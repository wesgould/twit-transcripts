[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.880]   to my left, Gina Trappani of smarterware.org, founding editor of Life Hacker,
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.320]   new mom, to my right, old dad, Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City of New York,
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.200]   author of Public Parts and What Would Google Do, blogger@buzzmachine.com and get this kids.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.920]   Get this kids, both of them, widescreen HD. Now we've done this in very different ways.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:21.120]   Oh, it just went black. Oh, that was me. Okay. My eyes are failing. Gina is on a Mac mini
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.440]   with a dedicated cable modem, but you do look fabulous. Which I know is an oxymoron, but I mean
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:37.040]   dedicated in my house. Nobody else is using it. Jeff is on Fios, right? At his house. On
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:45.520]   on my Chromebook Pixel, my one Chromebook Pixel. What a great camera in Ubuntu. He's running
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:53.360]   crouton and Ubuntu. And so he's running Linux Skype. I can switch back and forth with two keys
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:02.800]   between Chrome OS and Linux OS where I'm in the land of the lost. We just taught him how to use
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:11.760]   you name. And in order to do this, yes, he is true installed Linux on the Chromebook.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.000]   Like this is amazing. I'm so impressed. I don't mean to sound patronizing or, you know,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.840]   but like for a guy who accidentally mute himself on Sky. Sorry. Oh, my God. Oh, Jeff, I love you.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.680]   I love you. No, I'm so impressed that you installed that you installed Ubuntu on your Chromebook.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.720]   I'm blown away impressed. You've
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.600]   earned many nerd credit. I got to get credit because the the what the Chrome guys did. This is a
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.040]   Google guys did crouton. And you all you do is go in the shell, you type in one command, you
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.440]   sit back. That's it. They did it all. Yeah. It's so simple. Brad Linders article at little
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.480]   puting.com is the article you follow. And it does make it very straightforward. He also talks
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.720]   about putting Android jelly bean on there. And it turns out because of the bios, you can boot to
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.160]   anything on a USB key. So any x86 OS would work. I guess you'd have to have the driver. This is
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.480]   true of the of the pixel not of all of the other Chrome books. Right. Right. Right. This is this
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.640]   is something new. So now me and Leo are dying for a pixel. I bought one. You made fun of me.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:33.440]   I did. I'm not too. And now I'm like, I'm so close to ordering. Oh, it's it's because
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.320]   G to the thing is, this is a progression. And I've got to write this up. I've got to
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.240]   write. But if I hadn't been on the Chromebook for three months using it and doing doing really
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.560]   well, fixed a few problems doing really well, liking it, but Leo's right. It's a net book.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.120]   It's it's kind of crappy. The screen's not great. The keyboard's not great. But it worked for me,
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.440]   right? But I was really happy in Chrome because it was easy and direct and everything I needed to
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.280]   do was there. And so on. So I was already sold then on Chrome, right? And I was wishing for a
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.640]   slightly better machine. Well, the slightly better machine didn't come along. The killer
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.240]   better machine came along. And I debated as I said before, I went to the store and I debated
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.800]   and debated and debated and Google sent me heroin and a needle by sending me the machine. First one's
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.640]   free Jeff. And so using it for a while, you just get so you first get hooked on the quality of
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.480]   the machine. The keyboard is pure butter. I wish I could think as fast as I can type now.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.200]   The screen is magnificent. The type on it is just beautiful for my old alien eyes. It's wonderful.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:42.000]   You know, it's just solid. And you know, it's interesting about Chrome OS on that. It's running
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.240]   out of RAM. The entire OS is in memory. Yeah. So it really is super fast. You have an SSD, but I
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.960]   mean, that's not even that's I mean, it's running out of RAM. That's pretty amazing. Four gigs of RAM,
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.600]   right? Two gigs on the old Chromebook. Yeah. And two gigs on the old Chromebook was not nearly
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.880]   enough. And it would dump pages. Right. My fear of running Linux on this is that it's gonna take
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.360]   up too much RAM and make it dump pages on the Chrome side. No, no, no, no, no. In fact, you're
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.800]   using the same kernel. All you're doing is installing the GNU stuff on top of it. Okay.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.920]   So it shouldn't be any it shouldn't. Right. Gina, I don't think it should make any difference.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:24.080]   Linux is very lightweight. 64 gigabytes as a city. Well, that's that's a bigger drive that I would
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.720]   have expected for and a terabyte cloud computer, a terabyte of drive Google drive 64 on the LTE
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.320]   version 32 on the Wi-Fi version. Right. Right. And you have the LTE version. This leads into the
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.800]   story that we're going to be doing shortly, but but it's important to that I think that that it
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.680]   shows the wisdom of Chrome as an operating system and this kind of machine.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.800]   Yeah, I don't think Google expects many people to buy this because it's really expensive. In fact,
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:58.000]   the one I bought, which is the same as yours is almost $1,600 after tax. You have higher tax.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.520]   Yes. And I'm not suggesting for a second this is a mass machine is not, but what it does,
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.080]   this is a proof of concept, right, about the Chrome operating system. And it says that you
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:14.400]   really can I can use this machine fully. The only need I have for my Mac still, even with the cheap
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.760]   one was Skype, we've now solved that. And the occasional formatting, I've got to do a Microsoft
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.800]   Word because I'm bozo once it. But I do admit that having Linux in there makes it a lot more
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.960]   compelling. Oh, absolutely. Because now I can put in other applications here. I can do other
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.240]   things now. It helps. This is where it's really not mass. You know, you've got to be a Linux
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.160]   geek to do that. But it but it still shows for the geek world. This makes this a very
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.640]   enviable machine now, I think. Yeah. So is it any of the touch stuff work in Linux?
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:49.520]   Probably not. That's an interesting question. Although how long was somebody does it?
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.880]   Does some patching to make that happen? It recognizes it.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:08:00.960]   Does it recognize the touch as a tap so you can you can tap on icons and you went through and it
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:07.360]   launches? Yep. Wow. So I heard a rumor somewhere. I don't know. It may have been in the chatroom
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.120]   last week that this someone said something about how like this the pixel seems to be the
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:20.720]   machine that Google sort of made for Googlers and apparently Googlers in house use the pixel
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:29.440]   and dual boot Google s Google s which is basically a Google specific Linux distro. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:34.480]   So it sounds like this is what Googlers are using in house. So you know, it might be right that this
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.800]   isn't about mass appeal. This is just about hey, we made ourselves an amazing laptop and we're just
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.720]   making it available for the super fans. And it's but it's putting a stake flag in the sand saying
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:52.160]   Chrome OS is a is a effective OS and if you the real problem, you know, I played with the Samsung
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.120]   for a week to review it from before you buy, which I did yesterday. And that's where my eyes were
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.440]   open. I said, you know, actually 90% of what I do, maybe 99% of what I do is fine.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:09.120]   Exactly. It's just crappy hardware. Right. And and so and I tried photo editing. There's a few
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.840]   things. So I should emphasize this is a huge luxury computer for somebody who already has a real
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:22.640]   computer. Yes. It is, you know, for me, it couldn't be my only computer because I need I need to do
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.760]   Lightroom. I need to do, you know, there's stuff I do on a computer that I cannot do on Chrome OS.
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:33.760]   You know what I could probably buy a mini for the monitor I have now. I didn't if my laptop broke,
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.240]   right? If my MacBook broke, I could buy that if I were willing to do Windows, there's a lot of
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:43.760]   cheap stuff I could buy. And the main machine, we're not at the point where this is the only machine
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:49.200]   that would be too nerve wracking. Well, then that's kind of my point, which makes this at at $1,600,
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:55.520]   a luxury, 250 bucks for a Samsung. I think Google is means, well, it's kind of a disposable computer.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.440]   And that's certainly how Google's selling it with the dog and everything. Yeah, in the ads. But I
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.400]   don't I wonder why and I bet you this will happen. There's not a middle of the road, a six or $700
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:11.520]   decent quality computer running Chrome OS. There was in the sense that the prior Samsungs were 500
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.920]   bucks, but they weren't decent enough. They weren't high on those. They had to push the price down.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:21.280]   They knew it. They've got you're right. They got to come in with a $700 machine. That's that's a
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:27.360]   solid, simple laptop. Anyway, I bought the LTE version. We'll see. I'm thinking I could probably
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.520]   use it as my I have a computer right now. I'm using a Windows machine, but a dedicated show
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:36.080]   computer. And one thing I did learn from using Windows 8 on this machine is that touch is great
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:42.640]   on a show computer because I can pinch and zoom. And it's just a really natural way to do stuff
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:48.480]   on a computer that I'm using for the show. And so the ability to do this is fabulous. I mean,
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.920]   that's just really great. Yeah, anytime you're presenting or teaching. Yes. Yes. The touch
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.480]   makes a lot of sounds on the screen. So I do want to touch screen. So the so the pixel might be a
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.280]   good choice. It has HDMI out, which we require for putting it up on the on the screen.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.240]   I don't forget when you get it. You don't get the touch unless you go into the chrome flags and
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.120]   enable that. It's still. Isn't that weird that it's not enabled by default? I think it just still
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.840]   testing it. Yeah. But this all goes may I may I leap to the one I think is our first story today.
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.360]   To me, this all goes to the fact that Andy Rubin is out as the head of Android and Sundar Pichai,
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:28.560]   who was the head of Chrome is now the head of both. Sundar the guy who has been advocating Chrome OS
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:33.360]   for years. We've been complaining on the show for years that why do they have the two OS's?
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.960]   This doesn't make any sense. What the heck's going on here? Right. And now for the first time,
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.720]   I think we see the chrome was able to come into its own. And that's what the that's what the
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:47.120]   pixel really proves is this is not a toy. This is real. It's a it's a vision for computing.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:53.040]   Well, let's talk about the shuffle at the top. Big, big story with Andy Rubin out at Android.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.000]   Huge story. Well, okay, well, let's talk about it, but we're going to take a break.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.960]   This is this week in Google. And boy, do we have the story of the week this week.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.640]   Just broke, by the way, literally just a few hours ago. So we're still digesting it. But we'll
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:14.880]   talk about Andy Rubin out at Android. Gina Trappani, Jeff Jarvis, our show today brought to you by
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:21.360]   Podio. Oh, do you know, oh, Podio do I am really we're using Podio and some money interesting ways
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:28.320]   here now at Twit. P O D I O. And still I have a hard time exactly describing what Podio is. It's
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:37.280]   a way to bring together all the different pieces of a project or all the different members of a
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:43.600]   team into one workspace that does not abandon how you currently work. So when you set up your
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:48.400]   Podio account, by the way, it's free to do so. Podio, podio.com, you can log into Google,
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:54.400]   LinkedIn, all your different ways you work. Bring in your teams from your corporate email,
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:58.160]   all of that stuff. You're not abandoning Google Drive. For instance, we keep all our docs here
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:04.800]   at Twit on Google Drive works fine. What it does is it combines Google Drive, Gmail, all the ways
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:10.080]   you work into a single workspace. And then you you create workspaces based on what you want to do.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:18.640]   And they have a huge variety of different workspaces available. It is a way to get your work
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:30.480]   into a single space that gets the job done, brings the team together. It is just phenomenal works
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:36.560]   with, you know, all of the it's just I'm the only way you can really understand how this works is
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.040]   to try it. So the good news is it costs you nothing. It's not a free trial. It's free.
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:47.360]   P O D I O.com. Send it up today. Do create that workspace, invite your team in there,
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.960]   and just start using it. And I think you'll immediately see it's got this, you know,
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.560]   kind of like the social media stream. So you can see what people are they call it the activities
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.320]   stream. There's nothing going on in this new ones. Let me go back to the employee network and you

[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.760]   Okay. Can I ask Jeff one quick question about the Pixel before we
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.640]   welcome to this week in Pixel. This is this is this is. We're info ties that doesn't take any
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:44.160]   time out your credit card already did. This is this is more just a used question. So I've got
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.080]   some travel coming up and I was actually thinking about getting sort of a new travel computer. I
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.480]   was thinking about a MacBook Air maybe went so when you went so I know you got the LTE version
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.560]   of the Pixel so you've connectivity wherever you go when you travel when you're when you're
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.160]   you know out for the day or on the road. Are you taking the Pixel with you? Are you taking a tablet
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.960]   with you? I see that's like three and a half pounds, which seems pretty light.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:12.160]   My MacBook Pro is like five pounds and I hate it. Yeah, this is under three. This is a sir. I
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.600]   know you probably wouldn't get a Windows machine, but that's on this look health in and like that
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.840]   is. Yeah, that's the comparison and under three pounds. This is the kind of thing you can carry
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:25.040]   into your arm like a tap, tap, tap, out of paper. And that's what I'm looking for. Now the battery
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.920]   life on the Pixel is disappointing. Yeah. Well, but it hasn't been that bad. I think if you do
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.320]   video on it, it's going to be killer. The answer, well, do you know, let me ask you two part answer.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:41.360]   The first part is that I started carrying the $249 Samsung with me as a rule and on trips.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:50.880]   And it worked. The only only key is you've got to remember to open the mail, the mail app,
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:56.160]   the Chrome app as opposed to the mail webpage before you get on the plane and make sure that
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.360]   it's synced your mail before you get on the plane. There's like an offline app that you can use.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.560]   They have you offline. Right. Easy. And they've just redesigned it and you might love it. You might not.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:11.600]   The other thing is that is that the drive stuff syncs constantly. So that's okay. So that was the
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:19.200]   important first thing. Then, yeah, it's a little heavier than that machine was, but it's still
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:24.000]   light and it's what I travel with all the time. And I didn't have LTE on that one. Obviously,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.400]   I had my my fine with me if I needed that. Right. I carry a Nexus 7 still primarily for because
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:38.320]   I've got right, right, right, right trains. Yeah, it's a read. Well, in the subway, I'll read or
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.280]   night when I'm pissed off and have had it with the world, I'll watch. I'm breaking bad.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:50.240]   Okay. Yeah, that'll make you pissed off of the world. Yeah. Okay. Are you breaking bad, Jeff?
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:18:00.880]   I think he already broke bad. So it's a little heavier than a Chromebook, but it is your travel
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:07.520]   machine. It is your travel. I have this. I have this. MERS. Oh, that's good. That's good. You do.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.880]   You would want something to carry. Oh, it doesn't fit in. Oh, it doesn't.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:17.600]   Why instead I have this, uh, Uniqlo. Oh, yeah. You guys don't have Uniqlo yet. It's the coolest
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.040]   store. It's the cool store. Right. It's just New York. Is it just New York?
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.120]   I think so far in the US. Yeah.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:29.200]   So beautiful is a Japanese, a huge Japanese. It's the idea of clothes.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:37.920]   It's it's it's absolutely amazing. The UNIQLO. Yes. It's what's wonderful. They are online.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.480]   They have this incredibly, incredibly light that's for its recent down and its all kinds of
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.760]   right. Anyway, so I got a briefcase there for 30 bucks. I thought that it was all like,
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.600]   I thought that it was winter jackets. For some reason that was my impression. That was all.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.160]   Incredibly incredibly light. Only in the winter.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.720]   But now that I'm looking at the site, it's all kinds of clothes. Okay, we don't have to talk
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.040]   about fashion. That was all I wanted to ask. We can move on to the big, the top store. NYC
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:11.040]   NYC MD, NYC doctor says that the he takes his pixel to work in it without it. It's last from
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.760]   nine to five as long as he keeps it at 40% brightness, no video.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:15.920]   Okay, good time. And
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:23.280]   yeah, I mean, I, you know, well, I have a feeling you'll be getting one, Gina.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.760]   I'm thinking about trying to visualize myself at Google I/O. Do I want a MacBook Air?
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.760]   Wait a minute. I'm going to be sitting in the audience. Wait a minute.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.080]   Wait a minute. You'll be getting one at Google I/O.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.680]   You think? I don't know. I don't know.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.040]   Maybe you could just give us one thing.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:46.160]   Just the past year, this last year at Davos, you know, I was thinking about getting a phone
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.000]   around him. Well, maybe they're going to get one out. I don't know. They didn't even show up at Davos.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.680]   So you can't count that chicken. By the way,
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:02.160]   Google now, this is another story later. We'll get to the end of the story, I promise.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.800]   But Google now is probably going to be on that thing soon. And that,
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:10.000]   believe it or not, as small as that sounds, that was another deciding factor for me.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.640]   I love that idea. Notifications from Google now on your computer is cool.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.800]   Notifications you control. Yeah.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:22.640]   And somebody said, "You know what should happen? Google now should realize you're
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.040]   about to board a plane and download your mail in the background."
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:26.880]   Ooh, yes. Yes.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.040]   And I bet it will at some point, right?
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.560]   Yeah. Yeah, right. Because Google now, right now, detects if you're near an airport and you've got
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.520]   a ticket confirmation email and Gmail, it will automatically bring up your barcode,
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:45.520]   the scan in. So that doesn't seem so crazy that would auto download your email in the background.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.760]   Well, and this gets us back to the story, is that Google now, in a sense, is the first bridge
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:54.480]   from Android to Chroman back. We're starting to see a really interesting landscape, which is
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:59.840]   with it. Okay. So Andy Rubin, who has been leading the Android project at Google since day one,
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.840]   they did they not get-- He was hired for it.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.600]   Pardon me? He was hired for it. Yeah, they brought it, I believe. He created it.
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.040]   He was, yeah, he was, uh, he acquired. His company was acquired.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:14.480]   Was it not? Yeah. So Open Handset Alliance is Andy Rubin. Andy Rubin is Open Handset Alliance.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:24.960]   They say he stepped down. He was a, he was CEO at Danger and then Android. I mean, this guy is the
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:33.520]   guy. He's the guy. He's the guy. Yeah. He is Mr. Android. So my question is, what the hell?
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.880]   If you look at the letter for Larry-- Yeah, and no one really knows. There's no answer. Oh, sorry,
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.600]   Jeff. I was saying, if you look at the letter from Larry, you see a lot of praise for Andy,
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:49.840]   not in the kind of, that was nice, but we're glad he's gone way. Really praising him for his vision.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.440]   And at the end, Larry says, you know, I can't wait for your next moonshot.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:22:01.120]   Apparently he's going to be working on the Google moonshot. Well, moonshot.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:07.120]   10 years, look at a decade, Andy Rubin worked on Android, a decade of his life. So maybe he's
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:13.440]   tired. Maybe he's ready to move on. But I-- No, I think this, I think this is an endorsement of
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:18.400]   Sundar and, and Chrome is an OS and his vision and that that's the umbrella and that he made a tough
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.480]   decision that gets in there. I don't think it's anything against Andy Rubin. He's going to make
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:28.160]   an magnificent job. But you know, look at Vic. Vic was all Android and then went on to Chrome,
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:32.240]   which is a high priority for Google. There is life after life in Google.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:39.280]   Yeah, I mean, this, the announcement makes it sound like it was Andy's decision.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.680]   Andy is staying within Google. Just says, Andy's decided it's time to hand over the
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.840]   rings and start a new chapter at Google. I mean, I know this is all sort of like CEO.
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:54.960]   I don't buy it. You don't buy it. You think that-- I think Larry is very good. And it's very,
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:58.000]   it's a-- this is a very hard decision for a CEO to make.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.720]   Yes.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:07.280]   But I think that he is thinking on a grand strategic scale and there is-- there's huge significance
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:13.440]   in Sundar Pachai taking the role. And I think that Larry made a strategic decision and went to Andy
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:18.160]   and said, "Look it." I don't think Andy will be there in six months, but he probably said,
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.120]   "Look it, you could do anything you want at Google, but you're not going to be doing
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:27.920]   as running Android after next week." Why? Because-- well, that's the question, isn't it? What is going
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:32.800]   on? There's a reason you put the Chrome OS guy in charge of Android. Why?
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.240]   Forget the guys. Forget the guys for a second. You're putting Chrome OS,
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.680]   which we thought was the also ran. What he's saying is,
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.320]   Chrome OS is the strategic future, that this is the future of computing, this is the way we're
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:49.840]   going to go, and Android is a part of that vision. And then when you make that decision,
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.240]   that's what forces the personnel decision. I don't imagine, especially this higher level,
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.480]   the strategic level, you don't just say, "You know, I like Sundar better than Andy." That's not
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.560]   what this is going on. What if-- is it somebody who has strategy? What-- and you would know,
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:10.240]   because you were the expert, what would Google do? I don't know. But what if-- all along, you've
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:15.840]   had this horse race between two OS's? Because we did wonder, why two OS's? You had this horse race
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.560]   between two OS's and this is the declaration Chrome OS 1.
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:28.240]   Right? It wins the future. I mean, you don't put it on phones. You don't put it on phones though.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.920]   No, no, but this is where you go back to Google now. What you say is that there is a
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:41.440]   a computer strategy that says that everything operates in the web or apps,
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:48.000]   and that there is a machine of lines, right? I mean, you know, all this-- this is not mobile.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:59.600]   This is couch. So there's a line that goes for laptops to tablets to mobile devices that blurs
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:09.360]   utterly. You're going to find 4 inch, 5 inch, 7 inch, 8 inch, 9 inch, 10 inch, 12 inch, 13 inch
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:15.280]   screens. Where's the line? Right? So yeah, there's an operating system question, but basically,
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:20.720]   what it comes down to is that I'm using apps inside Chrome. I'm using apps inside Android.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.440]   It's not going to be hard to start to regularize those things.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.560]   Chrome OS did not win, you guys. No one uses Chrome OS.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:34.560]   It doesn't make sense. Lots of people use Chrome. Lots of people use Chrome, right?
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.120]   Yeah, and by the way, he runs Chrome as well as Chrome OS.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.960]   Right, right. He runs Chrome, exactly, which is both.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:47.120]   So and Chrome runs on Android. I mean, like the product.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.240]   It is impossible that they-- okay, here's the other take on it. They found something better for
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:58.640]   Andy to do, that Android is done. It's cooked, and maybe we said, you know what, this guy,
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.800]   brilliant, home run, moon shot. Let's put him--
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.320]   Glass for you, baby.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:07.280]   Yeah, maybe put him in glass. Maybe that's it.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:14.000]   Yeah, I mean, that's what I was thinking. I mean, this whole, you know, that Andy
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.520]   started something so ambitious and such a huge deal that he decided to start Android,
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:25.040]   and this is what this, hey, Andy, more moon shots, please. They want to put him on something.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.800]   He spent 10 years working on Android, which according to Malcolm Gladwell,
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.400]   means that Andy's fully baked. It is now pretty much the best in the world at--
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.040]   Right. He's got his 10,000 hours.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.000]   10,000 hours, right? They're saying, you know, we want you to work on something even more ambitious.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.120]   You know, Android's fully baked. It's hugely successful. It's on track. We know where that's
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.920]   going. We have the personnel supported. We're good. The Android ecosystem is firmly in place.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.560]   Now we want to put you on something that's risky and big and ambitious and unproven,
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:59.680]   because you've proven that you can do that, right? So I think putting him on glass or some other
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.400]   Google X project kind of makes sense. All right, let's parse.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:09.360]   So I was in the chat, says the Andy Rubin's letter to the partners just went up on the verge.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:14.480]   Ah, let's see it. You'll see it in the chat. But let's start. We will start by parsing Larry
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:21.600]   Page's announcement, because that's where we're going to see, well, I think what Larry is thinking
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:26.880]   if we read between the lines. Sergey and I first heard about Android back in 2004 when Andy Rubin
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:32.000]   came to visit us. He believed that aligning standards around an open source OS would drive
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.560]   innovation across the mobile industry. He was right. Was he not? Most people thought he was nuts.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:41.920]   Fast forward today, the pace of innovation has never been greater. Android is the most used
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:47.840]   mobile operating system in the world. Extraordinary progress, decades work, having exceeded even
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.760]   the crazy ambitious goals we dreamed of for Android and with a really strong leadership and team in
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:59.120]   place. Andy has decided it's time to hand over the reins and start a new chapter at Google.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:04.880]   You're right. I mean, he could see this could be CEO talk.
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:09.360]   We might we might as well have been guessing who'd be the next pope, but we know that now.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:14.720]   This is crazy is that we don't know anything. Right. We're just speculating like a rails,
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:20.400]   but that's fun. So let's read the letter. Dear friends, writes Andy Rubin. In November of 2007,
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.760]   we announced the open handset Alliance 34 founding members today. I'm grateful to the over 85 OHA
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:32.720]   members. Android ecosystem, tremendous growth volume and variety. He says 750 million compatible
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:40.160]   devices. Wow. And that's a good number. And it's almost as many as Facebook users.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:46.080]   At its core, Android has always been a free and Facebook's free Facebook's free 750 million
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:51.200]   bought things. Well, yeah, but it is free to the manufacturer and it's core. Android has always
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:57.520]   been about openness. The idea that a thousand brains are better than one. Just as the ecosystem
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:03.920]   has grown so as our team at Google, I'm proud. Look at last year, lean and best release jelly
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:09.920]   bean, Google now, Google play, success of Android going forward. Sundar Pichai will lead Android
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.320]   in addition to his existing work with Chrome and apps, which makes me think that this is a place holder.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:20.400]   Right? Maybe there's somebody coming along for Android. Hiroshi Lockheimer,
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.080]   well, many of you already know well, and the rest of the Android leadership team will work
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.920]   closely with all of our partners. I'm an entrepreneur at heart.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:35.200]   And now it's a key phrase. Yeah. And now is the right time for me to start a new chapter within Google.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   He is an entrepreneur. He was at Apple. He was at danger, which made the sidekick,
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:48.320]   which was amazing, but didn't catch on. Then he started Android in 2003 as a startup
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:55.920]   bought by Google. People like him are interested in the early stage of a big idea.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.160]   They're most that's what turns that that's what gets their motivation going. That's what
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.080]   lights their fire. That's what this sounds like to me. It's like, I agree with you. This is about
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:09.120]   look, I put in 10 years. We've reached, you know, more successful than I ever thought we could be.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.720]   We've got a great team. They don't need me anymore. I've got another ix to scratch.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.000]   So I'm going to go back to what Larry says about Sundar then
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.080]   or it signals about about if you think this is a placeholder. I do. Yeah. I, well, let's say going
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:26.400]   forward Sundar Pichai will lead Android says Larry Page in addition to his existing work.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.120]   Sundar has a talent for creating products are technically excellent. We get easy to lose.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.640]   I'm sorry. Use.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:41.360]   Friday and slip. He loves a big bet. Take Chrome, for example. In 2008, people asked,
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.880]   does the world really need another browser today? Hundreds of, I know Sundar will do a
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:52.160]   tremendous job of doubling down on Android. You know, in some ways Google has lost control of
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.720]   Android. Google Android is in some many ways, not really a Google product anymore, right?
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.480]   Yeah, that's true. Or brand.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:04.720]   And you see companies like Samsung and HTC co-opting Google. I mean, Android.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:13.440]   The open handset alliance is fractious and problematic. I wonder maybe if they feel like,
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.600]   yeah, Android's great, but we don't, it's no longer within our control in the same way that
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:23.280]   Chrome OS, Chrome and other products that we make are. If you think about it, Chrome is a similar
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:27.440]   structure to Android, right? It is WebKit, right? Chrome is based on an open source project,
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.160]   the Chromium project, right? But you don't, you don't, you don't see the same sort of
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:37.120]   kind of fragmentation or forking or, you know, I mean, has a company taken the Chromium project
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:42.080]   and rebranded it as a different, different browser? No, I mean, the Chrome brand is extremely strong.
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.800]   Look at all the forks for it. You can make the same argument.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.360]   Yeah, look at the forks for Android. Oh my God. I mean, Kindle.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.800]   Yeah, Kindle.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:53.120]   Well, really the Kindle is the, is the big one.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.640]   No, but yeah, but then there's a, there's a Asian, there's tons of Asian forks as well.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.560]   Right on kind of low, low in hardware. People want to be able to ship low end hardware that's
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.440]   running a free operating system and not paying the licensing costs and all that, right?
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:12.640]   All right. I mean, I don't know. I'm not a Kremlinologist, but I want to know what he's
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.240]   going to work on. That's the big question. That would be interesting because you kind of superstar
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:21.760]   here. There's no doubt about it. And I'd seem very clear he's staying at Google. So,
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:27.120]   you know, normally an entrepreneur kind of gets that itch. You know, so many times we hear the
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.520]   stories of Googlers who leave to do their own thing.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:35.680]   My first thought was that this is a victory for Chrome and Chrome OS, but now I'm going to bet,
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:40.480]   step back. I don't think it is. I think you're right, Gina. I think Andy is an entrepreneur.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.200]   He wants to go to the next thing. This is an established product now.
[00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:52.400]   I also think that, okay, victory is too strong, but I think that if we had bet a year ago,
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.320]   I bet we all would have bet that Chrome OS would eventually disappear.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.480]   Right. That they would give Andy, Chrome and everything else, not the other way around.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:09.360]   And I think what this says in part is that Chrome as a architectural vision doesn't disappear,
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.280]   that it's fundamental. It's not going to become a huge product or anything like that, but it's
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:20.080]   fundamental that building applications within Chrome is the architectural key in HTML5,
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.920]   is the architectural key to Google's success.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.120]   It just hasn't taken off though.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.320]   No, I know. That's the problem. That's the problem.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:33.920]   Chrome apps have just not taken off. Certainly not the way that Android apps have.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:40.480]   I agree, but if you, and the truth is that I use Gmail not in a Chrome app, I use Gmail as
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:47.440]   HTML5. So I'm not saying Chrome apps per se. What I'm saying though is that things built within
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:53.600]   the browser. That's key. I'm saying this at the same time, of course, that Android has tons and
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:59.600]   tons and tons of apps. But if you look at, I think the place to look is the success of
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:03.040]   Gmail and Google Calendar and that kind of stuff and how those operate together.
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:09.360]   There's going to be some regularization of that. So I don't think Chrome won, but I also don't think
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:16.160]   Chrome lost. I think Chrome survives as an element of a larger strategy that we can't see yet.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:24.160]   Wow. It's great stuff. These are the kinds of stories as a tech journalist. You just can't wait.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:28.400]   And I don't know. I don't know what's going on. I have no idea. I thought I might, but now,
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.400]   after looking at all the threads, it's very hard to figure out. But we will watch with
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:36.480]   great interest to see where Andy Rubin goes next. Somebody in the chat room says, "Well,
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.960]   no, he's just going to go swimming in his pool of Google cache."
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:46.720]   Let's just hope that he's not sticking around to Google because he's waiting on options or
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.000]   something. Let's hope he's sticking around to Google because he wants to do something else at Google.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:58.240]   Oh, by the way, this is kind of interesting too, is that if you looked at, like, Marissa,
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:07.200]   that was about a kind of administrative need, become a higher and higher and higher VP.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:09.040]   And Andy--
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:10.080]   He doesn't want to run stuff.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.200]   --about an entrepreneurial--
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:11.680]   Right.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.840]   --innovative need to create something.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.520]   Yeah, because he's running a big division at Google and he doesn't want to do that, I don't think.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:23.680]   I'm thinking you put him on glass maybe, or maybe there's something-- what's next after glass?
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.040]   That's the thing that could be something that's after glass.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.960]   Oh, yeah. I think it's what's next after glass.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.440]   Yeah. I mean, right. It seems like he's definitely going to be on some sort of
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:37.520]   new mobile technology, right? I mean, doesn't it seem like he-- it would surprise me if he was
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.800]   leaving mobile entirely.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.920]   What about cars?
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:47.760]   What if Larry Page comes to you and says, "Andy, you did a great job and Android's mature.
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.560]   You're probably bored." We're thinking of brain implants.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.560]   And we think you're the guy to leave the charge.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.120]   If you're Andy Rubin, would you not jump?
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:03.280]   Now, by the way, Rubin is a big robotics freak. His whole house is robot-sized, you know.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.880]   If you're going to--
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.840]   I didn't know that.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:09.360]   If you're going to get into robots, Andy Rubin's your guy.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:14.720]   I just figured it out. Google robots.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:19.760]   Your own personal Googlebot that'll just index your home, like a Roomba.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.960]   It'll just sort of go around your home, index everything.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:25.840]   And it's a long-term strategy, obviously.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.960]   And I'm going to see if I can find this article.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.200]   I remember reading a profile of Andy Rubin.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.120]   Everything in his house is robot-sized.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.760]   Actual androids.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.840]   Actual androids.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.800]   [laughter]
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.160]   We figured it out.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.160]   I'm off to work on actual androids.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:48.160]   Isn't it wonderful that I've been in a statement?
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.480]   Now, if Larry Page comes to you and says, "Andy, we want to do robots."
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.680]   Would you like to lead that?
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.280]   And you're not going to say no?
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:58.880]   You're going to say, "Yeah, hell yeah."
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.680]   Well, can we call it "I-robot?"
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.480]   Oh, no, that's taken.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.920]   Actual androids.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.160]   You don't say how much money do I get because I've already got--
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.120]   No, he doesn't need money.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:11.360]   How much money are you going to invest in this project?
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:17.680]   And can you get more investment in this pie in the sky, wacky big thing,
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.440]   than you could get from damn VCs now?
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.360]   I got to find this profile of Andy Rubin.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   Here it is.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.000]   It's from the New York Times in 2007.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.600]   "I-robot the man behind the Google phone.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.320]   A retinal scanner emitting a blue glow monitors the entrance to Andy Rubin's home
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.560]   in the foothills overlooking Silicon Valley.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.000]   If the scanner recognizes you, the door unlocks automatically."
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.560]   Those forced to use the doorbell are greeted with another technological marvel,
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:52.480]   a robotic arm inside the glass foyer, grips a mallet, then strikes a large gong.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:57.840]   Okay, I didn't realize that this was going to be like weird.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:05.120]   I like the retinal scan, but the mallet and the gong are weird.
[00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:11.520]   But before he did sidekick, before he did danger, he had a robot startup.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:16.400]   I'm thinking that's-- look at it, if you're Google, isn't robots,
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.840]   isn't that an area you want to explore?
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.320]   They love them.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:21.280]   Actual androids it is, I'm sold.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.680]   Actual androids, we figured it out.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.520]   Andy, call us.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.560]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:30.480]   We got the change log and lots more.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.520]   You're watching this week in Google with Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:39.840]   and our favorite law firm that's not a law firm, LegalZoom.com.
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:41.360]   It's not a law firm.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:46.000]   It's a-- it gets your legal stuff done at a much lower cost.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.800]   It's a self-help legal services.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.880]   If you've been waiting to-- I don't know.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.480]   If you-- are you sitting on a business?
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.120]   You got to have an incorporation or a document or an LLC, but guess what?
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:39:01.360]   An LLC is 99 bucks at LegalZoom.com.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:08.880]   Forming your business the right way can save you big, and make sure your liability is protected.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:15.280]   Certainly what I did, and you know that LLC we formed for Twit in 2005, still good.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.080]   I have a law firm now at great expense.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:22.480]   It's perfectly fine to start with LegalZoom.com.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.680]   It's a great way to get it done.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.520]   It can also help with trademarks.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.640]   I did the same thing.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:31.920]   Trademark to Twit and the logo, copyrights, patents, NDAs, and more.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.560]   What about your home life, your family?
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.160]   Make sure they're protected too.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:40.240]   Protect your family and your assets with the LegalZoom will, just $69.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.800]   They can do legal trusts or living trusts too.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:47.200]   If you don't have a will, you know, it's up to the government, the courts to decide what
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.040]   happens with your babies and your assets.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.320]   You got to do this.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.560]   First thing I did when we had kids, of course.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:58.400]   In the past 12 years, over 2 million Americans have used LegalZoom for LLCs,
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.520]   wills, trusts, trademarks, and more.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:06.080]   And you know, they've added this feature since I used them, which I really like.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.680]   You can get help from an attorney at LegalZoom.com.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.160]   They've got the LegalZoom Legal Plan Network.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.880]   They've got pre-negotiated prices.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:19.120]   So the fees are much more affordable.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:22.400]   And if they're, as you go through the LegalZoom questionnaire, if you find there's,
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:26.800]   you know, wow, like for instance, this was a question I had, where should I incorporate?
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   Delaware, California?
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.000]   We ended up using Delaware.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.560]   I wish I'd had the help of an attorney to talk about the pros and cons on that.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:39.280]   And by the way, you can look at unedited customer reviews and online profiles,
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:41.600]   so you make sure you got the attorney that's right for you.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.440]   And again, a pre-negotiated price.
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.840]   Attorneys can cost a lot.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:50.400]   LegalZoom makes it affordable to get exactly the legal help you need.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.680]   Start your business.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.720]   Protect your family today.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:58.320]   LegalZoom.com, not a law firm, self-help services at your specific direction,
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.800]   or you can speak to a legal plan attorney and get your questions answered, get on going advice.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:07.360]   We're just going to get a little plug for Twig when you use LegalZoom.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:12.080]   So if you will use the offer code TWIG when you sign up at LegalZoom,
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.160]   we'll give you 10 bucks off.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.520]   Just a little thank you.
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.520]   10 bucks by yourself a cup of coffee.
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.320]   LegalZoom.com, use the offer code Twig.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.600]   Let them know you heard it about it here.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.120]   And we thank them for their support of this week in Google.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.920]   Now ladies and gentlemen, break out to the trumpets.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.600]   It's time for the change log.
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.960]   The Google change log.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:42.320]   And Gina Trepene has what's new at Google.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.040]   Short change log this week.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.240]   Three quick things.
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:51.280]   First one, the app that we, I love on Android, I've been running for a while.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.880]   Field trip is now available for iOS.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.680]   Field trip is the app.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.360]   It kind of runs in the background on your phone.
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.480]   It triangulates your position on the cell phone towers.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.080]   And it lets you know if you get close to something interesting.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.440]   Local businesses, historical facts, landmarks, art and culture.
[00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.400]   I've been using Field Trip for a while and I really like it.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.320]   It's a little bit of a battery drain.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.400]   And at first it was a little noisy.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:18.000]   But you can configure what kind of alerts that you see or you don't.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:18.880]   And in fact, it's funny.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:24.240]   I turned on the Field Trip ingress layer and I went to the post office,
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.720]   which I never do, but I had to mail a package.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.080]   And suddenly my phone started making this crazy sound that I realized that it was telling me.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:35.280]   Field Trip was telling me that ingress, this was a portal that the, like, had captured.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.800]   So Field Trip on iOS, grab it on iOS now.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.520]   It's in the iTunes store.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:49.040]   The Gmail mobile web app got a redesign for on Android, Blackberry or Kindle Fire.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.240]   Basically, last November, and we talked about this on the show,
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:59.520]   also in the changelog, Google announced a redesign for the Gmail mobile web app on the iPad and iOS.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.960]   It was a nice redesign.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.840]   It added, like, icon images and conversations.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.360]   You could see your friends' faces, some Google Calendar integration,
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:11.360]   where you could RSVP directly from a message, multi-account support.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.600]   Well, that redesign has now come to Android and Blackberry, Kindle Fire,
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:17.840]   really, any phone running a good browser.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:20.720]   And that's rolling out this week.
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:26.320]   And finally, Google Public Alerts, which you can check out at Google.org,
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.200]   Google.org, not.com/publicalerts.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.520]   That launched in the US a while back, but it's now available for Japan,
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.680]   because Japan has lots of earthquakes and tsunami warnings.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:42.720]   So if you go to Google.org/publicalerts, you can check out public alerts near you,
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:47.680]   or if you type in Japan, you can see them also in Japan now, and you can translate as well.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:54.640]   Those public alerts about earthquakes and tsunamis and those kind of events
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:59.440]   show up both in Google Search, Google Now and Google Maps when you search for
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.360]   kind of relevant keywords now.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.040]   So that's for the US and Japan.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.280]   And that's all I got today for Change Log.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.240]   Play the things.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.200]   Change log.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.160]   I will never cease to be delighted by the bumpers.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:14.640]   I know.
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.040]   I never.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:15.520]   I love it.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.240]   It makes me so happy.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.680]   You're so simply amused.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:19.680]   There's something about horns and tympani, you know?
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.200]   Yeah, there's something about it.
[00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:22.400]   Ruffles and flourishes.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.800]   Google I/O sold out in.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.760]   48 minutes.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.720]   Eight minutes.
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.440]   48 minutes, which was longer than last year.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.880]   I think last year was like two minutes.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.560]   Maybe it was bigger this time.
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:39.280]   Yeah, I don't know if I actually don't know if Google released the official number,
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:43.680]   but that's what those who are watching it very closely and timing it are saying.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.400]   48 minutes.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.840]   I think it took that long.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.400]   Are you all going?
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.680]   I don't know.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.720]   I'm going.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.120]   You're going as pressed though.
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:54.480]   I am going as pressed.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:54.960]   Yes.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.880]   You didn't wait in line with the unwashed masses.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:04.160]   Some of the reasons it took 48 minutes is because there were some Google Wallet slowdowns.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.000]   In fact, a lot of people.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.760]   You knew you were going to fix that in this spare time.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.240]   Really?
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.800]   I think that's really why it took long.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.640]   It probably everybody who wanted a ticket was on within the first minute or two.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.920]   And then it was just waiting for wallet to.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.760]   Well, I saw complaints from people who thought that they were there to get it.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:22.640]   Same as with the phones.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.080]   You think, oh, yeah, I got it.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:24.480]   I'm in.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:24.960]   Then no.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:25.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.280]   This is Seth Weintraub writing in nine to five Google.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.040]   He tried it within the first minute of availability.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:33.760]   Got this page.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.960]   It said things are really busy.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.880]   We're assigning tickets as they become available.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.120]   We'll keep trying to get you a ticket for up to six minutes.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.200]   And then he said five minutes later, try again.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.000]   We couldn't find you a ticket, but there still might be tickets left.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.240]   He tried four times again and didn't get in.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:54.640]   So it's a tough event to get into.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.200]   I love this.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.160]   Don't do any of the following.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.400]   They'll decrease your chances of getting a ticket.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.360]   Refresh this page.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.960]   Try to register in a new tab.
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.840]   Hammer the JavaScript endpoints using the JS console.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.200]   It's very much a developer conference.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.320]   That's got to be really challenging to have some sort of system that these
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.000]   developers won't hack at.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.040]   Please don't hammer our JavaScript endpoints.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:21.120]   We know you know how.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.760]   You don't have to demonstrate your abilities.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.680]   You a ticket sooner.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.880]   Please don't pwn us.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.360]   Please.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:31.600]   Anyway, yeah, we'll be covering it.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.560]   What is it?
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:33.680]   What day of the week is it?
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.360]   It's March.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:37.520]   No, it's.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.720]   It's June.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.120]   I can't see it.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:42.640]   It's May 15, doesn't it?
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.240]   Yeah, I don't know what day so that is though.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:46.720]   I think I believe it's Wednesday.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.360]   It is Wednesday.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.560]   Oh, maybe we could do Twig from there.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:51.200]   I'm going to be in Rio myself.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:55.040]   Yeah, I was thinking that I would come up on Tuesday and do all that
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.200]   Android in studio and then come up for Twig.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.000]   Like I did last year.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.280]   Or maybe we'll do Twig there.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:00.560]   You want to do Twig live?
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.040]   Be there.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.120]   Or we could do Twig live from there.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.000]   That'd be fantastic.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.800]   I would like to do that.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.640]   I would be there and available for whatever we want to do.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.880]   And then the keynote on the second day will be Thursday.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:09.920]   So I don't know we can figure out.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.200]   How we want to cover that.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.000]   Let's do Twig there because the show before the security now,
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.120]   somebody else can do that because that's just Steve talking the whole time anyway.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:18.160]   I just sit there and eat lunch.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:22.080]   And then the show after know how I as doesn't need me,
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:25.120]   I just get in the way, slow them down, ask them questions, make it harder.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.040]   So I can we could just try.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.160]   Try an ulation there.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.920]   Maybe we could book a triangulation guest.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:30.320]   Oh, that's right.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.840]   It's not know how it's triangulation.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:32.080]   Right.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:34.160]   Oh, yeah, we'll get a triangulation guest there.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.280]   I'll interview Gina through that.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.240]   There you go.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:38.960]   Yeah, it's done.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.320]   Perfect.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:41.120]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.600]   I would love to do Twig from from the from Muscone.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.840]   Okay, deal in the in the environment.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.800]   And what we need to do and chat, we'll get some help for you.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.720]   But what we need to do is get set up some interviews and people we can talk to
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.440]   instead of doing a twig like this, but we'll just do both.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.680]   Gina and I'll just go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.440]   and talk to all the people who were there talking about their new products and stuff.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.240]   Yeah, that's that sounds like fun.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:04.880]   Sounds like a lot.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.680]   I'll bring the coffee.
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.200]   Fantastic.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:07.600]   All right.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.800]   Deal.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.840]   Cookies, cupcakes.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.800]   Did we get a media pass?
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.920]   I should say before I say this, I know that we have a contact.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.720]   I haven't talked about it yet.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:14.800]   I'm sure we have.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.840]   I'm sure I got a media pass.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:16.160]   I didn't.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:16.640]   I don't know.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.000]   I but I'm sure I did.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.800]   And if not, I would just say I don't I don't I don't need to go in.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:21.840]   Isn't there like a keynote?
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:22.240]   We got it.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.840]   Oh, there's like four days of keynote.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:24.240]   That's right.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:24.800]   I forgot about it.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.440]   Three days that I think there's a keynote the first day and the second day.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:28.800]   I know.
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:31.920]   I think Jason how I data press pass.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.400]   Oh, good.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.120]   All right.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.040]   All right.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:35.040]   All right.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.400]   So I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:36.960]   I'll get it.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:36.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.040]   I'm sure you'll get in, Leo.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.600]   So we'll cover the keynote and then we'll do twig.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.840]   Fantastic.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:44.720]   Perfect deal.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:52.880]   Speaking of being pwned, you know, it wasn't pwned at the Pawnium 3 hacker conference.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.800]   The Chromebook.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.600]   No,
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.880]   That's pretty impressive.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.240]   Every other operating system.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:04.320]   God, this is the pwned to own event that they do in Vancouver every year.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:05.760]   Um,
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.760]   They're.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:10.240]   Unbelievable.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.560]   Everything else got hacked, but the high end Chromebook pixel.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.080]   No, wait a minute.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:16.720]   What do they use?
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.280]   Do they use?
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.480]   I'm looking here.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:21.760]   Anyway, whatever they were using was not hacked.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.360]   Survived all attempts to hack it.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.000]   That's, I can't remember that ever happening for any other OS.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.040]   That's one of the reasons I think I kind of
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.400]   I'm a little bit more sold on Chromebook.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.040]   Especially a cheap Chromebook.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:38.960]   You could use that for banking for anything you want to be secure and just know that that's safe.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:41.040]   And then use your Windows machine for everything else.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:46.160]   So they didn't have any winning entries, but I think they had some entries and they said
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.880]   we're evaluating some work that may qualify as partial credit.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.520]   So I'm not sure what the guidelines are for a winning entry.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:56.560]   But it sounds like there are, you know, lots of attempts and maybe some.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:01.680]   Google had a prize fund of 3.14159 million dollars.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:07.920]   Yeah, you know this has some really trying hard.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:13.840]   $110,000 for a browser or system level compromising guest mode or as a logged in user delivered via web page.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:17.680]   $150,000 for a compromise with device persistence.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:21.200]   Guest to guest with interim reboot delivered via web page.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.760]   I mean, that's a year's salary for a developer.
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.240]   A lot of money.
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.680]   A young developer.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:32.640]   They were going against the base Wi-Fi model of the Samsung Chromebook
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.760]   using the latest stable version of Chrome OS.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:40.160]   You could use any of the installed software, including kernel and drivers.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.800]   No winning entry.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.840]   Wow.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:50.320]   Okay, so Pwn to own is actually finishing up today, I think.
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:57.600]   So this was Pwnium 3 next to which was a chromium Pwn and then Pwn to own does the other operating systems.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:04.880]   During day one of the event, all browsers except Safari proved vulnerable to attacks,
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:07.680]   but only because no one attacked Safari.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:18.720]   And apparently there was a Chrome browser issue which was fixed during day two Adobe reader,
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.040]   flash and Java also were compromised.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.280]   Just makes you wonder.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.360]   So congratulations.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.720]   Is it making nervous?
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:29.680]   What does it make you wonder?
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.120]   Is it making nervous or?
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:36.240]   Well, you know what happens is, and I bet you the reason nobody attacks Safari is because
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.200]   what's the guy who attacks Safari every year?
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:42.560]   He always has a package of stuff and then he went to work for Apple.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.720]   So he's like they took him off the playing field.
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:52.560]   And so everybody else figured, well, you know, we're not going to do that.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:57.440]   No, it just means that everything has these zero-day flaws.
[00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:00.960]   In fact, it's really quite impressive that nobody could crack the Chrome OS.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.520]   Kind of unheard of.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.280]   It is and it's better that they're holding events, inviting people to do that.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:08.160]   And giving money.
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.680]   Giving money.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.800]   Which is the exact opposite of the way most companies operate, which is,
[00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:13.520]   I don't want to know.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:13.840]   No.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.200]   Don't tell me.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.240]   Right.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.520]   I don't want to know.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:23.520]   Well, what's amazing too is when you go into dev mode on this, on the Chromebook, of course it says,
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.400]   "No more verification."
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.680]   Right.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:29.200]   That's what turns off as you could have.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:32.800]   And that only emphasizes to you how safe you are the rest of the time.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.120]   Right.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:38.480]   I, it makes me think that this pixel will be something that I will probably use, you know,
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.480]   and then I think last pass is installed on it.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.240]   It's easy to log in all my financial stuff.
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.280]   It's really easy.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:43.760]   I like it.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:49.360]   So remember Microsoft got dinged a little bit, $732 million
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:57.040]   last week because they accidentally took off the browser ballot on Windows installs in Europe.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:01.360]   That was in February 2011.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:09.040]   And it wasn't until mid 2012, 18 months later, the EU said, "Hey, where didn't we,
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.400]   didn't you say you were going to, what happened to the browser ballot?"
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.360]   Microsoft said, "Whoa, why did that happen?"
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:24.400]   Ah, well, now, according to the financial times, it was Google and Opera that informed the EU.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:30.240]   Screwed Gold.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:34.480]   Hey, I gave you a screw gold $732 million worth.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:38.080]   Of course it would be because it was, I don't know if it was Google, but it was definitely
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.840]   Opera that demanded this browser ballot.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.120]   So.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.360]   That makes sense.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:45.040]   I mean, how?
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.280]   It directly affects the number of active users that they have.
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:49.200]   So, so.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:49.840]   In fact, it did.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:53.440]   It's $730 million in Google got dinged this week for $7 million.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:58.480]   Who did Google did because of the Street View settlement with the internet?
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:58.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:53:59.440]   They admitted it.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.680]   We violated your privacy, they said.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:06.160]   Well, yeah, I have a little rant and I wrote a post.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:06.720]   Rant away.
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.640]   Don't we have a little something?
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.600]   We'll play it after your run.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:10.080]   Yeah, we'll go ahead.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.520]   Start the rant.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:16.880]   So the New York Times, would you think would know better, has this ridiculous story.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:22.160]   Page one, upper right, the biggest thing in which they say that, let me pull it up here so I
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.120]   can have a full rant.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:29.280]   I just had a shit because it's absolutely one side, a complete techno bias.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:34.960]   It says that, no, I'm not going to be able to find it because it's buried with the Pope.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.800]   The Pope did not get buried.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.160]   The story got buried.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:42.800]   Story got buried.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:43.520]   The story got buried.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:51.200]   So it said, the headline said, pardon me one second here, Google concedes drive by
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.520]   prying violated privacy.
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:57.360]   Now the verbed pry infers intent.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:57.760]   Yeah, that's a little bit.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.440]   There was a curiosity involved.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.200]   The Google wanted to know these things.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:02.080]   He was trying to do these things.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.040]   So that's wrong, right?
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:06.400]   So then it goes on and you know, let's remember everybody.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.480]   This was data that was an open public Wi-Fi.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:15.840]   Google was an absolute idiot to have saved it because there was no value in it whatsoever.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.360]   It was just, it was bits and pieces.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:18.000]   It was random.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.680]   It's where you drove by, right?
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.240]   It was a bunch.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:22.720]   It closed its case on this thing.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:23.840]   Even Germany did, right?
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.280]   But the attorneys general's whatever.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:29.200]   Then the time said, the lead said that Google,
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.720]   and pardon me for looking away from the computer here, is casually scooped up,
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:37.120]   passwords, email, and other personal information from unsuspecting computer users.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:41.520]   And later said that for years, the company has secretly collected personal information,
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.240]   email, medical, and financial records, and passwords.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:49.200]   Not to mention your strategy for a farm bill, as it cruised by.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.480]   It was data scooping from millions of unencrypted wireless networks.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.600]   It's all in New York Times talking.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:59.600]   And then it goes on, the worst of it to me is they say that privacy advocates and Google
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:03.360]   critics, the only people he talked to, by the way, characterized the overall
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:07.040]   agreement as a breakthrough for a company they say had become, and I quote here,
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.120]   a serial violator of privacy.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:10.080]   Come on.
[00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.280]   Come on, Facebook, maybe.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:17.680]   But there's no link to this horrible rap sheet of everything bad Google has done.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:18.960]   It's ridiculous.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:23.520]   And all the times talked to were the standard characters who hate Google,
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:27.600]   Scott Cleveland, and Mark Rottenberg, and the attorneys general went after them.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.120]   It was just nothing else.
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:30.400]   And so these are the panics.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:36.960]   So I got a call today from a CNN producer who said, oh, so there's Google Award on this thing.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.920]   There's a growing big concern about privacy, right?
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:44.640]   And I stopped myself from a BBC.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:45.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:49.040]   I just said you were on the phone, this is not a story.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:50.720]   Well, people are concerned.
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.480]   I said, yeah, of course they are.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:53.040]   What's what?
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.480]   I said, well, isn't there a growing concern?
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:58.720]   I said, not among the people, only among desperate cable news producers.
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.440]   Ooh.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:05.440]   And I just finally said, listen, I should go down and say, well, but I like Street View too.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:05.840]   Is this right?
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:06.880]   I said, no, it's not a story.
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.440]   I said, goodbye.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.000]   And I just hung up.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.920]   Yeah, that's appropriate.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:16.800]   Not only do they-- and this is David Strightfeld, although I doubt he wrote the headline--
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:20.800]   but not only do they say Google could see the drive by prying violated privacy,
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.960]   but underneath it, what do they have?
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.880]   A picture of Sergey Brin wearing glass.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:27.680]   Well, that's the other thing with the story.
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.600]   Now they're trying to tie this to glass, which is my other--
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.160]   Oh, please.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:30.880]   --of the week.
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:34.080]   The face of like, dating, of recording, of watching, right?
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:34.560]   The Borg.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.360]   Right, so they're saying, this is going to have an impact on that.
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:38.480]   Well, which is just ridiculous.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.560]   And I had a fit last week.
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:44.640]   I wrote a whole post on Buzz Machine under this, and I wrote it where you can make fun of me
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.840]   for any of that media, but it looks pretty.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:49.520]   Just getting sick of the technopanic over glass.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:55.040]   That before it's even out, before it's even used, people are having fits in media
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.440]   about this horrible danger.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:03.840]   And then there was this ridiculous story this week of the dive bar in Seattle that banned Google Glass.
[00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:05.680]   Well, it was a good move on their part.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:09.360]   They got a lot of headlines as if it was meaningful in any way.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:11.760]   They admitted that, right?
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:18.480]   But there are 8,000 media stories in Google News carrying this junk, this crap, I can say in America.
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:21.840]   Whoever their publicist is, that was a stroker genius.
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.040]   Oh, well, he kind of was.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.720]   Told me to catch in on the whole thing.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:27.680]   We're not going to allow glass at our bar.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:30.800]   Even though they record their patrons.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:31.440]   Oh, they do?
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.080]   They're on campus.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:34.480]   Yeah, I believe they have their own cameras at the bar.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.480]   Only we can have cameras.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.040]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.480]   That's pretty funny.
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:40.960]   They do.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:45.920]   This is this is this this is my rant of the week is is techno panic and how media play
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.160]   and techno panic and I've had it.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:54.880]   And that's our Jeff Jarvis rant.
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:56.160]   I'm stalling of.
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.440]   Jeff Jarvis, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:08.960]   That's what Matt Wiener.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:09.600]   What is his name?
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.680]   That's Jesse.
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:12.080]   Jesse.
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:12.560]   Jesse.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:12.960]   We Jesse.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.040]   Thank you, Jesse.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:15.920]   Thank you, Jesse.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:20.160]   We need video to go with that.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:20.640]   I know.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:24.240]   I'm thinking that I think Jeff Jarvis was steam coming out of this.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:27.280]   If you could just give us a face of just anger.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:28.480]   Okay.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:30.400]   Capture that, kids.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:31.280]   Perfect.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:33.360]   Now steam coming is that it maybe little horns.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:33.840]   I don't know.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.840]   By the way, am I pink this week?
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:38.560]   No, you look this Linux stuff is really looking.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:40.480]   I can't tell because the green is drained out of me.
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.560]   The green is one quarter inch above the rest of me.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:47.040]   You I tell you, you look marvelous in Linux.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.120]   Very flattering.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:51.920]   Open source.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:53.360]   Open source, baby.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:54.000]   Source, babe.
[00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:01.840]   Do we even care that Google showed a hacked speaking shoe at South by Southwest?
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.360]   No, we're talking about publicity, Stan.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.200]   It's not a product.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.720]   It's not a product.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.040]   It's not.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.400]   They're not making a talking shoe.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.840]   Did Jay only ask you this.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.600]   Did either of you feel deprived by not being itself by Southwest?
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:18.480]   Gina?
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.680]   No, I mean, not really.
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.560]   My co-founder, Anil Dash, he did keynote interview with Dennis Crowley at Four Square.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.920]   And I would have liked to have seen that.
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.720]   That would have been cool.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:31.760]   But they were supposed to livestream it, but I just couldn't find the link.
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.440]   I looked and looked and looked and couldn't see it.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.560]   Otherwise, no, I mean, I just I kept reading headlines about how people,
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.240]   my friends were basically celebrating not being it's all by this year.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:44.560]   Almost everybody just said it's a great party.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.360]   Wish you were here.
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.280]   If you could only get into the path party, you'd be really enjoying yourself
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.160]   right now.
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:55.520]   I saw a couple of vines, a sixth street, you know, it wasn't, you know, it didn't it didn't feel like.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:00.000]   I'll tell you what I would have liked to go to the the glass panel.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.160]   We should talk about that.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.280]   And there was a search panel.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.440]   So so I didn't so Phyllis,
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.800]   and Gina, what what are they talking about?
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.840]   So I think it's Timothy Jordan was his name.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:15.840]   One of the product managers on Google Glass did a demo of Glass showing off some of the first
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:21.920]   apps that we've actually seen running on Glass, New York Times, Gmail, Evernote, and Pass,
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.720]   which is which is kind of interesting.
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.440]   So we talked about this on all about Android last night.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:31.600]   So in New York Times, for example, if you kind of do the look up into the right head gesture,
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.680]   you could see New York Times breaking news headlines or images.
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.080]   I think that's really distracting.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.120]   I don't want to see newspaper headlines while I'm walking down the street.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.440]   I had to tell you, I I agree with you.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.160]   I think the Times is kind of the least the least interesting.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.480]   Well, look at the headline there.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.760]   It's eight hours ago.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.040]   That's the last thing I want.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.800]   Yeah, right.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.080]   I just don't I don't think that should be coming out of the corner of my eye.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.040]   I'm not sure I want to be reading my email as I walk down the street.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.920]   And if I'm going to read my email, do I really want to read it on glasses?
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.680]   Well, but this is this is what I really liked about the way they presented this is that
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:07.440]   they presented a lot of the design guidelines.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:11.600]   So with Gmail, for example, you have to subscribe to your Gmail in order to see your mail
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.000]   and you could subscribe, subscribe to just your important label.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.840]   So it sounds like you have a lot of control over what gets pushed to you and what doesn't.
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:25.760]   And some of the design guidelines, the guidelines that they're giving developers is that the
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:30.320]   information that you push to the glass to the heads up display has to be timely.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.800]   It has to be kind of minimalistic.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.160]   It has to be important enough.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.360]   It has to matter at that sort of in within that context.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:44.160]   Seems really in our Google+ group, Grant, Jelena Brown, I think the name is,
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.080]   I can't read because it's tiny in Linux.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.760]   And a great idea.
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:53.360]   And said, you know, just when you start thinking of these, if you're a presenter on stage
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.960]   and your notes come up there.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.160]   Yeah, that's fine.
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:56.720]   That's perfect.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:56.880]   Right?
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.680]   That's fine.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.160]   Things like that.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:02:58.480]   Right there.
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:01.280]   I can see these kinds of uses where it's actually useful.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.560]   There's some narrow uses, but I just I don't think it's a general.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:10.480]   You know, I know Google now would be cool to have Google now in my field of vision.
[01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:11.120]   I want Twitter in there.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.320]   Twitter, no, no, no.
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:12.960]   I don't want email.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:15.520]   I don't want any of that noise from Earth.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:15.680]   Right.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.360]   That's noise that are actually going to matter.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:20.720]   Yeah, but now would be OK if it said or maybe field trip.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.000]   I definitely want my text messages in Google Glass.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.040]   I'm going to pull out my phone and look at my text messages.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.240]   I would definitely want that.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:28.320]   Right.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:33.280]   Another interesting example that they showed off the South by Southwest presentation was
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.320]   a sketch and Evernote.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.760]   So so you can have the glasses on.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.920]   Say you're in a meeting and you have the glasses on.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.960]   You snap a picture with glass and you share it to sketch.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:45.920]   And then on your tablet, you can annotate that image and share it and save it to Evernote
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.200]   for example.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:51.760]   So I really like the idea of just being able to snap pictures quickly and share them out
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.200]   to Google+ or Sketch.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.840]   Text messages make a lot of sense.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.920]   Navigation makes a ton of sense.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:58.240]   Right.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.400]   I mean, navigation only makes sense in the context of a heads up display.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:02.640]   Right.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.160]   I mean, I'm always looking down at my phone while I'm driving to look at directions even
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.120]   though I should admit that.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.960]   But you know, Glass would have that kind of right in a field division.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.440]   So I agree.
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:13.840]   The New York Times example, I didn't think was a good one.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:19.200]   I think that subscribing to Gmail important messages, being able to reply,
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.200]   being able to compose an email, I might do that or compose a text message.
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:23.920]   I might do that.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.600]   I can imagine.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.800]   Well, I think I'm also Gina.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:31.120]   Well, you can imagine a case where you take a photo and you want to share it.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.480]   My baby is so cute that you could do that in audio.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.080]   Absolutely.
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:42.800]   I can imagine being with the baby and gestures to crop it or things like that and out it goes.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.160]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.680]   I can imagine hanging out with the baby, excuse me, putting the baby down and being like,
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:51.920]   email grandma, take a picture, email grandma, you know, like that's something that's,
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:54.320]   you know, super, super useful.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.680]   So what do you have to say?
[01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:56.800]   OK, Glass.
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.720]   OK, Glass.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.440]   It sounds like it's the, it's to activate it.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.080]   I prefer to be, yo, Glass.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.840]   I'm sure you could change it to anything you want.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:06.160]   I'm sure you can.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:06.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.600]   Your Glass.
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.760]   I haven't, I'm not a big path.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.160]   The fact that I'm not, I don't use path is path something that you'd be interested in, Leo.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.520]   No, I mean, I use path.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.080]   I love path.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.360]   But again, that's, you know, you come up with a couple of scenarios that I like.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:23.360]   I like the, and the nav while I'm driving, although I bet you many states pass laws against
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:26.080]   wearing glass while driving, but yeah, you're probably right.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:27.600]   I bet, but nav would be good.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.000]   What about biking or walking?
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:34.560]   Now, you know, I fell off my bike the other day and I didn't even have anything on.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:38.480]   So I think that's probably dangerous for me to be doing anything but paying attention to the road.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.760]   I just sprained my ankle and my wrist.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:44.640]   Contusions all up and down my body.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.680]   Sorry.
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:50.320]   And that was all because I was, I was, I just missed it was, and it was, but that's
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:54.000]   reminded me that biking is actually fairly dangerous activity.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.080]   And you probably should be paying attention to what you're doing.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.120]   Right.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.160]   OK, walking.
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:05:59.280]   Walking.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.160]   Yeah, although people fall in the holes all the time.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.840]   Totally.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:10.800]   If I was a Google IO or if I was a South by Southwest, I would love for glass to be like,
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.520]   Hey, two of your friends are in the bar up the street.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:14.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:15.840]   No, I can say, you know what?
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:17.360]   We won't really know till we wear them.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:24.560]   Um, I just fear that this, that those apps that I saw there did not make me say, gosh,
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:27.520]   I can't wait to get rid of your bad choices.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.880]   I think they were, they were playing to the big players now.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.600]   And it's going to be entirely new people who figure out how to use glass.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.200]   Yeah, they've got partners, but, uh, are they the right partners?
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.840]   And it's so funny.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:44.720]   The New York Times is so desperate to figure out what the hell's next after newspapers
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.240]   that they're even willing to do.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:50.000]   Have you seen the Google poems?
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.240]   This is funny.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.360]   This is on Reddit.
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.920]   By the way, coming up in just a few minutes, we're going to speak to, uh,
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.560]   Reddit founder Steve Huffman on triangulation.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:05.840]   Um, so it's, uh, it's our, uh, slash Google poems.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:11.920]   And I guess they're using, um, they're using the auto complete.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.480]   So here's one.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:12.960]   So here's one.
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.160]   I am sad.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.400]   I am sad in Spanish.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.000]   I am sad in French.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.440]   I am sad all the time.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.080]   Oh my goodness.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:27.200]   [laughter]
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:31.120]   Hipsters, hipsters, tumbler, hipsters in Detroit, hipsters on food stamps.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:34.080]   Here's one for yoga, Yogini's.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.080]   Yoga is my health insurance.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.280]   Yoga is my religion.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:39.840]   Yoga is my only exercise.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.000]   Yoga is my life.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.480]   So for those of you who are listening and not watching, what the hell is this?
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:49.520]   [laughter]
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:49.840]   Right.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:53.200]   These are, uh, auto complete, the Google search box is auto complete
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.800]   suggestions for particular words.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.480]   This one for game of Thrones fans.
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:03.120]   [singing]
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:03.680]   Hold on.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:09.760]   If you're not a fan of Game of Thrones, that was completely meaningless.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.680]   Do you like corgis?
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:16.720]   So you type in my corgi is, you can actually do this at home.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:23.200]   Type in my corgi is, my corgi is overweight, my corgi is limping, my corgi is fat,
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.720]   my corgi is satanic.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.080]   [laughter]
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:33.440]   These are all at Reddit slash r slash Google poems.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:37.760]   When you interview the Reddit co-founder, are you going to ask about the troll?
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.240]   Uh, I should, shouldn't I?
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:40.960]   I will, yes.
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:41.440]   I shall.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:41.920]   I shall.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.400]   I shall.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.640]   He's still there, right?
[01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:46.800]   What are you doing?
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.320]   My Leo is ignoring me.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.000]   My Leo man is ignoring me.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.680]   My Leo man is mad at me.
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.280]   My Leo man is ignoring me.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:53.680]   Help!
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.520]   Chaz just wrote that poem.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.040]   Why did you start typing my Leo man?
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:08:59.680]   I didn't.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.960]   It auto completed.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.080]   Just from my Leo?
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:02.960]   Yeah, it is.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.440]   Space.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.600]   Why is my Leo man ignoring me?
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.920]   Sastrology.com.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.040]   Sastrology.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.400]   I want sastrology.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.720]   Oh, my Leo, it took me a second.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.080]   Is the sign, okay.
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.600]   Yeah, Leo, yeah.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.240]   Yeah.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:17.200]   Where the hell are you?
[01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.480]   Where the hell are my keys?
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.160]   Where the hell are my Cheetos?
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.080]   Where the hell are you when I need you?
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.800]   Try sometimes I.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:26.800]   Sometimes I get a good feeling.
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:28.480]   Sometimes I get a feeling.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.520]   Sometimes in April, sometimes I cry.
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.360]   They tend to be sad.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:35.520]   Don't know why.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.280]   Ah, okay.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.480]   We should wrap it up.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.160]   Any other last chance?
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:45.360]   Well, you got, you got a funny, I think it's funny for just, just 30 seconds.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.040]   The, the, um, Eric Schmidt book trailer.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.640]   I have it right here, should I?
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.320]   The audio is what's funny.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:53.760]   It actually gets fairly dystopian
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:54.480]   toward the end of the battle.
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:55.760]   I think it's a good bad in the world,
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.120]   but that is still a good thing to the internet,
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.360]   but there's the voice on it just amuses me.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.920]   It's a, it's a YouTube video you can watch for yourself.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.480]   Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen, the new digital age
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:07.840]   with special announcer coming April 23rd.
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.000]   Oh, is that me?
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.000]   Gosh, dang it.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:12.400]   Okay.
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.760]   Here, wait, let me try it again.
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.560]   I'm going to disconnect.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.200]   I'm going to try to grab it.
[01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.720]   I'm going to try to grab it in the next decade.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.360]   Reconnect.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.960]   Because it's kind of nice.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.080]   As you know what this sounds like?
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.440]   Sounds like our announcer sounds like Jim Cutler.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:24.240]   I wonder if he did this.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:28.640]   Wow.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.840]   Thunder lightning.
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.200]   Very, very frightening.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.120]   Five billion new people will connect to the internet in the next decade.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.000]   Oh my god.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.360]   And with this mass adoption,
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:41.600]   the world's population will, in one generation,
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.000]   have gone from having virtually no access to unfiltered information,
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.720]   to accessing all of the world's information
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.840]   through a device that fits in the palm of the hand.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:56.240]   What's more extraordinary is that most of these people are going to be on the wall.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:57.600]   I don't think this is official, by the way.
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.120]   I think this is done by the draw shop, which does like,
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.800]   they do awesome whiteboard videos.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.840]   Those general electric movies we used to watch when you and I were in school.
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:10.400]   Yeah, they do.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.000]   Our friends zinc.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:17.760]   In parts of the world, written with the greatest number of challenges,
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:22.240]   where autocracy is already the dominant governance model for the physical world.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.280]   Autonomy, what?
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:28.480]   Autocracy is the dominant governance model for the physical world.
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.880]   It gets quite dystopian.
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.360]   I don't think this is official.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.320]   I think this is just a promotional vehicle for somebody else.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.520]   Like these guys who do these whiteboard videos.
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.760]   That's a big thing right now.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.160]   If you're an artist, kids, just thinking,
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:48.400]   if you can draw quickly, think on your feet,
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:54.000]   there's a real need for people to sketch strange cartoons at events.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.760]   Oh, it's very Davos.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:56.320]   What is he?
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:56.720]   They love.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.960]   Is that me?
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:11:59.680]   No, that was me.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.040]   I was trying to...
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.200]   The whole hour chef isn't just a cookbook.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.160]   This is another one.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.960]   It's just a venture guide to the world of rapid learning.
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:11.280]   But I swear to God, every conference now, they've got a guy doing this.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:15.680]   I actually have one for when I did my book,
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:19.360]   a Republican before I wrote it, that has a big penis on it.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.720]   Okay.
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:24.000]   Okay.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.200]   No, yeah, when I was at L'OeB, when I was speaking at L'OeB,
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.600]   they did one of me interviewing Kevin Rose.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:36.560]   Are you okay, Chuck?
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:41.040]   I think I wanted to take one moment here, Leo, since I think the chatroom would thank me for this,
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:43.760]   and I think that the plus world would thank me for this.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:47.760]   But since you are being known as so anti-Google+,
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:51.520]   isn't it interesting that Facebook just copied the heck?
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:52.080]   They did.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.360]   They did.
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:53.840]   They did.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:54.480]   It looks...
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.320]   But now I can make the case that it isn't Google+, it's just big pictures.
[01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:04.880]   That we are living in a visual world and Facebook recognized that,
[01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.120]   "Oh, I finally got it. How will you?"
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.760]   I'm going to join Julio, Nick, and 16 others to get less clutter, more stories,
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.680]   and a fresh new look in my newsfeed.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.560]   "I just got it. I'm so excited. Take a look," it says.
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.120]   Or you can press the button that says, "Not ready yet?"
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:21.760]   "New. Your choice of feeds."
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:26.000]   Stick to the same newsfeed you're used to with none of the stuff you want to read, or...
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:33.440]   or click the link to all friends following groups, most recent photos, games, music, etc, etc.
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.600]   It's easier to get around, visit other parts of Facebook,
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.600]   chat with friends all from one place.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.600]   That's straight out of the mobile, by the way.
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.520]   That's the mobile app.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.480]   If you ever need help, please.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:45.760]   I'm going to interrupt somebody and have them chat with me at any moment.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.960]   Yeah, I don't like that.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.720]   Here's an article from Atlantic Monthly.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.960]   "If you wear Google's new glasses, you are an asshole."
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:56.400]   That's good.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.760]   Let's...
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.320]   Let's...
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.120]   Go ahead.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.400]   We feel like the more visual newsfeed is the thing that sort of differentiates
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.840]   Facebook and Google+ from Twitter.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.640]   Yes.
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:08.160]   Although Twitter is doing inline images now too.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.680]   They're doing inline images, but it's not even close.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:17.840]   I mean, everything is sort of subservient to the 440 characters,
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.440]   like the tweet, the text of the tweet.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.920]   Yeah, it's really a little bothering me.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:26.320]   We just talked about this one ID, and I went to oneid.com,
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:31.040]   and all of a sudden I'm seeing on security now, I'd never heard of this company before.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.880]   Maybe it's a coinky dink, but for some reason I'm seeing one ID,
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:39.200]   and one ID ad it looks like, although it doesn't say it's an ad,
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.240]   and I certainly didn't like them on Facebook in my Facebook stream.
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:43.120]   That's a little odd.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:48.560]   Yeah, I wonder how they know that that I just visited them.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.400]   But it is a little Google+-y, but I don't think you could really say this is Google+.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:56.080]   This is the move towards much more visual streams.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.680]   I saw it side by side.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:01.360]   I forget who did it, but I side by side of two, the same posts.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:03.200]   And they were totally exactly the same.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:04.880]   The time I'll go for you to space in everything.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:13.760]   And maybe it's just me when I post there, but I still get far more conversation
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.920]   about our conversation on Google+ than I ever get on Facebook.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.760]   The quality's better.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.200]   The number of comments is not.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.200]   It's the quality though.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.200]   Would you expect that?
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:25.120]   I mean, Facebook is everybody.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:30.080]   Google+ is just a few nerds who even heard of it.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.160]   There it is.
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:36.000]   Now, if you do the photo stream, this is nothing but photos.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.280]   It is really beautiful.
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.120]   I mean, that's big images, big fat photos.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.800]   So...
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.160]   I don't know.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.400]   I don't think this is Google+.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.960]   I just think this is where everything's going.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.760]   The Pope's first tweet.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.440]   "Habeimos papam francisco."
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.040]   We have a Pope.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.080]   His name is Francis.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:05.120]   Thank God I studied Latin in grade school.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.480]   So...
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.240]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.560]   The new Pope is Father Guido Sarducci.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:15.120]   I thought he looked familiar.
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:18.640]   All right.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.680]   Let's...
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:21.520]   Pope jokes.
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:22.560]   No more Pope jokes.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.880]   Facebook redesign.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.960]   Do you not like it?
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.000]   Do you not want it?
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:30.560]   Do you hate it?
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:33.680]   It's just you'd say it looks like Google+.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.000]   It's fun.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:34.960]   It's fun.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.840]   I think it looks nice.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:36.480]   It's pretty pretty pussy.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:37.440]   I haven't gotten it yet.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.640]   I just got it.
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:39.600]   Like as we speak,
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.520]   so I will give you more of an opinion,
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:42.800]   more informed opinion as I use it.
[01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:48.080]   Okay, I think we got everything important.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.760]   Chad Hurley might start a YouTube competitor.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.800]   I don't know if that's the case.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.640]   Collaborative.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.200]   Collaborative.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.040]   Sounds like it could be something else.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.160]   I just thought Twitter's API keys
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.200]   for its official apps had been shared on GitHub.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:03.920]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:04.400]   It's a sting.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:09.920]   Here's how to get around the restrictions, kids.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.360]   Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.320]   yeah, really.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:13.200]   Just go to GitHub.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.120]   Everything's on GitHub.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.640]   I love that GitHub resume.
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.640]   Are you going to do that?
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.600]   Are you going to do that as a tool?
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.840]   Can I show that?
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:22.320]   Yeah, sure.
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:22.800]   I could.
[01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:27.920]   GitHub.com/resume/ or no, just your name, right?
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:28.640]   GitHub.
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:30.480]   It's a resume.github.com.
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:33.520]   And then, yeah, I think you just, you slash your name.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:37.040]   So if you've been using GitHub as Gina Trapani has.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.120]   I have.
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.040]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:41.760]   There isn't a GitHub.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:42.640]   It didn't work.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.520]   It's resume.github.com/questionmark.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:47.600]   Ah, question mark.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.480]   Question mark.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.160]   Yeah, right.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:50.960]   Let's do that.
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.720]   And then it builds a passionate GitHub user.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.240]   It builds a resume automatically.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:00.800]   Yeah, based on your repositories,
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.640]   and it does kind of like what you worked on when.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.680]   What languages?
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.080]   What percentages languages you write in.
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:07.840]   And that's pretty nice.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.560]   This is actually, I thought it was an official GitHub thing.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:10.880]   It isn't.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.960]   It's just an app that a developer.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:13.840]   Oh, oh.
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:13.920]   Oh.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.840]   Cool.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.640]   All right.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.360]   Let's take a break.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.840]   We come back with our tool tip number of the week,
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:22.640]   Jeff and Gina.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.920]   And then of course, stay tuned to triangulation right afterwards
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:27.760]   with the Reddit founder Steve Huffman.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.400]   But first, a word from squarespace.com.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.480]   If it's time to create a website,
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.280]   it's time to take a look at squarespace.com.
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.440]   I know there are a lot of choices for web hosting.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:44.240]   But very few combine great web hosting with superb content management system
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:48.880]   to give you everything you need to create an amazing website.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:52.400]   And they give you a free 14-day trial with 24/7 support.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.600]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.680]   You can see all the different templates.
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:19:00.720]   You can even because they have API support for importing from blogger,
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:05.600]   WordPress, type pad, and exporting too.
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.760]   And when I see important export, I mean everything,
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:10.880]   not just your content, but all the links,
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.680]   all the SEO is preserved, all the images are preserved.
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.720]   Even the comments are preserved.
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.320]   So everything is moved over.
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.280]   So what you should do is go to squarespace.com,
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.200]   play with it a little bit, import your stuff,
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.120]   see what your site would look like at squarespace.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:26.640]   Lots of great stuff.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:29.440]   Now if your developer, their developer platform is second to none,
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.600]   you don't need to know CSS or HTML.
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:36.400]   It supports Git, by the way, and kittens apparently.
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:42.160]   But if you do, you can incorporate those into your squarespace site.
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.280]   That's actually really the advantage of squarespace for normal people is
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:48.240]   you can get a great looking unique site without knowing all that stuff.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:52.560]   But the best part is the price is right.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:56.080]   When you buy a year plan, it's as little as $8 a month.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:00.880]   The unlimited plan, $16 a month, build annually.
[01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:03.440]   You get unlimited pages, galleries, blogs, bandwidth.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.640]   You never get a bandwidth bill.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.320]   If you suddenly get popular, no problem.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:10.320]   And by the way, even if everybody in the world goes to your site,
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.440]   squarespace can take it.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:14.160]   I've never been able to bring a squarespace site down.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.960]   We bring down sites every single day, not squarespace.
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:20.480]   Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors, and now they've added commerce.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.280]   And I think this is so, so cool, a very flexible e-commerce solution
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:27.360]   for both physical and digital goods.
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:29.680]   So you could sell music CDs or MP3s.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:32.240]   You could sell hardcover books or e-books.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.840]   A single interface for order management, for tracking orders,
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.480]   providing customer email updates, printing shipping labels, adding coupons.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.920]   Yes, coupons.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:47.920]   And all of this included everything unlimited, $24 a month, build annually.
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:51.360]   $30 a month, month to month.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.960]   Unbelievable.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:56.800]   And of course, the mobile experience is fantastic, even with e-commerce.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:00.800]   They will even calculate tax and shipping automatically.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.560]   And that's the price.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:06.080]   Squarespace does not take a cut from your commerce.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.600]   That's your site, not theirs.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:10.640]   I want you to try it, free squarespace.com.
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:13.520]   If you decide to buy, you could take 10% off your first purchase
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:17.360]   with any new account by using our offer code TWIG
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:20.960]   and the number three for the month, three for March.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:24.480]   TWIG3 squarespace.com.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:28.000]   Janet Tarpani, your tip of the week.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.440]   She's muted.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:33.120]   Hello?
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.960]   Sorry, my fault.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.720]   Oh, karma's a bit.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:40.480]   I call her as a dad.
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.280]   I didn't want to tell her.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.360]   Wow, you're doing really good for somebody who
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.960]   mutes herself automatically.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.600]   Accidentally.
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.640]   Ooh, girlfriend.
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:53.680]   I just didn't want you to all hear me like slurping ice tees
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:54.560]   or in the sponsor.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:55.520]   I'm just teasing you.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:55.920]   I mute myself.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:56.400]   No, no, you don't.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.840]   I wouldn't mute myself if I could.
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:58.240]   I can't.
[01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:58.880]   Well deserved.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.000]   Well deserved.
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:00.800]   It's true.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:04.080]   I will never make fun of death from muting himself ever again.
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:04.240]   Oh, yes.
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:05.520]   Stick it out of his tongue.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:06.720]   He's sticking out of his tongue.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:09.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.520]   I'm glad-- I'm actually glad that that happened.
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:14.480]   Captain feels very-- feels very good about that.
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.440]   Oh dear.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:16.080]   God, yummy.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:16.560]   Oh dear.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.600]   Oh dear.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:18.480]   Tip of the week this week.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.440]   Just a quick one.
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.120]   This comes from Life Hacker.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.040]   If you ever need to figure out how to do something
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:25.600]   with the Google app, what would you often do?
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.680]   You know, sometimes it's like, how do I forward my Gmail?
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.200]   How do I set up two-step off?
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.440]   How do I set up multiple accounts sign in?
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:34.880]   Well, you know, Google Search has that site operator
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:38.400]   where you can narrow search results to a particular site.
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.840]   So Life Hacker suggests if you want to search
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.160]   Google's official support pages for questions
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.440]   about those types of things, just use the site
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:52.640]   at colon support.google.com operator when you search.
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.200]   You can even narrow it down even further.
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:58.960]   Most of Google's answer pages are in the format
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:01.600]   of support.google.com/m-- you know,
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.520]   slash something, slash answer.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:07.360]   So you can even, you know, use the nerds who like redjaxes
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.320]   and that kind of thing.
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.280]   You can use the wild card.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:15.200]   So you can do like site colon support.google.com/star/answer
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:17.200]   and then put in your search term and that will return
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.680]   all the pages which are at that address.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:25.360]   So testing it out, I'm just doing site colon support.google.com
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:28.720]   and then search for something like forward Gmail.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:31.280]   And you can get all the kind of official help pages
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.440]   on how to forward mail to another account or set up
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:36.960]   your forwarding options or set up another reply to address.
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:41.040]   So I love that site colon operator, kind of narrow results.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.760]   And I know exactly what site I'm looking for something in.
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.440]   But it really is helpful if you just looking--
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.800]   you want to just look in Google's official support pages.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.440]   That's cool.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:50.400]   I didn't know you could do that.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:50.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:51.280]   That's really great.
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:51.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.760]   That's your tip.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:54.800]   Jeff has a number.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:24:00.640]   So the talk I wish I heard at Southwest was Yuri Milner,
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:04.240]   investor in Facebook and other places being interviewed.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:08.480]   And according to the report in Vanity Fair,
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.880]   when question time came, questions from Twitter,
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:14.400]   someone asked whether, well, IBM had been around for 100 years,
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.920]   what companies would be around for 100 years.
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.280]   And he listed three.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.760]   He said Google, Wikipedia, and Facebook.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.440]   A ladder of which, of course, he invested in.
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.480]   Huh.
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:26.080]   What do you think?
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.280]   You look like a PDF Facebook.
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:30.000]   A hundred years is a long time.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.120]   A long time.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.680]   I don't know if anything that we know and love
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:36.480]   will be around in 100 years, including New York City.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:40.480]   So I don't know.
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:41.760]   Do you think-- maybe--
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:42.400]   I don't know.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.360]   That's a long time.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.480]   A long time.
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:46.400]   It's like it's just too early to predict.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:46.800]   I don't think--
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.000]   People ask me that all the time,
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.360]   what companies do I think are going to be around?
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.480]   It's like they've only been around for maybe 10 years so far.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:54.480]   Almost certainly say Facebook will not.
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.600]   I think Facebook won't be around 10 years.
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.040]   Google, probably not either.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.560]   Wikipedia maybe.
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.560]   Wikipedia has a good shot, right?
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:05.520]   This is a nonprofit.
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:09.520]   And it's the repository of all knowledge,
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:10.720]   which can only get better.
[01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:15.360]   Is the Library of Congress archiving Wikipedia?
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.160]   Not that I know of.
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:17.440]   I mean, not sure of.
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:19.520]   But yeah, archive.org is, obviously.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:22.560]   It seems like Wikipedia has the best shot out of those things.
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:23.520]   Yeah, I'd agree.
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:24.960]   I mean, it's like, "Preeti Abritanika,
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.760]   how long did that last?
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.200]   How long did the OED last?"
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:27.520]   You know?
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.280]   Facebook, no way.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:32.320]   Facebook's the MySpace of...
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.000]   I think he kind of had to say Facebook.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.600]   Yeah, because he invested it.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:41.040]   Yuri, we got your onto you, Yuri.
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:45.120]   So this is, you know, so when I got the Chromebook,
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:48.560]   I started playing with apps,
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.920]   because that's all you can do, right?
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:51.200]   Is these apps?
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.640]   And so I'm just playing with them.
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:58.240]   And this was one of the things that convinced me
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:01.520]   that it really is quite a bit you can do with apps.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.560]   And some of them are kind of fun.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.680]   This is a really strange one.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:05.440]   It's called the email game from Baiden.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:06.160]   Have you seen this?
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.200]   No.
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:08.720]   Makes doing email a game.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.400]   You've got a little timer running,
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:11.840]   and you've got a little happy face.
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.320]   If you reply or archive,
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.480]   everything you do, you can see it'll improve.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:18.320]   I'm going to delete that.
[01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:21.520]   So in the timer runs, you have 45 seconds to do this.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.240]   Oh, I should reply to this one.
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:25.040]   Oh, gosh.
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:25.920]   Time's running out,
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.280]   and my happy face is showing.
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.520]   So it does 25 conversations at a time,
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:32.000]   and you get, you got to do all 25
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.080]   in a limited amount of time, like five minutes.
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.120]   And it's just a way to kind of
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:38.160]   get you to power through email.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.200]   And if you are one of those people
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.720]   that falls for crap like this,
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:41.680]   which I am,
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:46.080]   it makes email fun again,
[01:26:46.080 --> 01:26:48.640]   because it wasn't really for some time.
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.000]   What's it called?
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.280]   It's called the email game.
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.480]   It's in the web store,
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:55.840]   b-a-y-d-i-n.com.
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:58.000]   They use your Google mail.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.640]   I'm going to have it fun browsing through the web store.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:03.120]   There's really a lot of stuff in there.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.080]   There's a lot of it is,
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:08.320]   let's be honest, is a link to HTML5.
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:09.680]   It's just a web page.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:15.520]   Yeah, like the no program we all use.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:16.560]   Ever notice that.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.120]   By the way, when you get the pixel,
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.600]   when you're in the midst of you thanking me
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.200]   for inspiring you to do this.
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:23.520]   Yes.
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.160]   That flex looks great on it.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:28.240]   I tried Netflix even on the Samsung,
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:31.040]   the ARM based Samsung, and it works really well.
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:31.520]   Really?
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:31.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:32.720]   That's new.
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:35.520]   Yeah, they just added the capability of running an ARM.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:35.760]   So,
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:38.240]   you know, that's another one.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.280]   I don't really watch Netflix on a computer very much,
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.760]   but it's impressive that you can do that.
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.680]   And yes, I imagine it looks amazing.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.960]   Screen is just, this is.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:49.360]   Gina.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.640]   G.
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.440]   Pixel.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:52.000]   I know.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.040]   You guys are killing me here.
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:53.600]   You're killing me.
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:54.000]   Yes.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.440]   I'm like, "Exce, one baby doesn't need shoes."
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.400]   No, baby needs nothing except a pixel.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:04.800]   Baby needs daycare, so I can go to the Samsung event.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:06.960]   Baby needs daycare.
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:11.120]   Well, I'm looking at the world clocks on my Chromebook,
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.840]   and it seems that it's 7.12 AM in Tokyo,
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.120]   which means we're way late.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:16.240]   So let me,
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:20.560]   there's so many silly things you can get on this.
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:21.280]   I just love this.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:21.920]   I just think it's,
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.200]   what name is it in New Delhi now?
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.360]   Oh, yes, because that's where you will be.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.760]   Yeah, I doubt that I'm going to be up.
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:30.400]   Let's see.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.880]   New Delhi, it is 3.42 AM.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:33.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:34.800]   I don't think so, guys.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:38.000]   Can't catch you up at 2 in the morning to do this show.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.160]   You will, your head will fall forward,
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.160]   and you will break your brand new keyboard.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.600]   Yeah, I'm pretty sorry.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.720]   We don't want that to happen.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.520]   It's exactly the opposite though, isn't it?
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:48.240]   Plus half an hour.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.160]   It's exactly the opposite of California time.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:54.240]   Plus half an hour, which is the weirdest thing.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.240]   Yeah, it is weird.
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:59.680]   Jeff Jarvis, so you will be here next week though.
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.800]   You're not going to New Delhi yet.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:01.680]   No, we're going to New Delhi.
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.040]   I'm at full disclosure.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.200]   It's an event that's done by Google and the Guardian.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:06.560]   So I'm going to trip over,
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:09.200]   no payment, but I need to trip over on Google.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:10.000]   So you know.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:10.480]   That's fine.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:13.120]   You probably get free to go go internet too.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:15.680]   Actually, you do.
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:18.800]   You get 12 free go go internet sessions on your pixel.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.560]   Yes, I will.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.800]   So I never fly on airlines that have go go.
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:23.280]   So I know.
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:24.640]   Socks.
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:27.200]   Jeff is the author of Public Parts.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:28.000]   What would Google do?
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.080]   He is a blogger at Buzzmachine.com,
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:33.680]   and he looks fabulous in Linux.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.760]   Unbelievable.
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.280]   Who would have thought that?
[01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:39.440]   It's really a huge upgrade.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.360]   Now we know we just give everybody a pixel.
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.200]   Yes.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:43.840]   They like that.
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:45.680]   So Jeana says yes, yes, yes.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:48.160]   And I'm saying that I'm my brand new Mac mini here.
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:49.280]   Well, you look pretty good too.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:49.920]   I must say.
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:51.600]   It's a big improvement.
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:52.800]   I am so happy.
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:53.280]   Oh man.
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.840]   The work that Chad did, everybody had to help me out.
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:57.200]   Getting it sorted out.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:59.520]   We were committed to making Jeana look good.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:03.680]   If I use the LTE on the...
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:03.840]   No.
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:06.000]   But we'll try that.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.560]   For one show, how many gigs would that be?
[01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:11.840]   More than 100 megabytes.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.360]   Yeah, it'd be way more than 100 megabytes.
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:13.920]   We'll find out.
[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:14.480]   Let's try it.
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.320]   I'll try it.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:17.760]   My picks will come.
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:18.320]   I'll try.
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:23.920]   And then Jeff can submit the expense report for the Verizon bill.
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:26.800]   No, I also submit the lawyers,
[01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:29.200]   my wife divorces me when she sees the phone bill coming in.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.040]   Hey, a reminder, we will be covering the Samsung Galaxy S4
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:40.080]   announce event tomorrow afternoon, 4pm, Pacific, 7pm, Eastern time, 2300 UTC at Twit.tv.
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:40.960]   So tune in live.
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:44.480]   I guess we won't be able to get Andy because he's at the event.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:49.120]   But Andy and Jeff and Dick DiBartolo will join us after the event for their analysis.
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:53.200]   Ron Richards and I will be hosting here as we watch the stream live together.
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.000]   That's what we do now.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.440]   And I love that.
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:59.200]   We just play the stream so you can watch the event and then we make fun of it.
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.440]   History Science Theater, Leo.
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:02.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.280]   That's tomorrow right after...
[01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:10.320]   No help on many of these same stations.
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:10.960]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:11.760]   We'll see you next week.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:12.480]   Bye.
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:23.760]   [Music]
