[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.200]   It's time for TWIG this week in Google.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.720]   And we got the AT back.
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.640]   Nothing wrong with the Bizarro Google we did last week,
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.400]   but this week in Google really isn't the same.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.840]   Without that guy there, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.440]   Group hug, group hug.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.440]   And this lady here, Ms. Gina Trapani.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.440]   And Erin Newcomb's here too, which is great.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.240]   So we-- this sort of show-- and Erin brought his old radio
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.800]   with him, and he's still getting Franklin Delano Roosevelt
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.600]   speeches on his radio.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.360]   And I think--
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.360]   It's amazing.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.440]   Oh, call it a romantic--
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.440]   It's a lot of late-panched, huh?
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.600]   --lost causes.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.200]   And he's got old radio on there.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.080]   --and a Confederate officer.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.520]   Oh, there you are not being logical.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.360]   Actually, the story is interesting.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.920]   It's a Raspberry Pi in there.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.280]   That's right.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.200]   So what I did was I took an old Philco radio circa 1940
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.360]   something.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.800]   I'm not sure exactly what the date is.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.640]   And went ahead and put a Raspberry Pi in.
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.040]   I should roll it over here.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.600]   Can you roll it over here, Burke,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.320]   so we can see it between me and Erin?
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.240]   Roll closer.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.320]   So it's pretty interesting, because I really wanted to--
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.000]   I've got a pretty big library of old-time radio shows.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.520]   And I thought, what better way to listen to them
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.920]   than on an actual old-time radio,
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.040]   or out of an actual old-time radio?
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.200]   And the Pi's LEDs even glow blue,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.440]   which I love through the grill.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.800]   So the Pi is in the back, and it took up to Wi-Fi.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.840]   And I wrote a little web page control for it,
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.200]   so I can skip tracks and change the volume and things
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.760]   like that, because it's a little bit difficult to do that
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.480]   when it's just-- that's meant to be set on a table,
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.600]   and you kind of forget it, right?
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.120]   This is your grandpa's radio, but it doesn't work the same
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.840]   as it used to.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.840]   That is so need-o.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.520]   Actually, as I talked about it, last time I was here,
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.600]   I think, at the end of the show, I mentioned I was working on it.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.040]   That's great.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.400]   How hard was that to do?
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.520]   It wasn't hard at all, actually.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.240]   Raspberry Pi is so user-friendly.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.560]   If you know Linux, if you know how to set up a web server,
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.400]   or how to do just about anything in Linux,
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.520]   especially if you know how to do it on the command line,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.840]   it's really easy to get the Raspberry Pi up and running
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.240]   and get it to do whatever you want.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.240]   And is the web page in PHP?
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.600]   What is it?
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.120]   How's that work?
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.800]   The web page is actually a Perl CGI script,
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.240]   because I know Perl better than PHP.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.680]   So I did it in Perl, and loaded light.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.600]   I'm not sure exactly how you say it.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.880]   Lighty?
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.880]   Lighty?
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.880]   Lighty?
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.240]   It's a web server.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.400]   Commonly known as Lighty.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.560]   So I put Lighty on there.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.800]   And it was up and running.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.840]   Actually, it took me about five hours.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:54.360]   I think it's--
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.520]   The web server's running on the Raspberry Pi.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.840]   The web server's running on the Raspberry Pi.
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.200]   So you can connect from your-- you know,
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.880]   I can connect from my Android.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.280]   I can connect from my laptop, change the tracks.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.280]   Change the volume.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.400]   The neat thing about this is the Raspberry Pi was, what,
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.920]   $30?
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.680]   I guess the Wi-Fi one is a little more expensive.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.920]   Yeah, the one with networking, the ethernet built-in
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.120]   is $35.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.720]   And there it is.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.200]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.880]   We have had vibration levels one.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.800]   This is Dimension X still, I think.
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.160]   There's no reason you couldn't have--
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.000]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.200]   Absolutely.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.440]   See, it's all running through end player.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.960]   So end player can stream across the internet.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.520]   So you could actually run Twitch shows if you wanted to.
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.080]   Just have it running all the time.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.600]   No.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.160]   You're using it as little speakers?
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.400]   No.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.960]   No, I couldn't because they were powered speakers.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.040]   And the wires were so degraded.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.880]   I mean, you wouldn't really want to do that.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.520]   That's what's actually running it.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.040]   Sweet.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.840]   That's a good thing.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.960]   The Raspberry Pi, a little USB hub, an ethernet dongle.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.200]   Total cost.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   Less than $50.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.320]   I'm telling you, man, you've got a business there.
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.200]   Make that just go buy a bunch of old radios and make those.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.160]   There's a business.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160]   I'll tell you what, I mean, I encourage anyone.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.760]   Anyone that's into making or hacking,
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.920]   and they want to get into this, I really encourage them
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.400]   to go out.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.200]   I mean, it's not that much.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.960]   I want to do that.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.800]   That's awesome.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.320]   You got to get one.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.200]   $35, you can't go wrong.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.560]   So-- and the nice thing about it,
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.400]   it's all running off of an SD card.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.920]   So I can change this from this.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.360]   I can pull out the Raspberry Pi, stick in another SD card,
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.720]   and have it be a media server running on my network, streaming
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.960]   media, or playing my videos, or whatever I want.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.840]   When I'm tired of that, take out the SD card, stick in another one.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.760]   And it's back to the old time radio.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.200]   It's pretty darn cool.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.960]   Really cool.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.440]   Cool.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.760]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.280]   It's really cool.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.640]   A lot of fun.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.280]   I knew Gina.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.200]   I said, Gina, when she sees this, will squeak.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.160]   Yeah, part of it, right.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.520]   Part of it, right.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.600]   One half of me is squeaking.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.760]   The other part of me is going like nerds.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.560]   Nerds, nerds.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.960]   But I have to say, I'm kicking myself.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.880]   I haven't played a Raspberry Pi nearly enough.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.560]   And so that looks a really cool project.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.680]   It's really neat.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.040]   Thanks.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.600]   So how was-- we're going to do a little--
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.080]   because we haven't seen each other in a while.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.800]   So pardon us, folks.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.080]   You can fast forward if you want.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.680]   But I just want to find out how everybody is.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.840]   How was your holiday, Gina?
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.920]   Was it your baby's first Christmas?
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.280]   Yeah, it was baby's first Christmas.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.320]   It was wonderful.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.240]   We had a really nice chill holiday at home, very chill
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.360]   in the year, sleep before midnight.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   Because the baby's up at 3 in the morning,
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.480]   so it was very exciting.
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.320]   It's funny.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.760]   You really pretty much-- the end of your staying up
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:19.800]   to midnight has happened.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.640]   You will never again say up to midnight.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.760]   No.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.480]   You got 18 years ago and a bit of 10.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.880]   And then you're so old.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.680]   It's like, man, I ain't moving to bed.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.320]   Whatever.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.400]   I went to bed at 10.30 in New Year's Eve.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.400]   Watch Anderson Cooper again.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.080]   On purpose?
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.640]   Wasn't that wild?
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.400]   So I'm watching the usual stupid,
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.880]   taped on October, Rockin' New Year's Eve.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.600]   I mean, they literally tape it in October.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.720]   I had somebody call me and say, last year and say,
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.760]   I was at the Disneyland when they taped the segments
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.000]   with Fergie for Rockin' New Year's Eve.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.080]   It was October.
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.800]   So it really feels canned.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.320]   So I'm turning around saying, why-- and nobody--
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.680]   I guess they figure ABC's got it.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.480]   We're not going to do it.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.200]   So China Television, ABC.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.600]   And then I find CNN.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.960]   Not only is it live, but Kathy Griffin
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.860]   is apparently attempting to kiss Anderson Cooper's
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.000]   Sarnine repeatedly.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.200]   They were just like-- he was giggling.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.640]   Like, it was so funny.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.800]   I thought it was hilarious.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.000]   I was just so happy to find the New York-- the Times Square
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.840]   Ball Drop, like on a channel other than the Spanish channel.
[00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.120]   Because here on the West Coast, it's like you couldn't--
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.280]   so I was so thrilled to just do the New York Ball Drop.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.440]   I talked about my family on the East Coast, and it was fine.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.480]   But those two were-- they were just a mess.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.880]   I thought it was hilarious that--
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:39.880]   I loved it.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.360]   --was giggling and that she was being so wildly inappropriate.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.920]   So inappropriate.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.680]   It was fantastic.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.760]   And at first, I thought, my god, Cooper must be dying.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.120]   But apparently, they do this every year.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.960]   She just wrote last year.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:56.120]   They put up signs for this as no nudity.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.560]   And then, Si, Oppo Gangnam Style wanders in and stands down
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.000]   screen.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.200]   So it looks like he's three feet tall.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:02.720]   Oh my god.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.920]   I don't know if I answered this.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.240]   This is awkward at all.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.400]   I have to say, that's New Year's Eve.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.640]   But it inspired me.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.840]   Because I realized that they are the only people really
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.480]   covering it live.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.280]   And by the way, on the West Coast, after 9 o'clock,
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.640]   it's like, go home.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.560]   Because it's New Year's happened in New York.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.040]   What are you guys doing?
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.080]   I'm going to do it with Leo.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:21.880]   I'm going to do it.
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:22.880]   And we're going to do it--
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.920]   Twit Style, internet style.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.600]   We're going to do it 24 hours.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.840]   We're going to start with the first New Year's Eve in New
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.640]   Zealand.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.200]   Oh, there you go.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.080]   And talk to people via Skype at the top of the hour for 24 hours.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.680]   That's awesome.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.200]   Just go through-- and that's next New Year's.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.120]   We're planning it already.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.400]   Because apparently, I have to plan something like that
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.240]   in advance.
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.960]   Are you going to do it-- pull a jury.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.600]   Lewis, here would be there for the whole thing.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:44.800]   I am.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.720]   I'm aware of Tuxedo by the end.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.720]   I'll be singing--
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.440]   --and my Tuxedo.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.360]   Do you think you're drinking?
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.520]   I want to love this.
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.240]   I want to love this.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.240]   You are in on this.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.600]   You're our San Diego correspondent.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.480]   All right.
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:08:59.680]   Good.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.240]   It just has to be before 10 p.m.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.160]   Pacific.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.800]   OK, you could pretend you're doing Denver or something.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.040]   Well, I don't want to be big enough.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.880]   We'll be able to have her on the party hat.
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.520]   She'll be able to be on the business.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.640]   I think we have viewers all and listeners all over the world.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.560]   I think that we can easily find somebody from every time zone,
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:23.640]   all 28 of them or something, and have a New Year's ball drop.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.240]   28 ball drops.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.760]   What?
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.360]   Yeah, because there's some half hours in there.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.200]   That would be really cool.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:29.800]   I know.
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.880]   I said the same thing.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.240]   Kevin Marks said, oh, yeah, you'll have to do it for 28 hours,
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.360]   because there's 28 time zones.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:38.400]   He fooled me.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.800]   And then I realized we can't possibly be 28 hours.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.960]   The Earth still revolves around the sun once every 24 hours.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.800]   Actually, it actually rotates every 24 hours.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.520]   So I realized, oh, that's because we've
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.280]   got some strange time zones in there.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.040]   It will be possible to get a live feed from something
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.400]   at every single time zone.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.680]   Is that-- that's the challenge?
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.920]   Oh, it's kind of sitting around.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.800]   It's the challenge.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.640]   We're going to create a Google Doc at start now
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.840]   and say if you're going to be in, you know,
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.040]   Perth, if you're going to be anywhere, you know, we have to--
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.320]   No, in your audience, you're going
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.240]   to have people who are going to move time zones that night.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.160]   Yeah, just to go through the coverage.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.000]   Yeah, there's like seven time zones in India.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.920]   You'll have your new Samoan fan.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.800]   Google+ Hangout would be perfect for that.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.880]   Because people could just whip out their phones
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.080]   and join the Hangout.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.080]   Hey, look, there's 50 million people behind me or whatever.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.840]   That's what I want to do.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.340]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.520]   I have someone in Qatar.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.600]   I met a fan who watches the show on Qatar.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.480]   I Google it all again.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.520]   Get him to touch.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:36.960]   Cool.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.520]   So I invite you all.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.440]   And you've got a year to prepare.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.040]   No, don't.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.040]   I'm going to get my text.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.040]   I'm going to go.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.680]   Make a note.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.600]   So CES is going on right now.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.200]   And I'm not there.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:49.800]   You notice that?
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.400]   And can I tell you how happy I am?
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.000]   You were just in and out for--
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.480]   keynote was really, really good layout.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.240]   Oh, you saw that.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:56.640]   Watch it.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.280]   Yeah, I watched it.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:57.780]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.800]   I wish I'd known I would have been better.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.600]   I was very good.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.400]   I'm glad I didn't know.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.000]   Let's put that one.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.440]   It's very open, too.
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.960]   Henry Blodgett put up some of his business stuff, saying he
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.680]   was open.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.560]   Nothing compared to you, man.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.960]   Well, so let me explain.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.520]   I was not keynoting CES, but I was
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.880]   keynoting the new media expo.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.480]   They very wisely decided to move.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.120]   It's the formerly blog world and new media expo.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:19.960]   Now they just call it new media.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.920]   It's all new media, right?
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.080]   Blogs, podcasts, YouTubers.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.080]   It's all the same.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.440]   And they moved it to right before CES.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.840]   So they-- in Vegas.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.200]   So the presumption is, and I think it's wise,
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.120]   that people will come for that and CES.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.880]   And so they asked me to speak.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.520]   And I did.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.920]   And as I usually do, I like to tell our story
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.920]   and tell people what it's like and what the opportunity is,
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.880]   what the challenges are, and all that stuff.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:46.080]   So it was fun doing it.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.640]   It's a great audience.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.360]   And we streamed it.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.000]   And I think it's a special.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I think it's a Twitch special.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:51.600]   So you could have--
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.100]   Yes.
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:52.960]   Oh, it's a Twitch special.
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.460]   Perfect.
[00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.720]   Yeah, because I got to see that.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.840]   I saw one of your former keynot.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.040]   You've done this before.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.600]   Yes.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.480]   And you're just great, Leo.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.040]   And it looks as if you get up there with zero preparation.
[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.280]   Like the one I saw was like, you just got up there, his suit.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.680]   And no, but you were your sort of regular charming self.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.760]   And I told the story.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.760]   And then you could tell you could just--
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.960]   you were just kind of doing it right off the cuff.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.080]   And it was great.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.880]   It was so great.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:14.920]   So I'm excited to see the--
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.560]   No, he was doing him off the note, too.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.520]   I had a Galaxy Note 2, but that was only because there
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.360]   are some numbers in there.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.280]   I want to make sure I got those right.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.280]   Right.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.360]   And no, you're exactly right, Gina.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.400]   I used to prepare.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.520]   And Lisa told me, stop preparing.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.040]   Those are the worst keynotes I've ever seen.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.560]   And so--
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.800]   Yeah, I bet that does a compliment.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.280]   Like, you came off of someone just kind of telling a story,
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.480]   having conversations.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.440]   That's the best way to do it.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.200]   I mean, not many people are talented enough
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.560]   to be able to pull that off.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.800]   But it looks sort of wonderful.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.360]   Now, that's good.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.520]   She's-- Lisa's right.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.080]   Lisa's right.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.080]   Yeah, she's right.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:45.600]   Right.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:45.880]   I've learned that.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.280]   She's always right.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.480]   The truth is, this is, to me, the most important talk--
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.840]   I've given this talk several times for a new media expo,
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.840]   the most important talk I do.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.880]   Because it's tough being a podcast.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.960]   And then the next night, I went to the international--
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.360]   you could tell just from the name--
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:06.400]   the International Academy of Web Television Awards, which
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.440]   were done like the Oscars.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.800]   They had video bits.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.200]   They had presenters who had scripts on prompter.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.440]   It was in a big auditorium.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.200]   It was very glitzy.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.320]   People were all dressed up.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.280]   They had a red carpet.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.680]   And I thought, this is kind of like--
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:27.680]   this is a new media people wearing their mommy's high heels.
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.840]   It's kind of dressed up.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.920]   But I have to say, the quality of stuff that's
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.040]   being done in episodic web series is pretty amazing.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.920]   There's some stuff that is very, very Hollywood quality stuff.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.080]   You guys watched the-- what, is it H Plus?
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.520]   H Plus was one of the big winners.
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:43.760]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.080]   Wow.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.920]   Very well done.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.760]   I mean, super high quality.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.360]   I hate that it's so short because it's like--
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.760]   you get into it in that five minute time for whatever it is.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.960]   You're like, oh, why are they thinking?
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.960]   That's a short form.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.640]   I think you were.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.240]   I don't get it.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.400]   Yeah, I think that was a mistake.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.640]   I think it was a big mistake.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.240]   Because maybe the last week thing is longer than the show.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.640]   For the UCCES at all, Leo.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.640]   And then I did CES yesterday, Tuesday.
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:16.600]   So speaking of CES, if it weren't for Android and Samsung,
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.760]   flat line, I'm not kidding.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.160]   There's a few interesting things.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.000]   LG had an NFC capable printer.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.440]   So I took it a phone.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.680]   They have an Android and they have an iOS app.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.880]   But it works best with Android because you have an NFC chip.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.200]   So you walk up to this little printer.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.560]   I posted a video on Facebook because it wasn't worth doing
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.080]   much more on.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.160]   But I thought it's worth--
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.400]   I could probably show it.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:41.720]   Let me see.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.920]   I probably have it right here.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.520]   One of my thinking, I've recorded this.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.160]   But it's cool because it uses NFC.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:53.760]   It uses NFC to pair to Bluetooth, I should point out.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.240]   And then it prints.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.720]   But it's cool because it means you can walk up to an arbitrary
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.920]   printer with your smartphone and just print.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.160]   And the NFC is built into the printer?
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.960]   So it works best with a note or some sort of galaxy device
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.760]   because they have the NFC chip in it.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.200]   Your Nexus would work.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.240]   Nexus, style.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.760]   Anything that--
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.120]   But you have to have this particular printer.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.120]   Yeah, let me go to my Google+, and--
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.680]   It would be neat if it was an add-on.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:29.560]   It was something you plug into an existing printer with NFC.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.080]   I was just going to say, I'm sure you could do this with
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.200]   Raspberry Pi pretty easily.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.920]   Just a matter of time, isn't it?
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.400]   You just need one of those little--
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.880]   I've got to have a hundred chips.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.600]   I've learned about Devore documentation, though, and say,
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.520]   if that's the most exciting thing, you got out of sight.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.680]   Exactly.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.160]   There was a lot of stuff like that.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.880]   A lot of kind of chintzy stuff, you know?
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:51.240]   I was saying in the pre-show, I started doing all about Android.
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.400]   Last night was our first episode, and we covered some stuff
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.400]   from CES, and I realized, I thought I knew a lot about Android
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.400]   until we started talking about Android-powered cameras,
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.680]   Android-powered gaming consoles.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:05.120]   And there's a music--
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.440]   Smart glasses with Android.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.800]   I mean, it's pretty incredible.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   Samsung has the Android-powered refrigerator, finally.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.360]   Yeah, that's just what you want, isn't it?
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.360]   Phones that you can drop in the toilet.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.200]   Thanks to Sony.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.920]   In fact, there were also a lot of these Android roku sticks
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:22.760]   that are kind of cool.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.400]   Yeah, a few Google TVs.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:25.800]   Here it is.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.320]   Here's the--
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:27.880]   let's see.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.240]   Can I play this to Google Pocket?
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.120]   Are you getting my audio?
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.880]   Because if you don't hear it, it's not going to really
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:35.800]   be very interesting.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.280]   So we're in the LG booth.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.840]   And of course, a lot of people are looking at and amazed
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.440]   by the Ultra HD 4K displays.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.600]   They've got beautiful OLED displays.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.040]   I don't know how I'm going to choose from that.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.920]   But I'll tell you one thing I wouldn't mind having.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.200]   This is the Pocket Photo.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.240]   It will be $200.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.000]   It's not available in the US yet.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.280]   But the idea is you put the Pocket Photo software
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.360]   on your Android phone or your iPhone.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.720]   Actually, iPhone's Bluetooth.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.480]   The Android phones, because they support NFC.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.880]   I could just take this picture and tap it.
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.920]   Can I tap it to one of these?
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.720]   You just-- I've never seen this printer before in my life.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.360]   And now I'm printing via the NFC.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.360]   Actually, I think what it does--
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:15.200]   I misunderstood it.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.280]   I think it's doing a Bluetooth pairing.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.600]   And then it prints via Bluetooth.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.440]   But it's quite quite.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.160]   That printer.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.360]   And it prints a little, tiny thing.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.160]   It's a shorter box.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.760]   The NFC is for Bluetooth pairing.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.080]   It's kind of a silly little--
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.480]   Oh, that's a little tiny printer there.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.400]   It's a little tiny printer.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.800]   You could carry that pocket.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.560]   I think the market for this, because the whole point of easy
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.240]   pairing with NFC is not that you own it,
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.680]   but that stores have it, where it's at places.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:42.800]   And you just walk up to it.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.160]   You took a picture and you go a bar, for instance.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:45.600]   It'd be great.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.440]   Pab it in a bar.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:46.800]   Do it.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.440]   And it prints it out.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.160]   Easy views.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:48.600]   Easy views.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.960]   It's the new Polaron.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.200]   And this is what NFC is probably going to be better for
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.400]   than almost anything.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.720]   The Samsung folks also had NFC tags in the lobby of our hotel.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:01.400]   So I go, oh, this is exciting.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.080]   And I go like that.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.080]   And what does it do?
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.120]   It pulls up a web page for the hotel.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.120]   I was like, oh.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.360]   What did you hear what Disney's doing with--
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.080]   I don't know if it's NFC or RFID.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:12.720]   Risbands.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:13.760]   The wristbands, exactly.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.720]   Yeah, they're doing wristbands.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.920]   So you just walk around.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.200]   No more tickets to the park.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.280]   Well, eventually.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.440]   Then no more tickets to the park.
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.520]   You buy your wristband.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:20.920]   You go up.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.720]   You want to ride a ride.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.040]   You just scan your wristband.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.800]   You want to buy something.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.560]   Buy some candy.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.960]   Scan your wristband.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.680]   Anything like that.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.240]   You just go ahead.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.840]   What's really cool about it is that with permission,
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.160]   the data will be in there.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.240]   So when you go up to Sleeping Beauty,
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:39.040]   which I know you will, she'll say, oh, Leo, I have to do an agent.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   Finally.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:44.960]   That's interesting.
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.200]   Do you load it with cash?
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.400]   Is that-- do you put money?
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.600]   Is it a give a balance?
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.400]   And then it--
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.400]   Yep.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.880]   And does it do the fast passing on the rides, where you'd be like,
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.320]   hey, I want to ride this ride?
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:54.840]   Notify me.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:55.840]   Exactly.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.600]   Or you get there.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.200]   This is-- you know, Gina's doing future research.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.000]   Before you get to the park now, you
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.120]   could sign up for your fast passes.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:03.960]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.200]   And it's loaded into your wrist.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.200]   Yep.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:06.880]   That's great.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.760]   That's a great idea.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.280]   And it's great for Disney, because they get tons more
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:12.320]   information that way.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.440]   Who's riding what ride?
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.560]   You know, all that kind of stuff.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.240]   Who's buying what?
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.120]   I don't know, Jeff.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.960]   You can comment on whether that's scary or not.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.960]   But--
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.360]   No, you're opting into it all.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:23.880]   Right.
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.200]   And so you have full control.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.000]   So the parent can say, you can know my name.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.760]   I really don't want you to know my kid's name.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.480]   Whatever.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.280]   You're in full control, which is great.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.280]   And what I like about it is that it's Disney being Disney.
[00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.120]   It's a little microcosm perfect world.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:36.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.440]   And maybe people will get used to some of this stuff there
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.400]   and say it's not so bad.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.520]   It's not the mark of the devil.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.280]   Yep.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.360]   You know, actually, that ties into Bill Clinton speaking
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:49.640]   at the Samsung keynote at CES.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.480]   Samsung had to hold its keynote till Wednesday morning.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.200]   So it was this morning.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.120]   President Clinton was kind of like their guest.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.360]   I mean, it's not Bill Maher, Lady Gaga, but I guess it's OK.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.040]   He was a president.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.400]   But what he talked about was the fact that cell phones
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.200]   and Samsung is one of the leaders in low-end smartphones
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.520]   for the developing world are a huge and very important part.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.280]   And this is, of course, of these very involved in.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.720]   Part of the economy of developing nations is for many people.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.280]   It's the way they bank.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.680]   It's the way they make payments.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.040]   Not NFC, probably.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.680]   I don't know how they're doing it.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.440]   But Android-powered mobile devices are very important.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.200]   I just read a pretty fascinating paper
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.160]   by Professor Gordon at Northwestern,
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.280]   I'm forgetting his name, in which he was arguing
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.000]   about the three industrial revolutions
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.600]   and the growth that comes as a result of them.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.600]   So if you can see that.
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.080]   Look at that.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.400]   It's a bar graph on his Nexus 7.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.440]   It's a bar graph on his Nexus 7.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.680]   Basically, that's what's happening in the growth,
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.160]   and so it's going to go back down again.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.680]   Anyway, in this paper, he was arguing
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.280]   that the toilet and running water--
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.600]   it was a far more important invention for the world
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.480]   than any afterwards.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.200]   But Marcel Bauens, who writes some great stuff online,
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.560]   P2P Foundation, I think it's called,
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.640]   said no, that today in certain poor places,
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.360]   people are choosing cell phones over toilets,
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.560]   given the choice because the cell phone has an impact
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.160]   on their living and how much value they get.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.920]   Even where they don't have power,
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.920]   and they have to go and rent power.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.880]   There's a guy with a push cart power,
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.960]   and they go and they plug in because there's
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.880]   no electricity in some of these areas.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.200]   It's really remarkable.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.320]   Other CES events, Pebble says, we're
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.120]   going to ship our Android powered smartwatch January 23rd.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.920]   That's a blast.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.360]   We're all Kickstarter subscribers, aren't we?
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.040]   I'm not.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.160]   I am. I didn't do Pebble.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:56.960]   Well, that's what I meant.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.880]   Wait, I mean, of course we all use Kickstarter.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.240]   You have to be like, not in touch with the world,
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.520]   not to use Kickstarter.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.280]   Actually, you've moved to your eBay.
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.960]   You've got an eBay habit now.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.480]   What happened was, is the Kickstarter fever got to me.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.360]   So I just sold two of my Kickstarter things on eBay.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:14.640]   What?
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.640]   Basically, if a break even and got out of them.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.240]   I had this-- I think I told it in the show before.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.880]   I had this one thing where you had a case to an iPhone 4,
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.520]   and had a single magnetic card.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.800]   And that could mimic all of your credit cards,
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.680]   or your honor.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.840]   Then I realized that was-- I'm not going to use that.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.520]   Sold it for a slight loss.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:38.720]   And then I just got the first heart rate wrist band only,
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.120]   no chest band.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.040]   Oh, this is great.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.840]   I got to get that.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.800]   I'm taking beta blocks from my heart.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.720]   I got my heart rate up.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.800]   And I get the thing, and I say, it just lands like a fudge.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.240]   I say, oh, shh.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.240]   Shiza.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.360]   And I ordered that.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.240]   So I'm now an eBay man.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.680]   So I went on eBay, and I sold it for a slight profit.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.520]   So between the two, I'll break even.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:03.960]   And now you're buying stuff on eBay.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.320]   So it really isn't.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.360]   But eBay, so I bought myself a Galaxy Note 2,
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.080]   because Leo convinced me I should get it.
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.200]   Now I haven't turned it on yet.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:18.000]   I ordered a DIY make-your-own-cheese kit.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.160]   I can make your own mozzarella cheese kit right now.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.920]   I should probably say that.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.840]   I'm not really--
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.200]   I can function in the kitchen.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.000]   I can make coffee, and I can make toast.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.480]   And I can put it together.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.560]   But I'm not exactly a cook.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.160]   Well, my wife saw this, and she just went--
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.920]   [SIGHS]
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.320]   That was-- she just sighed.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:40.920]   I was like, come on.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.840]   It's like, make your own mozzarella at home.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.520]   Come on.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.080]   This is on Amazon, right?
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.320]   It's 23 bucks on Amazon.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.960]   Oh, the--
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.480]   mozzarella-- is that the one you got?
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.480]   No, no, it's a Kickstarter.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.440]   It's a Kickstarter campaign.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.200]   It's a Kickstarter cheese-making kit.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.040]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.320]   It's probably on my profile.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.280]   That was hysterical.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.400]   Well, I could just probably search for a cheese-making
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.840]   kick-kick starter, and--
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.280]   Fine.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.520]   That's a good idea.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   What I'm really excited about--
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.040]   Make Cheese Incorporated.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.560]   Let's make cheese.
[00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.240]   Exactly.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:12.760]   That's it.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:12.960]   That's the one.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.640]   In your own kitchen.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.160]   So--
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:15.720]   And guess what?
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.560]   They've raised $39,000.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:18.920]   Wow.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.480]   The piece that was $40,000.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.720]   I can send you some--
[00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.640]   I'm going to make some cheese.
[00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.480]   --buttermilk and some lemon and some cheese cloth and--
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.640]   Did you get your kit?
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.840]   I haven't gotten the kit yet.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.840]   I got a holiday card saying, hey, it's coming.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.800]   I think the mozzarella one ships in like--
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.840]   I know what sold you.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.080]   Look at this mozzarella-making party.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.680]   That's what sold you on it.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.280]   All right, this is the thing.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.280]   Come on, my mom.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.760]   I'm so impressed.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.760]   Turn around to eBay right now and put it up there
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.600]   and say that you can order the first cheese-making kits.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.880]   Did you pledge enough to get the Moscow pony included?
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.200]   I didn't.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.040]   Just straighten what's it all.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.480]   But it does make 30 batches of mozzarella.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.040]   So it's quite economical.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.280]   They're 30 batches.
[00:24:59.280 --> 00:24:59.960]   I'm so excited.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.240]   My wife was-- she was serious.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.280]   She was just like, you are never going to do this.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.760]   I'm like, I am so going to do this.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.400]   I'll come over.
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.920]   Let's have a cheese pulling party.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.880]   Maybe I'm New Year's.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.960]   I'll make cheese.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.400]   Oh.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.280]   In the studio.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:14.780]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:19.680]   That's a good segment.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.320]   And now, as we approach New Year's in Ghana,
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.520]   Gina Trapani will join us to show us how to make cheese.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:29.520]   You're like, you're a sense of ligny balls.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.720]   And I think you--
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.680]   It's like Taffy, right?
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.160]   What's the really?
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.080]   You got to stretch it.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:33.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.160]   It just looks-- yeah.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.080]   I've never done it.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.080]   I'm a bad Italian.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:37.840]   It's about time.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:38.400]   Come on.
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.320]   I want it.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.000]   That's funny.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.480]   Sorry.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.000]   Sorry for the--
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.080]   It really is that all Italians make cheese?
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.280]   No, they go buy it.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.040]   They have a cheese person.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.720]   I used to make pasta till I realized you could just go buy it.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.680]   My name's Ella.
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.160]   And I know--
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.760]   Ella's a cheese maker from Calgary.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.440]   That's cool.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.080]   You know what?
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.080]   This is what Kickstarter is all about.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.920]   By the way, I should mention that a number of winners
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:08.120]   at the International Academy of Television for the Web Awards
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.920]   were Kickstarter projects originally.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.480]   They raised the money for the financing for the films,
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.280]   doing that, including--
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:19.320]   there's a steampunk show.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.160]   Oh, what's it called?
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.640]   Film is a big thing on Kickstarter.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.040]   Yeah, everybody loves steampunk.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.320]   Oh, yeah, steampunk, of course.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.760]   All right, well, I'm going to give up one of my numbers
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.200]   right now.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.200]   Two of them, but we've got it.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:29.800]   Oh, boy.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.160]   It's getting tight here.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.040]   Do you not have to give them up?
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.080]   You don't have to give them up?
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:33.880]   I got it.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.520]   Here's the number.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.480]   This year, Kickstarter, and we're just
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.160]   the beginning of the year, so who knows things could change.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.360]   But it's on track to potentially collect a billion dollars.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:47.360]   Wow.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.000]   I thought I was really thinking by now
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.240]   that it would be--
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.480]   that the Kickstarter bust would have happened.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.400]   But I guess it didn't--
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.000]   It's down there under the stuff on the rundown.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.280]   If you want to look it up.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:26:59.800]   Wow.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.960]   I just amazed by that.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.440]   So Kickstarter-- not Kickstarter itself,
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.400]   but like all of the various Kickstarter projects put together.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.000]   Kickstarter takes what?
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.520]   5%?
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.120]   Something like that.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.320]   So this got 5% of a billion.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.320]   So what is that?
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:16.840]   That's not bad.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.760]   $350,000?
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.480]   I don't know.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.880]   Gina.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.400]   What?
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.400]   Am I doing math on the band?
[00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.160]   Can you do math?
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:25.600]   Gina?
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.080]   Can you do math?
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.640]   Looking at their best 2012, backers
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.240]   pledged $606 per minute in 2012.
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.880]   Crazy?
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.440]   So the League of Steam--
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.040]   Adventures of the League of Steam was one of the Kickstarter.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.040]   Do you love that show?
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.040]   Oh.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.040]   Oh.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.640]   These guys raised 13 grand to do their show.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.560]   They actually were wearing these costumes.
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.440]   They have the best costumes ever.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.320]   It's really cool.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.680]   And this is your brother's best friend's show, Liz?
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.800]   Well, he won a number of awards.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.240]   They kept bringing them up on the stage.
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:01.100]   Cool.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.040]   Oh, yeah, I saw this.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:02.400]   That's right.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.160]   League of Steam.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.240]   I did see this.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.080]   So that's really cool.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.360]   They built these crazy guns that shoot nets.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.680]   And God, man.
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.480]   That's amazing.
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.640]   Adventures of the League of STEM.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.440]   What else?
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.320]   So the pebbles going to be shipping on the 23rd.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.880]   So you and I will get ours, Jeff,
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.920]   and we could put it right on eBay.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.040]   This one, I think, all open.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.040]   This one I kind of want.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.240]   No, I have to do a review.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.160]   I mean, that's why I got it.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.160]   But--
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.800]   It connects to your phone, right?
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.160]   Uh-huh.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.880]   There was another one that we tried an Italian design.
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.800]   It was, I'm watch.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.320]   I am watch.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.240]   That was the same idea.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.240]   It was just horrible.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.480]   Because you know, a UI on a watch is not--
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.760]   you know, it's going to be hard to implement well.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.440]   It is tough.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.240]   But the pebble is yink, which I think makes it kind of cool.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:56.720]   Wow.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.400]   Gosh, there actually--
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.760]   Now that I look at it, there's a lot of stuff.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.560]   I was watching--
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.560]   Yes.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.400]   Yeah, I see yes.
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.280]   But again, it's Android and Samsung.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.880]   And that's pretty much--
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.120]   What's a couple of self-driving cars?
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.200]   You know, I was thinking that when HTTP--
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.120]   he might like to poo poo, and say, oh, come on.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.360]   People are going to go to a program.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.320]   People are going to buy this stuff.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.360]   And of course, we get idiot.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.360]   I can't believe it, right?
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.800]   What do you think about the 4K TVs?
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.160]   Love them.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.280]   Beautiful.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.320]   What's interesting is the stunning absence
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.840]   of the word 3D.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.360]   [LAUGHS]
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.320]   That's CES.
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.960]   For the last two years, there was nothing but 3D at CES.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.840]   And I guess the television manufacturers are retrenching.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.080]   I mean, you get it anyway, since most high-end TVs have it.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.920]   But I guess nobody's really demanding 3D TVs.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.840]   The next thing, which in a way is more realistic
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.120]   than 3D-- in fact, not a way-- is more realistic than 3D--
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.160]   is 4K-- they call it Ultra HD.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.640]   It's a doubled resolution, both horizontally and vertically.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.400]   And there was even an 8K TV.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.280]   No way.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.320]   What's that going to do to bandwidth demands on cable?
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.040]   Well, I asked.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.520]   You know, I did a panel with a guy from Roku and a guy from Sharp
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.520]   and who were responsible for kind of delivering this content.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.000]   And they said, we're not worried.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.560]   I said, what's interesting is-- and this is not unusual,
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.920]   I think, because of Moore's law that Silicon can advance
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.120]   at geometric paces.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.040]   So the TVs are getting higher resolution faster
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.920]   than the demand or the content can keep up.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.920]   Right.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.120]   We're still trapped with the telecoms.
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.240]   I want to give a quick plug to Susan Crawford,
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.040]   the brilliant Susan Crawford.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.880]   I was an amazing law professor, was on ICANN.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.120]   And she wrote a book just out called "Captive Audience"
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.080]   about the whole issue of us getting
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.320]   national broadband and national fiber
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:45.760]   using the NBC Universal Comcast merger as a stepping off point.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.040]   And she went on about the profit margins
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.560]   for delivering broadband unbelievably high.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.680]   And cable systems, she says, now we're just harvesting.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.680]   They're not investing at all.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.440]   And the file has stopped building and it's done deals with Comcast.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.240]   I fear we're going to hit a wall here as a nation where we do
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.720]   have all these great new applications
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.040]   and we are going to start hitting the wall.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:11.120]   Well, Lloyd Clark, who is director of a new product at Roku,
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:12.680]   I said, you know, you've got to be worried.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.200]   Because right, Roku just got to 1080p.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.120]   It's all delivered.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.280]   Roku is one of those internet devices that connects your TV
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.360]   to us, among other things, Netflix.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.000]   And he said, no, we're not worried.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.720]   Netflix had a 4K demo.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.880]   And he said, between improved compression
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.520]   and improved bandwidth, we don't think it's going to be a problem.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.520]   We think we will be able to deliver 4K eventually.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.520]   Wow.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.360]   Wow is right.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.680]   Because I tell you, it's like, look at through a window.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.280]   It's awesome.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:41.920]   It's hard to imagine.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.520]   There were a lot of set-top boxes.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.560]   Let's talk about those.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.360]   I'm going to take a break.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.040]   Let's talk about that.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.400]   And more from CES.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.440]   Yeah, there were our coasts and a lot of people.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.880]   Yeah, not just Google TV stuff.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.240]   Although there is some Google TV news as well.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.440]   But first, let's talk about my new scale.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.880]   Stamps.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.680]   Calm.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:05.120]   This is a message to those of you who want to be postal pros.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.600]   It's a pro tip.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.480]   If you're an eBay seller, you've got to mail people stuff.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.720]   If you're an Amazon seller or Etsy,
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.000]   if you are in a business where you send out invoices or mailings
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.800]   of any kind, you know.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.640]   You probably don't want to go to the post office to buy postage.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.240]   And maybe you're using a postage meter.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.440]   There is a much better way.
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.720]   Boy, this is the 21st century for postage.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.280]   It's called stamps.com.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.720]   It lets you print postage from your own computer
[00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.280]   and your own printer.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.680]   No special ink, no postage, meter, no lease.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.000]   You just stamps.com.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.400]   And it's fantastic because it also--
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.200]   because you're on a computer-- let's say you're an eBay
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.560]   seller-- takes the buyer's information from the page.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.680]   You don't type it in.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.040]   It prints out the forms.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.600]   If it's an express mail or a certified mail,
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.160]   it'll send an email to the buyer with the tracking
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.440]   information-- all of this automatically.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.040]   It's very fast, very easy.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.000]   And the scale is a very nice feature.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.200]   I'm not sure you can get the scale for free.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:10.640]   This little 5-pound scale is USB.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:12.720]   Plugs right into the back of the computer.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.000]   So you plop the letter, the package on there.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.280]   And the computer says, OK, this is how much postage you need.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.120]   Here's what you do.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.880]   You go to stamps.com right now.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.200]   And you'll see it-- well, wait a minute now.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.920]   You see the scale there, but that's the $80 deal.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.840]   I'm going to get you a better deal.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.120]   Click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.080]   for this special Twig offer.
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:34.880]   Enter the offer code TWIG.
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.520]   And that $80 offer turns into $110 bonus offer.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:42.640]   You get $55 in postage free over a few months.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.040]   You get the free digital scale.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.200]   That's a $50 value.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.200]   All you do is pay shipping and handling.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.320]   I think it's $45.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:53.160]   You get a $5 supply kit and a four-week trial of stamps.com.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.480]   If you are doing a lot of mailing,
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:57.960]   this is going to be a lifesaver and can even save you
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.800]   a lot of money.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:04.360]   Stamps.com use a promo code TWIG for $55 for free postage.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.480]   And that beautiful scale.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.280]   So per--
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:08.800]   It is pretty.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.440]   It's per--
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.800]   I wish I would have done that before we sent out
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.960]   all our Christmas cards.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.680]   You know, it's actually such a good deal.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.400]   It might be even worth it just for your Christmas card list,
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.280]   although I think it's really not intended for that kind of light
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.880]   mailing.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:23.920]   So let's talk about set top of boxes.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.560]   Our cost is going to do $150 Android--
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.040]   I'm sorry, not $150.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.120]   What is the price on that?
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:30.800]   Cheaper than that.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.320]   Android 4.1 box.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.960]   That means it'll have apps.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.600]   Yes.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.560]   So this was really cool.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.240]   This was actually my favorite best of show for me from CES
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:43.600]   as far as set top boxes because it's not Google TV.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.480]   It's actually Android 4.1.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.160]   So that means you get all the app ecosystem that
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:51.960]   comes with Android 4.1 system.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:54.120]   And it also has a built-in high definition camera
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.800]   so that if you want to do things like hangouts with your family
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.560]   or whatever, you can do that.
[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:03.840]   Our cost has always been a low price leader with Android.
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.560]   So the camera sits on top of the TV.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.060]   Yep.
[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:08.080]   And it has a built-in game controller.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.640]   And the little round disks are supposed
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.560]   to emulate touch on a--
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:15.320]   if you were to have a tablet or a touch--
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.200]   And a full keyboard.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.400]   A pretty keyboard on this, too.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.240]   A pretty keyboard.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.920]   I mean, it looks really, really good.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:24.680]   It's a 1.5 gigahertz multi-core processor, a gig of RAM.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:29.080]   You can expand the storage by adding an SD card.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.320]   You can hook up other stuff to it.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.160]   I mean, I think they've really done a really good job
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:34.080]   of kind of covering up the bases.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:37.440]   How do you compare that with a NetEor Neo TV prime, which
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.360]   looked good to me?
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.840]   Well, I haven't looked at the NetEor as much.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.240]   I do have a Vizio co-star right now.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.160]   I just got one for review.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.000]   The NetEor?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   The Vizio co-star.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:47.680]   The Vizio co-star.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.840]   Yeah, that's Android, right?
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.360]   It is.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.640]   It's Google TV.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.400]   And I did a review on all about Android.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.480]   You know, several episodes back.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.320]   It's pretty good.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.680]   It's a little sluggish.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.720]   The thing that I really didn't like about it
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.680]   was the fact that there's no apps.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.960]   The Google TV is really limited.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.120]   Software developers are not making apps for Google TV.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.200]   So to me, our co-star just kind of like skips
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.480]   that whole bubble of Google TV and just goes right for Android
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.160]   4.1.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:19.000]   So it's kind of a bad news for the Google TV team
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.680]   that a manufacturer decided to make a TV device
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.120]   and not use the operating system that's
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:24.960]   meant for the TV.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:25.880]   But it's true.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:31.840]   I mean, there are so few Google TV specific apps.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.240]   And the ones that are there are just like, oh, classy fireplace.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.080]   And the things that you can get anywhere else.
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.520]   You know, YouTube Netflix.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.020]   Right.
[00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.720]   So actually, this is the thing that's
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.560]   most exciting to me about this is that it's full on Android.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.600]   And the camera as well.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.040]   Although it seems like there are a lot of Android apps that
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.640]   would just be weird on a TV.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.480]   Well, my Android app would be really weird on a TV.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:54.840]   It's a tablet.
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:56.840]   Yeah, it's a tablet, basically.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.160]   That's why it has a touch knob.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.280]   So you would be like having a big tablet.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.240]   So it'd be like remote controlling a large tablet.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:03.400]   Right.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.200]   Exactly.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.640]   So it isn't a large tablet.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.600]   It's about the same resolution, actually.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.640]   It's less a resolution than an X is 10, about the same as an X is 7.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:15.960]   So yeah, so it'd just be a big tablet in your living room.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:22.200]   $129 bucks available next month, according to our coasts.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.520]   We'll certainly get one to try.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.760]   But you say, a living room.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:25.960]   But there are.
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.880]   I should point out, and it happened for a while,
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.080]   a bunch of USB sized sticks with Android.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:31.580]   Right.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.880]   Have you tried any of those?
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.440]   I haven't.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.200]   But this is basically taking that same concept
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.000]   to the next level.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.480]   Right.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.320]   So it's giving you a lot more horsepower,
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.920]   the expandability of adding other devices and other things
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.720]   to it because it's got the ports in the back.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.160]   So it's basically taking that same concept, which is a really
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:49.480]   mini system, and saying, you know what?
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:50.880]   It doesn't have to be that small.
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.000]   Let's go ahead and give you a camera, give you the things you
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.040]   want, give you a nice keyboard, and away you go.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.280]   So I'm going to get one as soon as they come out,
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.920]   and I'll probably be selling the VisioCoStar.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.280]   But we'll see.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.560]   It will be interesting to see what happens with Roku, Apple TV,
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:10.520]   and Google TV, because the one thing cord cutters want,
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.960]   they, of course, use these devices to watch on demand video.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.240]   But one thing cord cutters really want is live video.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:16.720]   Right.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.080]   And now Apple TV is doing that with the Wall Street Journal.
[00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:19.880]   I've just found out.
[00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:21.280]   I didn't even know it.
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.800]   Apparently Roku doing the same.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.640]   And according to Visio's CTO, Matt McCray,
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.600]   in an interview with GigaOM, Google TV
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.360]   will probably be streaming too soon.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.600]   I mean, it already does.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.840]   But I think what I got out of this article on GigaOM
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.920]   was they're basically taking the pass through out.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.840]   So there's no more pass through from your cable box.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.520]   That's the thing I like about Google TV, which
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.880]   is it doesn't take up a new HDMI port.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.160]   It's on the same one.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.600]   It's just an overlay on top of your live television.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.280]   He says, we're not going to do that anymore.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.040]   So I mean, it's basically saying, you know,
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.960]   there's enough cord cutters out there that don't really need it.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:58.520]   I don't have it.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.520]   My VisioCoStar has the pass through, but I don't use it.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.560]   Because I don't have cable.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:03.400]   I don't use it.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:03.900]   I use it.
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:06.840]   Interesting.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.360]   We're moving so fast in this.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.240]   It's very interesting.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.560]   Inquisitor liked the high-sense pulse,
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:17.600]   saying it was the fastest Google TV on the market.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.520]   High-sense is another, I guess, Chinese company
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.960]   that was off in the South Hall.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.920]   And I looked at their stuff a little bit.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.480]   This is really too bad that the Google Q thing didn't work,
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.200]   because it's such a confusing field.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.920]   And it would be nice if there were a touchstone product.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:34.440]   Yes.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:34.940]   Yeah.
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.840]   There's such an opportunity here for someone
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.760]   to do it really, really well and be the clear leader, right?
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.800]   It's a big as remote.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.120]   I got to say on this high-sense pulse,
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.040]   you get a full keyboard, you flip it over.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.360]   You do get a trackpad.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:47.700]   Mm-hmm.
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.720]   Another way to handle that touch.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.680]   Same as the VisioCoStar.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.180]   Yeah.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:50.880]   You get very similar.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.600]   Although it looks a little bit bulkier.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:55.480]   I don't know what--
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.360]   It's almost the same size, I think.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.720]   But looking at the pictures you're showing.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.600]   A little bigger than your hand.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.100]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:03.080]   That's the same size as my remote.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.800]   And the box is the same size, I wonder.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:11.440]   1080p, a Google Chrome browser, HDMI in and out, USB, IR
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:18.080]   blaster, Wi-Fi, DLNA, 3 AAA batteries.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:22.000]   They're proclaiming it as the fastest Google TV on the market.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:22.720]   I don't know.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.120]   I don't know.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.880]   I guess that's coming from high-sense.
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:30.520]   LG announced seven models of Google TV built-in.
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:31.560]   That's more interesting to me.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.400]   That's more interesting.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.600]   And in fact, was it LG?
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:34.920]   Or I guess it was Samsung where you
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.480]   have replaceable software and replaceable modules
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.680]   on the TV, which is good idea.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.680]   Yeah, they announced that last year.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:41.160]   Right.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.440]   Yeah, the idea being that you don't get--
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.960]   you don't-- people don't buy a whole new TV,
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:47.200]   but maybe they'd want new software firmware or upscalers
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:50.320]   or whatever is the silicon gets smarter.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.680]   LG will offer Google TV sets in two series, 42, 47,
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.880]   50 and 55-inch sets.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:02.960]   And then they'll have the cinema screen in 47 and 55 inches.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.960]   No pricing or availability yet.
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.280]   So this is built-in to the TV?
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:07.880]   It's built-in.
[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.560]   Yeah, they showed this also last year.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.400]   They showed Google TV.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   That's the way it's going to expand, I think, more quickly.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.640]   The only thing is, I mean, it's obsolete.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.680]   I mean, like we just said, look how fast this is moving.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.720]   And you buy one of these LG TVs and what happens when they
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:21.880]   decide not to update it.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:22.560]   Right.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.360]   That's why I like the additional--
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:28.640]   I mean, it's kind of a pain to have another box on your entertainment
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:31.760]   center, but I actually like that because I know I can throw out
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.440]   that box and get the next box when it comes out.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:33.940]   Yeah.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.440]   I'm going to do that more often than I'm
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.680]   going to replace my TV, right?
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.120]   Exactly.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.000]   Asus Cube is another Google TV.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.720]   I didn't-- now I'm kicking myself.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.960]   I went home too soon.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.440]   150 bucks launches in March.
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:50.760]   Same kind of big keyboard remote.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.800]   It's just another Google TV, as far as I can tell.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.800]   I'm not sure what's different except that it's more expensive.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.080]   And it's a little bigger.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:02.000]   And it's got this sort of cubish-like skin,
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   or the interface to it has this--
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.720]   is this cube that it kind of moves around
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.400]   in each face is a different category.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.760]   So I think that's why they called it just physically.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.120]   If you would also, the user interface is a cube.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.440]   Yeah, it's eye candy.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.760]   Well, the real question is, are they
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.320]   going to start putting higher-end processors?
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.320]   Because as you mentioned, the sluggishness of some of these things
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.200]   really gets in the way.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.080]   And if you want-- I mean, I love the idea of having
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:28.840]   it be a true Android experience with a fast processor on it.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.760]   I mean, the reason they're able to do this so cheap
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.800]   is just that they put in a slower processor,
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.920]   but a dedicated video processing chip
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.480]   so that you can do things like Netflix,
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.760]   and it looks great, and it's high-def and everything.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.520]   But then you go out and you say, oh, I want to play a game
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.760]   where I want to do something--
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:43.280]   It's terrible.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.320]   --some other app on it.
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.800]   And it's like, man, what is going on?
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.880]   It's so slow.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.240]   I could play in a person like Roku,
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.160]   but it's not what I would prefer or want to do.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.040]   Right, right.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:53.080]   Now, RCA is going the other direction.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.400]   They're delivering a tablet with TV, has two tuners on it.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:58.960]   Yeah, I thought this was really interesting.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:03.520]   They've announced this tablet, and it's got two TV tuners,
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:06.480]   and it also streams TV.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.680]   But I threw it in here because I wanted to get your opinion--
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.600]   this panel's opinion on, is this really something
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.680]   that people are interested in doing?
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.480]   This is using DialDYLE, which has been around for a while,
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.440]   and other solutions like this.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.360]   I think it's a small specialty market.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.360]   Nothing is--
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:24.860]   Yeah.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.120]   Remember, I remember a couple of years ago
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.560]   there were all these ads on the Super Bowl and stuff for this.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:30.720]   Remember the guy was shopping with his wife,
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.320]   but he got to watch TV.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.080]   Similar technology.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.000]   Never went anywhere.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   I can't remember the name of it.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.440]   But--
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:37.960]   The Eizen was-- had that--
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.400]   They've risen as VCast.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.400]   They still have VCast.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.720]   So it's got the Dial TV, and then I think it also has a--
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:46.560]   the other tuner is the over-the-air tuner.
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.800]   So theoretically, you could be sitting in the airport
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.000]   or in a taxi cab or something.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:52.760]   Watching the game.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.840]   Watching the game from there.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.400]   But I just don't know--
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.320]   Uses 4G.
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:58.960]   Uses a kind of a-- what is it?
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.280]   Metro PCS.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.880]   It's not a major player.
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.380]   Right.
[00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:04.760]   That's the reason it won't be everywhere.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.280]   Interesting.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.840]   But I just don't know how many they'll sell.
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.240]   Android cameras.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.400]   Samsung had one full Android on the back.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.880]   Regular point and shoot camera on the front.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.680]   Polaroid has one with interchangeable lenses.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.600]   I thought that was pretty cool, because that's
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.640]   what people were complaining about with the Samsung one.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.040]   Is if you did--
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.200]   Well, there's a point and shoot.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.560]   It's a point and shoot camera, exactly.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:27.320]   And people wanted something a little bit higher end.
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.040]   And this looks like this--
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:28.920]   So this is micro four-thirds.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.840]   This is the mirrorless.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:30.680]   Very popular.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.440]   And I see my micro four-thirds is a standard lens design.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.480]   So even if Polaroid only makes one,
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:37.160]   you can get micro four-third lenses
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:38.800]   from a number of manufacturers.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.040]   Android 4.1, that's good.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.120]   I'm glad we're seeing that everywhere.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:41.640]   Yes.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.480]   Yes.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.800]   For a while, it was gingerbread still on some of these things.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.240]   I'm not sure what's on the Samsung camera.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.240]   I think it's 4.0.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.120]   It's at least 4.0 when it came out.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.760]   4.9999 for the Galaxy camera.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.920]   500 bucks.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.000]   Yeah, Android 4.1 Jelly Bean 4.8-inch LCD touchscreen
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.320]   quad-core processor.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:06.920]   I was talking-- we did a triangulation
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:10.880]   with a guy from Nokia, Hans Peter Broadmau.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.000]   And he's a camera buff, photography buff,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.760]   but also kind of a R&D blue sky guy for Nokia.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:20.640]   And he says that really the future of photography is not
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.480]   in lenses.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.520]   It's in computation, back end computation.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.520]   You see this with things like the light-stroke camera
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.560]   where you take a picture, but you get
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.080]   to focus on a variety of different planes.
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:33.880]   He says, computation is going to be huge.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:36.240]   And you see it already in kind of a small form
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.240]   with the Android even iPhone where you get--
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:41.080]   you take a picture, but you have all these programs, the least
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.960]   of which Instagram filters, but all sorts of other things.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.320]   You can do this stuff process afterwards.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.440]   So the idea of putting an operating system,
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.360]   powerful processor, in a camera, I think,
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.160]   is really intriguing.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.080]   Yeah, I mean, for me, it's the sharing thing.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:57.200]   Especially now, I just take a lot more pictures
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.680]   because my daughter's so little.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:02.200]   And doing it with my phone, I get a low quality, relatively,
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.080]   low quality photo, but I can automatically send it to Flickr.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.680]   But if I take it with the nice DSLR,
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:10.080]   I mean, even if you have an IFI, it's still fiddly,
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.920]   and you have to connect to the thing.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.880]   So being able to take a good picture
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:17.880]   and then send it directly to Flickr from a good camera
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.680]   because it's got Android on it is appealing.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.720]   If we got to the point on--
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.560]   but it comes down to telecom companies once again--
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:27.800]   even the shared data plans that have come out,
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.320]   you have to pay for every device,
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.640]   and they still limit it too much.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:32.600]   It's like the days when the telephone company charged you
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.200]   for how many phones you had, which was absurd.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.600]   That's the way it worked.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.600]   If you got to the point where you just said, listen,
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.280]   I'm going to have as many devices I want.
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.320]   And yeah, you're going to charge me
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.160]   if I use more data.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.360]   At that point, I'd say, OK.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.200]   Because then I can have my Android camera
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.400]   and my Android refrigerator and my Android car
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.040]   and my Android this and my Android that,
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.840]   and I'd be all happy.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:56.560]   But now the plans are just too gating.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:01.760]   Valve, Steambox.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.680]   See, I'm thinking that games are actually the killer app
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.480]   for even something like Google TV.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:09.200]   That's why I want Android because I want to play games
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.400]   and do TV, right?
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:11.920]   Yep.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.920]   And the idea of the Steambox is it's basically
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:18.600]   using Valve's Steam platform, which is a very powerful,
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:21.360]   very popular gaming platform on PCs,
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.800]   and making a small box, roughly the cost of, say,
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.560]   a PlayStation 3 that sits in the living room
[00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.080]   and runs interestingly Linux.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:29.320]   No, not Windows.
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.720]   Yeah, Steam introduced their Linux, their client for Linux.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.840]   Not too long ago, they had a beta, closed beta.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:35.800]   Now they have an open beta.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.320]   You can actually go download it.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.480]   And if you have Windows-- I think we're Mac, you can also see it.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.440]   It's that kind of sit back experience with Steam,
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.040]   and it's great.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:44.240]   Yeah, the big screen, they call it.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:44.600]   It's great.
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.200]   And so this is really interesting that they are actually
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.280]   getting into hardware now.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.840]   It looks like they want to compete with the Xboxes
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.760]   and PS3s of the world.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.280]   And why not?
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.240]   I mean, they have a huge following on PC.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:02.360]   I'm seeing people now go back to PC away from consoles.
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.000]   But there is this group that loves
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:06.840]   to be in the living room with a traditional controller.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.160]   And so there's been rumors floating around for forever
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.800]   that they're going to do a piece of hardware
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.040]   so people can play in their living rooms
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.600]   without having to do the PC thing.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.560]   And now it looks like they're doing it.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.720]   Valve is showing off Piston, which is one of, they say,
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.200]   many prototypes.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:21.600]   Look at that.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.480]   That's cool.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:26.920]   That's based on an actual gaming PC, this company sells.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.640]   Yeah, that's a really cool looking.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.160]   $1,000 for the gaming PC.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.840]   Look at the back.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:32.640]   Yeah, look at the back.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:33.560]   I was like, oh.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.080]   Is there a--
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:35.840]   Shiny.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.040]   I don't see it back.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.320]   I'm looking at the Ron article.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.960]   A lot of ports.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:41.960]   Here's some more pictures.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:42.320]   Oh, there you go.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.320]   It's very pretty.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.840]   Ooh.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:47.400]   Four USB ports.
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.840]   E-SATA, couple of E-SATA ports.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:51.840]   USB, HDMI.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.400]   USB, 3.0.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:56.560]   And then two mini-video--
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:57.840]   One of those.
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.040]   There's not the mini-video form here.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.280]   The Apple--
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.840]   Same thing that you use in the Mac--
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.400]   Made a display port.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.840]   E-old, Ethernet port.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:07.160]   Couple of display ports.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.560]   E-old, E-old, E-old.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:12.560]   Yeah, really, this looks like it's a kind of a throwback.
[00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.880]   That's the throwback port.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:15.360]   Wow.
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:17.640]   That's what you need a stable connection, kids.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.400]   But it looks like they're shopping this around.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:22.680]   I mean, this particular box we're looking at here,
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.720]   retails at $1,000.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:24.240]   $1,000.
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.240]   Yes, I don't think that that's not the price.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.520]   That's not what it's going to give you.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.120]   Although, there'll be a market for that.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.200]   The hardcore PC gamer will say, hey, great.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.000]   I don't care.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.760]   Because I want to play my PC games in my living room
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.200]   on my big screen TV.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.240]   Maybe that's the high end.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:36.880]   That's the high end.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:37.880]   Maybe that's the high end and they'll
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.080]   have something at $1.99, hopefully.
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.680]   Well, it's got to be PlayStation for us to think.
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:43.120]   Maybe not.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.040]   $1.99, $2.99.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:45.680]   $3.99.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.480]   Yep.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.480]   $4.99.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.960]   We could go on.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:53.680]   [SIGHS]
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.360]   OK, let's take a break.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.040]   Come back with more.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:56.920]   There is lots more.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.840]   In fact, I think we buried the lead.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.440]   You would agree, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:00.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:01.280]   We got there.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:02.120]   We had to geek out.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:02.640]   That's fine.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:03.360]   We had to gadget out.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.160]   Oh, yeah, stuff.
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:04.960]   But we come back.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:05.800]   Here we are.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.080]   Google wins.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.320]   OK, but first, a word from Teng.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.120]   Teng's the thing.
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:14.400]   If you're an Android fan, you've got to find out about Teng.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:18.280]   It's a new mobile phone service from the folks at Took House
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.640]   who specialized--
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.760]   I love this Elliot Noss of Took House.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.520]   He did-- they do hover.com.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.480]   They specialize in taking industries that are just really
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:30.440]   suck and making them work for people, making them better.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.240]   He says, there's a huge opportunity
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:36.160]   to take cell phone service, which is universally hated,
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.280]   and make it work for people.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:41.760]   And you start off with integrity.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.640]   Telling people, there's what you're going to pay, exactly.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.960]   No BS.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.880]   Contract free.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:52.160]   No early termination fee.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.440]   They don't bundle or give you ride along services.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:56.280]   In fact, if you go to Teng--
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:00.880]   I'm sorry, twig.ting.com, T-I-N-G.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.000]   You can see-- first of all, we'll get you a $25 credit
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.160]   to get you started on your first device.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.760]   But you can also see how it works.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.200]   Look at the plans.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.880]   Now, this is just a serving suggestion,
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:13.160]   but I'll give you an idea of how this is going to save you money.
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:18.000]   First of all, it's great if you are a family or a business
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.320]   and you want multiple handsets.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.920]   It's $6 per handset per month.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:24.360]   So let's say it's a family of four.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.520]   That's $24.
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.760]   That's your cost.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.920]   But then you'll admit it.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.440]   Now, you could start with zero of everything
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.720]   and just pay as you go.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.720]   Or you could say, just kind of budget,
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.400]   I'm going to use 1,000 minutes shared, 2,000 text messages
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:41.320]   shared, and let's make it 3 gigabytes of data shared.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.960]   And the total cost $110 for the family of four a month.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.560]   For four people, $110 a month.
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.840]   And the best part is you don't use all of that.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.080]   They rebate you the difference.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.200]   You use more.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:52.920]   No penalties.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.080]   They just charge you the next level up.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.600]   You pay for just what you use.
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:57.960]   You get credit on unused service.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.640]   There are no add-on charges.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.520]   What do you get for free?
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.200]   Voice mail.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.400]   Picture and voice messaging.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.760]   Three-way calling.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:04.600]   Call or ID.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.600]   But I know the one you're looking for, and they have.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.160]   Tethering and hotspot included.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.280]   No additional charge.
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.120]   No mysterious line items.
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:15.320]   Unlimited devices on any plan.
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:17.960]   Just $6 a month per handset.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.520]   And you'll like the online--
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:21.400]   this is service for geeks.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.440]   So you'll like the online control panel
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:26.440]   that lets you see exactly what's going on.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.800]   Great support.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:29.160]   Great price.
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:32.480]   And never any early termination for your contracts.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:38.480]   Go to twig.ting.com to save $25 on your first device.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:40.360]   If you want to see what the customer support looks
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:42.000]   like, help.ting.com.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.040]   You'll see the forums, help ticketing system video tutorials,
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.600]   video startup guides, and more.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.920]   You start by picking your device.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:53.800]   And of course, they have lots and lots of devices for you,
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:59.880]   including the note 2, including the S3.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.280]   It's a good Android experience.
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.720]   The Nexus, lots of good choices.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:06.840]   And LTE, because it's riding on the Sprint network.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:09.800]   Very good prices, very good service.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.400]   There's the Optimus G, which is really-- that's the Nexus
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:19.760]   4 with LTE, stuff like that.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:24.720]   Take a look, twig.ting.ing.com.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.800]   I'm not going to show Jeff the price on the Galaxy Note 2.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:30.760]   We'll just pretend he didn't see that.
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.560]   See that?
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:38.320]   Moving right along.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:41.560]   So Google off the hook, according to the FTC,
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.680]   they are not a monopoly.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.440]   It's OK.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.960]   What they're doing with--
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:50.800]   they don't favor their own results in search.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.800]   Some say this wasn't a victory for Google.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:56.640]   There are a few little caveats and requirements.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.140]   Yeah.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:59.240]   I think this is huge victory, don't you, Jeff?
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.680]   I think it's gigantic victory.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.600]   I think it's a really heartening victory
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:07.360]   that they spent a long time, two years looking
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.440]   into supposed violations.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.680]   And in the end, said Google had the right
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:16.360]   to put up direct content on its search results
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:20.440]   and said that there was no harm to consumers in this,
[00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.120]   and that there's no harm to advertisers.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:24.160]   And that's the part that people are
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:26.360]   complaining about actually more.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.480]   And Yelp.
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.680]   Yelp.
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.400]   Well, and Yelp.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.120]   But Google said Yelp, you don't want to be part of it.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:34.320]   They specifically-- there's a specific way now.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:36.040]   They agreed to so that if Yelp doesn't want
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:38.440]   to be scraped for any reviews, they don't have to be.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.360]   I think it's suicidal to Yelp.
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:40.880]   But fine.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.280]   That's what you want, Yelp.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:42.720]   That's fine.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:44.280]   Moved to Belgium and Germany and France.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.600]   And Lesch
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.600]   Stunz should thrat for you.
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:53.360]   The other part of it was the basic patents.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.000]   But that was really more about Motorola's era
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.720]   than Google's era, as I understand it.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:58.880]   And Google said fine.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.320]   We're going to open up all the patents.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.520]   They've dropped some patents.
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.800]   I only wish that we're the beginning of a truce in patents.
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.960]   So I fear-- I'm told it's not.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:10.840]   But it was very clear statement saying to Google
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:13.040]   and the rest that Google was not--
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:15.240]   was helping consumers with what it does
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:17.320]   and that this was not antitrust.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.360]   It was not monopoly.
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:20.880]   And I think it's a big, big victory,
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.880]   not just for Google, but for the net and for innovation.
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:28.000]   And part of the argument was things change so quickly.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.680]   And this is the big revelation from the Microsoft--
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:34.040]   efforts before, of course, is that by the time they got around
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.400]   to finally finishing decrees on Microsoft,
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.880]   Microsoft was already bottom of the heap again.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.880]   And there's all kinds of changes in technology
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.640]   and Google's saying there's all kinds of new markets here
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:48.160]   where we weren't even in them before.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:51.040]   And we're going to fight with everybody else.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:54.120]   And so I'm very happy about this agreement.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:56.200]   And I think it's--
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.840]   what the only thing that pissed me off
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:01.800]   was the Wall Street Journal continues its anti-Google bias
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:04.960]   and acted as if they escaped and barely got off.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.960]   No, the FTC was very clear in saying
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.640]   that Google was not monopolistic
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.320]   and was not violating antitrust in its actions.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.680]   They also said, and Ron Wyden agreed,
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:18.720]   that there is no barrier to entry to getting my search.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:21.160]   I don't know if that's true, is it?
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.160]   Well, but the part of the problem here
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.680]   is that search is yesterday's battle.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.520]   That's not what's happened.
[00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:25.840]   So nobody cares, right?
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.320]   It's the way we've been saying that in this show
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.040]   for two years ourselves since all started.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.240]   That, yeah, so fine, Microsoft went all the time
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.160]   and started Bing.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.320]   OK, what next?
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.080]   Fighting yesterday's battle is foolish.
[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:41.520]   Where now Google says, yeah, yeah, yeah, we got search.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.400]   And, yeah, it's bringing in billions of dollars.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.080]   But what we're really concerned about now is mobile.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:47.560]   And that's where the company's headed.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.000]   What we're really concerned about now
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.280]   is relationships with people, otherwise known as social
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.040]   and data about that, and trying to figure out that stuff.
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:57.560]   So search is an old battle.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:00.560]   Now, this is not to say that they couldn't get zapped in Europe
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.560]   and I could see Europe going two ways.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.880]   Europe could say, oh, well, this could have kind of make us look bad.
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.760]   Or Europe could say, well, the angst
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.160]   won't get their own darn company.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.680]   We're going to show them, which I fear may be the case.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:12.920]   We'll see what happens.
[00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:15.400]   Interesting, too, that Google increased greatly
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:16.720]   at spending on lobbying.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:20.320]   It paid a lot of attention to this.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.960]   Every account said that they treated it very seriously
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:26.040]   and they were walking through the Justice Department.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:29.400]   They did not want to have a Microsoft-like snotty attitude.
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.680]   Schmidt went and paid homage a lot
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.400]   and sat down in conversations with them
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.000]   and they tried to work this out and explained to them
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.640]   the rationale of what they were doing
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:40.120]   and why they were doing it benefit us.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:43.360]   Jeff, do you think this was a misfire on FTC's part?
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:44.920]   I mean, do you think that they--
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:46.400]   They should have done it in the first place.
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.200]   Right, I mean, it almost feels like--
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:49.600]   and of course, I'm reading between the lines here.
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:51.640]   It almost feels like someone got a burr under their saddle.
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.360]   They heard something Google's doing such and such
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.440]   and they're like, I can't believe it.
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:56.200]   Let's go--
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:59.000]   I think it's the other-- I think what happened is Microsoft, Yelp,
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.320]   and other companies-- and there's a pretty long laundry
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.440]   list of companies involved in this--
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.440]   rattled the cage and said, FTC, you've got to look into this.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.360]   In fact, they were very unhappy with the result.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.440]   And it's-- I mean, you could also interpret
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.960]   as any competitive from those guys.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:13.920]   Although, here's one thing that Google did do
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.960]   that they had to change.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.240]   When Yelp went to them at first,
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:19.480]   it said, we don't want Yelp reviews in the places listings.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:20.200]   That's your stuff.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.440]   We don't want to be there.
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.880]   We want people to come to Yelp to find out
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:23.960]   what our Yelp reviews are.
[00:58:23.960 --> 00:58:25.120]   Google said, oh, you could do that,
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.160]   but you've got to take Yelp out of all Google search results.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.880]   And that is kind of any competitive.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.320]   That's using a big stick saying, well, OK,
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:35.160]   but then you can't find Yelp anywhere on the web.
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:38.880]   And part of this decision was, no, and Google has added now
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:41.080]   this feature to take it out of places without taking it off
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:42.240]   of Google search.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:44.120]   Patrick, they've done the same thing in news.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.800]   And so I think that they'll do the same.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:47.920]   No, it's a really good question, Aaron.
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.320]   I think Leo is right.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:52.240]   Microsoft and company spent a lot of money,
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:55.600]   hired a lot of lobbyists, did a lot of advertising,
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:58.520]   created a lot of fake trade organizations
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.480]   to go against Google in this case.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:04.520]   fairsearch.org.
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:09.000]   So the FTC, I guess, had to look into it in one way or another.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.680]   And I thought it was going to go against Google
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.280]   just because that was the mood.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.000]   And that's kind of what Lee Lewis was heading to.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.640]   But I really take my hat off to him
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:20.160]   that they, I think, delivered a very fair decree here.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.320]   Tim Moon from Columbia, who was consulted at the FTC
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:25.520]   for a period during this process,
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.120]   wrote a really good piece, a couple of really good pieces,
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:30.440]   talking about this and saying that, no, they didn't escape
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.560]   or, you know, with their skin, this was a good decision.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.080]   It was a right decision.
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.240]   And I think that's the case.
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:38.680]   In fact, it might have been a pretty surprisingly smart
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:42.320]   decision for them to understand that it wasn't about search
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:43.160]   anymore.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:46.200]   Because, I mean, as you said, the Microsoft prosecution
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.280]   took so long that it was kind of meaningless by the time it
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:50.320]   was done.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.840]   But the FTC wants this competition.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.080]   And we do have competition.
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:57.840]   Again, whatever, where we don't truly is advertising.
[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.320]   Yeah, I can go and find--
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.880]   Well, you know, but even there, there's all kinds of new--
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:02.360]   Oh, no.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:02.880]   There's Google.
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:04.160]   There's Facebook.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.640]   I think--
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.680]   So even there there is.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:09.080]   But Google has more power there than it does anywhere else
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.320]   in terms of its market share.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.640]   It's not a search market share.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.640]   It's an advertising market share that bears more.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.360]   Is it really Google that dominant when you look at Bing
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.560]   and Yahoo and Facebook and Google that they're so much bigger
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.800]   than everybody else?
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.600]   Is that true?
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.400]   There's share they have of online advertising is gigantic.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.280]   But again, there, there's new--
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:29.920]   new innovation.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:33.080]   So there's new real-time marketplaces for buying people
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.200]   as they go around the web that go around Google.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.240]   There's mobile stuff coming up like crazy.
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.880]   So that's another example where even though Google does
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.160]   have incredible power, it's by no means invincible.
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.520]   Google also-- and I think this is a positive result
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:58.120]   of this suit-- said it's not going to use its patents
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.200]   to stop competitors.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.200]   Well, this was-- yeah, I mean, this
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.240]   was one of the stipulations of the agreement, right?
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.120]   So Google Motorola said that they'd stop--
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.480]   the stipulation was that they will see seeking product
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.200]   bans for standards, essential patent infringement,
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:14.320]   that they resolve those disputes in arbitration and not
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.160]   in court.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.560]   So it was part of this agreement, which is a good thing.
[01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:18.440]   Right.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:19.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:19.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:23.760]   So that's also-- so there's good outcomes to this.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.880]   In other words, I don't think the FTC did anything wrong.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:31.240]   They investigated, and they got some concessions from Google
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.520]   that are good all around.
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.720]   I think that this probably was something
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:36.560]   that needed to be done.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.060]   Yeah.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:38.200]   Although Google is the one who says
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.640]   that they don't use patents offensively.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.040]   But this was for Google Motorola.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.320]   That was Motorola, right?
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:44.820]   Right.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:46.360]   That was about Motorola, exactly.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:47.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:48.440]   It's lawsuits by proxy.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:54.040]   What else?
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.360]   Where should we-- you put so many stories in here, Aaron.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.880]   I don't know where to go next.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.160]   I don't know.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.200]   Who's been jamming our rundown with stories?
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.240]   There's about a million things to talk about.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.800]   Here, this is crazy.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.960]   Here, you got Eric--
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:07.920]   there's going to be a choice here.
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:10.520]   Eric Schmidt in North Korea, Brad
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.800]   Feld talking about Google+, as the long game,
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.720]   Google creating free Wi-Fi in Chelsea.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:19.400]   I love that, boy.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.840]   That's New York City.
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:21.880]   Yep, that's New York City.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.480]   Is this the next stage in the Google fiber rollout?
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.600]   Is Google going to put internet everywhere?
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.720]   They did a press conference with Bloomberg.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.040]   But again, I was at an event last night
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:39.240]   with Susan Crawford's book, Captive Audience, give it a plug.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:43.480]   And she warns not to get too happy about free Wi-Fi.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.920]   The only thing that's going to work is fiber to the--
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.760]   Right.
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:49.760]   That's all that really matters.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.360]   But nonetheless, let's take it.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:54.520]   And I think it's a great thing.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.160]   But of course, that's the neighborhood in New York
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.440]   where Google is in Chelsea.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.200]   They're on 8th Avenue.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.320]   Oh, OK.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:02.000]   So they're just being a good neighbor.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.840]   They're being a good neighbor.
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:07.480]   And I forget the number of 200,000 residents around.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.280]   And I don't know how good it will be in your house.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:15.040]   But what it also means is that Chelsea is Google's campus.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.760]   So if you're at Google, out and around the same way
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.480]   you are in Mountain View, you're going to-- there's free Wi-Fi.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.760]   What I love when I go visit Mountain View is there's
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.440]   no restrictions.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.280]   There's no signing in.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.080]   There's no agreeing.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.560]   They figure it just on the Wi-Fi.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.800]   Thank you very much, Google.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.000]   And that they've done the same thing in their Chelsea campus,
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.240]   kind of.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.520]   And what Brad's writing about is the brilliant long game
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.120]   of Google Plus is really just a special example
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.200]   of what others have written about, which
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.320]   is that--
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:43.560]   others have said, for instance, that Google's a Trojan horse on iOS.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.400]   And we've all observed that we're not using Apple apps on iOS
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.120]   anymore.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.920]   In many cases, we're using Google Maps, Google Calendar,
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:57.040]   Google address book, and not using the Apple applications.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:03.080]   And he points out, Brad points out that he lives in Gmail.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:04.120]   I do too.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:05.000]   We all do, I think.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.400]   Google voices his phone number.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.480]   Me too.
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.920]   He says, Google, hang out.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.120]   It's my new calendar invite.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.880]   I haven't gotten to that point yet.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.440]   Yeah, that's why I break from this.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:13.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.600]   I don't understand that at all, in fact.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.480]   But I don't invite anybody to anything anyway.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.360]   Communities has been big for us.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.320]   Jeff set up a twig community that is really
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.600]   the best community we've got, much better than our own communities.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.600]   They're really good and taken off.
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:32.960]   I need to be more often too, because we've got to--
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.960]   because if we use those communities,
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.880]   also get story ideas and things like that.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.040]   Folks are a lot of things.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.600]   I always forget to put up the replay in the show.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:42.520]   And one of the users just puts it up every week.
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.160]   Thank you very much.
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.160]   It's great.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:50.880]   How is-- I guess I could just search for it in plus.google.com.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.680]   I'm a member, so I'm probably not getting the same result
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.400]   as a normal person.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.280]   Or go to communities and then search from there.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:01.640]   So go to communities first and then search.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.640]   And then you can search.
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:04.480]   Or you can see your community is and you can search.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.040]   Right.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.480]   Right.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:08.640]   Yeah, I need to be more involved here as well.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:12.240]   We've got 2,871 members.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:12.760]   That's great.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:13.480]   That's great.
[01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:14.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:15.480]   It really is.
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:18.760]   And Jeff, you haven't set up any discussions, have you?
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.840]   Have it, because I don't know what I should do there.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.640]   Because in one sense, it's nice to have one discussion.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.640]   Some people are coming after me saying,
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:26.240]   well, you should set up different discussions.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.560]   I don't know.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.600]   The idea of discussions make it kind of look
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.080]   like an online forum where you have--
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.440]   I think we'd have to do that if we wanted story suggestions.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.120]   For instance, you'd have a discussion group that says
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.520]   story suggestions.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.800]   You might even have a subgroup or a group that
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.280]   says story suggestions for the week of.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.800]   I don't know how you would do it.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.440]   I think you want some standard across the Twit network.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.400]   And Lisa had a bear as a moderator.
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.720]   So I think that if he came along and said, listen,
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:57.600]   we ought to have this standard discussion in every Twit show,
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.240]   so that one of your producers comes in,
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.440]   knows where to walk.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:02.240]   I don't think bears would kind of do that.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.280]   Maybe Glenn will do that.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.640]   We'll figure that out.
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:10.760]   See, my initial reaction was that 1,000 flowers bloom.
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:14.040]   Each host and each producer do whatever they want with their show
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.560]   and have it be organic.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:17.840]   I don't know if we need it.
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.840]   I don't know what to say.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.160]   What's the Twit standard for discussion groups?
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:21.720]   I don't think that.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.880]   I think every show should do what they want to do.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.120]   It's boss.
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:25.760]   Don't you?
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:26.600]   That's great.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.840]   Because different things work for different shows.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.880]   I mean, like, for example, for TNT, Reddit
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.880]   seems to be working pretty well, where people can vote on stories
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.800]   and come up to the top.
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.280]   Yeah, they're using a subreddit that works great.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:37.800]   Yep.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.080]   In fact, I wanted to do that.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:43.560]   And that's never got around to it.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:47.520]   Anyway, Brad, I think saying that the Google long game is brilliant.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.920]   I'm not sure brilliance are right word,
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.640]   but it's clear they are playing the long game
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.920]   and they are there and it seems to be working for them.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.760]   Right.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.080]   Nobody's given them credit to think
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.880]   that there's actually something here and what--
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.560]   they're sticking to it.
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.440]   There was another piece in the Atlanta today that said,
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.080]   listen, Google kills the things that don't work.
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:07.080]   And ain't killing Google+, and is only growing.
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:11.200]   And I won't steal my number this time because I've run out of numbers.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.000]   But when we get to the end of the show,
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.120]   we're talking about how news sites are using Google+,
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:17.040]   and surprisingly good ways.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:17.960]   There's a lot there.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.440]   And I really enjoyed doing it.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.800]   I did a post this last week, Amanda Palmer,
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.120]   who I'd like to have on the show, by the way.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:23.640]   Deal.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.080]   Amanda Palmer.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.040]   Yes.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:26.120]   She's just great.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.760]   I did an economist event with her, and she's wonderful.
[01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.760]   And I loved her blog post.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.280]   It was just amazing.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.640]   And I wrote about that, too.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:39.160]   And it was fascinating to see what happened to the conversation.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.280]   So I put the same post just to see what happened on my blog,
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:47.200]   on Google+, on Medium, which is Ev's new thing, and on Huffington
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.200]   Post.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:52.640]   And apart from it, suddenly getting spammed badly.
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:56.400]   300 posts I had to take out with odd South Asian names.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.880]   Say, yeah, yeah, pretty.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:02.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:06.320]   You know, on this horribly, it's about a teenager's suicide.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.200]   It's an awful thing to have to go through and see people
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.160]   so off key.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:13.760]   But for that, discussion on 100 posts on Google+,
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.440]   was really good.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.400]   The discussion on Amanda's blog, by the way,
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:18.560]   is unbelievable.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.280]   Just unbelievable.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.720]   It's three parts now.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.880]   She started with on-internet hatred.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.000]   And it was about bullying, and it's very powerful,
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.640]   and about her experience, and of course,
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.520]   about this sad story of the teenager
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:36.240]   who committed suicide after making a YouTube video about being
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.000]   bullied online.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.320]   It was just wrenching, gut wrenching.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.040]   Really, really is.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.560]   I couldn't watch the video.
[01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:46.720]   I know.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.880]   I did, and it was absolutely wrenching.
[01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:52.960]   And somebody, one person gave me hell in Google+,
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:57.760]   that I've been waiting for the moment to write about that time.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.240]   When you see on Twitter, somebody disagrees with somebody
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:00.740]   else.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:03.640]   And somebody else comes in on Twitter and says, fight, fight.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.840]   And it really has upset me.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.640]   And I was waiting for that moment to see it again,
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.920]   because I want to say, we're making the internet--
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.920]   we're getting the internet that we build.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.960]   And is this the internet you really want to build?
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:14.840]   That's what you're working.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.560]   Every time you do that, every time you point to something
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.280]   and encourage it, you're going to get more of it.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.040]   And every time you don't discourage it,
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.480]   when you know somebody's giving ad hominem attack
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:25.400]   to someone who doesn't--
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:29.560]   has no need to suffer it, then you're also allowing
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:30.360]   it and encouraging it.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.500]   And it's time we've got to rethink the internet we're
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.940]   building and the society that we're building here.
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:36.140]   So I wanted to write about that, too.
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:37.540]   She wanted to write about that, because she
[01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.980]   had a bunch of controversy in how she did her last tour
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:41.060]   of musicians.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.380]   So she started to search on Amanda and hate,
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:46.060]   because in her own name, Tumblr, what she found instead
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:49.180]   was this gut-wrenching, horrible story, this teenager, who
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:53.260]   just had fallen deeper and deeper into bullying
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:55.180]   in school after school after school.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:58.420]   And neither of us was trying to make any comparison of ourselves
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:09:59.740]   to that, not by any means.
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:01.660]   But we were coming along and trying to talk about it in this way.
[01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:05.680]   And then we just saw this doorway to a society
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.540]   that we don't want in this world.
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:09.040]   And it's up to us.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.280]   You find in England right now, the government
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.340]   has arrested people for tweets, because they're
[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:19.040]   mean or nasty, for example, burning a poppy,
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.600]   protesting soldiers.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.200]   In France, you have a government minister
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:26.080]   who's coming after Twitter and saying that Twitter should
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:30.240]   cooperate with efforts to ban negative speech.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.120]   Glenn Rerol worked a great piece about this.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.280]   And I remember I was going to say, Glenn, somebody else.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:36.960]   I agree very much that that's very dangerous for government
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:37.920]   to get into this.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.320]   That's government-affecting speech.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.120]   And by the way, it's not government's role.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:41.640]   It's our role.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.680]   It's our society.
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:45.400]   And if we don't do something about this,
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:47.880]   then we're going to keep on getting more of what
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:51.240]   we encourage in the infantile early stages of the net.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:52.600]   And I'll take full responsibility.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.280]   I've been involved in some nastiness.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.080]   I've said things.
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.880]   I regret it now.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:01.960]   When I said in my post, when the subject leaves the class,
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.320]   and we all start doing spitballs,
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.200]   that's what the hit was like early on.
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:06.400]   But it's not now.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.400]   We've got to build the society of ours.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.800]   So sorry for my--
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:10.800]   No, we all said.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.000]   And it's something needs to be said.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.280]   And Rita Mandepalmer's blog post started the first one
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.640]   and go through the three.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.880]   What's the name of your blog post about this, Jeff?
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:24.520]   We get the net and society we build.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.360]   Cool.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:25.920]   True.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.280]   It's 12.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:29.520]   By the way, I got a lot of response on Medium, which is,
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.120]   and is Ed Williams--
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.400]   Oh, interesting.
[01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:36.480]   Really, really elegant, wonderful interface for brain
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:36.980]   stuff.
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:38.680]   And you just put this stuff in there.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.200]   When you mark the word, you have five choices above,
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:42.320]   easy to put a photo in.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.480]   The size is automatically.
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:44.440]   It's elegant and beautiful.
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:45.360]   Has no comments yet.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.840]   They're going to add that.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.040]   Ed hired my ex-agent, Kate Lee, who's wonderful to be the head
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.120]   of content for it.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.160]   But I just saw a lot-- even though there's no comments,
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.920]   I saw a lot of people noticing it on Medium
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:57.720]   and coming across on Twitter, marking it.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.800]   It's a beautiful platform.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:04.120]   So currently, you have to request an invitation
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.560]   to post content there.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.080]   Oh, yeah, for a bit.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.680]   And you post content as basically as an article?
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.160]   If you go to scroll down, you'll see mine.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:16.960]   This one looks like, I think, on the right, not there anymore.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.360]   [HONKING]
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:21.360]   It's really, really kind of--
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.160]   There it is.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.160]   [HONKING]
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.640]   Yeah, we get the net in society.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.000]   We build--
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.440]   Beautiful, simple interface.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.960]   He's kind of doing a long-form tumbler, a tumbler for words,
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.800]   maybe.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.480]   Also, hired somebody to be in charge of content.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.720]   He's trying to bring in quality content.
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:42.320]   And try to raise it up A. And then B,
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.600]   because there's collections in there.
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.320]   That piece is in a kind of just an op-hich.
[01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.320]   I am H-O.
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.120]   I want to press on what I contributed to with a chapter
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.480]   from my book.
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:56.560]   And so there's a collab--
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.880]   not in the individual pieces, but in the idea of collecting
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.080]   things.
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.600]   Oh, this is great.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:03.280]   It's quite nice.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.720]   He's making a magazine.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:09.240]   And as Heph's want, he's getting all you guys to do the work.
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:09.920]   Of course.
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:13.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:16.120]   Philip Kaplan-Pudd, who created the F'd company once told me,
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.920]   said, the best kind of internet companies,
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:19.600]   one where everybody else does the content,
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.360]   you just sit there and collect the money.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:24.600]   True.
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.400]   Best in terms of revenue.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.560]   You have for best for him.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:27.920]   Right.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:32.120]   Although I like this medium, well, maybe they'll let me write
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.640]   something for them.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.040]   I could not believe the use of hashtags at CES
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.280]   is so out of control.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.480]   You'd go to a booth.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.760]   And the first thing they'd say is tweet this, tweet this,
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:43.480]   use the hashtag, Ford or whatever.
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:44.480]   And it was like--
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:47.120]   I would last about five minutes.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.480]   At the International Academy of Television on the web awards,
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:52.800]   you got to have a hashtag.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.360]   I felt like, god, I'm--
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:57.200]   even Seinfeld has a hashtag retro--
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.960]   I'm going to call it a retro tag.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.160]   Why don't we have a hashtag twit here?
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.800]   Because I think it's stupid.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.880]   That's why.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:12.440]   Even Newsweek, its last issue of the year, the last print issue,
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.640]   the last time they had an issue in print,
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.960]   right in the front, the cover, last print issue.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:19.360]   Mm.
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.120]   It's out of control.
[01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.320]   This is why I do a show on your network, Leo.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:24.160]   I am not going to do that.
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:24.840]   You and me.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:25.360]   You and me.
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.760]   We were in the same page.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.400]   OK, well, tell me why.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.320]   I think it's stupid, but why?
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:35.360]   Why is it stupid?
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.960]   Yeah, I wouldn't have lasted five minutes to see, yes,
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.400]   if people are yelling, tweet using a hashtag.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.560]   Every single booth.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:43.720]   Why is it stupid?
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:44.560]   Why is it stupid?
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.000]   Well, because if you want to talk about something,
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:46.840]   you'll talk about it.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:47.880]   And people find it.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:52.440]   It just feels so crazy, self-promotional.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.960]   It actually doesn't bother me on TV shows.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.760]   When you have the watermark in the bottom,
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.960]   I actually don't mind that.
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.560]   It's like, OK, I'll see what people are saying about this.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.680]   But yeah, tweet doesn't need that.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.000]   People are already talking about tweet.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.920]   Yeah, well, let's you have the conversation
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:09.240]   you want with the hashtag you choose, the hashtag of your choice.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:11.800]   I bring it up because the American dialect society
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.840]   has declared that 2012, the word of the year 2012,
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:22.360]   was hashtag, beating out YOLO, fiscal cliff, and gangnam style.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:25.440]   I wonder if Chris Messina popped a bottle of champagne.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:27.000]   He invented the hashtag.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.440]   That had the term, didn't he?
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.600]   And there was a baby named hashtag last year, right?
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:34.560]   That poor kid.
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.760]   No, no, not one of the Romney kids.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:43.000]   Look up Richard Jingress on Google+ G-I-N-G-R-S.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.360]   He's the head of Google News.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.720]   He ate a couple pictures down.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.960]   He burned a hashtag on the beach for new years.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:54.000]   Is it the hashtag backlash?
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.160]   Fire of the hashtags.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.560]   That's a good hashtag, hashtag backlash.
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.560]   No.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:02.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:07.000]   I guess it's so damn self-promotional that it bothers me.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.280]   And it's your right, it's attempt to mold the conversation
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:15.000]   instead of letting people have their own thought.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.520]   I mean, we all do some self-promotion.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:20.400]   It just feels like just let your audience talk about your product,
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.520]   the way they want to talk about it.
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:23.320]   Right.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.880]   But it's a hint.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:28.240]   Here's a helpful serving suggestion.
[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:31.200]   Use the hashtag twig.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.120]   See, you know what?
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:36.160]   Mostly it's because I have a constitutional aversion
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.400]   to marketing of any kind.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.120]   Anyway, it doesn't bother me if someone's trying
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.880]   to start a movement on Twitter and says, you know, you have--
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:44.120]   Arab Spring or whatever.
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:44.620]   Yeah.
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:45.120]   Right.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:45.640]   Or where is Square?
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:46.320]   That makes sense.
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.320]   That makes sense.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:51.000]   But yeah, that's a lot different than CES booth babe.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.160]   Were there booth babes at CES?
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:53.560]   Oh, yes.
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:57.960]   Oh, this sounds like my personal hell.
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:58.480]   I don't know.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:01.440]   You should have seen some of these booth babes.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.680]   It's funny.
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:07.200]   I had to get there early on Tuesday at the show opens at 10.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.640]   But I had to get there at 9, because we had to meet somebody.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:14.600]   And that's when all the women, the young, attractive, high-heeled,
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.680]   short-scirted, heavily made up--
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.600]   Good work.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.720]   --heavily-coft women arrive.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.360]   And I was watching.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.280]   And so these beautiful women all show up.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:26.360]   And then their coordinator, who's also an invariably
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:31.400]   another woman, an older, high-heeled, mini-scirted, well-coft
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:36.280]   made up woman, gives them their uniforms, the mini-scirts,
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.160]   hands them out.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.480]   So they all look the same, right?
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.040]   Because then now you know you're with booth hashtag.
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.040]   FEMBOTS.
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.280]   FEMBOTS.
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.800]   Yeah, they look like FEMBOTS.
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:45.800]   Totally.
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.320]   Totally.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.120]   And it's so retro.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:50.040]   There was a time briefly when this was not done, right?
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.840]   And now it's back in spades.
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.040]   But something's the same with Vegas.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:57.160]   Remember Vegas was supposed to be a family place for a while?
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:17:57.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.800]   And now we were staying at the Rio.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.600]   They've got a topless pool.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.120]   They've got go-go dancers.
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.120]   And you entered the door.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:09.000]   The first time I went to Vegas and saw a stripper
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.080]   in the lobby of the hotel, which I was just like, whoa.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.640]   I want to buy her a sandwich and wrap her in a blanket.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.800]   Like that was mine.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.640]   That was mine.
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:19.000]   Like, can we get her a hero?
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.840]   Is there a meatball hero nearby?
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:24.200]   Let's sit her down and feed her and talk to her about her life
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:24.680]   choices.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:27.120]   Sorry, no judgment.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.200]   No, it's not a judgment.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.440]   It's just-- it seems--
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.480]   I don't know.
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:35.080]   It's not the tech community that we wanted to build, is it?
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.080]   No.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.640]   That's the problem with Vegas.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:39.760]   I always tell foreigners that you haven't seen how low
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.600]   America can go until you go to Vegas.
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.720]   You know what's sad?
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:45.720]   We see a lot of people visiting from Australia and Scandinavia
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:46.760]   and all over the world.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:47.960]   They come to the brick house.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:49.960]   And invariably they go to Vegas.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.400]   It's like you can't come to America without visiting Vegas.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.920]   And for the first time I met a couple visiting from overseas
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.360]   who I said, are you going to Vegas?
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.640]   I said, no, we're going to Napa.
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.400]   Oh, nice.
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:04.400]   We host Japanese students occasionally.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.040]   Well, two or three a year, we host for a week or so at a time.
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:09.560]   And without all of them, without fail, have been to Vegas.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.600]   They usually go to Vegas first, and then they come to see us,
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.680]   and they're like bored out of their mind, right?
[01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:15.680]   Yeah, they think America-- I think they think America is
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.000]   Vegas.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.240]   And you know what?
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.600]   They might be right.
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.080]   That's the depressing thing.
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:20.720]   That's open.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:22.080]   I can't wait to get out of there.
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:24.320]   Every time I go there, it's like, huh, huh, huh.
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:28.120]   Two days was all I could take this year.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.720]   But it's the-- and the reason the CES is they're probably
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:33.160]   because there's an infinite supply of booth babes,
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.760]   but also because as they say, it's the only place big enough.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:39.640]   And in fact, CES, despite everything I've said negative
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.120]   about it, it was bigger than ever this year.
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:43.680]   150,000 people, they had to expand into the Venetian
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:48.680]   as well as Las Vegas Convention Center, which itself is massive.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.120]   Massive.
[01:19:49.120 --> 01:19:55.120]   I think we should take a break and come back with our tool tip
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:58.160]   and number.
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.920]   Before Chef's loses, it's the last one.
[01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.480]   What I stock them up.
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.520]   I hoard numbers.
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:08.000]   It shouldn't be hard.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.040]   You know, it's weird.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.000]   It's week to week.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.360]   Sometimes it's as easy as pie.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:13.440]   And sometimes there's just no numbers to be had.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:14.720]   It's like that for tips too.
[01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:17.280]   Some weeks are too many.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.640]   And then others, it's like I'm scrambling right before the show.
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:20.640]   Yes.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:22.000]   There's one story I'd like to have.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:22.360]   OK.
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:22.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:22.800]   OK.
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.840]   I'll give you each chance to pick one story
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.320]   that we haven't mentioned.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:31.640]   So Target is going to match Amazon's prices now for online.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:32.000]   Yes.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:32.880]   Right?
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:36.360]   They don't want to be Amazon's showroom anymore.
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.120]   So what should I go ahead and buy it?
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.560]   What does that do to Target?
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:44.160]   It's good for Target, right?
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:44.760]   No.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.920]   I think it is because then you don't leave the store.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:47.420]   Right?
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:49.600]   I mean, the longer they can keep people in the store buying
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:51.400]   their stuff, even if they have to give them a little bit of a discount,
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.440]   they're going to buy toilet paper and paper towels
[01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.240]   and all this other stuff while they're there.
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:57.720]   I mean, the problem right now is that people go to Target
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:20:59.720]   and they say, show me your TVs, which one do you like?
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:02.720]   Well, I'm not going to go buy it on Amazon.
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.240]   Showrooming.
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:07.520]   On their Amazon thing, which is what I do in the bookstore.
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:11.160]   But there's an obvious impact on profitability.
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:16.960]   And second, and this is on TV as they were doing the report,
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.960]   you know the Target has always given you two prices.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:22.960]   So there's the price on the shelf.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.640]   There's your phone along as long as you make them look.
[01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.040]   So now you've got to go to this effort.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.840]   It's like going back to the days of Hagling almost,
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:33.240]   except that Amazon is your haggle mate.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:39.960]   It just seems that the local retail, in person retail, is screwed.
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.360]   Well, it is giving in, isn't it?
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.520]   Yeah, it really is.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:45.000]   I think it was a big story.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.480]   And we're--
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.360]   And the Amazon pickup box is, right?
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:49.720]   That's another one that's interesting.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.480]   I just saw my first one kind of in person
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:53.400]   where it was like a like Radio Shack or something,
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:55.520]   where you could locker, is that what it's called?
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.480]   When you can order stuff and they deliver it to the store,
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.760]   you pick it up there.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.280]   I was kind of like, oh, it felt a little sad.
[01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:04.560]   I was like, oh, this is too bad for this retailer.
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.120]   They're really hoping I'll buy something
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:09.080]   while I'm here to pick up my stuff that I bought elsewhere.
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:15.800]   You know, I've worked in Manhattan for many, many, many, many, many, many years now.
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.560]   And I used to go out when I was bored or angry and wander around.
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:26.240]   And I would hit the store and the record store and the electronic store and--
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:26.760]   Oh, God.
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.880]   There's no such thing as browsing in real life anymore.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.920]   It's just not there.
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:36.440]   So I just found that I found a story to be a big deal about the impact of the internet.
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:41.760]   Beyond robots, beyond replacing things, you know, jobs with computers,
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:47.200]   it's about the impact of transparency, communication, and data on an entire economy
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:47.840]   of retail.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.400]   I think that was a big moment.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:49.920]   So that's why--
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.600]   Well, inevitably, if Target does it, it means all the other big retailers
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.640]   will have to follow suit.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:58.280]   So the way it works, if a customer buys a qualifying item--
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.240]   well, I'm not sure what that means-- that target--
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:03.600]   and then finds an identical item for less than the following week's Target circular
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:09.360]   or within seven days on Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Best Buy.com, and ToysRUs.com,
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.440]   Target will match the price.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.240]   I think they can do that a little bit with impunity
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:14.520]   because it's kind of a pain in the ass.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:15.520]   Right.
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.040]   Right.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:16.920]   That's what I think, too.
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:19.440]   I mean, that's why stores offer the price matching things so much, right?
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:19.940]   Right.
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:20.680]   Because nobody ever does it.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.360]   Makes you feel good.
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:21.960]   Makes you feel good.
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.160]   It's a pure psychological thing.
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:26.400]   I'm sure we had Dan Airelli on last week on "Tranulation"
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:28.600]   from the author, Predictably Irrational.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.360]   He is an economic psychologist.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:34.280]   And I'm sure he would say the reason that you can do that
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:35.920]   is because nobody ever does it.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:39.280]   But psychologically, it gives you the feeling, oh, I know I'm getting a good price.
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:39.780]   Exactly.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:42.400]   Yeah, so you would purchase something, bring it home, check the circular,
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.840]   and then-- or check Amazon, and then bring it back to Target
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.040]   and get refunded the difference?
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:46.720]   Yes.
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.600]   Yeah, no one's going to do that.
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.680]   Spoken as a busy mom.
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:53.000]   Oh, yeah, that's not happening.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.560]   It's not happening.
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.280]   You say, I know this is cheaper on Amazon.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.640]   They look it up for you right then and there,
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.440]   and they give you the other price.
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:01.440]   It does--
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:03.960]   The details are yet to come.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.080]   But that was--
[01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:08.120]   Yeah, maybe you see-- so unless they really lied to their teeth,
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:09.480]   they show the guy coming in.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:13.200]   He picks a camera and a something and a toy and a something.
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.320]   And he marches up front and says, he shows us--
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.520]   he's checking his phone and says, I know what the real price is on Amazon.
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.080]   He goes up front and says, we'll be giving him the price.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:21.280]   And they say, let me look him up.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:24.080]   They give him that price.
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:26.280]   I think that's the local television news
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.760]   making up their idea of what will happen.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.760]   I don't think that's how it's going to work.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:31.720]   Maybe--
[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:33.040]   Do you see network?
[01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:35.320]   Oh, well, they're impeccable.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:42.800]   You agree with the verge that the Amazon is the only unstoppable
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:45.480]   monster in tech today?
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:46.440]   I disagree.
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:48.160]   You know who's the unstoppable monster?
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:48.920]   Just ask Apple.
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:50.520]   It's Samsung.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:53.120]   What is Apple's price now?
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:56.080]   It dropped almost 200 points in the last two months.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:02.000]   Samsung announced its biggest earnings ever in 2012.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.920]   It's-- I was watching the CNBC Squawk box.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.560]   Jim Kramer said Samsung is the new Apple.
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.600]   Interesting.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:15.120]   And Samsung is putting on its own operating system on phones next?
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:15.880]   Tizen.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.000]   Actually, you know what it is.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.520]   And you'd be equipped to talk about this, Aaron.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.800]   It's Linux.
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:26.400]   Now, of course, Android's Linux with a Java-Talvik on top.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:27.360]   But this is not that.
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:30.760]   This is just Ubuntu's phone or Firefox's operating system.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:33.080]   Well, Ubuntu phone, that's what I wanted to talk about.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:36.240]   Real quick, just on the Tizen thing, I mean, that's HTML5.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.440]   That's what Tizen's all about.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:39.920]   So Tizen is running HTML5 apps on the phone.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:41.000]   On top of a Linux operating system.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.400]   On top of a Linux operating system.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:42.920]   So that's--
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:43.880]   And it's true Linux.
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:44.760]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:47.440]   And that's really what I think Samsung is pushing
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.560]   and wants to push is, hey, just run an HTML5 everywhere.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.240]   Now, we'll see if it goes anywhere.
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.680]   Now, the real question is, are they doing this in addition
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.680]   to Android or is this a response to Google?
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.280]   And they would like to be out from under Google's thumb
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.800]   and want to do something different.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:02.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.400]   I think they're hedging their bets.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.760]   I think they're hedging their bets.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.680]   I think they-- well, and I think it helps them
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.000]   because they are not--
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.240]   it gives Google less control.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.840]   It's going to say it gives them more control.
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:13.320]   It really doesn't.
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:14.320]   It gives Google less control.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.160]   If everybody's writing HTML5 apps,
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.280]   they can do whatever they want.
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:18.920]   And Google doesn't have the purse strings.
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:21.280]   I think Amazon makes so much money on Android.
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:22.840]   And it costs them nothing.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:27.080]   Whatever minimal restrictions Google places on what they do,
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:27.800]   it's worth it.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:28.760]   I think so, too.
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:29.520]   I think so, too.
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.520]   But did you see this Ubuntu phone, though?
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.400]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:34.600]   At CES, there's a video of it in the rundown.
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.800]   They actually showed it last year as well,
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.560]   but closer to fruitioning.
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:39.240]   Right, right.
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.360]   This is actually--
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:41.600]   I'll look at the video up here.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:42.760]   Yeah, it's actually pretty cool.
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:45.120]   So Ubuntu's been running on tablets.
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:49.240]   In fact, they run on Nexus 7, have been for a little while
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:50.080]   now, a few months.
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.920]   They've been starting to show that kind of stuff.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.120]   But they actually had a phone, and it
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.480]   looks like a Galaxy Nexus to me in the video.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:57.200]   I think it is, yeah.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.280]   And they're running their own operating system on it.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:00.920]   And--
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:01.800]   This is one of the names I've made.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:02.720]   You can cut the audio.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.320]   We don't need the audio, just the video, yeah.
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:07.000]   That's Mark Shuttleworth there, demonstrating it.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:08.400]   What I like about it is-- I mean, they've
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.120]   done some actually some pretty cool things.
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.680]   It looks like Windows Mobile.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.560]   It looks a little bit like Windows Mobile.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.560]   They've got menus on the sides of the device.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:18.880]   Every all four sides swipe in.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.840]   Now, the really cool thing here, and where
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:22.800]   they're taking advantage of their position
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.840]   in the Linux desktop space is--
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.560]   I think Mark says this at the end of the video-- is,
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:30.240]   I take the phone home, I dock it, or put it on some sort of device,
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:32.240]   and my phone changes.
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:33.960]   The display goes over to my big screen,
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:37.600]   and it becomes my Linux desktop from the same device.
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.560]   So you've got this mobile experience on the phone.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:41.520]   But then when you go back and you've got a big screen,
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.720]   then you've got the Ubuntu desktop experience.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:47.320]   Now, he didn't show that, but he talks about that's
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.720]   what they want to do, is they want to take this so that you just
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:50.800]   have this one device.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.240]   You've got to monitor at home.
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:53.960]   You've got this phone on the road,
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.400]   and when you get home, you lay the phone on a pad or something.
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.160]   And all of a sudden, you're a Ubuntu desktop comes up.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.440]   All your data's there.
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.080]   Everything's connected.
[01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.360]   I don't see that as compelling.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:05.240]   In fact, ASUS and others have done that with a transformer
[01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.400]   and didn't take off.
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:08.800]   But-- and you could do that right now,
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:11.000]   if you just got the right dock with almost any Android phone.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.760]   But I do think this is actually a beautiful UI.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.360]   It is.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:14.560]   I actually--
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:15.560]   They've done a lot of good work on it.
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:17.440]   I think this actually looks pretty darn good.
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:17.800]   Yep.
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:18.080]   It does.
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.160]   It has the boxes and the big typography of Windows mobile.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:23.400]   But it does-- it looks quite nice, actually.
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:23.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:27.920]   It's very Windows-foam-ish, but it's very not Android or iPhone-ish.
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:28.440]   Right.
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:28.940]   Yeah.
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:29.440]   Right.
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:29.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.160]   I wish Mark would learn that if he's showing a phone,
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:33.640]   he shouldn't shake his-- move his hands around somewhat.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:34.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.760]   It's making me queasy.
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:36.720]   Interesting.
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:38.120]   I thought it was really interesting.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:39.520]   Aaron, what are the apps on there?
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:42.360]   The Gmail app and the Facebook app are those--
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:44.200]   those are Android apps.
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.040]   They're HTML5.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.120]   What are they?
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:49.000]   I think they are probably HTML5.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:49.560]   You're probably right.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.680]   Because I think that what they've done is they've taken--
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:53.100]   they've started to-- you're about to start
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:55.800]   to deploy these apps on the desktop,
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:00.680]   as opposed to just running the web version, for example.
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.800]   And I think that they've basically taken that
[01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:03.960]   and put it into the phone.
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:05.240]   So they're creating their own apps.
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:07.520]   I'm sure they're all probably HTML5.
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.680]   So--
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:10.160]   it's really quite beautiful.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.080]   I thought it was pretty interesting.
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:12.960]   I was impressed.
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:14.640]   I thought-- I was like, oh, yeah.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.080]   We'll see a really tiny desktop.
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:16.560]   And then--
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.960]   But you know, demoing it.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.520]   And I was like, wow, that actually looks pretty good.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:24.120]   Oh, I saw phones as a lot of people have learned before.
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.120]   It's not easy.
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.760]   You have to make deals with carriers.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:27.760]   This, on the other hand, I could
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:31.600]   see being distributed as a patch to your existing--
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.280]   Right.
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:33.920]   Yeah, Galaxy or Samsung phone.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:34.920]   Right.
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.800]   This is almost like a ROM, a custom ROM.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:37.800]   Yes, exactly.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.120]   That I'd be very interested.
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:42.840]   In fact, I'd probably use it right away.
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:44.920]   Of course, now, if you lose all your Android apps,
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:47.280]   maybe that's not an ideal situation.
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.240]   You'll be able to run them side by side.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:49.600]   Should you?
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:50.360]   You've got enough space.
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:51.760]   Could you put Dalvik on here?
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:54.560]   Yeah, you could run both.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.200]   Says James, Betty.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.000]   What's then how?
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:58.960]   Not at the same time.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.320]   But I mean, you'd have to switch back and forth.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.160]   Oh, no, no.
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:01.720]   I want to run them off.
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.200]   You want to run up the same time?
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:04.720]   Yeah, so I was going to say it would be like,
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:07.800]   the Dalvik one time, kind of on top of--
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.160]   Yeah, that would be complicated.
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.080]   Very complicated.
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:12.480]   Maybe with Bluestacks.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:13.600]   Maybe Bluestacks could do it.
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.640]   So Bluestacks is that emulator that
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:19.640]   lets you put Android apps on Windows Phone and other devices,
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:19.880]   right?
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.800]   Yeah, Windows desktop.
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.800]   I've run it on my Windows desktop before.
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:26.040]   I logged in, and all my apps came up,
[01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:28.720]   and I was playing Fruit Ninja on Windows.
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:30.360]   It's an Android app player, in fact.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.680]   So if you've got Bluestacks running on Ubuntu phone,
[01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:39.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.280]   Yeah, Bluestacks is interesting.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:43.480]   I'm not sure what their end game is.
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:46.080]   But they're definitely doing some interesting things,
[01:30:46.080 --> 01:30:49.960]   porting Android apps to other platforms.
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:51.240]   Anything else you want to talk about?
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:56.520]   Firefox 18 ships today with a 25% faster, just in time,
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.080]   JavaScript engine.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:01.720]   I want to mention quickly this Google Play Store hitting
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:04.240]   a 1 million apps that might beat Apple.
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:04.740]   Meet it.
[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:06.920]   So the Google Play Store might beat the Apple App Store
[01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:09.640]   to 1 million apps, which is crazy,
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:11.640]   because I realize we've been around for a while,
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.480]   we being twig.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:15.200]   But it just seems like just yesterday,
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:17.240]   we were talking about how there were just so few apps
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:20.080]   in the Play Store, they really needed to beef those up.
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:21.200]   And it's so different now.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.880]   And I think these numbers are getting an app accepted
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.880]   into the iTunes App Store, is Apple App Store.
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.000]   Is it a much different thing than submitting something
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:30.680]   in Google Play?
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:31.560]   And it's true.
[01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:33.760]   I was saying this on all about Android last night.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:37.240]   Anybody can fire up App Inventor and make a FART app
[01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:38.280]   and upload it to Google Play.
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:41.280]   And that counts as an app that's in the store.
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.600]   Whereas every single Apple app is approved,
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:47.960]   still it's pretty amazing that the Play Store and the App Store
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:49.080]   have the same amount of apps.
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:52.480]   I don't think that this is a number to measure anymore.
[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:55.600]   Not for these two, certainly for other operating systems
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:57.320]   at this point, but still incredible
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.400]   to see how Android is caught up just with this.
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:02.000]   One particular measure that was really important a while back.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.720]   The current rate will be June of this year
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.200]   that they'll reach a million apps.
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:06.560]   I think it's pretty clear that you're
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.960]   going to say that the turning point, right now I
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:15.480]   would say Apple and iOS and Android are parity.
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:17.880]   And the real question is, is it going to now
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:19.040]   start to flip an Android's favor?
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:19.640]   And I think so.
[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:23.240]   I think by the end of this year, it will be twice as--
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.040]   not the number of apps, but just everything.
[01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:28.880]   It'll be selling twice as many phones, twice as popular.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:31.480]   Apple is going back to its niche role.
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:35.000]   The problem is that there's a snobbishness that exists,
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.120]   for example, among developers and in media both.
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.680]   So you see--
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:42.360]   I love the guys at Circuit, but they make an iPhone app,
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:43.200]   and that's it.
[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:47.520]   I complained to somebody else last week, just an iPhone app.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:50.240]   PBS did a list of best news apps,
[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:52.160]   and they were almost all just for iPhone.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.040]   And I complained, and they said, well, show us the bandwidth.
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:54.560]   So that's the point.
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.200]   The developers aren't going there.
[01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:58.640]   The economists are driving me nuts,
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.120]   because they don't have anything for an Android tablet.
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.320]   You can't use it there.
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:05.040]   Verizon drives me nuts, because they haven't updated
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:09.240]   their applications for a jelly bean.
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:11.920]   The attention still goes to iOS, because the developer
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.560]   community is there, and media executives are there,
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.880]   and that's what they have.
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:19.480]   But the public is unquestionably going to Android,
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:20.760]   and that's where they've got to go,
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:21.800]   but they're not there yet.
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:23.240]   So there's a back dude.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.160]   And I think Google could do something here
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:26.560]   by pointing this stuff out.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.720]   Google should be calling the economists and saying, hello,
[01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:30.440]   you want some help?
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:31.320]   What do you want from the center?
[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.680]   I wouldn't bother.
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.000]   They'll follow the money.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:34.360]   Exactly.
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:35.720]   We saw the same exact thing.
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:39.920]   And remember, Apple's gone through this with the Macintosh.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.800]   And people who ended up developing for the Macintosh
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.480]   were niche people who made beautiful apps,
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:47.360]   always better apps than on Windows.
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:49.680]   But if you're the economist, you follow the money,
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:50.640]   and you make Android apps.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:52.800]   And I think by the end of this year, you'll see that, Jeff.
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.840]   I don't think you're going to--
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:56.160]   there will still be the circus of the world.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:59.600]   The iOS developers will be much like OS 10 developers.
[01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.440]   They'll be nichy.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:04.920]   There's still a strong perception, though, that iOS
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.240]   is where you make the money.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.840]   I mean, I just switched an iPhone to the Galaxy Nexus.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:12.640]   And it's like, time hop, lift, the magazine, letter press,
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:17.560]   like really great new apps start on iOS still.
[01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:23.040]   So I really-- I'm waiting to see the cool indie new startup
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.240]   launch their mobile app first on Android.
[01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:28.360]   We've seen that with Ingress and Field Trip.
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:29.960]   But those are Google-funded projects.
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:31.960]   We still have to see that third-party developer launch
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:34.160]   on Android first with a lot of success,
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:35.960]   because Android's where they feel like they're
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:38.160]   going to get the money in the audience.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.360]   I'm waiting for that.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.080]   I think it's going to happen this year.
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:43.360]   This is the year, just around the corner.
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.360]   There'll be a path.
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:46.000]   There'll be an Instagram.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.720]   There'll be an app that-- and by the way,
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:49.840]   that accelerates it.
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:52.200]   Because as soon as there's an app that's only on Android,
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:55.960]   that everybody has to have, then there really
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:58.680]   is no really much resistance to buying Android at this point
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:34:59.200]   anymore.
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:00.360]   I don't think.
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.720]   I think more and more normal people are just saying, yeah,
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:03.320]   what's wrong with it?
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:06.960]   I'm going to get an Android phone.
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:08.560]   All right, now it's time to take a break.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:13.600]   And then we'll come back with tools, tips, numbers, and more.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.400]   I love this Mark Cuban story.
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:17.520]   Is that going to be your number?
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:18.480]   I have two numbers.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:19.680]   You should make that your number.
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.760]   That's a good number.
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:23.840]   I know anything like that I love.
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:25.520]   But first, hey, we got a new advertiser.
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:27.560]   I want to tell you about LegalZoom.com.
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:28.920]   I've used them.
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:31.200]   Maybe you've even heard of them.
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:33.360]   LegalZoom is not a law firm, but what they do
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.800]   is they give you legal help, self-help,
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.400]   your direction, affordable business
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:42.120]   and personal forms, documents.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:45.280]   It's really great for anybody starting their own business.
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:49.000]   Set up your business, form an LLC at LegalZoom,
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.760]   starting at $99.
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:55.120]   If you're a blogger, this is something you should pay attention
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:55.800]   to.
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:36:00.480]   Trademark, copyright, patent, NDAs.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:02.640]   If you've got a great idea and you want to do an NDAs,
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:07.880]   LegalZoom has it at very affordable prices.
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:09.480]   This kind of protection, it doesn't
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:11.480]   mean you have to go to a law firm and spend hundreds
[01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:13.480]   and hundreds of dollars an hour.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.720]   You could spend $169 and register your trademark
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.760]   with LegalZoom.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:20.720]   And if you want family law with $69,
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:23.200]   you could do a will or a living trust.
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:24.480]   By the way, if you don't have a will,
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:27.840]   you really need to get one.
[01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:31.280]   Gina, you guys have a will.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:33.360]   Yeah, we're getting one.
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:34.040]   We're the best.
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:37.440]   Yes, since you have a child, you got to get a will.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.360]   Two million Americans over the last 12 years
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:44.840]   have used LegalZoom for LLCs, wills, trusts, trademarks,
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:45.400]   and more.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:46.840]   Their online process couldn't be.
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:47.760]   It's all online now.
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:49.200]   When I first used LegalZoom, it wasn't.
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:49.720]   Now it is.
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:50.760]   It's very easy.
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:54.120]   Step by step, you get total customer support.
[01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:56.320]   And what they've done now, which I think is fantastic,
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:58.800]   if you want advice and want to know more,
[01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.880]   if you feel like, you know, I need some help,
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:03.320]   they've got an extensive network of attorneys
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:05.760]   through LegalZoom's legal plans available in most states
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.880]   at a very affordable prices.
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:11.480]   And that is fantastic.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:14.000]   Start your business and protect your family today
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.360]   at LegalZoom.com, not a law firm,
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:19.080]   but self-help services at your specific direction.
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:21.280]   Or you can speak to a legal plan attorney
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.720]   and get your questions answered and get ongoing advice
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.600]   for variable affordable rates.
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:29.720]   To receive a special thank you for using LegalZoom,
[01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:33.440]   make sure you enter our offer code, which is Twig,
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:34.480]   easy to remember.

[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:40.400]   It's a nice way of doing that.
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:44.440]   LegalZoom.com use the offer code Twig.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.840]   And I really want to encourage you, you know,
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.360]   if you're setting up a business, you got it.
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:50.600]   There's just some, it's not hard, not complicated.
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.440]   There's some certain steps you just got to take
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:57.040]   to protect yourself, like trademarks, like LLC.
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:58.520]   And it's really easy to do.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:00.440]   I was thrilled.
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.520]   - Yeah, you're from the side business,
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:02.600]   that's the way to do it.
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:03.440]   - Oh yeah.
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:05.200]   - I happen to be surrounded by lawyers at the moment
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:06.800]   'cause we're doing the adoption and our will
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:09.040]   and a bunch of other stuff, but, you know,
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.920]   that's a great option if you don't want to have an army of--
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.080]   - Are you going to a room and there's three lawyers in there?
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.320]   I don't know about you, but my,
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:20.000]   I start seeing the numbers floating in from my head as they--
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.320]   - Of the clock text?
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.160]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:27.520]   He's $215 an hour, he's $400, she's $500 an hour.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.000]   Oh my God.
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:30.960]   (laughing)
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.040]   Can we hurry this up?
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.400]   And they're never in a hurry, are they?
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:34.520]   You notice that?
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:35.680]   - No, no.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:38.480]   - They're never in a hurry to wrap this thing up.
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:40.600]   Oh, let's get out of here early.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.520]   - It was for telephonic communication.
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:44.320]   I said, "You charged me more for calling it that,
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:45.920]   "just calling it a telephone call."
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:48.120]   - Telephonic communication, yeah.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.240]   That, you know why they do that?
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:51.040]   'Cause it takes longer to say.
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:52.040]   (laughing)
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:52.880]   - So they can build for that?
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:53.880]   - They build for that.
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:57.080]   - That's three extra letters.
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:58.800]   - In contract, all I want to do.
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.520]   - We got to work on, I don't know why,
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.280]   maybe Jeff's using a different Skype now,
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:05.280]   but he's getting echo canceled, so whenever I talk,
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:06.280]   you can't hear him.
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:09.880]   No, that's, we can fix that.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:12.200]   John knows how to fix that, we'll fix that after the show.
[01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:15.080]   Just make a note of that.
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:19.240]   All right, it's time for your tip of the week, Gina Trapani.
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:21.440]   - Really simple tip this week,
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:23.920]   a new little thingy in Gmail.
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:28.320]   Gmail's Compose window now has a label dropdown.
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:32.120]   So you can add a label to a message before you send it,
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.520]   which sounds kind of crazy, but actually,
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:37.160]   if you depend on labels and if you organize your stuff
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.560]   with labels, which I absolutely do, it's a huge help.
[01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:41.960]   'Cause normally if I send a message that I want to file,
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:44.040]   I've got like a follow up label.
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:45.160]   If I want to file that in the label,
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:47.480]   you send the message and then you have to label it afterwards.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:49.560]   Now you just do it while you're composing the message,
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:52.600]   add your label and send, and that's in both the new
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:55.320]   Compose experience, which is the window that opens
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:56.720]   in the lower right hand corner,
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:00.080]   or just your regular vanilla Compose window.
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:02.760]   - Very cool.
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.360]   - So and once you get a reply to that,
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:06.240]   it stays the labels persist, right?
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:09.040]   - Yeah, the labels, the conversation, yeah.
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:11.280]   So that conversation would stay within that label.
[01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:12.480]   - Very good.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:15.320]   Your number of the week, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:16.400]   - I'm going to mention this one first.
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:18.280]   - 'Cause I think it's something interesting to anyone.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.800]   Adam Shirk, S-H-E-R-K at adamshirk.com,
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:24.440]   put up some really amazing numbers to me,
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:27.120]   looking at the engagement per post and per site
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:30.240]   for a whole bunch of news sites on Google+.
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.520]   So for example, average engagement per post,
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.200]   number one, Mashable.
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:38.320]   At 239 plus ones per post,
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:42.320]   87 shares per post, 67 comments per post,
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:46.360]   a total of 394, thus interaction per post.
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.600]   I just found these stats to be amazing
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:51.440]   and to see that those places that are
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:54.840]   trying to make an effort at Google+,
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:57.400]   and new ways to measure engagement,
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.680]   and as somebody pointed out in one of the comments
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:04.000]   on my post, it follows Mr. Irgan's rules
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.080]   that you do something that is done for Google+,
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:07.880]   you put a big picture up.
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:09.160]   So I found that interesting.
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.800]   - But more interestingly, Leo, and thus to the world,
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:12.880]   but I'm not a real jock,
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:16.760]   but you gotta watch Mark Cuban myself on Shark Tank.
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.920]   But Cuban gets in trouble regularly
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:23.440]   for what he says online, and got fined $50,000
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:27.080]   for a tweet that complained about officiating at a game.
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:30.560]   And that's pretty amazing.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:32.480]   - The tweet was pretty innocuous too,
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:34.800]   it was just kinda like, I mean, it was criticism,
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.800]   but it was like, I'm sorry that I haven't been able to,
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:38.760]   you know, that the refereeing isn't better,
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.720]   and officiating isn't better, right?
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:42.600]   Like, I failed at making it better.
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:45.760]   It wasn't even like a really mean tweet, a $50,000 tweet.
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:48.760]   - I guess it's just cigarette money for him,
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:50.960]   but it still doesn't seem like you should be able
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:52.840]   to be fined for a tweet.
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.760]   - It's a ridiculous industry.
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:56.920]   - Yeah, I guess 'cause he's an owner,
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:59.360]   they could do anything they want.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.440]   He said, I'm sorry NBA fans,
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:04.040]   I've tried for 13 years to fix the officiating
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:06.840]   in this league, and I have failed miserably.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:08.160]   And he suggestions I need help,
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:10.160]   that's because of course his team was,
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:13.400]   by three points to the New Orleans Hornets on Saturday.
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.480]   - It's the officiating!
[01:42:15.480 --> 01:42:17.480]   - You have a tool, Mr. Earned.
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.000]   - You know, I can do one.
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.040]   Actually, this was in the rundown here,
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:22.920]   and I picked it up and I thought, you know what?
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:24.720]   If I need to do one, this is gonna be it,
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:25.640]   'cause it's pretty cool.
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.680]   It's power searching with Google.
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:28.960]   I don't know, did you put this in Gina,
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:29.800]   or who put this in?
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.480]   Maybe it was Chad, or somebody else.
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:32.320]   - Tell us.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.880]   - It was there when I saw the rundown.
[01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:34.720]   - It looks really cool though.
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:36.680]   - It does look cool, I was wondering if you knew about this.
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:40.240]   So if you just go to power searching with Google.com,
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:42.520]   you will find some sessions.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:45.920]   It's basically courses in how to use Google search better.
[01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:49.640]   And it's, I think it looks pretty cool.
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:50.640]   I mean, if you wanna sign up,
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:53.360]   if you wanna figure out, they offered one in,
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:55.000]   power searching not too long ago,
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.040]   and now they're doing one in advanced power searching.
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:00.360]   So I guess this is really targeted towards researchers,
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:02.760]   if you are a researcher and you're doing a project,
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.200]   and you really need to get down and dirty,
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:07.000]   and get a lot of data and crunch through it,
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:08.440]   and you wanna use Google to do that,
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.760]   then this is a course that you would really,
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:11.600]   really wanna do.
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:14.040]   But if not, they also offer the power searching course
[01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:16.000]   on demand so you can learn more about
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.600]   how to get the most out of Google searches.
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:18.800]   So check it out.
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:21.600]   - Wow, do you think you really need a course in searching?
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:22.600]   - I mean, it's funny, you know, like,
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:24.040]   my first reaction was that like,
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:25.520]   oh, if your product is so complicated
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:27.560]   that you have to offer a course and how to use it,
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:28.800]   then there's something wrong,
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:32.360]   but Google search really does have so many,
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:36.240]   you know, cool operators and hidden kind of advanced techniques
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:37.640]   like that you really can do, of course.
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:39.120]   I mean, I know at Life Hacker,
[01:43:39.120 --> 01:43:42.360]   are Google power searching tips articles
[01:43:42.360 --> 01:43:43.920]   always sort of like the traffic on them,
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:44.760]   always went through the roof,
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:46.280]   people love them and ate them up.
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:48.080]   And it's funny, I sort of start using
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:50.480]   new advanced operators sort of one at a time,
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.680]   you know, like, you know,
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:53.400]   sort of seeing the whole cheat sheet,
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:54.760]   once you don't really digest them,
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:57.000]   it wants to sort of start to get used to using them.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.160]   But I think it's a good idea to say here's a problem,
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:00.520]   here's a researcher problem,
[01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.880]   I think that they want to find and here are the search techniques
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.440]   who would use to get to them.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:05.760]   >> Yeah, there are a lot of things.
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:06.920]   >> There are a lot of little things
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:09.360]   that people don't realize are there.
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:11.720]   I mean, I just, I guess I knew about it,
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:13.040]   but I forgot about the image search,
[01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:15.640]   the image matching search you can do.
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:18.520]   If you go to google.com and then click image,
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:20.080]   there's a little dropdown you can change
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:22.160]   to search for similar images.
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.840]   And it's such a cool little feature.
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:25.720]   And I guess I heard about it and I was like, yeah, yeah,
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:27.320]   and then I needed to use it.
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:28.640]   And I used it and I was like,
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:31.360]   oh, I'm going to use this every day now, it's so cool.
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:32.520]   >> You know what I would love to do
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:35.600]   is do a weekly search challenge on the show.
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:36.760]   >> Oh, that'd be kind of fun.
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:40.160]   >> Give us a researcher search challenge.
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:42.360]   Maybe the audience can do that.
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:45.640]   Maybe we should set it up in the Google+ community
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:47.440]   and ask for a search challenge.
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.280]   >> There's a, have you guys seen this documentary,
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:50.800]   Catfish about this guy?
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:51.640]   >> Yeah.
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:52.680]   >> Yeah, so there's a show now,
[01:44:52.680 --> 01:44:55.160]   like you turned it into a show on MTV.
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:57.640]   And it's for people who are in these online relationships
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.280]   who go and meet the person and find out
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:01.520]   that they're not at all who they represented themselves.
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:03.400]   Anyway, this show, like the majority of the show
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:05.840]   is the guy, the host, showing people
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:08.280]   that if you just take the person's profile picture
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:09.800]   who you think you're in love with
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:11.720]   and drop it into Google image search,
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:15.680]   you will find where the person like janked the photo from
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:17.480]   to make it look like it's them.
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:19.400]   And it just makes me laugh.
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:20.640]   >> Oh, I love that.
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:22.560]   >> You know, these people are just so in love
[01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:25.320]   and it's been two years of Facebook message I am,
[01:45:25.320 --> 01:45:26.960]   you know, that they're so invested in it.
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:29.280]   It's like this guy just pops the image in and he's like,
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:31.760]   yep, no, actually this person lives in Texas.
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:34.160]   (laughing)
[01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:37.280]   >> So he does that each week, he does another.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:39.200]   >> Yeah, each week it's another person
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:41.680]   who's in love with someone who they've never met,
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:42.960]   Facebook or whatever.
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:44.520]   And one of the first things he does
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:46.680]   is take the profile picture and put it in Google image search
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:48.520]   by image to find similar, you know,
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:51.960]   other web pages where this same image is shown up, you know?
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:53.640]   And it's almost always fake profiles.
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:55.880]   It's almost always someone sad and old and fat
[01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:57.520]   and trolly, troll looking, you know,
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.440]   who like really wants to look like a model.
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:01.600]   Sorry, everyone being sizes.
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:04.760]   But yeah, so that's, it just makes me laugh.
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:08.560]   So I'm like, oh, it's a course in Google on MTV.
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:14.240]   >> Aaron Nukem is a regular on our Floss Weekly show.
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:15.840]   That's why he's here, he came up to do that
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:18.880]   with Randall Schwartz, but he also has his own show,
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:19.920]   TheSourceShow.org.
[01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:22.480]   I hesitate to say that, yeah, I'm put up at episode in a while.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:23.720]   >> Yeah, I mean, we have to, I'm waiting for you
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:25.480]   to start your maker show that's right.
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:26.600]   >> Would you be-- >> We can combine effort.
[01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:27.600]   >> Will you be part of that?
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:28.560]   >> I would love to be part.
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:29.400]   >> All right.
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:30.480]   >> Once you get around to it.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:33.800]   >> I saw Make Magazine is advertising for hosts.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:34.640]   >> Yes.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:36.480]   >> So I decided, because we were talking for a while with them,
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:37.840]   but you know, we kind of let them down.
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:39.800]   We didn't, we've been delaying and delaying.
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:40.640]   So maybe we'll just have to do it
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.000]   without the help of Make Magazine.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:42.840]   >> Yeah.
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:45.280]   >> Just build radios out of raspberry pies.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:46.760]   >> That's right. >> And things like that.
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:47.600]   I want to do it.
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.280]   >> Yeah, absolutely. >> Gotta do that.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.280]   >> Absolutely. >> So forget TheSourceShow.
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:52.120]   (laughing)
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:52.960]   >> That's history.
[01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:54.640]   >> Follow me on Google+, that's the best place.
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:55.480]   >> That's the best place.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:57.440]   >> Yeah, Google+. >> A-A-R-O-N.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:59.800]   >> Yep. >> N-E-W-C-O-M-B.
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:02.280]   >> And I am that on, you know, all the social networks.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:05.440]   So Facebook, Twitter, but especially Google+,
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:06.600]   because I get a lot of interaction.
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:08.440]   That's where a lot of people were asking me,
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:10.520]   "Hey, are you gonna mention your radio that you're building?"
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:11.560]   'Cause you mentioned it last time,
[01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:12.880]   or you're gonna mention it again.
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:14.400]   And so I said, "Yeah, I'll just bring along
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:15.840]   "what I've gotten, show it off."
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:17.240]   >> You'll know you have the right Aaron Newcomb
[01:47:17.240 --> 01:47:18.920]   and you see the A+ logo.
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:19.920]   >> Plus. >> Yeah.
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.680]   >> Thank you, Aaron.
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:23.000]   Thank you everybody. >> Thanks for having me.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.480]   >> Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com,
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.960]   and he's also a professor of journalism
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:30.520]   at the City University of New York.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:32.240]   And anything else I should plug?
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:34.720]   Oh, yes, public parts, that fabulous book.
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:38.400]   Seem, he can't talk when I talk.
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.160]   Which could be useful.
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:41.720]   >> Hey. (laughs)
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:42.800]   >> Hey.
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:44.800]   (laughs)
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:46.440]   We shall fix that.
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.520]   >> Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:50.840]   and thinkup.com.
[01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:52.920]   And as the author of todo.text,
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:55.520]   which is a great text-based to-do list
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:58.040]   for Android and iPhone.
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:47:59.760]   >> A new co-host of All About Android.
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:00.600]   >> Oh, that's right.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:01.440]   >> On Tuesday night.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:03.240]   >> Oh, oh, oh.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.120]   >> That's great.
[01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:05.560]   So tonight you'll probably rehash
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:07.680]   some of the things we talked about in more.
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:08.760]   (laughs)
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:09.600]   Last night.
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.440]   >> Last night.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.600]   >> Yeah, it's wonderful.
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:14.320]   My All About Android prep sort of feeds my Twig prep, so.
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:15.320]   >> Perfect.
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:16.640]   >> Yeah, it's very efficient.
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:19.120]   And we just released our new Think Up 2.0,
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:23.680]   our first beta, it's a total revamp of the application.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:24.880]   So you can check it out.
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:27.720]   If you're up for fiddling around with a PHP application
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:29.320]   on your web server, you should download the beta
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:30.160]   and check it out.
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:32.320]   >> Yeah, this is what you get.
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:33.320]   >> Oh, yeah, this is.
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:34.160]   (laughs)
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:35.160]   >> Don't get excited.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.840]   (laughs)
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:39.560]   If you know what to do next, you should get it.
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:41.000]   >> You know what to do from there.
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.080]   (laughs)
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:43.960]   >> From the Apache file listing.
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.600]   (laughs)
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:46.760]   >> On zip.
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:47.600]   (laughs)
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:48.680]   And that's for you.
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:49.520]   >> You tried beta.
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:51.320]   (laughs)
[01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:52.560]   >> Think Up is awesome.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.960]   All right, we do this show every Wednesday
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:58.560]   at 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:04.560]   On UTC time, that would be, I think, 2,200 UTC at twit.tv.
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:06.680]   Do I have seven or eight?
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:12.080]   I think I had eight, so actually it'd be 2,100 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:16.760]   But you can also get after the fact, get on demand,
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:20.840]   versions of audio and video versions of the show at twit.tv/twig,
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:22.640]   or wherever you subscribe to podcast effect,
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:23.960]   please do subscribe.
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:26.160]   That way you'll get it every week.
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:30.960]   9 p.m. GMT, I don't care about GMT, I want UTC.
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:34.040]   I guess GMT is the same thing, right?
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:37.800]   So 9 p.m. 2100 UTC.
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:38.640]   Okay.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:42.880]   Dr. Mom says it's easy, Gina, download on zip install.
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:44.360]   (laughs)
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:45.360]   >> It is!
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:47.680]   >> What could be easier?
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:49.440]   >> Easier!
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:50.280]   >> Well, FTP.
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:51.840]   (laughs)
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:53.000]   >> Thanks, everybody, for joining us.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.800]   We'll see you next week on twig.
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:57.380]   (upbeat music)
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:49:59.960]   (upbeat music)
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:02.540]   (upbeat music)
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:05.120]   (upbeat music)
