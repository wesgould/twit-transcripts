[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.440]   yes very festive
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.520]   right
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.160]   December 23rd is officially Festivus
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.040]   but Matthew just because I know you're a pagan
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.280]   oh I'm sorry you're a Canadian close
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.360]   we put up the Festivus pole
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.600]   fantastic
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.800]   feats of strength and the airing of grievances coming soon
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   yes let's get to it
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.720]   actually the actual
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.480]   Canadian's have no grievances
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.720]   no I know what are you what are you unhappy about soft wood
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.520]   we do we just keep it there sorry they have no grievances
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.520]   I'm so sorry
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.320]   no that's actually
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.560]   Matthew might have a little a little grievance
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.120]   he of course writes for the Columbia journalism review
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.040]   where he is their
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.960]   their man about the digital universe and had an article this week in the
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.600]   CJR
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.080]   NPR's move into
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.000]   podcasting analytics raises privacy concerns
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.720]   I imagine you probably have some thoughts about that
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.160]   I certainly do
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.160]   so what is NPR
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.320]   planning what is what are they up to
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.880]   so they've rolled it out it's a
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.880]   it's an open
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.160]   standard
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.480]   that they developed that they're hoping obviously
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.640]   lots of distributors and creators will
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.440]   integrate and they own a
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.840]   it's actually explains why they bought
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.600]   for what for us is the number two podcast platform
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.360]   pocket casts yeah
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.480]   so the interesting thing is pocket cast has said it has no plans to
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.280]   implement this standard
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.480]   they obviously got a memo yet
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.320]   which is it no no they did
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.840]   they're not going to do it carefully it doesn't sound like they're going to do it
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.320]   wow good for them so
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.480]   that by the way kills this in its tracks
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.200]   it doesn't ensure doesn't help that's for sure and so how does it how does it work
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.160]   it's basically tags
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.960]   on a lot of content is audio tags or
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.160]   yeah the content is tagged
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.800]   I wouldn't pretend to understand
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.200]   how it actually works technologically but the way it's described is that
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.280]   there are tags in the stream and you can tag whatever you want you can tag the
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.080]   ads
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.120]   you can tag the beginning of the podcast you can tag
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.800]   when the you know guests all introduce themselves you can tag
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.600]   a specific feature within your podcast
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   and then you can see how many people make it to that tag
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.320]   you can also import back up the plane of the tag
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.680]   so magic I assume no that's why it
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.320]   make it matters whether pocket casts implements it it does it the player has to
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.200]   be listening to him to make and then upload it
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.160]   right so if if if if I tunes doesn't implement it
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.000]   pocket cast doesn't implement it's dead in the water because those are the two
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   number one and number two podcast platforms
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.040]   and the business what do you think of it Leo yeah
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.280]   this is well to me okay so the way NPR is pitching this according to your
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.440]   article is as a useful thing for programmers because they can know
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.600]   when people tune out of their show that's not the reason for it it's oh
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.760]   and it's really a bad surprise it's shocking that a content company would do
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.480]   this because it's really for advertisers
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.720]   this is what advertisers would like you know
[00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.280]   they're so frustrating and some of this comes from the fact
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.520]   that the same people buy podcast ads by digital banner ads
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.440]   and so they're really used to this kind of instant metrics and feedback how many
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.960]   people looked how many people clicked how many people clicked through how many
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.120]   people bought they I get all these metrics
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.160]   and it really bugs them that podcasts don't offer those same kind of metrics
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.160]   I should point out that neither does a Super Bowl ad
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.120]   nor I mean you've got ratings but we have ratings for podcasts that are very
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.960]   comparable in fact I think better than television and radio ratings
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.800]   but you don't know if the person got up during the Super Bowl ad and went to
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.040]   the bathroom you don't in magazines Jeff you know this
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.320]   having been in the magazine business for years
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.800]   magazines can't determine whether an ad was seen or not it's extremely
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.760]   yes sorry I cut that out well even man in the circulation ad
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.840]   what is it ABC the advertising circulation bureau
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.680]   even has a pass along rate to inflate the numbers that's the that's the
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.080]   Simmons that syndicated research so what I was at
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.720]   everybody knows it's a lie it's also a lie
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.520]   people had a pass along rate of eight readers per copy
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.200]   every copy was dog-eared as could be yeah right
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.480]   wow because it was public place also they counted people who would
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.960]   riffle through the magazine and check out and if you pass to quiz
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.000]   then they counted that reader so eight readers per copy versus about two I
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.160]   think would be God at the time so the whole the advertisers really
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.640]   want to know who saw that how many people saw the ad
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.320]   who clicked on the ad they really want that they unfortunately
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.000]   every medium in the world is competing against the two
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.400]   giants google and facebook and if you can't offer the
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.000]   the customer information that google and facebook offer
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.200]   and the click-through rate information that they offer
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.760]   you're a second tier so NPR said well we can know we can do this
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.360]   but what it doesn't consider is a everybody has to use a player that
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.080]   supports it be the pride and you talk about this
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.680]   Matthew there are privacy concerns in this yeah that was what Marco
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.440]   Arman mentioned he developed overcast and also tumblr
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.320]   another huge marco's overcast is like the number three
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.840]   packets live for massive and so I noticed when
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:47.600]   so I noticed when he said he said I have no intention of
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.320]   implementing this and I hope no one else does either
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.320]   and that interested me because I you know I wondered why
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.640]   he was so vocal about it it's especially since NPR was
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.600]   pitching it as a good thing and he said that even though NPR
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:10.960]   says that it's you know it maintains user privacy he said
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.360]   someone is going to use this to target users because they've got an IP
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.120]   address when they download the podcast you can do all kinds of
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.880]   data extraction based on IP address and then you can tag that
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:27.440]   to this how far they listen in a podcast and you can effectively
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.520]   you know come up with a profile on people and he thought that was
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.520]   would be an actively bad thing for the podcasting business so how is that
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.280]   any worse than just a web page everybody listening so it is
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.960]   everybody listening is bad it's the same everybody listening this needs to
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.320]   understand that advertising supported media is under
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.920]   constant pressure from advertisers deliver more information about you to
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.120]   the advertisers that's the game that's going on
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.000]   period and every single content creator is fighting back
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.360]   partly because to protect privacy but also partly in our own interest
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.360]   I don't want people to start counting whether somebody listened to the show
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.800]   or not in my opinion the only thing an advertiser should ever be interested
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.960]   in is did your ad work did you sell more in widgets
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.000]   if you did if you sold more widgets than the ad cost then you're ahead
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.600]   why isn't that good enough but they all want more they all want to know
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.360]   oh what age group blah blah blah hasn't uh
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.520]   have an iTunes and Spotify already implemented analytics but only again
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.640]   if you use iTunes to listen most people even most people who get
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.600]   their podcasts from iTunes don't use iTunes to listen
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.160]   okay Spotify oh really yeah oh no well they download it on their phone they
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.360]   might listen on their phone maybe Apple's podcast app does that but most other
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.560]   apps don't Marcos doesn't pocketcast doesn't
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.480]   it's the iTunes stats are exactly that their iTunes specific
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.240]   if for people who listen on iTunes I guess because I will say project from that
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.240]   right NPR when I talk I spoke with them
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.440]   um someone who developed the standard and and
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.280]   their sort of VP of digital strategy they very much
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:16.960]   focused on how useful this information was to creators they said that NPR
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:22.160]   had effectively used a similar technology and it had changed the way
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.800]   they did their politics podcast because they noticed that we people were
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.120]   bailing uh do in the early parts of the podcast
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.960]   when everyone introduces themselves and so they went back and rejig the
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.400]   podcast so that they got to the material faster
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.880]   and they described this as a win for that type of analytics
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.840]   okay if they just be honest and say we're NPR we have sponsors uh they still
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.720]   pretend they're non-commercial for crying out loud
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.760]   they have as more commercials than we do yeah
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.200]   so it's a lie it's it's advertising driven there may be some value to
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.640]   programmers um i'm i'm not champing at the bit to get that
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.040]   kind of information and by the way I know our audience doesn't want us to
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.320]   spy on them anymore there were definitely a bunch of people who
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.160]   responded to Marco on twitter saying thank you yes
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:21.040]   you know for for sort of upholding our right to not be tracked and
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.160]   not to go the way the web has there's no one in the world who think
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.920]   thinks ad tech was a good thing for the web
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:34.560]   well except for that yeah it in a long run if it increases the value
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.160]   of media properties and supports journalism that's a good thing
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.240]   but we'll we can debate we can debate long and hard about whether
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.280]   advertisers should get this but you're only going to compete you're competing
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.320]   with data that does exist for tv that does exist for um that's true no no
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.640]   we're not good no no because that data doesn't
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.160]   that kind of data exists for tv in a very limited fashion using people
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.120]   meters which measures a small tiny audience
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.480]   and then extrapolates right and so along comes along comes every platform that
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.280]   exists in the web the web promised greater um like add accountability
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.680]   and i guess i mean and things like advertisers want it but i don't know if
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.080]   it makes their ads better or more effective so there
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.600]   there's two ways you could look at it and that this was a discussion i had
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.480]   with Marco you could argue that if you offer these analytics
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.280]   maybe advertisers will be willing to pay you more
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.040]   but you could also argue that the finer you slice and dice
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.760]   the attention in your podcast you might end up with the same kind of nickel
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:37.040]   and dime garbage ads that we get on the web and actually
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.880]   wind up actually i think it's potentially the opposite
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:47.760]   podcast now and well i mean yes and no right the power of a podcast i've
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.680]   i've had on this network is that leo reads it leo believes in it
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.120]   it's hard to fast forward through it there's high recall
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.040]   right it's it's native they work that's the value right it works
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.200]   and as long as you have that kind of advertising
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:08.640]   then um that has added extra value the issue is if you're serving commercials
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.440]   pre-made into an audio format into a podcast
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.600]   uh then you're competing with radio what other that's a good point and there
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.480]   uh we've tried and with very poor success we've tried um insertion ads in some
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.280]   of our yeah yeah in in in uh in uh in
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:33.280]   i'd like to think of it as man in the middle ads but uh
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.160]   in some of our uh long tail shows and shows that we can't sell and so forth
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.200]   and i know they're terrible right we made a few hundred dollars and the real
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.480]   problem for us and the reason we stopped doing it is we couldn't guarantee that
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.600]   the inserted ads weren't competing with the
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.440]   good strong good ads that we put in and we don't want to lose our real
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.960]   advertisers for a few hundred dollars in in insertion ads
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.800]   so you're right though for that kind of inventory i guess it's fine i don't i
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:04.400]   do you know i i'm just uh i'm an old fart i don't want to see podcasting become
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.240]   massively commercialized but it has to i suppose
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.840]   uh i'm saddened to see npr non-commercial public radio be the one
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.480]   leading the charge on this but doesn't surprise me at all
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:24.000]   i mean wnyc is just as much a podcast commercial podcast entity as any
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.080]   thing out there they're they're you know juggernaut i did notice a bunch of
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.600]   people were sort of said that they thought they saw podcasts in a way as a
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:39.040]   kind of you know a haven of yeah content where they weren't
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:43.520]   where they're every sort of step and breath and click was not tracked
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.120]   jeff did these kind of debates go on with blocking
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.640]   like the blog is saying don't mention no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.520]   harry harry copplin had blog ads yeah there was a pay content debate i
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:00.560]   remember that well that goes on right that the the fake sponsored fake content
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:05.120]   that that really is just an ad we get that e like that email every single
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.640]   day i get four or five people saying they'd like to write for our website
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.240]   that i saw something fascinating just while we're talking about this there was
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.840]   a story about um trying to remember where i think it was in the
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:21.600]   atlantic and it was about um would be influencers on instagram so mostly
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.880]   young kids oh yeah the atlantic had a story about people
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.680]   pretending they had ads so they do they make a post that's right
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.840]   that looks as much like an ad as possible so it looks like they have ads and
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.280]   therefore they're an influencer i just found that fascinating
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.280]   but you know what when i when we like when we started at a weekly
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.120]   um and we did the uh the mock up which i have around here somewhere
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.640]   right there uh hold on i'll show you something
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.840]   because jeff goes back to the uh you know early days of
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.760]   yeah before the war before the war
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.160]   entertain he started entertainment weekly so he's got the mock up here of ew
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:04.560]   i got the mock up right right right right and you keep it handy just in case
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.600]   well i have it because i teach it in school so in the mock up
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.240]   we put ads of course right you know we're gonna put ads and and everything we put
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.520]   out there we put ads they were not really ads and the first you know first
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.440]   issues of things you'd offer advertisers space for free because it would look bad
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.120]   not to have ads yeah
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:34.000]   heavy side just kind of be good by cover i don't know if there's a whole lot of
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.120]   privacy you're giving up so these tags
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:45.040]   in theory would not identify you i mean they could it's conceivable that they
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.040]   could but they as design don't identify you they just
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:53.440]   you as a podcaster you would get the information that aggregated data
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.160]   a hundred people tuned out here two hundred people tuned out here
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.800]   and whatever but the real reason for yeah is through your ip ad yeah and it's
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.120]   not like it's not more than you would on the web
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.440]   and they really the real value of it is that the advertiser then and this is the
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:10.960]   thing it really scares me the advertiser would say oh yeah
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.320]   so we're not going to pay for the people who didn't get to our ad right we're
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:17.120]   only going to pay for the people who got to our ad that's what advertisers want
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:20.960]   that's what it's podcast visibility so the other thing that someone
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.920]   mentioned which i thought was interesting was if you tag
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.840]   the ads that's going to make it a lot easier to skip them
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:32.160]   because you will you could just have your software don't tag run to a tag and
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.720]   jump to the next that's easy to fix you just tag
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.920]   before the ad you know two minutes before the ad
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.920]   i mean that's not so hard if five minutes after the ad it's not so hard
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.840]   uh it's interesting it's it's a i think it's a non-starter just like iTunes
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.280]   is kind of a non-starter unless they can offer
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.440]   just as Nielsen does a sample well we we know five thousand people listen to this
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.600]   podcast and this percentage tuned out and i guess that would be valuable
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.640]   it's sad to me i can't wait to get out of the podcast business because
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.600]   essentially it's being eaten alive by this kind of crap but it did feel like
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.640]   you're gonna what you're gonna get is a bunch of big media companies yeah
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.160]   making podcasts they're just gonna turn it right into broadcast television
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.480]   and radio and which is sad that's sad because that's not what i want to do
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.240]   this is the reason i'm in podcasting uh to you know as a
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.240]   as a refugee from commercial television and radio i'm getting depressed
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.400]   well it always happens right as soon as this is what's happening i get i we see
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.520]   it here all the time you know we don't get the advice we
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.240]   used to because they want to buy uh kind of i was listening to um
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.120]   Conan O'Brien's podcast which is fine he's he like every other comic they all
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.600]   all comedian podcasts are essentially the same
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.520]   yeah uh and he does the ads and he rifts his way through the ads they're
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:53.120]   funny ha ha ha there's no direct response i'm sure Conan has said
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.840]   well no we're not good oh you're buying Conan that's good enough for you
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.000]   yeah direct response is what we do you know slash twit or use the
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.040]   offer code twig and that's how that's a very primitive way advertisers can see
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.120]   what kind of response they're getting to an ad
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.800]   Conan is saying no you don't need that you just you're buying Conan that's all
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.920]   you need to know so he's going the other way he's going
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.880]   further away from measurement yeah and it's just all it's just the death of
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.040]   it yeah it's the death of anything that's not
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.960]   Conan on podcasting that's why when you had Ford
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.440]   there was no direct response involved it was a branding yeah
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.640]   i like branding ads i wish we could get them wish we could get more of those
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:38.240]   those are good we do some but uh and and i would argue in your case
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.520]   because you get early in on you helped brand uh a lot of these direct
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:46.880]   response companies too oh yeah and most honestly most
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.200]   podcast advertising directly copies are model i mean we kind of pioneered the
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.440]   whole damn thing yeah yeah but uh that's fine i mean it's just i i
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.480]   think i don't know i'm getting to be an old man
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.880]   i actually have a new theory which i'm going to spring on you guys
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:05.840]   i don't know if i go for tell everybody do it do it
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.280]   i've been reading and i highly recommend it uh you've all know a
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.120]   harari's new book if you read homo say uh was it
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:17.360]   se homos homo deus and his previous book sapiens
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.360]   he's a uh israeli uh professor philosophy
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.120]   a deep thinker he's loved in silicon valley which is interesting because he's
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.680]   not a huge fan of silicon valley uh his newest is 21 lessons for the
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.520]   21st century and admittedly i haven't got to the end of it yet but he makes a
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.560]   very strong case at the beginning for just
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.280]   humans are terrible at deciding things like driving cars
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.560]   right we're we know that a million and a quarter people die every year
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:49.520]   in car accidents if you had autonomous you know if you if you if you have if you
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.480]   said it's illegal for humans to drive let the computers drive
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.920]   that number would shrink to maybe a thousand ten thousand a hundred thousand
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:02.960]   but shrink by a order of magnitude at least probably a hundred times less
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:08.640]   if uh if as ais get better at diagnosing illness they're not there yet i
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.040]   admittedly why would you let a human with all our human foibles and failings
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.120]   diagnose your illness if an ai could do it and then he goes on to say and
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.960]   honestly really music should be tailored to your emotional reactions as soon as
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:25.280]   we can get you know a headband that gives you fMRI capable readings might as
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.720]   well have the music tailored to what you're in the mood for
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.040]   and it will super i just i just happened to see at this moment a facebook ad for
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.240]   mindset head that headset that reads your brain
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.040]   activity yeah and i i look at this we're way this is years and years and years
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.760]   off but i can't wait to see where this goes
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:49.280]   if if humans can't be trusted to set election
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.600]   districts let the machines do it to avoid gerrymandering
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.280]   what the humans do is they set goals as in with with health
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.200]   you know what's the max what's the better what's the best health outcome
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:03.840]   and maybe i don't know maybe because it's the best health health outcome per
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.760]   dollar you could probably throw that in
[00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.600]   uh with driving what's the fewest number of fatalities
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.600]   uh humans can set the goals for gerrymandering or not gerrymandering you
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.680]   know what's the most representative way to
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.360]   set up our congressional districts ultimately
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.680]   follow me down this road as a eyes get better
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.880]   humans should probably set the goals
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.560]   but they can't be trusted to really implement
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.280]   just like self-driving cars we can set a goal we want fewest traffic fatalities
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:39.840]   and let the self-driving cars do it which is how all of this auditing of
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.880]   platforms and stuff should be able to say and you don't don't see the
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:48.560]   algorithm see the see the outcome yeah so yes exactly so we got to be careful
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.360]   on look we're at early days so you can you can pull up
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.880]   many ways it doesn't work yet including self-driving vehicles
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.760]   but is but if you could get a i to really work
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:01.600]   first of all how would you implement such a thing how would you
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.480]   because i'm saying let go and let google let let the ai do it
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.440]   now okay but it was a google you trust or who do you
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.720]   what humans set the goals who do you trust what's the mechanism for setting
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.840]   the goals but but let's assume we could solve that
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:20.640]   and maybe we can't but but we it's got to be better than we got
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.760]   why isn't the next why isn't our next government
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.920]   going to be based on technology and ai human shouldn't be allowed to vote
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.360]   we don't vote panic we stop we yeah i agree on that but
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.800]   we don't we don't vote with our brains we vote with our hearts
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:39.920]   everybody knows that but sometimes that's good when
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.800]   well sometimes i can't think of any good
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.240]   you can think of bad examples i can think of a lot of bad examples i mean
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.600]   really honestly brexit is a bad example yeah
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.400]   yeah i mean the for me the problem is that artificial intelligence and
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.560]   algorithms are are just expressions of humanity
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.000]   i mean the way you design precisely exactly right
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.080]   exactly right people encode their biases into software so here's what i
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.640]   submit when we talk about ai we are thinking we often think about the
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.880]   wrong hazard we think about machines that are going to take over right the
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:19.200]   terminator scenario that's not actually what's going to happen
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.280]   these ais are going to be human they're just going to be very fast smart
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.760]   calculating machines they're going to be like alpha zero
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.240]   that taught itself to be the best chess player go player
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.440]   and shogi player in the world beating everybody humans and machines
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.160]   and it taught itself without any examples only knowing the rules so it was told
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.880]   here's what you need to solve and it didn't for hours
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.920]   yep now i know we're at early days but assume that that progress continues in
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:55.120]   ten fifty a hundred years we can we can say look this is what humans should do
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:58.880]   we should set our goals we should say what it means to win a
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.240]   chess game or what it means to drive safely but then we should let
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.800]   implement leave implementation to ais and then i think you're exactly right
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.920]   Matthew the questions we should now be asking are not how do we keep the
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.160]   machines from killing us oh my god it's the terminator
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.040]   what we should be asking is how do you do that how do you determine what the
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.120]   goals are right how do you implement the machine no
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:25.280]   better how to train a machine without infecting it with our own
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.680]   biases and i would argue that very quickly i would argue that very quickly
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.120]   once you get beyond things like say driving
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.800]   or playing chess once you get into sort of messy human
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.520]   problems like who should get health care who should get uh
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.600]   once you get into problems like that coming up with the goals and how you
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.800]   implement them is actually way harder than sort of
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.240]   incorporating those goals into software maybe yeah but i mean i think we could
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.640]   come up with an algorithm for who should get health care
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.920]   where does this go okay for their podcast business Leo
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.600]   i have the podcast are gone long gone 20 thought i thought you had i thought
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.160]   i was all going to give you a new business i was trying to bring this back to
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.520]   podcast no no i'm done with five times algorithms will do the
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.600]   podcast down the road algorithm okay i won't look at first of all we're
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:19.200]   gonna have a big problem because 90 of us won't have jobs anyway
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.480]   but you'll you'll still be alive you'll be like a head in a jar or something
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:27.760]   i mean honestly i know i think podcast could be
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.280]   create i mean if ais get to that stage podcast could be created by ais just
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.880]   much oh yeah a hit song could be created by an ais there writing news stories
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.720]   yeah you know there's robots right and it may still be me hosting because they
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.520]   god knows we have hundreds of thousands of hours of me
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:47.040]   that could easily be used to create an ai if people out of that oh brainer
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.080]   you probably want something more attractive but
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.760]   or they would use your sort of avatar and they would do use deep fake video
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:59.040]   faking technology and stuff like the words yeah exactly but it would look
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.120]   like you no and that ai would generate the content probably do that today
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.800]   we're we're actually fairly close to that right deep fakes is right example
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:11.760]   oh yeah yeah did you see the um i think it was in
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.960]   video actually came out with a whole bunch of photos
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:20.960]   of faces and i think cars and there was another category
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:26.240]   and they were all generated by ai so none of them both free people but but
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.200]   they were yeah right here but the thing is they were um they're
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.480]   caught so they were arguing they're actually they were still
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.320]   combinations of features they were inspired by faces there was a starting
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.800]   tilt but still none of those faces actually exist
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.320]   in the world and yet they're totally 100%
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:46.560]   believe it
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.640]   and there's a point being that we aren't at
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:54.480]   that turning point that inflection point yet
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.560]   but it's coming and it's coming fast and you look at this and that's
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:03.200]   we you know that's become a long way in a very short period of time
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.720]   those are not real people but you never know there's not real people
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.520]   my fear is if you have say the health care algorithm that determines who
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:17.600]   gets health care then people will kind of
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.080]   absolve themselves of of any need to think about it because they'll say well
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.400]   the algorithm decides who lives and who dies the algorithm decides
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.960]   who gets cars gets medicine that's being discussed with with cars right
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:36.160]   as it should be humans are terrible drivers and i think also if given a
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.000]   choice of killing the five-year-old or the eight-year-old
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.120]   it's because it knows enough to be able to make that choice yeah but i think
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.360]   that that i think the trolley problems a little bit of a
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.200]   mcguffin i don't i i don't know read herring i don't i don't think a little
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.480]   bit because really a car what's a million in a quarter people die every
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.560]   year in auto accidents what all you have to do is tell the
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.520]   ai drive as best you possibly can
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:05.040]   to maximize human life and minimize damage destruction
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.320]   but human life and people will die in the car whatever of all kinds of the
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.120]   person in the car in the car and out of the car and property
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:17.040]   destruction and you can make you can easily think of a set of rules that you
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.720]   would follow the three laws of robotics not those those are
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.280]   made up but seriously you could come up with a with a couple of real rules
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.480]   and yes people would still die and there would still be pedestrians run over and
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.200]   there'd be people will still die for sure but not a
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.400]   quarter one and a quarter million people yeah but you know what's going to happen
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.120]   we we already had that first case in Phoenix where the woman died but she
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.760]   was uh apparently homeless and perhaps a bit
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.200]   the car doesn't need to know that that car that's not in the algorithm out of
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.200]   what i'm saying is people didn't didn't have a a complete psycho fit about that
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:54.960]   but what's going to happen is one of these cars is going to kill somebody yeah
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.480]   and the argument and we're going to have a full moral panic and the argument
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.800]   that well but it killed um you know one tenth
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:06.320]   the number that the physical drivers killed won't go anywhere
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.720]   people will be in a in a in a jitter yeah elon
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.640]   elon keeps mentioning that whenever someone brings up
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:16.720]   you know that that it's not safe he keeps pointing out that the things that
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.800]   we drive every day are also not even close to being safe
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.960]   and yet you know they're a hundred times more unsafe and yet we're perfectly
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:30.800]   happy to keep driving around i bet you that the mark zuckerberg and the
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.960]   sergs and the larry pages of the world in the back of their minds are having
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:42.080]   this exact thought that really every why are we letting humans run anything
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.800]   let's come up with some basic you know goals some tenets
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:51.680]   some values and let the ai do it but that's why it's so important
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.520]   that it's not just people like mark zuckerberg who can make these decisions
[00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.560]   or incorporate their biases into the algorithms we like i agree
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.680]   problem that's where we should be thinking exactly right you got it
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.960]   there's got to be a lot more diversity not just of
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:10.800]   you know skin color but economic background and
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:14.720]   world experience and i mean you've got to have can't just have
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.680]   this tiny tiny subsection of rich kids we're worried about killer robots we
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.520]   should instead be worried about how do you design the tenants the values
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.800]   what are our values and how do you build that into a machine
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.400]   and i don't think i mean i'll look at uh alphas zero didn't do machine
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.760]   learning really it was it was told with the goals of the game
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:38.240]   were and left on its own devices to play millions and millions of games
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.800]   against itself to figure out what the best strategies were
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.200]   that's probably the right way to do it so i put in the rundown the google has
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:50.160]   put out its pot it previously put out its policies for a i
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:54.080]   now it's put out its procedure for how it's going to review those policies
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.120]   so it's it's like a that's what i'm saying is
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.560]   i think they've already gone down this road and they're thinking about this one
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.720]   of the reasons i think haraari is so
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:07.680]   lionized in uh silicon valley invited to dinners and
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.480]   there was a big article in the new york times about him
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.520]   a couple weeks ago and about they were puzzled like
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:17.520]   this guy is telling us that the big tech companies are a problem and that
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.280]   there's going to be a useless class of people a large group of people who can't
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.200]   work who have no value to the machines and why is silicon valley
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.560]   lionizing him because he's taking them down that path
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.440]   and they're already thinking about these kinds of things
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.920]   and they're thinking about i think the right problem which is
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.840]   how do you how do you choose what you're going to optimize for it and then
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.760]   let the machines do the optimization oh when does when does the
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:45.600]   choice become you know when do we we make bad choices and the machine can make
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.720]   a better choice for us in every respect almost right
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.160]   right so well hara uses an example choosing
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.880]   what your career is going to be you this is something you deal with every day
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:33:00.800]   jeff people use all sorts of incorrect
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.760]   you know theories about life and we're terrible at choosing our about themselves
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.800]   about themselves i'm going to be a lawyer because i really loved i love
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:13.360]   thinking about deep philosophical stuff and then they find out it has nothing
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.120]   to do with that but that's actually but that's where a lot of the magic of
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.480]   life comes serendipity yeah that's the serendipity argument right
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.560]   and you also get people who you know you get incredibly tortured
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.120]   people who did all the wrong things who become incredible artists because they
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:34.480]   find something in that not every single person who does that obviously but
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.400]   that if you you see that you know that the oyster needs a kernel of sand that
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.520]   make a per yeah and if and if some computer said you
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.440]   here's what you should do instead we would have lost that person and all the
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.600]   things that they created out of frustration you're making an
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:53.600]   argument for suffering you understand that Matthew yeah yeah okay
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.000]   definitely okay
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.840]   i don't know i'm gonna i think that i have this idea it's and it's a it's a
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.520]   it's just a kernel of an idea but i'm gonna i think pursue this i this may be
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:13.360]   my new and final because once manifest manifesto manifesto my last
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.680]   Leo's last testament from your cabin yeah in the woods yeah i'm gonna
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.920]   make a bumper sticker let go and let the ai do it i think you're right though
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:27.440]   that the that's sort of coming up with how we decide on the goals
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:32.240]   and how we incorporate those is way more important than
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:36.480]   you know worrying about you know whether software is
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.680]   gonna kill us or whether terminator is gonna right like it's it's actually
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.840]   more scary because it's so it's gonna be so hard to do
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.560]   you know it's gonna make self-driving cars look like
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.960]   a day at the beach yeah we already have evidence that there are
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.880]   there are a lot of human endeavors computers do a better job with

[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:46.800]   major according to the wall street journal new expansion
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.760]   a billion dollars in capital improvements to establish a new campus
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:54.800]   google hudson square where's hudson squares that is that uh that's uh
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:59.120]   um just uptown a bit from where they are now
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:04.400]   yeah this is in addition to the uh the fishyards that they bought or whatever
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:08.240]   no they they owned the the old port authority building and then the
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.800]   Nabisco biscuit works that were next door they all have that
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:17.680]   and and they port authority building is i mean it's a new york city block solid
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.320]   it's just huge it's huge uh and so they have all of that they built
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.680]   they bought the building next door and they're buying up um
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:29.360]   three buildings north of there i mean to call it a campus in new york is kind
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.720]   of silly it's too spread out to be a campus
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.520]   chelsea market that's what i was thinking chelsea market yeah yeah that
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.200]   that used to be the Nabisco factory
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:43.120]   so they're kind of spread out they're not in all one spot they have seven
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:49.040]   same as mountain view we know view right you know we're building uh four
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.600]   hundred seventy three oh that's five miles away
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:57.680]   what is it is it easier to attract uh young smart people to uh work in
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:01.520]   new york city is that it yeah because it's the center of the f and
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.080]   universe oh yeah i sure i'm asking the wrong guy
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.520]   what do you mean what the cadet is there
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:11.520]   i think they could probably get some people to go there
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.000]   who might not you know want to move to mountain view for whatever reason
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.680]   what was that new yorker cartoon they it was a cover
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.840]   where they had a picture of the map of the u.s
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.000]   and uh but as but it was as uh conceived
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.160]   by a uh new yorker
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:37.520]   i wish i could find it basically it was it was the new york and the rest
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:42.960]   yeah you can find any job yeah anyway
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:47.120]   this is no this isn't it uh
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.400]   anyway very search New York here it is here it is
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.280]   view of the world from ninth avenue yeah view of the world here it is
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.680]   view of the world from ninth avenue there's ninth avenue
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:01.600]   hudson river jersey is a little strip and then
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:06.480]   the rest of the country the pacific ocean that's basically that's that's your
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:11.280]   that's your world view isn't it yeah yeah you got a problem with that buddy
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.520]   yeah
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:19.280]   it's not even new york it's ninth and tenth avenue basically
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:23.760]   and the chelsea fish market was just brilliant in the bisco building
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.320]   well that's where google is right it's avenue it is the view it actually
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   worked the view from google i have to do a new one
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:36.960]   uh the interesting somebody pointed this out yesterday
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:40.560]   they didn't do what amazon did which is basically get information about
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:45.360]   every every major city in the country is run and which tax breaks were best
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.400]   before they you know they didn't have a beauty beauty talent
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:52.320]   search before they picked their uh they said right i was just good to man
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.800]   hadn't apples to in austin apples building a new
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:02.320]   austin campus big right big one yeah
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.760]   um why do companies make a big deal about this is this to prove that they're
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.880]   not they're not silicon valley they're not i think so parlor yeah
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:15.040]   i think so but if you were gonna do that you wouldn't be in new york
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:20.320]   you'd be in atlanta or nashville or
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:23.760]   you know someplace where you could get a sense of the country better
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:27.520]   or
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.440]   or someplace that needs it like mrs. p but of course what am i was to is there's
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:36.000]   there's a huge amount of talent in new york it is the the childhood dream of
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.360]   conquering gothan and they're going to be keep competing against amazon
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:42.400]   or if you can make it there you can make it anywhere
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.280]   yeah that's why it's kind of surprising though that they would move
[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.880]   i mean that's where amazon's building uh by least half of its second
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:53.920]   headquarters is across the bridge in long island
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.120]   though the only in new york would complain about that
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:43:01.440]   it's in queens everybody's complaining about this are they see i told you
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.600]   you said it's oh no that's all new york
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:08.960]   said well technically but good enough for us uh because um
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:12.960]   uh there was some there's gonna be some gentrification there's some
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.760]   affordable housing that was supposed to be built it's not gonna be built
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.840]   uh there's a strain on the number seven subway and a strain on public services
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.440]   so one of my students is and social journalism is doing
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:28.000]   uh that as our community is the people in that neighborhood and that issue
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.600]   and we were out for the last class we went out my colleague karae brown
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.040]   took all the students out for drinks and we're sitting there
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:38.720]   and suddenly one of our colleagues looked up and realized
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:43.760]   the person covering this story on amazon is named
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:47.200]   like so wow
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:52.240]   she has a deep hatred of everything amazon because of that
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.120]   seems fitting so whole generation of women named
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:59.040]   the growing up today who hate with a passion
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.880]   hate and people ordering them around asking them questions
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.920]   just like we used to anyway google has a little bit of a diversity
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.880]   problem it turns out a vast number of uh google
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:19.120]   employees almost half our part time only 50 percent our full-time
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:27.600]   employees 49.95 are tvc's yeah tvc's what's a tvc temporary
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:34.720]   vendor or contractor oh wow you know Gary's vendor team just
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.480]   completed a big milestone this is from the google uh training document
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.800]   he wants to reward them with shirts in the google store should he
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   uh Gary should not reward them with shirts why
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.240]   swag bonuses and other gifts are considerable taxable income to the
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:54.480]   individual which alphabet cannot report since we are not the tvc
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.360]   employer it can also raise ethics and compliance
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:02.320]   concerns finally they don't they don't report t-shirts to the irs
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.520]   finally we need to respect and adhere to local laws and
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:10.160]   regulations and tvc employers may have strict policies about receiving
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:13.760]   gifts which is that's you know i was gonna make fun of this
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:17.280]   until then that's if you don't get swag and these are we're gonna google what
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:22.400]   the heck is the wait wait gary said how can we show appreciation for tvc's
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.760]   right a thank you note right a thank you note
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.240]   send them a note on google plus
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.760]   a sincere thank you from all of us at google
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.280]   perform an interpretive dance
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:48.240]   the festival oh yeah this is a grievance
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:52.640]   you cannot give half of your employees but this is actually this was not the
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.840]   first time we've heard this that that they they are stingy with most
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.120]   in most of this employees because they're not employees they're contractors
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.600]   you don't get the free candy or anything yeah
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:06.000]   it's not for you probably can't ride the bikes even
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.080]   oh yes they can ride the bikes i was surprised it was 50 percent
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:16.240]   it's such an red badges versus white badges
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.800]   the article this is not just people in mountain view at hq
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.960]   no this is generally the world every rush but this is how it is in the world
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.560]   right i mean yes you know we we have full-time employees
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.280]   you guys are not your contractors but you only do one show a day
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:38.640]   or rather a week with us but we have full-time employees but we keep saying
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.520]   we really should stop paying these people benefits
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.400]   we really need some we need to really need some
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:48.000]   contractors uh oh i'm afraid i'm afraid karstin's gonna start a strike on
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.400]   the show contractors are the best
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.160]   and this is what happens i tell you
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.640]   red red badges versus white badges the guardian again
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:05.040]   matt was on his way to a quote whole team meeting for a project he was working on
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:08.880]   when he noticed that one of his co-workers a test engineer was still at his desk
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:13.040]   oh you should come matt a google software engineer will call sing
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:16.160]   only to be told the meeting was not actually for the whole team
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:20.000]   temps vendors and contractors were not allowed
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.560]   the guy sits with us like literally next to my desk he's got better knowledge than
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:29.120]   me about the parts of the project to be honest it changes the dynamic a lot
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:33.360]   but this is a part of this comes from uh iris regulations you if you are going to
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:37.600]   use contractors because there was an abuse of this right for a long time
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.280]   yeah companies would print you know i you're a contractor john
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:44.800]   and uh he'd be doing exactly the same work as a full-time employee except i don't
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:48.080]   have to give him benefits and so and the iris said no they're not
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:51.280]   contractors and you have to pay taxes and benefits
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:56.080]   so that's why google and other companies now make this very clear line
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.600]   it also seems like the way they describe it it also seems like
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:03.120]   it's partly a security thing they're not allowed to go to
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.240]   all hands meetings they're not allowed to go to the friday
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.920]   meetings where you can ask questions of executives
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:13.200]   and i feel like part of that is they don't want leaks
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.440]   right
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.600]   wow half of their staff yeah that's a lot
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.080]   i would have thought maybe like a third or last but half a thought when i
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:26.640]   when i want to hire somebody to like just write an article
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:32.400]   for my center yeah um we basically have to hire
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:35.920]   really yeah and yeah and then i end up paying money
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:40.160]   for benefits they never see because they only work you know a week so
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:44.640]   for a long time in silicon valley uh that what they would do microsoft used to do
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.880]   this because i know because i have friends who work for them
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:51.200]   they would have a company that's not microsoft hire them pay them
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.280]   i'm sure that's what kubil's doing and it gives them an arms-length relationship
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:57.840]   with these people even though they're coming in they're working they're
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.720]   doing the same job they're not working for and they are
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.200]   that's like black water they're working for somebody else
[00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:07.760]   or remember when the security people did get hired as google employees
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.040]   because there was kind of a movement right about two three years ago
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:16.320]   right i would say at some point when you're hideously profitable you probably
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.840]   this is the this is the other odd argument when you look at companies like
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.760]   amazon where they're really making a lot of money
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:29.520]   um is it still sensible for them to be so hard in their staff and employees
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.200]   i'm particularly warehouse employees shouldn't it certainly makes sense with
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.680]   amazon i mean it looks bad on that company it looks
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.320]   like one more is famous for that right there
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:42.240]   like you're you're making more money than any company has ever made
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:46.800]   probably in history but you won't let your you know
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:51.200]   drivers take a bathroom break and you won't let them sit down for five
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:56.080]   minutes it just seems inhuman walmart obviously
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:00.320]   they have to go away anyway half of walmart's workforce part-time
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:05.280]   yeah um one of my favorite features i don't know if you read it
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:12.080]   was about the retired people who live in uh motor homes and work in amazon
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.680]   warehouses particularly around holidays like christmas
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:20.720]   and they're basically it's the new micros but it's the new migrant later
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:24.800]   and lots of them lost their homes or whatever in the recession or
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.120]   you know invested badly and they're 70 years old they're living in a van
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:34.720]   and amazon lets them camp in the parking lot and then they work in the warehouse
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:40.800]   and it was just a fascinating and and kind of horrifying story
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:44.400]   and there's dispensers on the wall of like pain
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:48.960]   pills and stuff like that you know so that you can keep working longer
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:52.480]   it's luise you know what i so i just happened i just searched for i was i was
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.920]   looking i was looking for the hiring of the security guards but i i happened
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:51:00.160]   upon a linkedin page google employee reviews for security officer
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:04.160]   they're in love it's five stars five stars love being at this place helping
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.840]   people that needed my help felt good to see people leave with smiles in their
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:11.440]   faces this made my job fun i had fun can you
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.160]   can you shut up and wake up and enjoy working for google we're gonna lose
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.760]   mo he's gonna go to work for google
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:21.280]   moh put fingers in your ears we can't moh can't work for us because he
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:26.000]   carries a weapon and uh the insurance for us if we had
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.320]   him as a full-time employee would be a big issue uh our insurers won't let us
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:34.160]   employ somebody who carries a gun as part of his job
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:37.760]   so he has to work for a security agency which we then pay right
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:43.440]   right so in their california has new rules by the way about contracting
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:47.040]   plays because this was a big issue scooter ex
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:51.760]   tells me that uh these lawsuits against microsoft in california
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.720]   temps can work for a finite time they have to be off for three months then come
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.400]   back in the words you can't just continue to work
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:00.960]   yeah full-time and i should point out that media companies have been very bad at
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:06.320]   that i know i worked on contracts that were extended and extended
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.120]   until the union basically complained and said
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:15.520]   look you have to either create a job or you know get rid of this person
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:21.600]   that's how i want you to get transferred from tech tv to g4 worked we all worked
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.720]   as contractors oh that's so sad this carsten who
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:28.080]   was at tech tv when it got bought by comcast
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:32.800]   and then moved to l_a_ and they adopted the standard hollywood practice of
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.360]   saying well you're not employees
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:40.320]   your contractors uh and let's not forget uber does that too right
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:44.960]   i yeah and i completely understand as an employer i understand it i mean it
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:50.000]   but you know you just i seem sad but
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.080]   huh and they're not going to be going to work in china so i'm a pursuit of profit
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:58.240]   people yeah i don't know uh let's talk about facebook
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:02.480]   uh boy there's a lot about facebook why not jeez
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:06.720]   jeff do you want to just take the next segment off
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:10.400]   no i mean okay full disclosure is that i raised money for my school from facebook
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.040]   i'm independent of facebook i received a money personally from facebook or any
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.520]   of the platforms but boy are they messing up
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:21.200]   except you know and and and and i've been i don't know how to write about this
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:26.160]   frankly um because where do you start um but any other problem is though so
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:30.160]   so today the new york times said that facebook had shared data including
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:35.120]   private messages with big company partners and and and and everyone had a
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:39.040]   proper fit about it but then please say that again
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.680]   including private messages including private messages
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:47.520]   including private messages then i read that i read facebook's response
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:51.840]   and i don't know what to make up yes yeah so
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:56.480]   so there's definitely truth on both sides i mean the private messages thing
[00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:00.000]   facebook's argument is it was specifically designed so you could share a song and
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.800]   spotify through your private messages so in order to allow spotify to do that
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.120]   oh it had a give spotify access to your messages right that doesn't mean spotify
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.320]   could read and write messages on messenger
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:16.480]   like some of this is i think intentional misunderstanding
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:20.880]   as often the case mainstream media kind of will fully sensationalizes
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.760]   yes and i should also i don't know if you guys notice but somebody pointed out
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:30.240]   that way way down in the story it mentions that the new york times was
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.920]   actually a part with the day where the one one of the ones that got this
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.720]   information right and they they did it because they
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.840]   had a sort of social story sharing
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:43.520]   feature that they wanted to implement that if they eventually killed
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:46.640]   and if and if there's one thing i think you could
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:51.520]   argue is bad a bunch of this stuff was killed and then facebook just left the
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.040]   apis open like just left them sitting there
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:59.760]   so they the features died but arguably the access was still
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:04.160]   available that's a that's definitely a flaw
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:07.600]   okay some of the stuff we've we've read about already right some of it is
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:12.400]   and so in the early field of it right in the early days before there were apps
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.920]   facebook had to allow phone makers to incorporate
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:19.680]   facebook into the phone and in order to do that they had to give
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:23.200]   the phone makers access to right apis that makes sense
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:26.720]   so that one doesn't seem like that big a deal
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.720]   but the more modern ones were it was giving them access and then
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:35.120]   not really telling people i think that's to some extent there's a
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:39.280]   disclosure problem there it was clear that there's been that
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:42.000]   and their argument is oh Spotify should have told you that
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.720]   or amazon should have told you that or the new year time
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.960]   they were going to start i put the the response up in the
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:52.240]   in the um oh good chat yeah um and they're saying that there was always
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.520]   permission they said none of it violates the fdc and they say this was
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:59.840]   done mainly between 2010 and 2014 so there were things as in the early days
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:04.160]   of facebook all around there were things that would never fly today
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:08.880]   never so this is this is by the way important because one of the accusations
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:12.320]   is they had a consent decree with the ftc
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:15.840]   and then in doing this they might have violated that and facebook says to be
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:21.120]   clear these did not violate our 2012 sentiment well but they don't get to
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.960]   decide that right yeah ftc will be a judge of that yeah
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:31.680]   right exactly so okay so which is it is it uh i mean it's really ironic that
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.280]   the new york times is one of these companies
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:40.160]   well see prior discussion about data yeah yeah right uh uh
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.280]   advertisers want it media companies want it facebook and google are the only
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.120]   ones that go to doing it and we we in media clamored for the opportunity to
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:50.880]   get data and to this day every meeting i go to
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:55.920]   what am i meeting people beg google and facebook for user data yeah
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:00.560]   every single you could argue that in fact it's like a it's like
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:05.280]   looking back in time reading that story and you look at all the services and
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:08.080]   all the things that facebook offered and and how
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.000]   adding social elements to everything was great and everybody wanted to do it and
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   and every no one thought about the exchange of data and you know it's just
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.920]   oh yeah we can you know connect our calendars and our
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.960]   song choices and everything to facebook it's super great
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:27.600]   and and now it's all horrifying all the things that we sort of
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:31.600]   right things are changed right yeah honestly as facebook points out we
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   all signed up for this instant personalization stuff we
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:40.000]   we wanted our facebook account to link to rotten tomatoes or yelp or and i think
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.320]   facebook could still have that if they had been smart about how they had informed
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:48.080]   us disclosed remember we went through the circles of privacy where they keep
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:51.120]   on changing the privacy center that was what this was this was yeah
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:56.560]   so then now today you have tons of people who were or and clearly famous people
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.200]   uh who were saying i'm quitting facebook so my
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.920]   tweet of the day they got me in a little trouble in some places i said i want to
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.760]   quit the platform people are using to brag to the world uh that they are
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:09.600]   quitting platforms um because i'm just getting sick of it
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.320]   and it's tons of it but i got into discussion with julia ioffee as a journalist i
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:15.840]   respect greatly who covers russia and she asked on twitter she said i'm
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:19.520]   tempted to quit but this is where russia is being discussed by people and my
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:22.720]   advice was journables need to listen you need to be there
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.800]   and everything that i put up on facebook i presume to be public there's no privacy
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:30.720]   and anything i do on facebook um i go back and forth about that
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:34.560]   the reason i'm not on facebook is not because i worry about the privacy
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:39.120]   implications it's more uh a moral stand i don't want to support the company because
[00:58:39.120 --> 00:58:44.160]   i i feel like the companies uh uh practices are questionable
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:48.000]   and walt mossberg said the same thing when he just when he announced that he was
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.840]   quitting yeah he said it doesn't it doesn't fit
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:57.760]   with his sort of moral principles and code he tries to live by and admittedly it
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:01.120]   impedes my ability to do my job i couldn't get the facebook it portal
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:05.520]   until i reactivated my facebook account bought the portal and then deactivated
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:08.880]   and the portal doesn't fully work without a facebook account right and i
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:13.760]   argued to julie on on on the twitter discussion and others that um
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:17.680]   we in journalism need more ways to listen to people not fewer
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:21.360]   uh and so i agree not from the company but from the people who were there
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:25.440]   but i do wonder and i've been thinking about this a bit the more people
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:28.480]   quit so tim woo said that he was quitting
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.120]   um you know while mossberg said he was quitting
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:37.200]   um and i i i get your point and i know mandy jenkins made the same
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:41.280]   point in an essay that we have to be in these places
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:46.080]   but i still feel like journalists particularly not just you and i being
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:50.720]   on it but journalistic organizations media organizations
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:55.360]   being partners with facebook integrating themselves with facebook i think
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:57.680]   there's a there is a conflict there is because the
[00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.600]   because the public we know because you you're looking at it as corporate to
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.640]   corporate you're not seeing the forest for the
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:08.880]   you know the trees from the forest it is to some extent you're supporting
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:13.680]   this entity and they're supporting them our entities
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.680]   yeah so it's codependent no question i'm just wondering whether or also is
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.000]   about where the people are and we serve the public and that's and that's what
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.080]   matters to me because we're journalists right but if the people and i'm not
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.920]   saying facebook is this but if facebook was a deeply unethical
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.560]   organization should we still use it just because a bunch of people are there
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:38.080]   well you know i was talking about it a little bit much we had paris martin
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:42.800]   on that's what last week and she had to use she has to use gab because her
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:48.720]   be unwired requires that she cover uh the kinds of things that are going on
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.800]   on for chananda and so she has to stay there that doesn't mean an endorsement
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:55.760]   of it and then i think is i think that's absolutely an
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.440]   exception so that's why i was making an exception or a
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.600]   distinction between me as a person and as a journalist being there
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.760]   well my company integrated my companies on facebook we have a twit page on
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.560]   facebook we also are on twitter i'm not but i've got a company i work with
[01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:16.480]   that uh is doing facebook watch uh they're reaching a tremendously
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.800]   large audience for it they're getting paid for it
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:25.520]   um uh our at our graduation on friday um jonay Ramos from uni was on and he
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.120]   was talking about how you know there are watch and he's getting an audience
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:33.040]   sometimes on watch that's equivalent to what he gets on tv
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:38.880]   and he's serving a public that's there and so it's it's it's it's and that only
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.520]   can happen because not being i mean jonay was very early in this
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.560]   uh you know two presidential elections ago he was on
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:50.320]   online with video and on facebook and it was pretty amazing so he's made
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:56.720]   a huge following there um so partly it is him but but without the company
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.480]   wouldn't be there but it's also but it's also where the audience he's trying to
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:04.320]   reach our right bingo bingo and it depends on who you are i mean
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.960]   mike.com admittedly mike.com had lots of other problems but yeah
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.800]   they spent a bunch of money and built up the big team to create a facebook
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:18.880]   watch program and facebook said facebook said we don't want it and so
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.920]   and then my company is out of business yeah
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.440]   person i respect greatly in this field and disagree with all the time but
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.440]   seva vareenathian uh is i think the most intellectual
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.040]   critic of facebook out there he has a new book out a few months old
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:37.040]   about this but he argued in the new york times and argues strangely that don't
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.480]   quit facebook fix it it's almost like a political structure
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:43.760]   that if you walk away that's a position of privilege
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:48.640]   because you kind of can but if you're in how can i fix facebook you can't fix it
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:52.880]   mark zuckerberg controls it this is we interviewed seva about his book anti
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.760]   social media how facebook disconnects us
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:58.880]   and undermines democracy now at that time when we interviewed him which was in
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.640]   june i think he was saying get off facebook so he might have changed to
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.760]   no he no he wrote a piece in large that he linked to today okay
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:11.360]   saying don't get off okay um i misunderstood him i mean you and i can
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.560]   explain about facebook highly critical yeah yeah yeah so we blew
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.440]   till we're glint in the face they're not going to change because we
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.640]   say we don't like it i just i just i know we go through a whole list of
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:24.240]   features that aren't being done anymore because of public pressure
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.240]   i just can't do it it's not even this whole discussion doesn't
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.520]   hit me because i just i can't bring myself to be there i just
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.240]   i feel it's unseated what is it about it that bothers you it's unsavory
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:38.880]   it's a crim i feel like it's almost participating in a criminal
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:42.160]   organization i'm not going to try to fix it with from within i don't think i
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.040]   can i think you're right it's mark's place i just don't want to participate
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.320]   i might miss the people there including matthew engram i don't miss
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.520]   anybody and by the way every time i thank you every time i deactivate
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.920]   they put pictures of you and matthew and others
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:59.440]   saying oh jeff is gonna be really sad what are you gonna say
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.720]   oh i do miss you lia i do i didn't realize this but
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.080]   apparently it's sending to each and every one of my friends
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.640]   lio's no longer your friend every time i deactivate
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:18.880]   and that's a that's a nasty thing to do i'm i'm a i wasn't gonna say anything
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:22.640]   i'm not it's not personal i do feel this though
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:27.120]   it you know in the early days facebook was this wonderful thing
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:32.160]   and mark was this bright shining you know creative individual
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.520]   who came up with this great idea and and
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:40.160]   you know we've really seen it moved to the complete opposite end of the spectrum
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.160]   where people even people who aren't in media
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:49.760]   art in technology have said to me the same thing you said lio that they feel
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.480]   and maybe it's because of the reporting i don't know
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:57.120]   but they feel icky using it they feel they're being
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.520]   used and if you tracked and they're right
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.920]   feel like they're complicit in some sense and in this creepy enterprise
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.840]   that's i'm gonna repeat again this is this is a this is a privileged view for
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.520]   those of us you know when newsrooms look like the three of us
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.080]   and if you're a woman in america if you're african-american america if you're
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:20.080]   latino in america or media don't cover you you have no voice you have no way to
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.520]   speak these platforms both facebook and twitter as well as instagram and
[01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.320]   others give you a mechanism to speak that enabled
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.080]   living well if i were to meet you if i were a woman i would not be on
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.440]   twitter bathy wrote the story every 30 seconds true
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.480]   of female jennel mister politician every 30 seconds is harassed on twitter
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.680]   i'm harassed on twitter in a minute i mean i there's no point in me being on
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.920]   twitter it's just a
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:47.840]   that's a depressing pool depressing survey and i mean it's not just women either by
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:52.320]   the way i or politicians there's harassed general harassment all the
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:54.320]   time and women of color i think it would
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:58.080]   were eighty five percent more likely to be harassed
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:03.920]   so if you want a voice start a podcast read a blog do something but i think
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:09.200]   twitter and facebook are not there is an alternate universe and i i know this
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:13.920]   is crazy to even talk about but there is an alternate universe i think
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:17.920]   where blogs became a social network where all the
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:22.320]   interlinking that we started doing in really crude ways so lovely
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:26.160]   was where that sort of became twitter and facebook
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.320]   like both of those things could have been incorporated
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.080]   mark still still lives in that i know i know could have been an open system
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:36.000]   could have been federated a wider day wider exists to live in that world
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.280]   where we would have been a sort of open api
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:45.680]   and yet here we are so i've been i've been rereading of the rays of the of the
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:48.800]   guy who brought the gutenberg parenthesis to my mind
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:53.360]   tom pettet the academic and then mark and and he argues as you know don't worry
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:57.280]   i'm not going to do it all that we're reverting back to a pre-gutenberg
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.400]   era and that that was an oral based world rather than a
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:04.400]   textual based world and what he argues in that is that was a performance
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:08.080]   based world and what we see happening to a great extent is people are not
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.360]   we immediately are creating content they're not
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.680]   they're performing yeah and they're performing in ways that shock us because
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.320]   that's part of the point and the performing in ways that test
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.520]   borders they're performing in ways that that don't have
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.360]   norms yet uh we're returning to an
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.000]   a society built on a reality over texturality
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.480]   text over text and i think it's a kind of a brilliant insight
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.440]   into so we're we're misinterpreting what people are doing
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.000]   they're not creating when we look at what they're doing is of creating
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.440]   content we say well this is crap how can we allow this
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.320]   but if we say it's people who are performing
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.720]   and acting out something that's what our politics are entirely right now and
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:51.280]   we've got to judge it against that to figure out what they have to do about
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.880]   it that is a great point and i know i've talked to
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:00.720]   josean direction is a Iranian blogger spent six years in prison for
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.520]   blogging because um he uh when he got out he noticed
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:09.760]   that the web had changed and he described very much the same thing
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.920]   his sort of shorthand is that it's becoming like television everything is
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:17.120]   becoming like television so twitter's becoming like television
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:20.880]   facebook's becoming like television televisions take over and not just in
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:25.280]   the sense of video but in the sense of a kind of
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:31.840]   shallowness in a way of and so his view obviously as a person who likes
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.840]   text is that and like particularly like just like
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.520]   yeah and links is that much of this content is
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:44.080]   um just shallow and kind of doesn't it doesn't encourage you to think
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.320]   it encourages you to feel and to feel strong emotions and that that's a
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.960]   condescending way to look at it too i would argue
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.400]   is the problem with television was that television was one tube sent out to
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:57.760]   all of us and now when you go to my favorite conference vidcon
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.160]   what you see is that everyone can make television
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:02.480]   and they're not making it in the ways that we would think and people are going
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:05.040]   to look down their noses out of the production values of this are awful
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.880]   what is that john karen you have awful people like pewdiepie coming in
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.680]   or saying awful things maybe it's an awful person but he says awful things
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.080]   it doesn't matter there's no distinction and right if you say awful things you're
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:19.680]   an awful person i don't care and and so it could set the tweets for Leo
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:24.320]   please good pop you send the tweets to all the tweets to me because i'm not on
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:29.200]   twitter so you can't that's why i'm saying that but i mean clearly he's an
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:33.280]   awful person i know yeah yeah so so i understand why youtube
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:37.840]   well i do understand it's money right but this is sad
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.360]   the money works two ways it's not just the money of oh there's ads on this it's
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:47.680]   also the money of the cost of having to manage all that
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:51.360]   um and and and so we're still we're still in this transition
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:54.080]   manage getting rid of him or manage keeping him
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:56.400]   managed to get rid of a manage to figure out who to get rid of
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:00.960]   the the the the million little oh i know i mean i i'm surprised they got rid of
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:05.920]   Alex Jones i mean honestly i don't they probably wish they could just let
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:10.400]   everything be and not have to be editorializing at any point
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.560]   because it's very difficult yeah i i do think it also came out of a certain
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:18.320]   opt for a blargish optimism yes right yeah uh
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.280]   the verbal they didn't recognize how they're being manipulated yeah
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:25.120]   the sort of Gutenberg you know parenthesis idea i
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.480]   started thinking about specifically with relationship to twitter
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.400]   twitter is much more of verbal sort of oral
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.080]   kind of performance if you will then it is taxed it feels like yeah
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.920]   because you're two but it's not actually like and that's and that's what some
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.520]   have said is the problem with twitter is it it you feel like you're doing these
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.720]   off the cuff you know water cooler remarks but they're
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:51.440]   preserved forever it's exactly it's it's in the worst possible kind of
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:56.160]   gray area between text and perform weren't for that we wouldn't know that
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.240]   Jack Dorsey sent beard shavings to azalea banks to make an amulet
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:04.400]   to protect him from Isis i got a someone has got a like
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:09.440]   fact check that story no this is too good i know it feels too good
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.200]   yeah she tweeted because i don't think you ever shaved his beard you know so
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.320]   well she can just take a little clip you don't eat much
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.520]   the question is did he ever get the amulet
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:22.240]   apparently he did not according to the story he did not
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.960]   this is so he's not protected new music express
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.480]   nick actually is from nick builten right nik nik referred to it in his vanity
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:35.360]   vanity fair piece on uh jack dorsey uh nik's been doing great work covering
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.360]   covering twitter see nik can't quit twitter but i can
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:45.040]   um let's take a little break and uh how about a change log
[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.520]   in just a yeah just a minute some refreshing
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.720]   i mean what's this Brits tell New York Times to sod off oh did you see this
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:58.800]   that was brilliant it is it is so actually the stories here you should go
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.600]   to the original New York Times tweet which it'll have in there

[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.280]   ways to say sod off New York Times the replies sitting on the London
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.960]   underground a passenger met my eyes for more than a second

[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.880]   this is the second time the times has done this to London remember they did a
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:24.560]   thing on how oh food and money's not so bad anymore right

[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.800]   and give you verified approval verified approval has a letter with it that says
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.320]   essentially they're good for it you have the strength of a cash buyer
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.840]   no contingencies moves you're right to the front of the line when you're buying
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.960]   a house i'm taking from me i've bought a lot of houses
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:15.120]   that is that i've been beat out by cash buyers many times
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.760]   never again and then the third part is really timely interest rates again went
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.960]   up today the fed raised interest rates that means your home loan
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.640]   index rate whatever it is will probably go up shortly
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:30.160]   that's nervous making your house hunting and you don't know is the rate going to
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:34.560]   go up is it going to cost us much more over the life of the loan
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:37.120]   not if you have rocket mortgage because
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:40.640]   rate shield approval locks your rate for up to 90 days while you shop you have
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.960]   up to three months to find a home your rate you know what your rate is it

[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:51.200]   actually freights go down your rate will go down it just they just can't go up
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.240]   that's why you want to go right now and lock in the rate before it goes up even

[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:36.720]   by the great jina trip and a many moons ago jeff and i
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:42.320]   just watched as she did it so masterfully she did she was good we miss her but
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.240]   she was jina where for out though jina she was on all about android last night
[01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:48.240]   which broke my heart
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:55.200]   cycle what about us i think it's i i think it well it could be you jeff but i think
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.160]   it also could be
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:02.080]   no she loves you i think it really is that daytime she's working she's got a
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.160]   reach she's got a job yeah unfortunately yeah but if you love jina watch all about
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.320]   android last week all do it was a great episode they had brian bernette came back
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:15.200]   uh ron was in studio i mean it was a really wonderful episode including jina trip
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:22.000]   panney but i in honor of jina trip panney we're going to rename this the jina trip panney memorial
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.400]   google changelog the google changelog
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:32.480]   memorial no not memorial memorial
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:41.200]   uh that's just me i'm just mad she didn't come join us this week on the show in reviews we trust
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:45.280]   making google play ratings and reviews more trustworthy this blew me away
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:54.160]   the google play trust and safety teams this year deployed a system combining human intelligence
[01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:59.600]   with machine learning to detective and force policy violations and ratings and reviews and as
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:09.520]   a result they have clobbered a lot of phony reviews one week a recent week one week millions
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:14.720]   of reviews and ratings detected and removed from the play store thousands of bad apps
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:21.360]   identified due to suspicious reviews and rating activities on them this is a long time coming
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:25.600]   like thank god they finally did that it's i guess a testament to how big the store is but
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:32.800]   also how much frauds going on wow yeah they say if you're a developer don't buy fake or incentivized
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:38.640]   ratings because you might you might be bumped don't run campaigns in app or otherwise it's say
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:43.040]   things like give us five stars and we'll give you this in app item that's not allowed
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.400]   that counts as incentivized ratings is prohibited
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:54.480]   read the developer policy to make sure you're not making violations this you see you used to
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:58.880]   see this anyway all the time you know give us five stars and we'll give you ten percent off
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:05.200]   that's not that's not right if you're a user don't accept receive money or goods even virtual
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:10.480]   ones in exchange for reviews or ratings do not use profanity to criticize an app or a game
[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:12.400]   unless it's effing horrible
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:22.640]   no i added that part don't post it don't post gibberish okay hateful sexual profane are off
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:31.440]   topic reviews they aren't allowed no profanity what you know if i can't say a good juicy swear
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.000]   word every once in a while in a review i don't know what's the point
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:41.040]   helping families develop healthy digital habits with chrome books
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:46.160]   it's a new app the family nanny state knows they're no bad
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:52.000]   added again the family link app helps parents see how they're using their android devices
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.440]   here it is help your family create an android or chrome book well i guess they've extended
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:00.640]   this to chrome books i suppose i think that's right i guess that's the idea
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:07.680]   um the family link app can run on a chrome book anyway keep an eye on screen time so this is
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:12.480]   you know we have all of this kind of on uh for ourselves anyway on android but now you can do
[01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:18.960]   it with your uh with your family and your kids guide kids to good content family link allows
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:24.720]   parents to customize lips so websites kids can visit and review so don't watch youtube then
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:35.200]   such as youtube oh i'm sorry youtube kids or google playbooks uh huh wouldn't want to leave
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:39.920]   youtube at manage google accounts and chrome books from anywhere so that's nice that's nice that's
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:46.160]   the family link app i don't know is it only on the play store but you could use it on your
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:53.280]   i'm that's not clear it's just more family link features that for chrome books so yeah
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:57.520]   is it just for chrome i think you get the android version and it will work on chrome books is my
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:04.800]   sense from reading this so we were talking about artificial intelligence by the way on my chrome
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:12.720]   book i can no longer tell what version i have what they changed the settings and i don't know how
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:17.600]   to find out what must be somewhere like there's gonna be somewhere in the about it oh you know i
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:21.040]   don't have one in front of me there's no bad anymore huh
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:30.400]   google has created a song composing artificial intelligence engine like you were saying just like
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:37.760]   i was saying music transformer uh-huh the transformer sequence must we listen a little bit
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:44.560]   let me see if i can find some examples there you go this is not half bad that's not really
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:53.920]   so okay here's music transformer working with uh the black shalpaz black key etude
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:59.040]   it's pretty bad this is
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:09.280]   that's starting with a real piece of music here is it's not bad it's not bad wait a minute here's
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:16.960]   the song it's better though without any you know any just do on its own
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:21.120]   it's not bad
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.600]   so we use this as our new theme subtle
[01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:31.520]   you got to pay the algorithm i heard a guy in the practice room down at the uh local university
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:36.080]   doing exactly this yeah just kind of playing it sounds like someone's trying to other
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:39.440]   noodling around on the internet noodling
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:44.320]   it's all we do every week is doodle
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:49.840]   jeff jarvis mash potato says go to about chrome os detailed build information
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:58.880]   thank you this actually is not bad it's not bad yeah it's got some weird it's got some weird
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.400]   things in it i'm impressed
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:06.400]   [Music]
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:11.360]   the team concedes music transformer is far from perfect it's sometimes this sounds exactly like
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:18.720]   the music in west world it sounds like the west world theme the team concedes music
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:23.600]   transformer is far from perfect it sometimes reduces songs with too much repetition sparse
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:33.200]   sections and odd jumps hmm sounds that was a sparse section right there yeah this sounds so
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:39.520]   much like west world it does it does do you think the west world theme is generated yeah
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:43.040]   it could be it would be perfect if it were it would be
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:50.480]   what the west world theme is actually a feat that's even harder a human
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:58.160]   composing music to sound like a machine composed it wow i think that's level that's next level man
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:06.720]   so you can do this yourself i guess music transformer that's uh a new feature
[01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:12.960]   i'm just gonna keep this going it's very it's very soothing google is sending
[01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:22.000]   the other gin and tonic please here i am becoming a piano man google is sending free socks out
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.920]   to local guides you know what local guides are those are these people i'm a local guide who help

[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:48.560]   qualifies one user on reddit is at level seven is a local guide and knows receiving the socks
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:55.680]   with others in that same ballpark did not oh i have a weird shocking so google keeps emailing me
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:04.400]   because i'm a local guide and it says your pictures are getting yes like millions so one photo
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:16.000]   one photo yeah of a patio of a sandwich place in downtown toronto yeah has like 600 000 views
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:22.720]   okay is it still lying because i get the same thing there is nothing unusual about this patio
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:28.400]   in any way there aren't even any human beings on it why are so many people looking at this photo
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:34.960]   i did does it pop up like when you look at a specific region in toronto i don't know or
[01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:42.400]   it's a mystery yeah there's another one i did a review of a restaurant in rome and you know it's
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:49.680]   there's a shot of the outside of this restaurant in an alley and it's like 370 000 views
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:55.840]   i don't understand are you tired of that music or do it just the robot gave up he thought we weren't
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:26:00.480]   listening robot got tired so if you're gonna if you're not gonna pay attention to me i'm not
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:06.000]   gonna play that's this part not just background music i never get tired of robot music i can i
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:13.840]   think the rest of the show should have freaking robot music yeah hello robot talk it's just a matter
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:22.560]   of time jeff it is uh there's a new one tell them our plans there's a new anyway get your free socks
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:29.200]   write more reviews take more pictures if i ever got socks i would wear them google i'm just saying
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:37.520]   yeah you unfortunately you would uh it's going to be easier to share files on your google right
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:43.200]   with non-centraled cow holders that's huge they're going to use a pin so that they can identify it
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:47.840]   it's called such a pain in the butt to try to share something is that yeah you said it to me
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.840]   are you sure yes i'm sure i decided this well then they have to ask permission from me and then
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:55.040]   it's all you know it's a mcgillan plus they kind of have to sign up right if they're not if they
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:00.240]   don't have an account they well you can can yeah you gotta go through many hoops and they have fire
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:05.440]   in the minutes of pain they have they ask you for permission and then you grant it okay so now
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:11.440]   it'll be just a that they call pin code sharing you can invite non-g suite users to call you can
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:16.720]   even collaborate uh using a personal identification number that's kind of sweet this has been overdue
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:23.360]   yes yes thank you google thank you google very handy you can ask google assistant for flight
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:29.840]   delay predictions i like that google of course because of its acquisition of uh what was that
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:35.600]   the flight booking the flight thing yeah now i'm probably knows more about what flights are
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:40.720]   going to be delayed and what you know historical information like that than anybody and uh they're
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:45.840]   they're exposing that to you you can even ask the assistant you could say what's the status of flight
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:53.840]   AA 528 that flight is scheduled to depart on time at 11 p.m. philadelphia time
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:28:00.240]   due to a late incoming flight there's a good chance it'll good change it says here this is somebody
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:05.760]   google doesn't make typos like that do they there's a good change so i think this is fake
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:10.480]   that'll be delayed by at least 30 minutes you should plan still plan to be on time though
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:17.680]   good change it's always gonna say that yeah that's fake that's that's okay well what i do is i go
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:23.120]   to flight aware gotcha i go to flight aware all the time i'm neurotic as hell of course and i travel
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:29.920]   a lot i have 230 000 miles is here so i go and i and on united you can check where the plane's coming
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:37.200]   from i'm i'm obsessed with that because i want to know where the equipment is and then uh especially
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:41.520]   if it's uh other airlines i go to flight aware and i just see how often the the plane's been delayed
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:46.080]   so i'm doing that judgment really good though it is really good
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:52.000]   uh this is actually really the whole change vlog could have been the things google is doing
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:58.880]   for the holidays draw a line in the snow using tech with kids around the holidays
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:05.120]   live from the north pole what's new at san is village keep calm and google fit on
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:09.200]   seven ways the assistant can help you survive the holidays these are all blog posts how and
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.920]   rek can help you switch off enjoy the holidays on the 12th day of holiday shopping made by
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:19.280]   google gave to me unwrap the seasons on and on and on this year in search 2018 i think we already
[01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:27.200]   did that one right um oh have you seen this one that was gonna be my uh show end thing all right
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:33.200]   i'll save it oh i won't go ahead no go ahead well and then i added something else under that uh
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:37.440]   method that's related so i know we can do it at the end but there's two things we'll have the
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:43.840]   other okay you remember uh then so by the way this is a little side note you remember the i didn't
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:49.360]   even show because everybody in their brother sent me a clip of the nasa engineer mark rober who
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:55.520]   made the the glitter bomb the glitter bomb the stink bomb for package thieves brilliant i don't
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:59.520]   know how many millions of views this video has gotten now on youtube and i'm not gonna show
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:04.560]   because everybody's seen it but if you didn't watch it carefully you missed the part where he said
[01:30:04.560 --> 01:30:10.960]   the thieves should have known uh that this was a fake it would look like a google home pod they
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:16.880]   should know for several reasons one ups doesn't deliver google home pods but two the label was
[01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:27.120]   addressed to one yeah kevin mccallister yeah who happens to be the kid left alone yeah in home alone
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:34.160]   this are we getting some sort of home alone resurgence here maybe here's a google assisted
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:44.160]   video featuring mccollie caulkin who was grown who was aged slightly as a as an updated kevin mccallister
[01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:51.280]   in home alone it's the same house by the way at least from the outside mom well he really looks
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:56.400]   like the same kid does google what's in my calendar today you have one event called house to yourself
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:31:05.040]   google add aftershave to my shopping list hey google remind me to clean these sheets later okay i'll
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:12.320]   remind you someone's in the front door what do i owe you looks like you paid online keep it changed
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:19.280]   go to build the animal okay cool hey google they're not a temperature two degrees
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:29.840]   hey google begin operation kevin operation kevin underway i guess he's using the assistant too
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:33.120]   kevin dorant
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:41.760]   better get at you for somebody's thesis oh they even have the voice of what's his name
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:49.120]   that's good that's a good ad well done and then to which jeff ever the grinch
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:56.480]   yeah it is gringy as a as a metal floss party pooper article if you did the actual home alone
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:32:05.280]   pranks you'd probably kill somebody now yeah the paint can pendulum with yeah it would hit your
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:11.200]   a 13 pound of can of paint would fly towards your face at 20 miles an hour v sauce of course a
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:16.720]   youtube channel tested the impact this would have on the head of a ballistic dummy
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:22.640]   it would pretty much crush your skull and there was video you want to see the video
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:26.800]   oh sure v sauce and lows wow
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:39.600]   can you survive the home alone trap v sauce i'm jake and my parents maybe i don't want to
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:43.760]   be home yeah i can't at least he'd say hey guys scary because i'm only these
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:48.080]   buses are pretty good channel i like to be so straight out and that's a great idea for a video so

[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:25.360]   our fourth woman tries to fill you know it has to be fake i saw this video as a tesla owner i'm
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:30.560]   watching this i don't know she's trying to fill a car up with gasoline because it's the sound
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:39.200]   up it's a tesla we're watching from the car behind her clearly the people videoing this know that
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:43.920]   she's not going to find a gas tank she can't figure out where it is you don't think this is fake
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:52.320]   i probably i assume everything is fake it's fake okay maybe it's fake if it's funny
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:58.000]   i enjoy it i assume it's fake first of all really would you go i mean there's no gas meter how
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:02.240]   why would i would stop well i but i i was talking to somebody and they said and i haven't driven a
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:07.360]   tesla so you know better what it looks like but is there an empty sign no no for your for your
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:14.640]   for your electric is that an s yeah it's a model s yeah no there's nothing that would even show you
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:20.480]   she wouldn't she's gonna do it she puts now she's given up she's figured well i figured out where
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:26.240]   the port is she's opened the charging port and she just put money in the pump oh dear don't put gas
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:32.480]   in the charging port she's now she's trying to get the this actually could be dangerous i don't
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:37.520]   know what happened if you put gas in there but it wouldn't be good you couldn't though could you
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:43.760]   you know i i think this might be real because nobody could laugh like that i know fake right
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:46.800]   even the google i was i was i could drive by now
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:51.600]   it has it hasn't happened
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:58.080]   she's giving up now she's putting it back in the uh whole
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:04.560]   uh she just doesn't she's just baffled but she's looking in as if that will help
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:08.720]   of course this would happen in charge because we don't have self service right
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.520]   oh you know that's right mine i can't know that's great yeah i forgot about this oh now she's

[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.480]   a tesla driver because she doesn't know you hit a button yeah she doesn't understand
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:33.680]   okay

[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:28.320]   see and it i wish i wish i could see this movie you probably could see it in new york
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:33.760]   peter jackson's world war one movie they shall not grow old believe
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:40.640]   mmm jackson the creator of the hobbit and lord of the rings took really cruddy old newsreel footage
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:46.320]   which is hand-cranked and so it's stuttery you know you've you've seen all these old movies you've
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:53.360]   seen it super jerky super jerky black and white he colorized it he's spaced out this you know he
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:59.760]   cleaned up the timing so that it looks like an actual film and he did it not for a little bit
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:06.800]   but for 100 hours of archival footage amazing he actually ran out of money the documentary
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:10.880]   screens nationwide it's already shown once December 17th and it's coming up
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:17.680]   December 27th if i were in new york city or toronto i'm sure maybe toronto i would go see this if i
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:25.280]   could figure out where maybe it's only in britain i don't know uh it is a uh 90-minute documentary
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:30.640]   but it features so many of these videos and it really isn't interesting how it seems so much more
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:38.400]   real change your perception yeah it's incredible the imperial war museum
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:44.320]   um had a project the commission artist to create work for the centennial of world war one you know
[01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:51.360]   we're a hundred years after the end of the war in 1918 to 2018 they approached jackson he apparently
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:58.400]   was is a real you know historian world war first world war buff his grandfather was a soldier in
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:05.920]   the british army before the war served in the war during its duration so he wanted to only no
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:13.120]   narrator and only use archival footage which meant he had to really go through a lot of footage it
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:21.920]   took them three years to clean this up but boy and we only can see little clips in this new york
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:28.000]   times article but boy it really looks good um can't wait to see it i hope i get a chance to uh to
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.680]   do so i am i wonder after those two days if they're gonna put it on netflix or something but i hope so
[01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:41.600]   wow it's just incredible and he's really uh they actually brought in because some of them like this
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:48.640]   one here it this one it there's no audio on it but they could tell what the guys were saying
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:58.080]   so they brought in forensic lip readers uh who and then actors to actually overdub it so that
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:45:01.360]   they would have voices and they even brought in actors from the different regions of england so
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:09.760]   their accents would be appropriate really really cool so that's my article of the week that we
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:17.520]   didn't get to what about you matthew i was trying to there there were a bunch um but you don't have
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:24.720]   to pick just one what's your what's your favorite so so this is in the rundown uh but
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:34.880]   this guy sort of hacked in new york city wifi monoliths um so that they would play the mr softy
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:40.000]   jingle it was only a matter of time these these these things are great i mean they're very high
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.880]   speed internet you have to be close to it they are they jeff are they just where phone
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:52.000]   booths used to be or yes well uh yeah pretty much yes but they have wi-fi they have a screen and
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:58.320]   they have a big ad screen on them um and and what you see is you see homeless people charging their
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:04.240]   phones yeah sitting there for for as long as it takes to charge the phone uh and it's their their
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.280]   life that you can actually make phone calls from it which is a little awkward because you're kind
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:11.760]   of screaming in the streets of new york but it's a connection people who don't have connections
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:17.120]   i wish that this guy had when i first read the headline i was hoping that he had kind of
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:25.120]   hacked into the wi-fi or into the system of the phone or the unit but he actually goes up to it
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:30.960]   and makes it a freak so you can make free calls i guess and he calls a conference call line that
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:37.200]   he set up that then plays the mr softy jim oh so it's not really a so not not really that high
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:48.000]   so i had when they when they announced this i thought oh this is going to end poorly but it's not
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:55.680]   it's jeff it's something it's a success you think yeah good yeah good it also said my favorite part
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:47:01.760]   of the piece i think was that it said that most of the New Yorkers that the reporter watched uh
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:07.040]   kind of turned to acknowledge the jingle and then carried on as though nothing was happening
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:13.200]   to york yeah yeah what's the big deal it's both playing the mr softy jim what a surprise
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:18.640]   mr softy friend of mine is i went on pictures of some guy who was dressed as a christmas tree yeah
[01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:23.040]   yeah and pictures on the subway and no one's paying this life yeah of course yeah yeah no nobody
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:28.560]   even noticed what i love about new york yeah you see everything you see everything the problem
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:36.080]   with that everybody's got uh there's personal space yeah i think that's fun yeah and i have to
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:41.840]   disagree with gizmodo mr softy is not creepy music when you just slow it down it's creepy it's a
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:48.400]   little creepy if you play in a minor key maybe yeah bye bye oath we hardly knew ye
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:57.360]   verizon has decided remember they they bought yahoo and aol and last week they they reduced the
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:01.360]   value of the brand by four point six billion yeah four point six billion and now they're going
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:07.520]   to rename it to something a little more sensible than oath verizon media group so that was roughly
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:14.640]   half the value of that's the purchase that unit they've basically wrote 50 of that entire unit
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:20.000]   i thought it was four point eight matthew that it was four point eight down to four point six
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:23.920]   minus four point six no i think so four point eight was what they paid for
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:32.240]   yeah that was the brand value but the the total the purchase price was higher than both yes
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:37.920]   yeah but they wrote up a good portion of the purchase price the good will the good we have no
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:44.160]   big brand value fran now i thought jeff you'd want to pick this one france is going to tax
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:55.520]   tax google apple facebook and amazon gaffa european finance ministers did not agree on a
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:49:00.160]   block wide digital tax next year but france says yeah we're going to do it anyway they want to raise
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:06.320]   half a billion euros in 2019 off the backs of these guys this is just business as usual right
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:11.280]   yeah the problem the problem i always have with this is that it's fine your government you set
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:14.800]   the tax rate but don't set it for specific companies you got to set it fairly across
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:18.560]   the playing field but that's not what they're doing they're playing politics but they have
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:22.240]   got some politicians do uh january first
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:29.280]   so the story that is so what do you guys do you think there'll be a panic about a
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:37.760]   guard no really i think that's kind of cool i know you can now tell your amazon echoes
[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:45.840]   listen for glass break or what else um screaming smoke alarms screaming
[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:52.480]   alarms right no screaming so as you leave you say you say echo turn on uh echo guard
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:59.760]   and your speakers elicit for trouble they can't call uh 911 but if you have a alarm service it can
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:06.160]   it can call the alarm service and uh it can also notify most most importantly notify you and you
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:12.080]   can listen in you can even speak so you can hear oh there's somebody in our house get out of the house
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:18.240]   i'm calling the police now and then you hear
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:25.840]   you know if there this is not a new feature there's a number of alarm systems including our
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:31.120]   advertiser right who that do this yeah you don't want to bet it's gonna happen people gonna say see i
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:36.400]   know they listen to you all the time they can do that oh yeah that's what people are gonna say
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:40.800]   probably it was gonna theory here is you turn it on when you're leaning turn it on but that means
[01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:46.000]   it's capable it's it's already all the time they're just clear just fooling us i know i'm gonna hear
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:56.960]   it i know it uh did you know tesla has a fart mode is what what would be what yeah all tesla is my
[01:50:56.960 --> 01:51:03.440]   tesla has added a fart mode what does it do uh you can configure it in one of two ways fart
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:09.600]   on demand allows the driver to send flatulence through the speakers with the press of a scroll wheel
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:15.200]   oh steel on then there's fart on turn signal now that's funny
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:22.080]   there are six different noises uh can be randomized
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:28.000]   the sound is external feel falcon heavy is one of the sounds
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:37.440]   it can fart at random yeah
[01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:47.920]   falcon heavy oh elon short shorts ripper okay i guess i'll be turning that on um i'm sorry i'm
[01:51:47.920 --> 01:51:53.280]   sorry i was uh trained on the fart feature and i when i didn't pay attention and i and i caused
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:52:00.240]   an accident some people might say elon if you could worry less about a tari games in fart mode
[01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:06.880]   you might want to work a little harder on the self-driving capabilities but not me he just opened
[01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:13.600]   a tunnel too yeah it was taking a tube yeah so what's your next car gonna be Leo you know i
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:18.880]   really wanted a model three and i'm worried about the company and i i honor elon for his vision
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:23.600]   he's a visionary he he really made electric vehicles happen he's also insane
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:30.080]   and i just i don't feel like it's safe to buy another tesla at this point my my lease runs
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:34.960]   out in july i'll probably i don't know i really you know out he's doing electric vehicles i think i
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:40.800]   might look at a more traditional car manufacturer you think tesla's got there's a risk the company's
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:48.640]   actually gonna go under he he he's so mercurial that people have had problems a lot of problems with
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:57.600]   repairs and body work um and i yeah i do worry that you know he might he just hear me say something
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:04.480]   and decide he doesn't like me and deactivate my car but it just worries me well that one time
[01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:09.200]   you wouldn't sell one to somebody i know that yeah because he got upset yeah and the thing
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:14.320]   somebody understand is it tesla logs everything you do in that car and i would be at all surprise
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:22.640]   if tesla even logs the audio in the car um not not for ad sales but just they want they want records
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:27.760]   and particularly what they're anxious for is evidence that it was your fault if the car crashes
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:36.400]   right right oh that was one of the things i noticed when when one of a car crashed and burst into flame
[01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:45.600]   and within minutes or maybe hours tesla had provided detailed um descriptions of every
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:53.360]   act that that driver had taken from that touching the door to you know touching the steering wheel
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:58.960]   that made me a little nervous yeah i don't know i really the everybody who has a model three
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:04.240]   loves it so i don't i don't have to decide till july they're great cars oh i see okay i love my
[01:54:04.240 --> 01:54:09.040]   model x i have a model x do you have a tesla and matthew no i do not but a friend has a three a
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:14.080]   model three and it's amazing yeah i never yeah i'm gonna do a trade one of our employees has a model
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:19.200]   three i'm gonna do a trade the thing the thing that struck me that i couldn't get used to is that
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:27.040]   there's no dash panel i kind of like that so it's just a featureless experience of what yeah is that
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:32.400]   wild so where where all the dials would be is where you prop your book piece of wood you can read that
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:40.960]   it just looks like you know part of the there's no dials no cages no nothing it's just it's odd
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:47.280]   you know actually i've been thinking a lot about we were talking earlier on windows weekly about
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:51.840]   user interface and cars because i drove the jaguar electric vehicle the eyepace and
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:57.600]   it's got buttons and knobs it's very physical yeah everywhere and it's too cluttered for me yeah
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:05.280]   i like us i don't know if i mean tesla the model three is extreme but i but i i don't know i kind of
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:11.920]   like it i've gotten used to the tesla way of simple clean interface yeah it looks beautiful yeah it
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:19.840]   just takes a bit of getting used to yeah and then there's a portia coming out early next to the ticane
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:27.600]   uh oh oh no i don't know yeah it's supposed to be well it's the same it's out he also oh and then
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:32.960]   there's a new v dub that people are going crazy really which one well it's not out yet but they've
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:40.880]   been driving around prototypes so they're electric electric vw well there was a lot the
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:46.880]   the the um the van no that's coming in come early we're coming coming back with the van it's the
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:54.800]   they are that's in 2021 i think okay this is they are saying they'll have 342 mile range which is huge
[01:55:54.800 --> 01:56:00.240]   it's called the id but see they're driving around these dazzle they've got this dazzle camouflage on
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:08.880]   them um but it's going to be very i think affordably priced so i don't know see this all goes back
[01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:14.960]   interestingly to diesel gate yeah because outy and vw which is the same company of course where they
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:20.560]   were faking the results for the diesel engines and as a result they got a huge fine and one of the
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:25.600]   commitments they made is something called electrify america multi-billion dollar investment into
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:31.920]   charge stations every 40 miles in the united states so there's going to be these chargers everywhere
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:37.920]   it's going to be very interesting i don't know well i didn't want to upset that the uh chevy got
[01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:44.640]   rid of the bolt they they killed the fault i think so yeah i didn't hear that because now they have
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:53.920]   the bolt oh the very poorly named yeah one's electric one's hybrid so they get rid of the hybrid
[01:56:53.920 --> 01:56:58.960]   yeah but they kept the electric no i think every car company is facing the facts that we're going
[01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:03.280]   to have to go all electric in every country of the world except the united states where we will
[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:11.440]   continue to drive whole powered cars whole power cars for the vehicle future god bless it
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:18.080]   you know why isn't there a second amendment for a gas engines i think there will be there will be
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:26.320]   there will be a picture in a future and there's like an underground you know group of of guys who
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:31.840]   drive their own physical cars and put gas in them and they have an internal combustion
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:39.360]   gasoline only analogs will have internal combustion engines um just want to get rid of gas
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:46.560]   i think that's actually that's actually the attitude among some yeah but i like driving electric
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:52.800]   vehicle i feel good about it the torque just amazes me it is incredible it's a great drive
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:58.720]   they're funding only one of every hundred percent or mw the ice ice six whatever yeah
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:05.600]   so uh jeff did you have a number or are we going to wrap this thing up i do i do i do so chart beat
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:11.280]   yes which uh tracks traffic on most sites put out its list i think craig silverman uh matthews
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:18.560]   fellow matthews lansman uh Canadian from buzzfeed uh said i think it was matt it was craig said if
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:22.960]   you get depressed about what people are paying attention to look at this list from chart beat
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:30.960]   it's the stories that had the most engagement uh in in news in the year so number one was bordain's
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:35.200]   death tragically number two was i'm part of the resistance inside the trump administration
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:42.560]   number three brexit live blog bbc number four this is why umithormin is angry number five
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:46.240]   why is there oh i remember now why i'm a thermon and zag yeah i remember either
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:52.480]   so these stories have high engagement and there's nothing awful in here now of course these that's
[01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:57.680]   self-fulfilling because it comes from major news sites that pay jock beat okay but those sites
[01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:02.800]   also had dumb stories everything one of them and those were the ones that got the most um so
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:06.880]   engagement so these were not idiots out here engagement means what not that these are the most
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:11.520]   read story this is this people read the traffic people actually you like the umithormin story
[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:15.120]   you couldn't stop reading it was all about how quententerantino practically killed her
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:21.520]   when making was it making kill bill or i can't remember was i killed him was kill bill yeah
[01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:28.240]   yeah it wasn't exactly two stories yeah it was a good story okay good time spent good
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:33.280]   so although i did notice buzzfeed news not to rain on your parade
[01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:40.560]   jeff but buzzfeed news had a list of its top stories and not buzzfeed buzzfeed news
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:50.640]   and all right number four was is this person saying yanny or laurel oh i hate it yanny or
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:56.560]   laurel i hated that i hated it i hated it i hated it by the way what did you hear yanny or laurel
[01:59:56.560 --> 02:00:04.160]   i can't remember actually to be honest i read the i read it it was you're wrong i read a description
[02:00:04.160 --> 02:00:08.960]   of how it worked and then i could hear both yes exactly it was kind of ruined it for me
[02:00:08.960 --> 02:00:13.040]   did you have a pic maceu anything you wanted to tell people about besides yanny and laurel
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:18.720]   we stole it from him i do not we did we stole his uh video stole yeah that's so i was
[02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:25.520]   was in a good cause matthew you sacrificed for a good cause so um amazon sells a seventy dollar
[02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:31.360]   puck that you put your note or galaxy phone on it turns it into a desktop computer it's an
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:37.040]   interesting concept right uh the idea that this phone these phones are powerful enough now
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:42.320]   why do you need a separate computer why don't you just carry the phone around and have a little
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:48.480]   docking puck wherever you go but the problem is it's kind of expensive so this is my pick and
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:54.320]   it's actually pretty cool it has all the value of a decks dock but it's only 30 dollars it doesn't
[02:00:54.320 --> 02:01:03.120]   come from samson comes from nexjack n_e_x_ j_a_c_k and it actually does uh turn your phone
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:12.640]   this is the uh galaxy browser um but if if i want i can uh launch other uh galaxy stuff i even have a
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:18.560]   i even have a keyboard and a mouse attached to this and i have it's got an hdmi port actually i think
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:24.800]   it's dead the mouse doesn't seem to be oh there it is you know it's not dead i don't i close this we
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:29.920]   could show the desktop it's uh the scaling the scale our scalar isn't working right so
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:37.680]   but but there is a desktop screen you get on it and there uh microsoft office works as a desktop
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:45.440]   application as does you know gal samson's email uh at some of their other um applications including
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:51.280]   their internet browser it kind of looks like a desktop here's the deal i'm not sure i i don't know
[02:01:51.280 --> 02:01:58.240]   how useful decks is and i don't know if you would want to use it but for 30 dollars you get a you
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:04.000]   get a little dongle that by the way also charges the device because it's got a type c connector
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:10.000]   in fact you have to plug it in to make it work it has a full size htmi port two usb ports one
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.880]   three point one one two point oh so it's a hub it's a connector hub that also can be used as a
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:19.920]   deck station i think for 30 bucks this is a very sensible thing to add i wish they had a headphone
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:24.560]   jack but i guess you don't really need one because of the samson still makes phones with headphone
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:31.200]   jacks but uh you know somebody in the in the radio show last weekend so should i get a decks
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:38.640]   and i said there's this 30 dollar thing i said let me get it and tell you next jack any xjack
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:48.320]   you can get it on amazon 2990 if you have an s8 s9 uh or note eight or note nine i would get one
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:50.080]   why not
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:56.640]   ladies and gentlemen this was our last show of the year

[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:17.040]   yeah in a lot of ways yes yeah i guess it was i don't know yeah high stress i've blanked it out
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:23.920]   oh so so was the stock market blanked out in any way oh my god that was a bad year for investors

[02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:43.680]   this year and actually i think if you watch our best of shows you can do to be the judge of whether
