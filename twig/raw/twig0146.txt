[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.440]   all the stuff that's happening in the social world as well.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.040]   And we've got some real experts on hand. As always, Gina Trapani is here from smarterwear.org,
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.240]   co-founder, founding editor of Life Hacker and the author of ThinkUpApp.com.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.040]   Hi, Gina.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.240]   Hi, great to be here. Happy to be here.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.040]   Yes, she's happy and gay today.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.040]   She's gay and happy.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.840]   Always gay and happy.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.440]   When did gay stop meaning happy?
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.440]   That's my question.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440]   It should still mean happy.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.240]   One word does it all.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.440]   Right. One word does it all.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.440]   In my case, it does mean happy.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.440]   As well as gay.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.440]   We were talking about the president's decision that in fact, people of the same sex should
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.440]   be able to marry, but it's up to the states, really.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.440]   I ain't got nothing against it, but it's up to the states or something like that.
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.440]   It's a journey of many small steps.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.440]   Yeah, it's politics.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.440]   You know, it's politics.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   In it's politics.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.440]   First they said, "Joe, I can just imagine this call.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.440]   Joe, you've got to do it.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.440]   You've got to go out there and take one for the president."
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.640]   So Joe Biden, like three days ago, says, "Gay marriage is fine."
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.440]   And they said, apparently somebody said, "Mr. President, that's not sufficient."
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.560]   Oh, all right.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.560]   Also with us, I should get-
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.840]   Oh, you know, now on Twitter, the world is asking for Joe Biden to come out and favor
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.040]   a legalizing marijuana.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.040]   There you go.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040]   Joe's the guy.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.600]   Joe's- that's the why- that's why you don't want to be vice president.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   Oh.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.120]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis is here from buzzmachine.com.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.120]   He's a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.040]   Have you been watching Veep, the new show?
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040]   Yes.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   Love it.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.160]   The lane from Seinfeld has a vice president for an unnamed president of an unnamed party.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.400]   But it's exactly- I mean, it's perfect for her because she's always a little bit angry
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.000]   about things anyway, right?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.840]   And she's just got no power.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.880]   She keeps asking her assistant, "Has the president called?"
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.880]   Her assistant, "No."
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.880]   She says, "No."
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.880]   It's very funny.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.880]   It's very funny.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:47.880]   It's about-
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.720]   Because one of those, it took about 10 minutes, 12 minutes to get you into the groove, and
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.040]   then once you were in the groove, they established everything and you knew the sense of humor
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.040]   and it was very good.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.520]   Oh, it's just perfect for them.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.640]   And they apparently improv a lot.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.640]   So there's-
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.040]   Oh, yeah, there's some wildly just kind of crazy moments that I just enjoy.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   Good.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.200]   Well, I'm glad we got the TV critic to watch one of our shows, Gina.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   I was looking into you.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:31.040]   I was looking back at the earlier seasons and really it was better in the first couple
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.040]   of seasons.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.160]   Without January Jones, I don't like it quite as much.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.160]   Although there's a-
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.920]   You gotta love Zuby, Zuby, Zuby, Zulady, but I don't know.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.000]   Anyway, enough of that silliness.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   We could talk about Gleason more, but-
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.440]   We're gonna do a television show, clearly.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.280]   We clearly have to do a show.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.480]   But then Jeff, we'd have to make him watch TV and he doesn't want to do that anymore.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.480]   I know, I do that.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.480]   What's your favorite show right now, Jeff?
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.720]   Oh, let's see.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.000]   HBO, I end up watching.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.520]   I watch-
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.160]   Not sure, actually.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.680]   You know, now that he's not a TV critic, Jeff, how many years?
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.280]   We're decades you're a TV critic, so now he doesn't care anymore.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.360]   I had a crush on once or anyone weeds, but-
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.080]   Oh, I love her too.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.960]   But you know, Jennifer spoiled weeds for me because she pointed out that she's always
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.240]   holding her frappuccino with a claw.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.880]   And now I can no longer watch that show because it wasn't-
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.120]   That is so good on attractive.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.120]   She does always have that chubby.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.120]   She does, she has the claw.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.320]   I'm sure she can do the sexy, schwarp with a straw.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.320]   I hate that.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.320]   Oh, no, it's very good.
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.320]   Me too.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   What's her name?
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.320]   Mary Louise at Elizabeth Parker.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.320]   I'm quite an amateur lover.
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   I'm sorry, Leo.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.320]   I'm leaving you now.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.320]   No, I'm in love with her too.
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.320]   We can marry her together.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.320]   That's it.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.320]   Yeah, because we have for all.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.720]   Once you go to game marriage-
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.040]   Now animals for the time, whatever goes-
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.040]   Anything goes.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.040]   Absolutely.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.600]   Girls is very good.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   Bryce is liking girls.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.320]   Girls is taking a while to grow on me, but I'm kind of liking it.
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.320]   Emma Thrones.
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.320]   Okay.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.320]   That's because you read the book, right?
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.320]   Emma Thrones is kind of sick.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   Yeah, it's getting dark.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.320]   It's getting dark.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   It's very disturbing and dark.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.320]   All those heads on spikes are really getting to me.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.840]   Enough with the heads on spikes.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.320]   It was one thing to read it.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.320]   Another thing to see it.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.320]   I can't believe I'm liking the big C.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.320]   You know, I didn't like- I like her.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.320]   I'm not into it.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.320]   I've gotten into it too.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.320]   I have to watch some more.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.320]   Earth's Jackie was not hot on-
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.320]   Love, Nurse Jackie.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.320]   Love, Nurse Jackie.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.320]   Um, Borges.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.320]   Borges is great.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.320]   Hey, John.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   Hey, John.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.320]   How can you not love your- Oh, Sherlock is the best show.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.320]   Feld is right.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.320]   Sherlock is great.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.320]   The best show on television.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.320]   Modern Family.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.320]   The Middle.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.320]   Oh, I love Modern Family.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.320]   Modern Family is okay.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.320]   See, I knew it.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.320]   For a network sitcom, it's okay.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.320]   Community.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.320]   Community's pretty good.
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.320]   Oh my God.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.320]   Community's amazing.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.320]   That's a sleeper though, isn't it?
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.320]   I mean, I don't know if people know that that's a good show.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.320]   A lot of people DVR that show, so they don't- They'll know someday.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.320]   One I don't like much is- Which gets me in trouble with people?
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.320]   Not as much as- No, don't say smash.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.320]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.320]   Of course not, I wouldn't say that.
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.320]   Love smash.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320]   That's all right.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.320]   Smash is- Smash is Glee for grownups.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.320]   It is.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   So good.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.320]   For theater geeks.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.320]   For theater geeks.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.320]   So good.
[00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.320]   Parks and Rec.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.320]   No.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.320]   That's horrible.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.320]   Amy Poehler's horrible.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   But okay, you agree?
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.320]   Okay, yeah.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.320]   Horrible.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.320]   It's not funny.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.320]   It's like they're trying to be the office with that talent.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:31.320]   Oh.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.320]   Actually, the office is pretty horrible these days too.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.320]   It is now too.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.320]   God, is that Gone Bad Hill?
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.320]   30 Rock still?
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.320]   30 Rock still great.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.320]   You can't- Tana Fey, she's not lost her touch.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.320]   What happened to this show?
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.320]   This is odd.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.320]   This week in television.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.320]   Do you ever do it?
[00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.320]   Edit this all out.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.320]   Edit this all out.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   Edit this all out.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   Oh, okay, the people.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.320]   You should do the TV show.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.320]   We'll do the TV show.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.320]   We do a TV show.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.320]   It's called Frame Rate.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.320]   Right.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.320]   Tom Merritt does it.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.320]   We could just make this one to do it.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.320]   We could just make this frame rate too.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.320]   Let's do it.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.320]   We'll really piss off the chance.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.320]   What?
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.320]   We should really talk about your favorite podcasts, your favorite YouTube channel, that kind
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.320]   of thing.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.320]   Well, I will plug that in since you opened it up.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:20.320]   One of my entrepreneurial students, Ashley Milne-Tite, formerly heard of often on-
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.320]   Public Radio's Marketplace.
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.320]   Her name is Ashley Middle-Tite.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:25.320]   Ashley Milne-Tite.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.320]   Ashley Milne-Tite.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.320]   And she has a name.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.320]   It's a name.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.320]   It's great.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   What she actually turns out is that her father decided to add, just add the Milne for the
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.320]   heck of it.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.320]   It's not even like a name.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.320]   No, but she's got a great British accent.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.320]   She's hyphenated.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   I love that.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.320]   So she's from XMPR or X- as Public Radio, pardon me.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.200]   And has a new podcast called The Broad Experience and she interviewed none of them in our very
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   own junior-depress.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   Ah!
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.200]   It's a great show.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   She's great.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.960]   I mean, she's obviously pro, you know, has NPR experience.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.960]   The show is like short.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.960]   It's eight to ten minutes.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.440]   It's on Women in the Workplace.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.440]   It's really good.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.160]   I really enjoyed doing an interview with her.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.960]   I'm glad that I got in on it.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.200]   Kind of only in a few episodes in.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   I think she's only three or four episodes in, but I think-
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   She's still three in.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.800]   It's actually at The Broad Experience.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   It's not there.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   I tweeted it.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   It's not on her website?
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.040]   I know she screwed up.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.240]   I just emailed her.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.240]   The-
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.240]   God, I'm going to down-board her.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.240]   Great idea.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.240]   I love the name, The Broad Experience.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.960]   God, that's a good name.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.360]   It works on so many levels.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.400]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.840]   No, no, no, no.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   Hold on.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.840]   I thought it was-
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.320]   No, it is on her website.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   It is on her website.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.320]   It is there.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.320]   Okay.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.320]   Somewhere.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.320]   Because Google said it was.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.760]   If you go up the listen, maybe.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.320]   Is there a listen?
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.480]   Actually, it's about some-
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.480]   Aww.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.200]   The Broad Experience.squarespace.com.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.200]   Aww.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.360]   They're a Squirt Fix, please, you can see.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.360]   Great.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.360]   They're a sponsor today.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.360]   Yes.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.360]   If you're smart and you're doing a podcast-
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.360]   I'm glad folks.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.520]   Oh, you see, I'm subscribed right here.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.520]   I get it.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.160]   By doing that, she gets free bandwidth.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.800]   Well, 16 bucks a month for bandwidth unlimited.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.720]   So that's a really smart thing to do for a podcast.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.400]   Anyway, I've just subscribed to it, apparently.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.480]   Thank you very much.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.760]   Welcome to The Broad Experience.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.200]   Oh, look, and she's also using SoundCloud.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.200]   You know what?
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.360]   She's smart.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.040]   She's doing all the right things here.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.080]   She has a great accent.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.080]   And she's a musician.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.080]   She has.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.320]   So you are on episode two?
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.720]   I think it's episode three.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.720]   Women in technology.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.880]   Welcome to The Broad Experience.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.680]   With my other student named Ada, who's starting a book, a business called...
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.680]   Gotcha.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.160]   She has a great voice.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.840]   Yeah, she's got a great voice.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.040]   She's being hotly debated at the moment.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.400]   Women and technology, and why so few women work in this sector.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.880]   She should read Winnie the Pooh.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.720]   She's at the toilet of Pooh's man.
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.520]   I asked her whether her father added Milne because he was a Pooh fan.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.520]   She never had thought to ask him that.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.600]   I think she is.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.040]   He is Milne-type.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.760]   At least he's not Milne-type.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.680]   I don't know what that would be, but it sounds like a part for a car.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.560]   All right, we do have tech news of some kind here.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.880]   Hangouts on air is now everywhere.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.840]   And there's a lot of excitement about that.
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.120]   We use Hangouts on air for Trey Radcliffe's podcast.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.120]   Right.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.440]   Trey for a variety hour.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.160]   And so we've had access to that for a while.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.080]   Coco Club used it this week.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.280]   So what is different in the Hangouts on air?
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.800]   How does that...
[00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.480]   It's live and it's archived and so...
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.520]   Automatically saved on YouTube.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.520]   And anybody can do it.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:39.880]   Yeah, so this week the Coco Army did it with their hero.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.880]   Who was...
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.880]   You know, what I mean only...
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.880]   The Coco Army.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.080]   I'm being stupid.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.080]   XMBC.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.160]   That keys the old woman.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.160]   Go to Brian.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.160]   Go to Brian.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.160]   Okay.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.200]   Whatever happened to keys the old woman?
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.000]   You know, I ran into the new president of Current.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.280]   David Borman is an old friend.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.680]   And I said, "That must have been really interesting."
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:07.000]   Because the old woman was hired before Borman became president of Current.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.840]   And he just went, "Someday, I'll buy you a drink."
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.040]   "I'll tell you the whole story."
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.440]   "You need to buy him one."
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.920]   Oh.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.680]   So you can broadcast publicly if you check the box.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.640]   It's the fact we could do it right now, I think.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.640]   Because I think I have that capability, I believe.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.440]   You check the box that says, "Enable Hangouts on Air."
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.880]   You could broadcast your Hangout Live from the Google+ stream, your YouTube channel,
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.240]   or your website to the entire world.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   That's cool.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.480]   Yeah, that's really cool.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.200]   I mean, this really kind of gives anybody the ability to do a Twitch style, talk and
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.000]   have a show at any time, right?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.720]   And you can embed the live stream onto your website.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.720]   Right.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.720]   So somebody doesn't have to go to Google+.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.720]   That's great.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.720]   I'm trying to...
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.800]   I think you can do it for mobile as well.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.480]   I think you can.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:13:00.160]   So this is the new Hangouts on Air interface, you'll see.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.400]   And so it's a little slow right now.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.400]   There we go.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.400]   "Enable Hangouts on Air."
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.640]   You check this.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.640]   You could even...
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.000]   We'll use your YouTube channel.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.440]   And of course, you've tied your YouTube channel to your Google account.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.680]   And then you say, "Okay."
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.680]   And then you can restrict miners.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.480]   You'll play about that here.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.720]   You could say who this is, and I could...
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.720]   You know what I could do.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.440]   What I did last time is I could say technology journalists.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.760]   That's always nice to limit it to those for my Hangouts.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:29.760]   And then...
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.760]   Or you can join an existing Hangout.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.800]   Now, and then it's going to record it and put it up on your YouTube channel.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.800]   This is cool.
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.560]   Hanging out is fun with friends.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:42.760]   Or I could just click on these people, I guess, and say, "Hey, come on in Tom Marich.
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.760]   Should I do that?"
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.760]   Yeah, I do Tom and Kevin.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.760]   Yeah, let's do Tom.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.760]   I'm sure Kevin's sitting there watching.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.760]   Probably.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.760]   All right.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.200]   And then what else do I have to do?
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.720]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.720]   Name it.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:14:00.560]   Oh, let's say testing on air and then hang out.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:01.880]   Then it does the usual...
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.880]   I see myself...
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.080]   Ooh, that's terrible.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.080]   Kevin is there.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.080]   Kevin is on chat.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.080]   So we'll be on.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.080]   Hi, Kevin.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.520]   Now, I have...
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.920]   I guess the picture is getting a little bit better here.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.160]   Let's start the broadcast.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.560]   Click that button.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.800]   And so that will put a tweet out on my...
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.240]   Oh, there's Tom Marich joining us.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.360]   Kevin, Kevin, come on, Kevin.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.000]   Hey, Tom Marich.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   He's drinking.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   He's drinking heavily.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.160]   On property time.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.600]   Now, I can turn the microphone on, camera on, settings.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   There's some Google effects.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.120]   We've already seen these, but just in case you haven't, I can use a Google effect.
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.240]   But I'm going to have to get a new computer.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.240]   This thing is like...
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.800]   Yeah, this is always slow.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   Oh, lasses.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.520]   Oh, now I'm hearing myself.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.520]   That's even better.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.520]   All right.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.200]   So I can be a late night host.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.880]   That guy you were trying to remember?
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:03.800]   This is kind of cool that they actually give you Conan hair.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.800]   Okay.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:11.240]   How does he get that?
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.240]   That's very funny.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.320]   I can also put a hat on if I want.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.640]   This is a...
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:24.000]   This is, of course, all stuff that everybody has a logic to cameras, been able to do for
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.040]   ages, but Google's decided that this belongs.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.760]   And there's Kevin Marich joining us.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.760]   Hello there.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.760]   Hey, Kevin.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.760]   Hang on.
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.760]   Hi, Kevin.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.760]   So...
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   Is it very bizarre?
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.600]   Because I thought you were actually streaming on the other side.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.600]   I know.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.600]   It's probably very confusing.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.600]   Hang on.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.160]   This is why my camera's not happy.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.520]   Let's still have this hat on.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.360]   Well, we get the idea.
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.360]   I mean, I just...
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.760]   And then I can have a birthday cake or a mustache.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.760]   They've added it.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.760]   They've added stuff.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.160]   I feel like Josh to Polsky with these glasses.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.400]   Josh, what's a Polsky joining us right now?
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.360]   So you can't give someone else a fact.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.400]   You can only add a fact to your own.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.400]   Only yourself.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.400]   And apparently they're cumulative, which is interesting.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.400]   So you can really make yourself look like an idiot.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.800]   Hey, Mario.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.320]   Will they replace the background, too?
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.320]   So I'm trying to...
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.320]   I'll check you to do that.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.320]   Yeah, I checked.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.320]   Does that?
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.320]   I guess not this.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.320]   Maybe you'd like a green screen where you just like hit it and would go out short and
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.320]   it...
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.320]   Right.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.320]   I'm in Hawaii right now.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.320]   Exactly.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.320]   Stuff in like fish.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.320]   Okay.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:41.720]   Tom, Mary, just put a beard.
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:48.760]   To Polsky glasses and a top hat on, I have a Mario mustache and a cat in the hat hat.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:51.360]   But I might go for the dog look here.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.360]   Let's see how...
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.880]   Have you ever seen a dog with a mustache?
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.880]   Get ready.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.640]   It's a slow news week, folks.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:58.800]   No, it's not.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:03.280]   It's the monopoly millionaire, Tom Merritt.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.760]   Okay, the dog is pretty cool.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.040]   The dog with a mustache.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:10.040]   No one.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:16.440]   For people who are listening and not watching this podcast, trust me, you're not missing
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.600]   anything exactly.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.600]   You're very lucky.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.840]   Just keep it just fast forward.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.160]   Yeah, just fast forward past this section.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.160]   Look at Tom.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.160]   Hang on.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:33.600]   In front of my phone as well.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:40.200]   What I want to talk about how YouTube and Google replace network television, I'll point
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   to this.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.840]   This is exactly what television has wanted.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.640]   It's so very long.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.640]   Yes.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:53.720]   But I do think that this is a very empowering technology for somebody who wants to do a
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.720]   podcast.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:57.720]   Now...
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.960]   It's not a pig.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.960]   That's a dog.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:03.960]   It's a little...
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.760]   I mean, look, they got a little work to do.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.760]   It's a little slow.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.080]   It's a little funky.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.640]   And I guess depending on your bandwidth, it's probably not going to...
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.320]   You need a lot of bandwidth.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.880]   Kevin's not sending video on purpose.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.280]   You're looking pretty good to me, but clearly it didn't let my cameras today.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.280]   I must have Skype open with them.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.280]   But look at Tom Merritt.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.680]   I mean, just fantastic.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.480]   Until he drinks a beer.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:33.360]   That is beard, glasses and hat.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.200]   Just get left behind.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   It's magic.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   Something...
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:44.000]   I think trust is actually a sort of actual anonymization technique.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Yeah, you could use this.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.680]   It certainly would take a boring podcast and make it interesting.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.040]   Not that it's done that for us, but in theory, in theory.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.840]   Anyway, I'm going to let you all go.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   Thank you, Kevin.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.840]   Thank you, Tom.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.840]   See you.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   See you.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.840]   Thanks, guys.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   Nice mustache.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.840]   Or beard.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.720]   This hangout is now over.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.920]   If you are broadcasting publicly, as we will...
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.920]   Oh, maybe not.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.120]   No, I didn't say public.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.360]   I said those people.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:12.000]   Your recording will now be uploaded and automatically replace the live video on the player.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.760]   Please allow a few minutes for the upload and processing.
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:21.360]   So when you go to Google+, instead of saying he's doing a hangout or he missed a hangout,
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.200]   just like this, here's Trey's Variety Hour, you'll actually see video.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   Which is great.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.800]   But in effect, made a podcast just that way.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.560]   It's pretty cool.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.040]   Yeah, that is cool.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:43.960]   So, bully for them, and I think it's empowering technology for people, lets them do their
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.120]   own thing.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.280]   Google Maps now has offers.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.280]   This is...
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.280]   Well, there's two things.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.160]   This is a big deal because Google Maps will now be more in the local space, which is
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.080]   really important, but also today, Four Square announced that they're...
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.080]   Two Pons too.
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.080]   Two Pons.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.440]   All this with Groupon's stock plummeting, and I guess everybody thinks...
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.440]   As well it should.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.440]   Well, we can do that.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.520]   And actually, probably is one of the reasons why the stock is plummeting because in fact,
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.400]   Groupon doesn't seem to have a monopoly on this.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.120]   Not only that, but Four Square and Foldis-Lorzia, I've been talking to them with...
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.120]   Oh, I love...
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.120]   I love Denson.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.120]   They're great.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:24.120]   They're great.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.040]   And Jay Crowley's brother is doing Biz Dev and I've been talking to them.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.040]   And they...
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:32.840]   Four Square encourages loyalty.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.360]   Groupon does not.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.840]   How does it do it?
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.240]   Because when you want to be mayor, when you want to come back, when you want to get a
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.080]   badge, when you want to do those things, that's what Four Square is pushing is for you to
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.080]   come back.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.080]   Right.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.920]   And then the opportunity is to give rewards on that basis.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.680]   Ah, and Groupon just says, come get a 50% off a massage.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.680]   And then run.
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.680]   And then run, never come back.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.880]   And that's the problem is, does it create a new customer or does it just create a drain?
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.420]   And this altogether becomes a huge impact on the newspaper business because it's low
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.420]   hold.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.420]   Right.
[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:04.420]   Because...
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.420]   And radio too.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:06.420]   And radio too.
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.420]   Yeah.
[00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:10.280]   But Groupons are the last reason to print a paper.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.680]   The last good reason to print a paper are Groupons and Circum...
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.680]   Good point.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   Good point.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.640]   And when newspaper circulation falls below a critical mass, that's going to have an impact
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.640]   on that.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.520]   So at the same time, Groupons online are starting to work more.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.080]   I've seen studies saying they're more work more.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.800]   Plus, you have Facebook and 4-square community with Groupon business.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:33.760]   And in Groupon business, not just at a Procter and Gamble level, but at a local level.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.760]   This becomes a big deal.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.760]   But we're going to release out of CUNY a study in about a week or two.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:44.920]   We went and surveyed online 500 businesses in a neighborhood of Manhattan and 500 businesses
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.560]   in a town in New Jersey to find out how digital are they.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:53.440]   And it's very interesting to see how few in some ways, to my mind, have still Facebook
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.640]   pages, websites, YouTube channels, Twitter handles and so on.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.840]   But 4-square is interesting and Google Play's pages are interesting because you're already
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.840]   there.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.320]   The only questions are you doing anything with it?
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.320]   Are you maintaining it?
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.600]   Are you helping it out?
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.360]   So I think offers on maps is a big deal in the business.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.240]   Yet it doesn't have that thing that you mentioned that 4-square has.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.880]   It doesn't have that loyalty building thing.
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:16.880]   It's just a map.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.880]   There's no check-in.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.880]   No.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.360]   I mean 4-square, do you use radar on 4-square?
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.560]   Does for you, when you pass by things?
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.560]   What kind is it?
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.560]   Do you find that useful?
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.560]   Is it working?
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.000]   No, mostly just says, "Hey, you're home.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   You want to check in?"
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.200]   Yeah, that's mostly what it is.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.400]   But I also am big on using the to-do list.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.680]   So if I'm nearby a place that I put on my to-do list, I'll say, "Hey, while you're nearby,"
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:44.720]   that juice place that you want to try is across the street.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.080]   I found a lot of lists.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.480]   Yeah, a lot of lists.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.080]   So we'll say, "Yeah, there are that restaurant that's on your best places to eat in the whole
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:52.080]   wide world.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.080]   Right.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.080]   So that is kind of cool.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.080]   That is really cool.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:01.960]   I mean, the thing about 4-square is that I don't have numbers to back this up, but I
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.720]   get the impression, like, you either are really into 4-square and use it all the time, or
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.560]   you don't at all, I wouldn't consider it.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.560]   Right.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:12.520]   And the thing is that Google Maps on your phone, that's the way everybody gets directions.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520]   Yes.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.880]   Especially on Android because the navigation is so fantastic.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.920]   I really miss the navigation on the iPhone.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.120]   But people go to Google Maps to get directions.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:22.920]   They've been doing that since 2005 or 2006 when it launched.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.000]   So to add offers to Google Maps, which you're going to have open anyway, like Google Maps
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.800]   is your go-to for location stuff for most people.
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:30.800]   Right.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.420]   I mean, with 4-square, you have to get into the habit of launching the app and checking
[00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.120]   in and only a very small kind of dedicated group of users does that.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.560]   So I think offers on Google Maps is really a big deal.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.360]   I think that it's probably will be the first experience with location-based coupons that
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.880]   most people will have.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.680]   Because you're using maps all the time.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.880]   Because you're using maps all the time anyway.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.960]   People are walking, you know, it's installed on your phone when you get it.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.720]   You're walking around getting directions to go someplace anyway.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.920]   So you're going to see them.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.560]   Right.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.600]   And that's only on Android so far, right?
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.600]   Right.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.600]   This is actually 4-square on iOS.
[00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.600]   Sorry, it's so bright.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.600]   But just-
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.120]   I mean, I do think 4-square specials are coupons.
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.000]   It sounds like coupons are similar to specials or better for business, right?
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.600]   Because often it's like on your third check-in, get a free appetizer for the mayor.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.600]   You know, that kind of thing.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.600]   Right.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.600]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.800]   And I do think these lists, if they get more people to do the lists, they're going to
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:22.800]   be huge too.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.960]   Here's Dan's list of, for when you go to New Orleans, you got to get off Bourbon Street.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.040]   Seven things to do in New Orleans, not on Bourbon Street.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.040]   I mean, things like that.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.040]   I love lists.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.040]   Potentially huge value.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.040]   Right.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.880]   And then the tips, when you go to a restaurant, you know, someone you know says, "Try to this."
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.880]   That's really valuable.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.880]   That is really useful.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.880]   I mean, that's a thing about 4-square makes you identify with places.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.880]   Right.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.840]   You know, like, it's funny, like, I don't check in if I go to the, like, you know, the
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.040]   Ralphs, you know, because I'm going to go with free shopping.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   Nobody should know that.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.760]   So, I'm going to go to the top, I'm going to check in a lot of ways.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.360]   It's an identification thing.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.560]   You know, it's, it's, which is a deeper, much deeper experience.
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.520]   And then it connects customers with places a lot, a lot more strongly.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.760]   But also there's that hurdle of getting into 4-square.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.760]   I mean, people who don't use 4-square are just annoyed by 4-square check-in notifications
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.560]   and badge notifications on Twitter and other places.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:13.600]   You know, they probably just see the app notifications on Facebook and think like, "What
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.600]   is this?"
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:15.600]   You know?
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.000]   I think it's a very split group.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.800]   You're either really into it or you're not.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.000]   And, you know, it's funny because somebody's saying, "Well, you know, Google does have
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   check-ins."
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.400]   Of course, latitude check-ins.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.080]   In fact, they're automatic though.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.160]   I think in one way that's a disadvantage because you're not doing anything.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.440]   So you never really see those check-ins.
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.640]   There's a lot to come on.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.240]   Maybe the other stat that came on this week, I don't think we have on the rundown, is
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.960]   how much more Facebook use is happening to mobile-y.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   Right.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:50.800]   And, you know, we're the bare beginning of seeing how this stuff is going to be used.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.520]   Well, we've been, you know, it's funny because we've been saying, "Oh, this is going to be
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.520]   huge.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.080]   Location is going to be huge.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:00.120]   Search gets replaced in some ways by location."
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.160]   And it just took a while to catch up, but it's happening.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.160]   It's starting.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.680]   It's happening.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:14.080]   Did you know that according to Eugene Volok, Google search results should be protected by
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.640]   the First Amendment?
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.960]   Because he says, interestingly, that, and this was, we should say, commissioned by Google.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.680]   He's a professor of law at the University of California, Los Angeles.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:29.520]   And a libertarian, early, early blogging guy.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:32.880]   But Eugene says that search is opinion.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.880]   I find this really interesting.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.760]   It's not a free speech.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.480]   So the algorithm is not fact.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.800]   It's opinion.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.800]   Wow.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   That makes sense because he says Google, Bing, Yahoo, and other search engine companies are
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.400]   rightly seen as media enterprises, just like the New York Times or CNN.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.240]   They're media, which they don't say they've never said before.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.840]   So now they're trying to get under the media umbrella on the First Amendment, which I
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.800]   find really, really interesting.
[00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:03.800]   But then I would.
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.280]   It's a wonky thing to get interested in.
[00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:09.360]   And this, of course, hasn't been an issue in the US yet, but they've already been sued
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.920]   in Germany and France over auto, complete, and things like that.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.920]   But they haven't.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.240]   Nobody's attacked them in the US or have they for search results.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.080]   But I imagine they think it's going to happen.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:26.960]   Well, not yet, but this is where you get to this idea that Google is a utility and
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.800]   that it has to have fairness in search, which when you think about it for two seconds, it
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.200]   makes absolutely no sense.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.760]   Because who's to say what's fair?
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.160]   Who's to say what that is?
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.040]   But no, that does get raised a fair amount.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.320]   And I've changed my tack with reporters calling.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:48.560]   I had a reporter call yesterday about evils of Facebook and stuff.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:53.120]   I had consumer reports last week about evils of Facebook and I said that they were in moral
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:57.040]   panic and then I had a reporter calling this morning trying to compare Google to standard
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.880]   oil as a monopoly 100 years ago.
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.320]   And I just lost it.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.920]   That's your starting point.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.960]   That's your starting point.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:11.320]   It's always big, bad evil Google, you come.
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:15.080]   So yeah, I think there are efforts to say that Google's too powerful.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.200]   We have to control Google and we'll control Google around this idea of saying that search
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.400]   is something that should be regulated.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.280]   Well, no, search a speech.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:33.240]   LiveHoots.org, a new way to understand a city.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.080]   So these public, these check-ins are public.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:38.520]   There's an API for this, Gina.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.560]   So if you set your check-ins to public.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.640]   And most people do.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.000]   So each dot on the map represents a check-in location.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.080]   Groups of nearby dots of the same color form a livehood.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.400]   The shapes of livehoods are determined by the patterns of people.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:59.280]   If many of the same people check into two nearby locations, these locations will be part
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.920]   of the same livehood or livehood.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.680]   This is how people kind of congregate.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:11.200]   So when you have a lot of dots of the same color, this isn't like a neighborhood.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.400]   What kind of location to learn about its livehood?
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.720]   This is livehood number 17.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:24.400]   The top five places, the 24th Street Mission Bart Station, Ritual Coffee Roasters, Phil's
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.560]   Coffee, Beretta and the Takerillo Cancun.
[00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:30.000]   This is the mission district.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.560]   It even tells you what phone service people are using.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:39.080]   Here's the Sparky's 24-hour diner location.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:42.400]   Malicious Mission Dolores Park Safeway Golds Gym.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.400]   What ties them together?
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.400]   I don't get it.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.600]   Yeah, I don't either.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.800]   What makes it a hood?
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:54.600]   If people check into many of these same, like they following--
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:55.600]   Sounds like set theory.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.600]   Gotcha.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.600]   Set theory.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.040]   Well, if you're going to say it the fancy way.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.040]   It's set theory, OK?
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.320]   Don't you know?
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.320]   So this is the Sundance Kabuki Theater.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:11.480]   So if you live in one of these cities, I mean, I know San Francisco will enough to say,
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.880]   yeah, these are demographic clusters.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.800]   Here's the downtown demographic cluster.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:19.800]   That's really interesting.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.800]   And these are the--
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.840]   That's using public data from--
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.840]   Orswear.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.440]   Yeah, and then they say, well, if you like this,
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:32.320]   live hood, you'll like these other five live hoods that are closely related to similar
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.960]   groups of people.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   And then stats.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.960]   Wow.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.720]   This is pretty cool.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.800]   This is really cool.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:44.520]   This is Livehoods.org from Carnegie Mellon.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.520]   Wow.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.920]   They're mobile commerce lab.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:52.640]   I'm looking through four-squared privacy because you got to have a really large amount of public
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.720]   data to do this well, which it seems like they are doing it well, East and San Francisco.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.160]   Let me do Brooklyn for you because you'll know this one, Gina.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.160]   Well, can you get anonymized data?
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.760]   Gina, I wonder whether you got anonymized data.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.760]   It's not people.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.760]   There's no people's names on this.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:07.760]   These are low-sounds.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.360]   I think maybe you can get--
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.440]   Just a stream of check-ins versus--
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.440]   --without personal and for like aggregated.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.440]   Yeah, that's-- you're right.
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.440]   That's possible.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.000]   Because that's how you see things like trending restaurants and other stuff like that.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   That's the ballot.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   That's a great deal.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.160]   So here's the Williamsburg neighborhood.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.160]   This is really interesting.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.160]   Brooklyn Bowl.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.160]   Yeah, this is interesting.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:30.320]   It's a bridge MTA subway, Radagas tall and beer garden, blue-puddle coffee.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.080]   Here are related neighborhoods, and it would make sense.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.480]   We got downtown.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.920]   So go to Christopher Street or Chelsea or something like that.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.600]   I want to see if it marks other gay neighborhoods.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.600]   OK.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.360]   Yeah, if the West Village is--
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.360]   Exactly.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.520]   --is packed with Chelsea, yeah.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.920]   Oh.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.520]   Now you're getting sophisticated on me.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.760]   Do you think these lavender dots represent anything?
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:55.840]   Oh, sorry.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.120]   That's the South Street seaport.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.560]   Never mind.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:31:59.480]   I don't know.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.000]   I don't know.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.600]   There's the Apple Store in Soho.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:07.560]   Yeah, so like West Village would be--
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:08.400]   Oh.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.400]   I got the Lower East Side.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.000]   How about that?
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:18.600]   See, the meatball shop, Cats is deli, pianos and Spitzer's Corner.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.760]   Yeah, they're all kind of related.
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.440]   I think what--
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.440]   Now how Pat should use this, right, to understand what it is.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.840]   It's not a zip code.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.920]   This determines-- this is the first best way
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.240]   I can see to discern a neighborhood rather than trying
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.920]   to use existing boundaries.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.240]   Well, that's their point.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.960]   These are better than neighborhoods.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.080]   It's emergent data, right?
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.120]   That's really good.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.880]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.640]   I think I have a business use for that tomorrow.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.480]   All of a sudden, we go off the air.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.960]   I'll be in a local business.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.320]   Good.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.240]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.480]   This is fun.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.960]   We're just kind of messing around.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.600]   Seriously, oh, I was in a rotten mood right here.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.920]   Well, thanks to you by rays of sunshine.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.280]   We're just messing around, man.
[00:32:58.280 --> 00:32:58.880]   I'm happy.
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:01.160]   We're just doing our thing.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.160]   Kind of getting down.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.600]   Gina, Japan, he's here.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.800]   She's from Brooklyn.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.760]   That's cool.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.120]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:09.920]   He's from-- I don't know.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.200]   What neighborhood is this at the University of New York?
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.160]   Times Square or Times Square?
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160]   Times Square.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.120]   Center of the universe.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:19.120]   The otherwise known as the Shimada District.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.760]   The Gray Ladies sits outside waiting to consume.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.520]   We're going to get back with more in just a bit.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.520]   I want to talk a little bit about never
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.680]   going to the post office again.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.200]   See, no more four square check-ins at the post office.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.680]   Because you've got stamps.com.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.720]   See, this is going to be different because as people's
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.960]   behaviors change-- for instance, they're not
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:39.760]   going to the post office.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.320]   What they're doing is they're using their computer
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.000]   and printer to print their own postage.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:43.640]   And it's so cool.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.760]   We do it here.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:48.720]   In fact, I notice a proliferation of stamps.com
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.760]   USB scales.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.120]   Jordan has one.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.920]   Now, Frederick has one.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:56.720]   I think we're never going to have to buy stamps ever again.
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.800]   Go to stamps.com.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.240]   You could take advantage of this special offer.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.280]   It's a no-risk trial.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.920]   It includes $55 free postage.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.400]   The digital scale is free.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.800]   You just pay for shipping and handling.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.240]   It's $5 supply kit in a four-week trial.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.280]   All you have to do is use the offer code TWIG.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.520]   So you really get an idea of how stamps.com works Mac or PC.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.840]   Just go to stamps.com.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:19.200]   Click that funny old microphone in the upper right-hand corner
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.080]   to get the special deal.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.600]   And now, see that it will, for instance, print out
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.760]   the forms you need for priority mail, express mail,
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.960]   even international mail.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.840]   You'll always have the right postage because the scale
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.320]   mues it.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.720]   If you're an eBay seller, you're going to love this.
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:38.160]   It actually takes the data from eBay and populates it.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.600]   So it prints the labels everything.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.520]   This is so cool.
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.920]   If you use QuickBooks, you'll do your invoices this way
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.520]   and never have to type in another address.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.720]   I just love stamps.com.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:48.680]   I know you're going to like it too.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:50.240]   But that's why we arrange this number of trials.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.360]   So you don't have to worry about it.
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.680]   Just try it and see.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.320]   $55 free postage, a free digital scale,
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.040]   a supply kit and a four-week trial, all at stamps.com.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.760]   Use the offer code TWIG.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.920]   Stop going to the post office.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.760]   No more check-ins at the post office for you.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.520]   stamps.com.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.760]   Moving right along.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:14.280]   I'm sorry about that channel for a video.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.280]   Let's cut that out.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.280]   I already made a note.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:19.080]   I don't want YouTube to pull us down again.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   I made a note for Tonya.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   Thank you.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.320]   There have been some court cases that actually support this idea
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:29.400]   that Google searches free speech in 2003.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:34.040]   In 2003, an Oklahoma ad company accused Google of hurting its business
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.000]   when it downgraded the company and search listings,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.200]   the federal judge threw out the case on free speech grounds.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:44.440]   Google's protected free speech, baby.
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.040]   This is the author of the algorithm, essentially.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.640]   Instead of the editor of the content.
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.080]   Well, the algorithm is an opinion.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.840]   It kind of makes sense to me.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.720]   Yeah, I mean, an algorithm kind of is an opinion.
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.080]   I mean, it is a set of values and rules.
[00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.320]   This is what we're kind of grappling with, though, in all sorts of ways.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.040]   Patent, law and everything is what is a computer program?
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.200]   What is an algorithm?
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:08.200]   What is it?
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.600]   It's a programmer, I think you would say.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.240]   It's an expression of speech.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.240]   Right?
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.840]   It's an expression of something coming out of your brain.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.960]   Just because it's not written in prose, it's written in a language that's different from
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.960]   English, but it's just--
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.560]   Yeah, it's logic flow.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.560]   Logic, yeah.
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.120]   It's speech.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:33.200]   Ah, so now the next web has a picture from the Google Glass project.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.520]   By the way, Kevin Rose said, "I'm going to get you the goggles to me."
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.680]   One, no, no, no, three.
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.320]   I'll make sure that we get three.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320]   Yes.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.520]   This is the greatest thing.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.840]   This is a really neat photo.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.240]   I hadn't occurred to me.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.240]   Yes.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.000]   Well, we should probably describe it for people who are listening.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.400]   It's somebody who's wearing the glasses, has his small child, and is spinning his small
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.440]   child around, and you can see this person.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.440]   It looks like a guy's hand.
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.440]   So you can see this man's two hands.
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.400]   It's a hands-free photo.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.240]   Sebastian Thrun is the guy who does those code lessons, right?
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.720]   He's in charge of it, right?
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:11.720]   He's doing all the online.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.960]   He does the new online school.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.720]   He was the chief engineer behind the Google Self-Driving Car, and he's in charge of the
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   lab stuff.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.880]   He has the greatest friggin' job in the world.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:20.880]   He is the coolest guy ever.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.360]   You don't want to do it because he's got to be that smart.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.240]   So he's spinning his son around, and the sun is in focus and everything else is blurry
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.720]   because he can do that, and there's no hands.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   Wow.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:32.720]   But what do you do?
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.720]   How do you do it?
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.720]   Do you blink?
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.240]   Do you say take a picture?
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   I think it's audio.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   It's a timer?
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.240]   Oh, it's audio commands.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.240]   I know that's what the video said it was going to be.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.240]   We don't know.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.240]   Yeah, I take the picture.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:47.400]   This is the crappy picture that Sebastian took when he was on Charlie Rose.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.600]   That's a terrible, the color, everything.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:55.920]   But maybe the lights were throwing it.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.800]   We're seeing more and more of these glasses in the wild, though, right?
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   Not just prototypes.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:07.080]   Well, they are prototypes, I guess, but not just broken prototypes, actual glasses.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.320]   I saw video.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:14.760]   Sebastian was on, I forget where it was, he was interviewed about the car and said that
[00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.640]   people would see them and they drove all those miles.
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:20.120]   I'd see them and they had all these guesses about what it was.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.280]   And there weren't many guesses of self-driving.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.640]   It was other guesses.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:28.120]   And finally, people started guessing right, and that's when Markov called and said, "Is
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.120]   this what it is?"
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.120]   Oh, interesting.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:33.440]   The New York Times, John Markov for a drive.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.440]   Good man.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.280]   And a fast John's a smart guy.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:44.640]   So, stated Nevada has approved self-driving cars from Google.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   The Las Vegas Sun says that-
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.640]   That's what we want.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.640]   It's a bunch of, I guess we do want that.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.280]   A bunch of drunks, not, not any people.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.120]   Levattal law requires a person behind the wheel during the test.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.640]   So you do have to kind of sit there.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.640]   But I think that's-
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:02.920]   If you could program it for gamblers and onomists and won't let you drive to the casinos.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:09.360]   I think the presumption is you're not going to drive downtown Vegas Boulevard that you'll
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.800]   be in the wilderness, I hope.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.960]   But they've been driving around the Bay Area.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:18.800]   Why do they have to get permission from Nevada when they've been doing it in California?
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:21.760]   I think they want to take them to Vegas for some show or something.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.320]   I think they wanted to do something.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.680]   And they're trying to get a market.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.640]   They're trying to get approval state by state so that they can actually make this a
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:34.640]   sellable technology.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.640]   It's the first state in the nation to approve testing driverless cars.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:44.000]   Google has equipped a fleet of at least eight vehicles, six Toyota Priuses, an Audi TT, and
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.040]   a Lexus RX450H.
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.760]   The license plates are be unique.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:56.440]   They'll have a red background and feature an infinity symbol on the left hand side.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:40:00.720]   DMV director Bruce Breslow says, "I feel using the infinity symbol was the best way
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.440]   to represent the car of the future."
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:13.000]   Man, woman, birth, death, infinity.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.880]   So apparently Google's going to go to other states to try to get permission as well.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.600]   I guess they don't have it yet in California, but that didn't stop them from doing it.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:26.280]   I guarantee them the New Jersey will funnel the car.
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.280]   Where am I?
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   What am I doing here?
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.280]   I feel property.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.640]   I used to live in where Jersey City and Hoboken are.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.600]   There is, honest to God, there's a different constitution there that says that people
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.480]   train left have right of way over all forms of life.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.000]   I'm turning left here.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.480]   Get out of my way.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.480]   Really?
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.480]   Is that true?
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.480]   No.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.480]   It is in practicality.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.120]   You can turn left in New Jersey.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.120]   It doesn't matter who's in the road.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:56.120]   You got to prop it is.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.680]   My people are from Jersey.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.800]   I apologize.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:04.040]   Galaxy S3, did you guys talk about this last week when I was in here?
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.040]   Did you?
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.040]   No, it came out on Thursday.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.040]   It came after Twig.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:11.080]   Oh, all right.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.520]   It's one better than the S2.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:21.680]   It's big, 4.8 inches, ice cream sandwich, LTE and HSPA Plus.
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.120]   So it'll run on all the high speed 4G networks.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.120]   You can give me a refresher on that.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.720]   A witch carrier is witch.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.720]   Where?
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:34.200]   So AT&T and Verizon will be offering LTE.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:40.680]   T-Mobile offers HSPA Plus, as does AT&T, but AT&T also offers LTE.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.440]   T-Mobile does not have LTE.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.040]   And Sprint currently has YMAX, but is moving to LTE.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.080]   So LTE is the thing to go.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.080]   LTE is the future, for sure.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.080]   LTE.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.080]   Okay.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.080]   How are regular people supposed to understand that?
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:55.080]   Really?
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:59.280]   It's not even 4G, even though they call it 4G, because 4G is supposed to be 100 megabits
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.560]   down and nothing's ever even close to that.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:08.920]   But the-- what's the name of the ITU, the International Telecommunications Union, gave
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:17.080]   a kind of a waiver to the United States saying, "Well, it's faster than 3G, so go ahead
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.040]   call it 4G.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.000]   LTE is the future.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.760]   Just remember that.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.760]   So I'm going to be in Korea in--
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.760]   It'll be LTE.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.480]   So should I-- I don't know if one can buy phones.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.000]   They're going to buy a note or something like that.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   What should I look for?
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Something in the LTE?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Yeah, I can get a note that's LTE.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.760]   But, well, okay, here's the other thing, is they're on different frequencies.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:43.720]   So there's LTE in Korea may not be on the same frequency that LTE in the US is.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:47.400]   So you really-- that's why they have multi-band phones and--
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:51.000]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:58.600]   In fact, now T-Mobile has announced that they're going to do HSPA plus on 1900 megahertz, which
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:00.160]   means you can run the iPhone on it.
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.360]   You couldn't do it before.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.360]   Hm.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:04.360]   Fantastic.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.360]   But that's okay.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:08.520]   Galaxy S3, just-- it's nice.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:09.880]   It's a nice phone.
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.880]   It's big.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.280]   It has some neat features.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:18.680]   For instance, it's kind of smart like it knows what you're up to, right, Eileen?
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.680]   It's like--
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.680]   Yeah, it watches you.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:23.520]   It's kind of creepy in the way that it-- well--
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:26.200]   The camera is using the camera or is this a separate sensor?
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.800]   There's a sensor on the front of the camera and the-- or on front of the phone and it
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.080]   waits till you actually stop looking at it and then it will go black.
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:40.760]   So you know, I've talked about and I love that program called Screamle that I use that
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:41.760]   uses the accelerometer.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.440]   I don't know if you're-- if you've got the phone tilted up, it says, "Oh, you must be
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.440]   looking at it.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   I won't turn off the screen."
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.680]   So you can set the screen, tie it out to like the minimum, like seconds.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.880]   And as long as it's not flat or upright and you can change the parameters, Screamle will
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.280]   just keep the screen on.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.920]   This is better than that because it's looking at you.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:57.920]   It's looking at you.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:58.920]   Yeah, so there's a video--
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:43:59.920]   She's using it.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:04.440]   There's a video commercial where the dad is holding his kid and he's about to drift
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:08.400]   off but he's reading and reading and then he closes his eyes and then the phone turns
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   off.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.400]   Oh, isn't that nice?
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.400]   No, that's neat.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.400]   I like that.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.400]   I like that.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:18.000]   The screen seems to come very close to the top of the device itself.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.320]   Like it looks like it's mostly screen, which I kind of like.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.960]   They don't have the bump anymore either.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.440]   It's like a very thin profile.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.040]   The bezels are really thin and I hear that some people do complain that the buttons are
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:32.000]   a little-- there's not as much really state for the buttons if you're used to using them.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   So--
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.640]   Hey, I'm just glad that even though it's ice cream sandwich, it actually has buttons.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:43.520]   It's got the home button and it's got menu and back.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:44.520]   Not menu, I'm sorry.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.920]   It's not that menu anymore.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.040]   It's that task switcher, which I think is completely useless.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.480]   It does look kind of plastic-y though.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.480]   You know what?
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.640]   I think it looks very similar to a Galaxy S2, just bigger, right?
[00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.640]   It's curved though.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.880]   It's a little curvy.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:01.880]   So anyway--
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.160]   That was to appease the lawyers.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.280]   I think you talked about it on Twitter.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.280]   Right.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.080]   Yeah, Apple says it can't look like an iPhone.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.080]   Okay, no problem.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.160]   We'll curve it.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:19.000]   So it should hit-- the latest is from CNET that it should hit this summer in the US.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.640]   It's actually-- I thought June was what they were talking about.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.760]   Yeah, but it's going to be the official phone for the--
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.760]   The Olympics, right.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   --the Summer Olympics as well.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   Wow.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.000]   All the athletes will get one in there.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.440]   It's going to use NFC.
[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.680]   So the athletes are going to have wallets and have paypoints.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.720]   They can walk around and tap their phone on stuff.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.720]   That's kind of cool.
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.720]   Cool, wow.
[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:39.720]   [CLICKING]
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.960]   I went big village full of hot people using NFC.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.960]   I like it.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.160]   You went there, didn't you?
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.160]   I did, sorry.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:47.160]   You went right there.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.160]   Sorry.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.960]   I've heard that it's apparently just a love fest.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.960]   Yeah, I'm--
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:52.960]   In the Olympic Village.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:53.960]   Can I imagine?
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:54.960]   If I was locked up in training--
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.760]   21 years old, perfect body.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.960]   You want to use it.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:01.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.440]   And especially if your event is early.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.640]   Because then it's nothing, right?
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.920]   Then you've got weeks just sitting around in the Olympic Village eating lots of food
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:10.920]   and tapping your phone.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.920]   You're phone at the bar.
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:14.400]   It's a good time.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.400]   I've heard it's--
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.400]   What's his name Phelps was interviewed?
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.840]   I think it's 16 minutes last week talking about how he just kind of slugged out afterwards
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.000]   and getting it back together.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.920]   And he said, yeah, I'd sleep till 11 in the afternoon.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.720]   It's like college kids?
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:30.720]   It is.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.160]   It's a bunch of gorgeous college kids with nothing to do.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.480]   You do the math.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.880]   We're going to talk about-- I just-- you know, I don't want to talk about Oracle.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.880]   I don't really--
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.880]   I don't want to talk about it either.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.880]   Oracle versus Google.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.760]   The non-verdict.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.760]   The non-verdict.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:56.560]   The jury ruled in favor of-- or this is the Java, the son Java issue, whether Android infringes
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.880]   on Java's patents and trademarks.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.960]   Oracle sued saying, yeah, you're Android.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.320]   We should have licensed that.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.160]   That's a Java.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.800]   Google said, no, it's not.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.840]   The jury said, well, yeah.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.320]   It is Java.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:18.880]   The jury said, yes, Android basically stole Java.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:26.040]   But they couldn't decide whether it was-- what did it say?
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:29.000]   It infringed copyright or not.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.160]   So now the jury is going to look at patents next.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:38.560]   And Google, meanwhile, says, Miss trial, you're on a-- I want a mistrial.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.240]   So it's just-- it's going to go on.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.520]   There's more.
[00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.960]   That poor jury.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.520]   Is the same jury comes back and now does patents?
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.520]   Not that poor jury.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.520]   I think so.
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.520]   That's got to be the--
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.520]   Oh.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.520]   There's like a--
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:56.160]   So Google infringed on copyrights.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.240]   But they couldn't reach a decision on whether that was acceptable.
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:01.240]   Well, not a fair use.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.240]   It's under law.
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:04.600]   It's protected under fair use is the question.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:06.120]   So Google says mistrial.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.760]   And then-- now this is in its fourth week already.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.760]   Now they're looking at patents.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:19.680]   This went from sort of fun crazy circus to OK.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.640]   Judge says you do not have to answer the fair use question.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.880]   You just have to decide whether they violate copyrights.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.600]   We appreciate the jury, says Google.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.080]   And we know that fair use and infringement are two sides of the same coin.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.280]   The core issue is whether the APIs here are copyrightable.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:40.400]   And that's for the court to decide we expect to prevail on this issue in Oracle's other
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.560]   claims.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.080]   Oracle said, we won.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.800]   We won.
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:48.280]   We won.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.120]   I just don't-- I don't like to report on these.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.120]   That's it.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.120]   That's the story.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.120]   Thank you.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:54.120]   We're done.
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.800]   For the-- for the nonce.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:58.800]   Let's take a break.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.040]   We're talking Google, the cloud, the internet.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.040]   Lot more.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.440]   Gina and Jeff.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.440]   And ting.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.440]   Ting.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.120]   Time to talk ting.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.680]   You know about ting?
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.680]   Ting.com.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:18.840]   It is their goal in life is nothing less than completely disrupting the cell phone industry.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:19.840]   OK?
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:20.840]   You got to like that.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:24.120]   Just, you know, you got to admire their pluck.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.600]   Spunky little ting.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.640]   No long term contract.
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.600]   You only pay for what you use.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.480]   Some really nice phones.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:36.240]   Now last week I mistakenly said you could bring your own phone.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.400]   But you know, they're based on sprint.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.200]   It's a CDMA carrier.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.480]   So you can't.
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.480]   You have to-- you have to get a phone from them.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:44.000]   And you pay more because they're not subsidized.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.760]   But I'm going to tell you in a second how to save 50 bucks on the phone.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:48.960]   They've got the top of the line photon.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.200]   I would go with the Galaxy S2.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.200]   I'm sure they'll have the S3 at some point soon.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.400]   The optimus, if you want to save some money.
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.560]   But here's-- look at the plans.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.120]   This is where it really gets interesting.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:04.800]   You pay for what you use, no penalty, no waste.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.200]   This is why it's disrupting.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.400]   Because basically you say how many devices you're going to have.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.600]   This is good for a family too or a business.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:14.840]   Look, you know, I could say I'm going to have 20 devices.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:16.160]   Let's say I'm going to have 15 devices.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.800]   That's 90 bucks a month.
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:23.600]   And then I'm going to say, well, I'm going to use 500 minutes.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.600]   I'll do 100 text messages.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.720]   And I want 2 gigabytes of data.
[00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:30.080]   And then it tells you the price.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.880]   It's $144 a month.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.160]   But here's the cool thing.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:36.360]   If you use less data or less text,
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.240]   they refund your money.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.800]   And if you use more, they just charge you the same amount.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:43.320]   There's no penalty.
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.080]   There's no penalty.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:47.640]   Plus, you get voicemail free, picture and video messaging free,
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.840]   three-way calling.
[00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.920]   They don't charge for that.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.480]   Call ID.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.680]   They don't charge for that.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.440]   Tethering.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.640]   They don't charge for that.

[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.000]   It's run by a bunch of geeks who said,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.120]   there's got to be a better way.
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.320]   And I think they've done it.

[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:37.000]   I, by the way, somebody put this on Google+.
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.320]   The best thing I use Google+ for is to find out
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.560]   about deals on Google Play.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:46.800]   Right now, they've got like a whole cover album thing free.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:47.640]   They're great.
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:49.240]   Oh, really?
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.240]   That's a great hauling-outs cover.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.720]   Play.google.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.120]   Well, but, and I have a question.
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.680]   Maybe one of you smart people's knows
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:57.480]   that how to do this.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.120]   So if you go to play.google.com,
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.040]   you can do this on your Android device, of course.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.720]   But you can also do it on a computer.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.480]   They're having-- they have a Mother's Day sale,
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.560]   but come on, go to the next one.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.640]   If you just go to music--
[00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.000]   That's your other--
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:09.440]   --music tab.
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:09.960]   --it uses--
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:10.680]   --music on the little--
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.040]   --not my music, not my music.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:12.640]   The music.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.440]   Yeah, I went to the wrong one.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.440]   Wrong one.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.920]   This is my music.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:18.520]   Go to the music store.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:19.560]   It'll say it there, right?
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.640]   There you go.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.600]   Best cover songs ever.
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.640]   They're giving these away.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.080]   There's how many tracks?
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:25.760]   20.
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:28.840]   But is there a way to download them all?
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:29.840]   I was wondering that too.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:30.560]   And I started just--
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:31.920]   Because you have to go one by one.
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:34.040]   American woman Lenny Kravitz, Red Red Wine, UB 40.
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.840]   I think it's a little work for the free.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:36.760]   What's your favorite one?
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.080]   What did you like?
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:40.200]   The hauling-outs--
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.280]   I can't remember.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.400]   What's the name of the song?
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:42.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.160]   What did you do to your love for--
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:44.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.440]   The BG's sorry.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:45.840]   No, no, sorry.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:46.560]   It's not-- it's not the--
[00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:48.200]   It's the bird and the B.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:48.880]   Yeah, they do it.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.600]   They do a hauling-outs cover too.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.920]   The bird and the B have deep--
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:55.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.240]   Oh, that's great.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:58.240]   I won't play that that long.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.120]   That's three seconds.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.560]   We can play three seconds.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.920]   Cassandra Wilson doing Lay Lady Lay.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   You can play that today.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:08.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.680]   We should get a deep voice.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:12.200]   Mm.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:12.840]   Yeah, baby.
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.120]   Oh, they got nothing compared to you.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:14.960]   Oh, way up there.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:15.320]   Oh, I know.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:15.800]   Oh, I know.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.360]   Shaneo Connor.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:18.840]   Mm.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:20.000]   So how do I get these?
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.760]   OK, somebody-- smart people.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:24.760]   Because here's how you do it.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.480]   That's the way all, but there isn't a download all.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:27.520]   There's not a download all.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.040]   I guess they're giving it away.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.640]   Yeah, they're making you work for it.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.480]   So you got it.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:32.560]   It's all free.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:33.960]   Add free songs.
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.920]   Well, they have a whole lot of free music
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.280]   that you can download in general.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.000]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.600]   Yeah, but be careful because I did everything
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:41.880]   and I got inspirational songs.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.960]   I got crap.
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.680]   I got a lot of stuff I didn't want.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:45.360]   So you can just pick--
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.360]   Let's just add--
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.360]   So you-- oh, boy, that was easy.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.520]   You can't pick by genre.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.040]   World.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:50.840]   I like world.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.120]   I like R&B and soul.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.040]   I'm not going to get Alice Cooper.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.200]   I'll skip that.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.360]   I like country.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.640]   So now this is all in my Google--
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.480]   In your Google play music, yeah.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.680]   John Mayer, Santana.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.800]   I'll skip the rest.
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.040]   That will blues be good.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.360]   Regge, baby.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.560]   So that was easy.
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.560]   So that was easy.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:12.400]   That was easy.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.960]   Right, but that covers sections special.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:14.920]   Look at all the crap I got.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.120]   So then you have to still do individual.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.120]   Holy cow.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:23.720]   All right, so yeah, but I want to get the covers.
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.800]   Well, we're just going to have to clip one by one.
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.560]   That's too bad.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.400]   These are great, though.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   I'm glad you pointed this out.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.440]   I just thought I'd mention that.
[00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:33.440]   Yeah, good covers.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.000]   I'm not in your tool.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.440]   Who doesn't like covers?
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:35.800]   I know.
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.800]   My tool is a lame tool, but that's all right.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.840]   "Jealous Guy" by Roxy Music.
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.680]   Coldplay, live from Norway.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:45.520]   You've got to love that.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:46.720]   You only live twice.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.440]   They actually have a lot of artists come into the Google space,
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.520]   and then they'll release it as an album as well.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.320]   And so you get those for free.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.320]   Ooh.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.960]   Hey, if I were a carpenter, buy the carpenters.
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:55:59.720]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:00.120]   Oh, no, no.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:01.280]   This is even better.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.120]   This is carpenter songs performed by other people.
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.480]   See, this is how they get you.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:09.600]   Now I want to spend hundreds of dollars to hear dishwala play.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:12.160]   It's going to take some time.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.640]   Or babes in Toyland calling occupants of interplanetary craft.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:16.360]   Now that's a hit.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.360]   Oh, the cranberries.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.520]   They longer be close to you.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.640]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.120]   Oh!
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:25.400]   Close to you by the cranberries?
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.400]   Just like me.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.080]   Oh, I'm buying it.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:30.600]   See that?
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:31.480]   Now they got me.
[00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:31.760]   See?
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:32.480]   Ten bucks.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.000]   And they might all be--
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.840]   Battle Bing, pet of Boom.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:40.440]   I got free cover songs, and I couldn't resist buying this.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:41.200]   Ten bucks.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:44.440]   It cost me for those free songs, because I ended up buying that.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:46.440]   But that's good.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:53.000]   And now I can share it on Google+ and tell my friends,
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:57:05.440]   what could be wrong with the cranberries singing close to you?
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:08.880]   Do you know what's your embarrassing music choice?
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.880]   Oh, I have many, many, very special.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.920]   I think Gina's music is generally just embarrassing.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:16.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.440]   Oh, I'm teasing her.
[00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:20.720]   I'm teasing.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.240]   Come on.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.360]   The last couple days I've been listening to classic Ben Folds
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:23.960]   5.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:24.960]   Yeah, no, that's great.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:25.480]   That's so bad.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.640]   She's a brick, and I'm falling slowly.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.600]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.640]   That's a great song.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.720]   So who listens to their Google music through Google Play?
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:35.440]   Never.
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.960]   But I've got a great collection.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:39.160]   I do on the app.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.160]   I do on the app.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:42.040]   Great big collection with zero plays.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.560]   They're out.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:45.960]   I can download them though, right?
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:46.840]   I mean, I could download them.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:47.320]   Yeah, I can download them.
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.240]   Yeah, I listen to them on my phone.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.200]   But I do admit that I buy most of my music on Amazon,
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.800]   and I love the Amazon player.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.320]   And I even buy a lot of stuff on iTunes.
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:04.840]   So Vivian Redding, Vivian Redding of the European Union.
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.600]   This is just a minor Jarvis moment,
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:09.040]   but she's the one who goes after Google all the time,
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.080]   and is doing all the horrible privacy things, I think,
[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:11.480]   in Europe.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.240]   And she calls--
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.000]   She has a lot of nerve.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.840]   She really has Orwellian surveillance apparatus.
[00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:18.960]   Oh, come now.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:22.680]   Every country in the EU has cameras on every freaking
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:25.120]   intersection.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.920]   And this EU commissioner calls the Street View car, which
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.080]   is just going around once and taking
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:36.320]   a picture of the street Orwellian.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.600]   Lady.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:38.520]   Lady.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.160]   Lady.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.640]   Don't you know?
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.280]   Is she German?
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.920]   She's-- no, she's Belgian.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:46.320]   Oh, well.
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.760]   She's fake French.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:49.760]   It's our Fredericks.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.320]   We'll never send you another check.
[00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:52.280]   You better be nice.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:57.800]   Wow.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.000]   Wow.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:58:59.960]   You're Orwellian.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.640]   And that's a-- that's nervy, because the car goes by,
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.120]   and that's that.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:07.480]   And it's not those cameras that are on, I'm sure,
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:11.640]   every street corner in Brussels are constantly monitoring
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:12.880]   everything that's going on.
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:13.380]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.040]   There's a difference between surveillance and cameras.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:17.360]   And they go straight to the police.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.360]   Ah.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:21.360]   [SIGHS]
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:23.320]   [SIGHS]
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:26.520]   To that, one of the reporters I got mad at this week--
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:28.440]   I yelled at-- it was so bad one of my neighbors came by.
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.640]   I said, who are you yelling at?
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:32.320]   Was from IPN in the UK.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:34.000]   Were you yelling at the TV?
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.600]   No, I was really yelling at reporters on the phone.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:37.320]   They said, can I talk to you for a quarter by this?
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:42.240]   But the premise would be bad technology, bad big company.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.160]   So one of them came in and said, well, Google
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.680]   got this patent to be able to use background sound when
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:48.120]   you make a--
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:48.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:49.600]   I saw that.
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:50.120]   I saw your--
[00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:52.720]   And how obviously awful and evil this is.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:55.120]   And I said, come on.
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:56.880]   If I ask for Raptor, and I can hear that I'm
[00:59:56.880 --> 01:00:00.840]   in a quiet museum, or I'm in a loud stadium,
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.200]   it's going to guess where they want the dinosaurs or jocks.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.760]   And it's going to tell me, and that's OK.
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:05.920]   And I can turn it off.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.480]   Jesus, get off of it.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:09.600]   I just yelled at the guy, use the F-word a few times.
[01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:10.320]   And I don't want to--
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:12.120]   Oh my goodness.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.320]   I just love that your neighbors have to check in on you.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.120]   Make sure they're like--
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:15.680]   Sure, you're OK.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.840]   --things OK.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:19.000]   Jarvis is having a hulk moment.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:19.440]   Jarvis is not dead.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.920]   He's turned bright green.
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.560]   I mean, if you were really on it, you would have just
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.320]   been being green right now.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.000]   No, dang.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   Sorry.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.800]   I was about to do it right now.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.320]   He's turning green.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.800]   He can't hassle I think it already.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.800]   Turning green.
[01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:36.240]   I can't handle that.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:40.360]   Google now is-- this is great, because Microsoft is suing
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.280]   Motorola.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.600]   But then Motorola came back and suing Microsoft, saying--
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:47.880]   and Motorola, of course, is Google.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.400]   I don't-- and Motorola, mobility we're talking about--
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.440]   that Microsoft says Motorola Mobility wants to charge it
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.600]   $4 billion a year in the patents that Motorola holds
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:00.720]   on Wi-Fi and video technology.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:06.000]   So they say, for the Xbox, you owe us $4 billion a year
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   in royalties, says Google.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:08.560]   A year.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.880]   Wow.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.880]   Wow.
[01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:14.400]   Wow.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.680]   Somebody should do a chart of who is suing whom for what?
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.440]   Because it just shows the absolute--
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.160]   Oh, they have.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:20.680]   They have.
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:21.480]   It's crazy.
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:25.480]   Yeah, it looks like the Paris subway map.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.080]   If the two don't come up with agreement,
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.440]   the judge could stop Microsoft from importing
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:32.600]   Xboxes into the US for sale.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.080]   No more Xboxes for you.
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.200]   Microsoft says this amount is insanely high and unfair.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:40.800]   So is life.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.520]   So wait, Google's using patents offensively here.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.960]   Apparently, I thought they weren't going to.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:49.320]   I thought they weren't going to either.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.480]   But this is Motorola Mobility.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.200]   So the same--
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:52.800]   I mean--
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.280]   It's in defense.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.600]   They could make the argument, no, this is in defense,
[01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:00.360]   because Microsoft has been going after Android.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:04.680]   So now we're going to come back and say, OK,
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:06.240]   you want to play that game?
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.760]   You owe us $4 billion.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.240]   One woman's offense is another woman's defense.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.520]   Depends on which side you're on.
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:13.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:14.560]   Right.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:14.920]   Right.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:16.840]   It's not a big royalty.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:17.800]   It's 2.25%.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:24.840]   Motorola lawyer told the judge, don't forget, they started this.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.560]   We didn't start this.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.160]   So that's their response.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.000]   No, it's defensive.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, teacher.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.400]   But that's why you buy Motorola for what are they?
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.480]   $15 billion.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:35.960]   That's why you buy $60 billion.
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:39.720]   Because those patents are defensive.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.480]   Offensive patents, yeah.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:46.840]   But it's only defensive if you use it, or the threat to use it.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.880]   Do we care about-- we talked about it a little bit on Twitter.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:54.520]   Do we care about the Yahoo CEO resume kerfuffle?
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.480]   Not only in the Yahoo remains even a bigger joke day by day.
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:57.760]   I know.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:58.640]   It's just getting worse.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.120]   It's just getting worse.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.200]   It's sad.
[01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.600]   It's a clown car.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.640]   But I mean, I don't know who cares if he said he had a computer science degree,
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:06.240]   and he didn't.
[01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.520]   He just took some courses.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.920]   I mean, I don't care.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:11.960]   My favorite and all that was a week ago, Michael Arrington, putting on his LinkedIn
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.400]   page that he was the CEO of Yahoo.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.720]   Why not?
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.800]   Now, do you credit the rumor that AOL--
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.680]   AOL's denied this.
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:24.280]   That AOL's going to sell and gadget and tech crunch?
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.360]   And that Mike Arrington then said, but I'm not buying.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.040]   I got your money.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:31.040]   I'm not giving any back.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.720]   The Yahoo reported 7-- even though it was denied immediately-- was it 70 million?
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.480]   I think he sold for 20--
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.600]   It's a big premium, 30, less than 30.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.760]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.120]   Wow.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:49.400]   What-- Facebook road shows ongoing.
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:53.720]   Mark Zuckerberg offended analysts by wearing a hoodie.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:54.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.280]   So here's the deal.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:58.680]   If you're going public, you then make you do a road show.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.920]   You go to the big institutional investors.
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.360]   People with a lot of money to buy stock, and you give them a pitch about why Facebook
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.640]   be a good investment.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.000]   And they get in early on it.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.800]   It's all an old boy network thing.
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:14.000]   But the zuck is just not into it, man.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.560]   So first, they make a video.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:20.640]   In New York, they force people to sit through a 30-minute video of Zuckerberg
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.800]   and then answer your questions.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:27.320]   People complained because they didn't-- they said, we didn't have enough time for questions.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:30.000]   And Mark's wearing a T-shirt.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.760]   So then he comes to another one and wears a hoodie.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:37.360]   And the analyst said, this is a sign, a mark of immaturity.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:37.880]   Wow.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.400]   She's-- you know, come to us in a hoodie, kid.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:45.720]   Mark Millian writing for Bloomberg about this, which is just great.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.120]   The analyst name is--
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.240]   let's see, Packter.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.960]   Michael Packter is an analyst for WEDBUSH securities.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.560]   Mark and his signature hoodie-- this is on Bloomberg TV.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:57.800]   He's actually showing investors.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.760]   He doesn't care that much.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.040]   He's going to be him.
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:01.640]   I think that's a mark of immaturity.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:06.800]   I think he has to realize he's bringing investors in as a new constituency right now,
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.160]   by the way.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.640]   That's exactly what he realizes and why he's going up yours.
[01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:15.400]   And I think he's got to show them the respect they deserve because he's asking them for their money.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:19.640]   And I think Zuck's a point of view is, hey, I'm asking you-- you don't have to give it to me.
[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.600]   If you think we're worth it, give it to me.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.760]   I'm offering you a great chance, a great opportunity to make some money.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.800]   He's putting forth the kind of hackers way, the hackers' ethic, right?
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.840]   He's not-- yeah.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:36.000]   This analyst said that he felt like this roadshow, going to ask people for these amounts of money,
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.560]   is it akin to going to a wedding or a funeral, showing up at a wedding or a funeral,
[01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.600]   not wearing a suit, that it's a sign of disrespect?
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.720]   Please.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:44.840]   Do you think-- yeah, he's not--
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.920]   He's not wearing the Wall Street uniform, so we're not--
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:53.200]   Well, I wonder, this analyst, by the way, issued a buy recommendation for Facebook stock.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.120]   So he's-- OK, he's got his moment in the sun.
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.400]   He's not much of a concern.
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.840]   But yeah, he's still going to give him his money.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:08.120]   And you know, would you rather invest in the new CEO of Yahoo and Atai?
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:08.640]   No, exactly.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.640]   Or the CEO of AO Well and Atai?
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:17.480]   Or Steve Jobs and the T-shirt and-- or a territorial neck and marks like a burgundy hoodie?
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:18.080]   Right.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.560]   Exactly.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.320]   It seemed like a cultural clash, right?
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.800]   Like New York Wall Street versus Valley.
[01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:26.400]   It was also kind of-- it was ageist, reverse ageist.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.880]   It was kid.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.320]   You don't know what you're doing here.
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.440]   What do you do?
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.880]   You didn't bring a knife to a gunfight, did you?
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:33.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:34.400]   Right.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:37.840]   Henry Blodgett did a very, very, very, very long post.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.520]   It was good.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:43.320]   Just recounting how Zuckerberg didn't want to go public.
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:47.360]   And if it hadn't been for the 500 rule, which has basically gone now with the Jobs
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.600]   Act, you know, may not have.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.560]   And the company could have stayed private forever.
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.720]   I mean, he resigned himself to it, and he's going to do it, and he's going to get benefits
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.720]   from it.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:01.120]   He's going to get, you know, liquid assets and a marketable commodity for buying things.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:05.400]   But the hassle is high, and the issue for him was control.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.920]   So he managed to keep control and go public at the same time.
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:10.360]   So FU, I'm wearing a hoodie.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:14.160]   Right on.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.600]   And speaking of modern times--
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.320]   Better a hoodie than that shirt you have on.
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:18.320]   Leo, so.
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.320]   Hey, this says--
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.320]   Oh, marital ward.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.320]   Scutors.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.320]   Computers on it.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.320]   You don't like this?
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.320]   I wouldn't invest in you with that on.
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.080]   No, good.
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.480]   You're probably right.
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.080]   So this is a sign of the times.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:35.400]   If you would doubt it in any way that Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher were no longer together,
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.960]   she's renamed her Twitter account.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.240]   She used to be Mrs. Kutcher.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.040]   Now she's just Demi.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:42.360]   And apparently, has put a rather provocative photo.
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:46.240]   I can't tell because it's behind her tweets.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.280]   The tweets are hiding something that it looks pretty exciting and exotic.
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.280]   Oh, it does.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.280]   Yeah, I know how to--
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.280]   Right click show background.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.080]   I know how to get it.
[01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.080]   Sorry.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.000]   Not a recent picture to me.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   Okay, just saying.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   That's kind of sad, though.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.200]   I mean, but don't-- okay, so just to tip-- by the way, Pierce Morgan when he's interviewing
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.640]   her says, you could change it to Mrs. Morgan.
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.000]   I don't think she accepted the proposal.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   Just--
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   Demi follows you?
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   Look at you, Leo.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   Rockin' it.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.880]   Hey, you know, we're just friends.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880]   You're--
[01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.880]   We're just friends.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.880]   All right, no.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:24.880]   Well, you picked right up on that one.
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:25.880]   Yeah, I did.
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:26.880]   Sorry.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.680]   Isn't that what people do, though?
[01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:33.800]   On girls that show, that new show on HBO, she tweets on the second end of the second
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.100]   episode.
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.560]   All adventurous women do.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:39.560]   It has something to do with--
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.560]   Thank you.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.560]   --vigorial disease, I think.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.560]   Anyway.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:48.480]   And then, immediately after, there's an analysis of the fact that she follows, like,
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:51.080]   1,000 people and has, like, four followers.
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.880]   It's pretty funny.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:54.880]   I paused it.
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:55.880]   I looked--
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:56.880]   Did you?
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.880]   See, that's the new thing.
[01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:58.880]   You go, oh, let's see.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:02.040]   Demi's only following 246 people, and I'm one of them.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.040]   Look at you.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.040]   Look at you.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.040]   Oh, oh.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.040]   It's the shirt.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.040]   It's the shirt.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.040]   She likes the shirt Mr. Jarvis.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.040]   Oh, oh.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.360]   I'm just saying.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:16.160]   Demi, whatever those boots are you wearing, I like those.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.480]   Just to return the favor.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:20.400]   That's like 30 years ago, Demi.
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:21.400]   Really.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:22.400]   And then--
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.400]   The greatest--
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.400]   What are the greatest moments she ever had?
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:27.800]   I remember this when she was on, I think, was a vanity fair on the cover, basically
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.640]   nude body painted.
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:31.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:36.800]   And then she took the rag that she'd used to clean herself off, the washcloth, and gave
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:38.640]   it to David Letterman.
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.440]   And he swooshed as well as he should have.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.600]   You know, if you're a sex symbol, work it, baby.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.840]   Work it.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.240]   You know, don't be apologetic.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.640]   Go, you want my sweat?
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:51.640]   Why not?
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:52.640]   Where'd you take--
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.040]   Where'd you get that dog face back on you, Leo?
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:06.080]   I actually interviewed her many, many years ago when she was still on general hospital.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.080]   What--
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.080]   Wow.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:09.920]   What could the possible tech angle have been, Leo?
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.920]   Oh, this is when I was a general--
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:12.920]   Like you.
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.920]   I have a previous career in media.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:15.920]   Oh, OK.
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.640]   And this is when I was just doing general--
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:18.640]   Cheap celebrity stuff.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.320]   Cheap celebrity stuff, exactly.
[01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.480]   If I'd been smart, I would have started a magazine, but no.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.640]   No, it was smarter not to believe me.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.280]   Was it Eerus?
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.280]   What was it?
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.280]   Entertainment Weekly, right?
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.280]   Yeah, there's the--
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.280]   Let's see here.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.280]   The original cover.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.280]   Right above the Osborne.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.280]   Yep.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.760]   And over there is the trial cover.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:44.080]   It was a horrible, horrible cover.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.520]   I liked Entertainment Weekly.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:49.400]   In fact, when I was a DJ interviewing people like to me more, I used it for research.
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:54.720]   I have the Entertainment Weekly's top 10 things we love this week on my iPad.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.720]   I kind of love it.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:56.720]   See?
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:57.720]   See?
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.720]   This was the original cover.
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.720]   With--
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:02.720]   You were trying to do--
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.720]   You were doing--
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.720]   An intellectual.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.040]   And that was the mistake.
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:09.960]   They didn't tell me that they'd put it in every Kmart in Calderon America.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:10.960]   Right.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.560]   And so, man, this cover come back.
[01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.560]   Whoa.
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:17.080]   Yeah, you were making-- you didn't get what--
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:18.680]   You'd the mission.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:20.360]   This was the original prototype cover.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.360]   Oh, cool.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.360]   Mm?
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.360]   Was that Michael Jackson?
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.360]   Oh, it's Fred.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.360]   Oh, it's Fred.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.360]   It's Fred Savage.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.360]   Fred Savage.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.920]   He was adorable.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:31.920]   He was adorable.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.920]   Well, still is.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:33.920]   It's quite an adorable--
[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:34.920]   But then he hit puberty and it got weird.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:36.920]   Well, he was really cute as a kid.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:37.920]   Sorry.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.000]   Back to TV.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   It all comes back to TV.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   It goes back to TV.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   I'm telling you.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   We are the TV generation.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.560]   We have a tip a tool and the number of the week.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.080]   But first, a word from squarespace.com.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.880]   What a great place to get your website going.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:54.880]   It's hosting.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.280]   The best hosting you can get anywhere.
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.520]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:02.560]   You know, lately, I've also been talking about the fact that it's more secure because
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:05.600]   they run the hosting, the software.
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.760]   They keep it up to date.
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:13.600]   The all the vulnerabilities that our sites and other sites are prey to with running PHP
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.240]   and Apache and all that, not on Squarespace.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:19.040]   It's locked down.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.280]   So unless you are prepared to manage your server and keep it secure, I highly recommend
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.880]   squarespace.com.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.480]   Manage servers never run out of bandwidth.
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:30.880]   Really reasonable price.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.240]   And then there's this great software on top of it that lets you make a unique site.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:43.240]   Great templates, themes, 85 plus professionally designed styles from the biggest brand names
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.240]   and designers.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:48.320]   Photo galleries are just gorgeous if you're a photographer with light box integration,
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:51.400]   hover effects, automatic image resizing.
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.320]   They've got an iOS and an Android app.
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.320]   I love that.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.080]   So it's easy to post, easy to moderate.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.280]   Now import from the existing APIs of movable type, WordPress type pad and blogger, but
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.800]   they'll also export back out so you're never stuck.
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.600]   And that import is very thorough.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.320]   I mean, it gets all the links, all the images, all the comments, everything.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:11.320]   I can go on and on.
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:14.080]   I'll tell you what the best thing to do is just click that green, try it free button
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.960]   on squarespace.com.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.480]   You've got the run of the place for two weeks for no cost.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.840]   You don't even have to give them a credit card.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:22.040]   Just boom, you could do anything you want.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:24.320]   If you decide you want to buy, take a look at the pricing.
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.320]   You've revamped their pricing.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:32.440]   It's much simpler and frankly, much more affordable, $8 a month for the basic plan, $16
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:37.840]   a month for unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:41.840]   And by the way, when you sign up for the annual plan, you get a free custom domain.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.720]   They'll even do the setup so that it points to your site.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:49.520]   So this really is from soup to nuts, everything you need at an amazing price.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:51.280]   And I have a special offer for you.
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.600]   And use the offer code twig five, you'll get 10% off that first purchase.
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:14:00.040]   So get the annual plan, get the free domain registration, get 10% off.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.760]   You're really saving squarespace.
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.640]   Great place to set up your next website, squarespace.com.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:12.800]   Who are we talking to that did a squarespace site?
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.800]   We're just talking about that.
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:14.800]   Oh, actually no tight.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:16.800]   Actually, the broad experience.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.600]   Actually, the broad experience.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.920]   Yeah, the broad experience.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:24.800]   And you see, actually it's interesting because she could use squarespace to store the podcast,
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:28.320]   but instead she uses SoundCloud also free for the storage.
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.320]   So she's really got it.
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.320]   She's got it.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.680]   And I've had her watch Twitch shows and said that she ought to look at doing video instead
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.560]   of just audio and then she could use Hangouts.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.560]   Can we have her on Twitch?
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.160]   What is your specialty?
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:44.760]   She worked on a marketplace for some like seven years.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.760]   Like finance.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.760]   Like finance.
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.760]   Econ.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.760]   Business.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.760]   Oh, we could use somebody like that.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.040]   She's a voice.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.040]   She is wonderful.
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:56.120]   And the other woman she interviewed in the show with Gina, Anna Benier is starting to
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:58.280]   store a show called, I mean, a show.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:02.000]   Listen to me, a company called Skill Crush, which she doesn't say it this way, but it
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.680]   was really inspired by trying to teach women to code because she found it.
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:06.680]   No, that's me.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:10.560]   She learned to code being around boys and their ways and they're going to do it a new
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.360]   way rather than saying, well, you want to learn Pearl.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.400]   No, you want to learn how to do this task.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.840]   Whatever you need to learn to do that, we're going to teach you that.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.960]   So it's two of the businesses out of my class.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:19.960]   Me too.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:20.960]   Really neat.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:27.360]   Gina, Trapani, does your resume say you have a computer science degree?
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.360]   It does.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.360]   And I do.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.360]   Oh, all right.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.360]   I mean, I really do.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.360]   I can show you my degree.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.360]   It's somewhere.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.960]   I was trying to impeach your credibility, but apparently your integrity is 100% ahead
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:38.960]   of yahoo, Dan.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:41.560]   You're even better than Yahoo.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.440]   That's not saying anything.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.560]   So Gina has a tip for us.
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:50.320]   Yeah, so my tip this week is an app I've been using for a long time now.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.640]   It's called timehop.com.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.280]   And I'm surprised I never brought up on the show before because I really love it.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:01.040]   If you use social media, if you've been using social media pretty regularly for more than
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.240]   a year, this is a really cool app.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.360]   Basically what it does is it's very simple.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:09.520]   It sends you an email every day with a digest of everything that you posted across different
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.760]   networks on a given day.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:12.760]   What a good idea.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:17.080]   So, I mean, it sounds kind of like, you know, first I was like, I get too much email.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.080]   I don't need this.
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.080]   I signed up for it.
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:22.280]   So I use four square Facebook and Twitter pretty regularly.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.360]   It doesn't score Google+, yet.
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:26.080]   And you get this email and it says, you know what?
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:28.480]   A year ago, May 9th was a Monday.
[01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:33.320]   It was 65 degrees in sunny and I checked in at the San Diego airport, the San Francisco
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:34.840]   airport, the Moscone Center.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.840]   It was Google I/O.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:36.840]   You were Google I/O today.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:37.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.160]   Yeah, we were Google, Google I/O.
[01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:43.160]   It's a really neat way to just kind of get reminded of things.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.160]   I have a terrible memory.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.960]   I have a really bad sense of time, memory-wise.
[01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:46.960]   Like, was that two years ago?
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:47.960]   Is that three years ago?
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:48.960]   Is a year ago?
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:49.960]   But you get just--
[01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:50.960]   I needed it for yesterday.
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:52.960]   Seriously.
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:56.400]   But you know, you just get reminded of things, especially if you use four squareys.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.600]   Like, oh, that time it went to that place with a friend.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:02.520]   And if you start like leaving pictures places to you, you just get this really nice memory
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:06.240]   of places that you've been, things that you've done, thoughts you've had, articles that
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:09.160]   you liked enough to tweet or share on Facebook.
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:13.080]   You kind of get to revisit a year later and remember what that was like.
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:15.200]   So it's a really cool service.
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.040]   It's something that I-- if it fills a need that I think is really important and something
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:22.800]   I'm trying to really do with ThinkUp, which is like deriving meaning from all these little
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.240]   tracks we leave around the internet and these different streams of information that just
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.000]   kind of flow down and disappear.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.320]   This is a cool kind of simple, fun way to just say, hey, this is where you were a year
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.320]   ago.
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:37.120]   And emails are just well written, the copies are all written, they also have little facts
[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:39.240]   about what happened on this day or ago.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.240]   So--
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:42.680]   So I'm just going to get a daily email now from them saying this is what you were up
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:43.680]   to last year.
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:45.440]   Yeah, May 9th last year, right.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.480]   You checked in these places, you tweeted this.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:48.480]   I'm here.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.480]   I'm off my mind.
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.640]   It's going to say, this is what you were mad about last year.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.640]   Exactly.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.280]   Jeff will get to relive all his rounds.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.800]   That's hulktimehulk.com.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:00.200]   They-- your last hulk moment.
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:04.000]   This is one of the first big hacks with four squares API.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.120]   So it was built originally on four square, but it works.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.880]   It's put on Facebook as well.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:09.320]   So now it says, thanks.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.320]   We're preparing your emails.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.320]   I did the whole thing.
[01:18:11.320 --> 01:18:14.080]   If you've got content, you'll get your first email in the morning.
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:19.520]   And this just makes you-- I think this is created by the consortium of social networks
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.760]   because this just encourages you to post more.
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.760]   Right?
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.760]   And it makes you-- it's me.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:28.040]   I feel like I'm putting like a little message in a bottle in my future self.
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.480]   You know, like today, President Obama's announcement.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:32.760]   A year from now, I'm going to feel really happy about that.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.720]   Namely, somebody's going to read your social postings.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.720]   You!
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.720]   Me!
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:38.720]   This 365 days from now.
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:41.400]   Because I often wonder, what are we putting all this stuff out for?
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:43.640]   Because who's going to-- nobody cares, but like we do.
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:44.640]   Right.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:45.640]   Like what are we doing?
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.840]   The Facebook realized that the timeline is not for anybody, but you.
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:49.840]   Yep.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:50.840]   It's true.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.400]   So this is like the timeline plus.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.400]   It's cool.
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:54.400]   I like it.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:55.400]   Exactly.
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:56.400]   Although actually, I have all those things hooked up to the timeline.
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.280]   So the timeline could do the same thing too.
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.280]   Timehup.com.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:03.080]   Jeff, you've got three numbers to choose.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.080]   I'm going to pick this one.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:08.480]   I'm going to pick because some news just happened moments ago in one of them.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:12.880]   The Pebble Watch, the E-ink watch on Kickstarter, passed $10 million.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.880]   Wow!
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:14.880]   $10 million.
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:15.880]   Wow!
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.160]   Now, here's the other news folks.
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.480]   Sorry, it's over.
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:19.480]   Sold out.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.720]   They, they capped it at 85,000 watches.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.240]   Yeah, I got mine.
[01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:24.240]   And so I did too.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.240]   I got mine.
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:26.240]   Sold out, sold out, sold out.
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:30.120]   I was going to buy one more, one minute ago, and it just sold out.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:34.160]   It just passed 85,000 watches, which is just pretty amazing.
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.160]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.040]   If you pledge a thousand or more, you can get 10 pebbles.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.040]   Yes, you can do that.
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:42.680]   So you know I should do that for everybody at TWIT.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.680]   What is the Pebble?
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:44.680]   What is the Pebble?
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:50.880]   The Pebble is an E-ink watch with an API so you can change the face and change what it
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:51.880]   shows.
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:53.520]   And so it's just, it's just genius.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.120]   Why wasn't this thought of before?
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:57.000]   Well, I've seen E-ink watches before.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   I think Philippe's started on there.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   There are.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000]   But it's amazing.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.880]   So what was genius about it was they couldn't get any cash from anybody.
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:07.480]   And so they went to Kickstarter and the most successful Kickstarter project of all times.
[01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:08.480]   Five miles.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:12.160]   They asked for $100,000,000 and they got $10,000,000.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.480]   That's, yeah, that's VC money.
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:14.480]   I mean, that's crazy.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:15.480]   Oh, easy.
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:16.480]   That's more than they own.
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.440]   They still own the entire company.
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.280]   They got the best market research possible.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:23.760]   They're using their customers capital to build this.
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:24.960]   You know, it's a beautiful thing.
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:29.800]   And the only, the only yes but here is what if they miscalculated the manufacturing cost.
[01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.800]   Right.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.800]   That's, that's the thing.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.480]   There's actually a lot of yes buts because I have to say there's no protection on, on
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:36.480]   the Kickstarter.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.480]   No, there's not.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.480]   There's not.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.480]   And, and, and, and Kixrara says that.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:43.600]   So once, once they pass in nine days, the, the time limit and all that $10 million goes
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:46.680]   to them, you know, Libya, here they come.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:47.680]   Right.
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:48.680]   They can walk away.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:49.680]   That's possible.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:51.680]   They can.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.480]   Or more likely, I don't think they'll walk away, but more likely there could be a hitch.
[01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.480]   And they get along.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:59.600]   The worst that I could imagine is A, that, that, that what they thought the manufacturing
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.280]   process B isn't or B, there's a cost overrun.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:05.600]   And with 85,000 units, that's deadly.
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:06.600]   Right.
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.600]   Right.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:08.600]   And, and it was cheap to get it.
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.600]   Right.
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:10.600]   It was only, Leo, what was it?
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:11.600]   A hundred.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:16.640]   I bought, I bought, I think I bought the $115 one, which means a, oh no, I did 125.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:22.400]   So I could choose from Arctic white cherry red voters choice or jet black and I being
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:23.400]   bland.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.400]   You got the black one.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:25.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:30.360]   I might pledge a thousand at this point.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:33.800]   Do you think, do you think people who work here would want one of these?
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:34.800]   Chad?
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.800]   Yeah, Liz?
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:38.800]   John, yeah.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.800]   Anything for free.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:40.800]   You don't work here anymore.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.800]   I know.
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:42.800]   I'm not going to get it anymore.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:45.000]   This is how I'm trying to keep Eileen.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   Gee, for a thousand bucks, every one of you could have a pebble watch.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:54.320]   I wonder if Molly would would be doing that for her employees.
[01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:57.880]   Hey, look at this for a 1250.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:58.880]   Oh, that sold out.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:21:59.880]   You can get a custom.
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.720]   I could have a special Twitch watch face.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:05.120]   Would have been cool.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:06.120]   Hmm.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:09.280]   A hundred watches are $10,000.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.000]   That sold that sold out.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000]   31 backers.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.720]   They want to 30.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:19.000]   31 people paid $10,000.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.640]   Yeah, that's what they're resellable.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:22.640]   Right?
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:23.640]   There's now a market.
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.040]   So now that's the last you'll ever buy this watch at $115.
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.920]   That's the other reason if they had to cap it.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:29.480]   They were eating into their market.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:30.480]   Right.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:31.480]   You know, the reason to do this.
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.640]   So you think it's going to cost $200 or $300?
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:34.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:39.440]   Incoming caller ID, email, calendar alerts, Facebook messages, Twitter, weather alerts.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.120]   But I got to point out this doesn't exist.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:47.880]   And you're kind of, because I'll tell you, I've participated in a number of Kickstarter's
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:51.040]   that I still haven't received anything for.
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:52.720]   I have, yeah, I've got some.
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:57.480]   I have my little glyph, the thing that holds my iPhone for a tripod.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.480]   That was a good one.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.480]   It was a good one.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:01.640]   I have my shoulder strap for my briefcase.
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:03.640]   It was one I got from there.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:10.480]   I ordered, we'll see if it comes, the new iPhone case that actually remembers all your
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:14.280]   credit cards and affinity cards in one card.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.080]   And all of these you've got, you've received.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:18.520]   No, I haven't got the last one.
[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:23.920]   I did some dice that I've never, I'm never going to get with some games.
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.480]   Oh, no, I very importantly, no, no, no.
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:26.480]   The best thing I got was this.
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:27.480]   Hold on.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.480]   The glyph was good.
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.240]   That was a good bet.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.000]   This is a board game.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000]   Yeah.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   I'll start up.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   See, that's cool.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   Oh, cool.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.280]   I can't even find the dice game anymore on the Kickstarter site.
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.440]   I got hit said misses.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.520]   I funded books and albums that I've gotten.
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.840]   I founded Zay Frank's show.
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:52.920]   That was good, but see, you could.
[01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:53.920]   So this is it.
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:54.920]   Dice Age.
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.080]   It was like a new game.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:59.840]   I wasn't very, I think I pledged 10 bucks or something.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.000]   I just took the book.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:06.040]   I pledged to Asteroid, which was a project to send an Android phone into space and develop
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:08.520]   an app and take photos.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.320]   And it didn't work out.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:15.080]   And the person who ran the project just emailed all the backers and said, "You gave me money.
[01:24:15.080 --> 01:24:17.040]   I didn't fulfill my end of the bargain.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:22.840]   Let me know if you want me to donate your donation, your backing money to charity water,
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:23.840]   or if you want it back."
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:24.840]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:25.840]   Or what?
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.080]   Which I felt like was the most gracious way to handle a situation.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:31.160]   He's like, "You know, I just didn't know what needed to go into this.
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:34.120]   I thought it was going to be easier than it was, and I'm sorry.
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:35.360]   And what do you want me to do with your money?
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.360]   I can make it or."
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.360]   Wow.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:38.360]   That's what I didn't have to do.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.800]   Do you think Kickstarter has any obligation here?
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:41.800]   They say no.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:47.000]   They need to come up with some sort of plan B. They should let a person who's starting
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:55.000]   a project say, "Give backers the option for me to funnel their donation to charity if
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000]   this doesn't work out."
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:00.080]   There's got to be some sort of structure for failure because it seems like this is the
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:04.040]   refrain of a lot of people that they're backing projects and they're not getting anything.
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.120]   The first thing I ever backed on here was diaspora.
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:09.880]   The Facebook clone.
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.520]   I don't know what's happened with that.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:15.040]   They're still around.
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:20.440]   This thing got funded in June of last year and I still haven't received anything.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:22.280]   I probably have my money.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:26.680]   You can send a message to say, "What's going on?"
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.160]   What the hey, man?
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:31.840]   So $10 million for the pebble.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.240]   I better get my pebble.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:35.240]   I'll be mad.
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:36.240]   If I don't get that, I'll be mad.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.360]   Well, this is such a high profile project.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:39.840]   They've got to ship something.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.840]   Right.
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.680]   It'll be a big story that they didn't.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:44.720]   We can all get a pet rock.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.720]   Real quickly because we're running late.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:54.600]   I just mentioned my tool is the Google+ client for iOS has been updated.
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:57.760]   I thought it was, I read that it was going to be universal.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.760]   It is not.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.400]   It is an iPhone app.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:05.040]   But Mike Elgin does a little piece on his Google+ account in which he talks about how
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.040]   nice it looks.
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:08.160]   They have to say it does look nice on the iPad.
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.160]   It's still you're doubling the size and all of that.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.160]   It actually is pretty.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.920]   They've got a new styling.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.920]   Pictures look great.
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:21.080]   Videos look great.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.800]   It takes advantage of the iPad's screen real estate in a nice way.
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:28.840]   I wish, though, that look how bad the text looks on the iPad.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.520]   It's been way so hard.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.040]   Text could be done right.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:37.200]   That's something that should be vector graphic and should be able to work easily.
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.760]   Or just let me have the iPad's big.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.240]   Let me have the web version.
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:42.240]   Yeah.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:43.240]   Why not?
[01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:44.240]   Why not just do it?
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:45.240]   It doesn't let you.
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:46.240]   It forces you to go to a moment.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:47.640]   And it's not as good.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:49.240]   It doesn't do things.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:50.240]   They're so close now.
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:53.240]   I have a feeling that they soon they'll be an iPad version of this.
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:55.080]   I mean, look, it's so close.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.880]   It really does look good.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:59.800]   So Google+ even if you have an iPhone, of course, you'll get an iPhone.
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:00.800]   It's not a update.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.640]   But if you haven't put it on the iPad, put it on the iPad, the new one's actually pretty
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:05.120]   nice.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.000]   Pretty nice.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.680]   Ladies and gentlemen, we do this show this week in Google every Wednesday afternoon,
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.680]   1 p.m.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:13.680]   Pacific, 4 p.m.
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:14.680]   Eastern time.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:19.200]   2000 UTC, 20 OO hours on Twitter.TV.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:23.040]   But you can always download audio and video after the fact from our website and everywhere
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.040]   better podcasts.
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:27.560]   Our gene of Japan is at smarterware.org.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:30.440]   It's her blog and of course thinkupapp.com.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.840]   And she'll be gay all over San Diego tonight.
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:34.440]   I will be happy and gay.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:38.840]   And I just wanted to thank Eileen for being one of the best producers on the planet making
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:40.680]   the show so great for so long.
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:41.680]   We really appreciate it.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:42.680]   Eileen, you're the best.
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:45.880]   I didn't want to break it on you there.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:52.480]   But you beat me to it, Eileen, without you, the show wouldn't be possible.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:55.680]   All the help that Eileen gives behind the scenes, all of the wonderful support and the
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:58.960]   great attitude and the professionalism and...
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.760]   Don't leave, Jardin!
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:01.760]   She will be missed.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:05.600]   I'm going to have a hulk moment here and start backing you into this hulk.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.200]   I tried to give her a pebble watch.
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:08.200]   That didn't work.
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:09.720]   This has been truly an honor.
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.600]   It's my favorite show on Twitch.
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:14.400]   Well, you made it.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:19.480]   Eileen's producing really, as I think Gina pointed out before the show began, to put
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.640]   us in a whole different level.
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:22.640]   So thank you, Eileen.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.200]   Eileen is leaving a Twitch to go.
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.240]   She'll still be doing all about Android, by the way.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:31.280]   But she's leaving to go work for Amali Wood and her new show Always On.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:33.720]   So you'll be able to see her doing that.
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:37.000]   And we have not yet announced her replacement, but I guess by next week we'd better have
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000]   to...
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.840]   You guys will be in good hands.
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:41.840]   Yeah, sure.
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:42.840]   Somebody.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.400]   We didn't mention Flipboard Android for Flipboard.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.440]   It's supposed to be for the Galaxy S3, right?
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:47.440]   It is not official.
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:48.440]   Leaked out.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.840]   It's a leak, so it doesn't work for all devices.
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:53.400]   Yeah, so that's kind of why I didn't.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:59.560]   But I have to say, that is one of the few apps that are iOS-only that really kind of dominate.
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:02.080]   And the fact that it's now going to be on Android.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:07.720]   Wow, that's a big loss for iOS, I think.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.800]   I'm not sure how do you get it?
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:12.320]   You go, there's an APK on the XDA.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.320]   Ah.
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:17.280]   And if you don't know what that means, then you don't get it.
[01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:18.280]   Yeah.
[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:20.720]   Download the APK and then use it.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:22.440]   There's some devices that don't really work.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:25.720]   So people are using it on tablets and it seems to be working fine there.
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:29.160]   Although it's weird because it's not a tablet app.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.120]   It's for the phone.
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:34.480]   So some guy used Android to extract the APK.
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.960]   Yes, at the event or something.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.880]   Bad, bad man.
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.040]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.520]   That's where he blogs and he's also a professor of journalism.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:47.160]   If you're ever so lucky to go to City University of New York, you could study with him in
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:50.080]   his very strange hands.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:51.760]   The office started to point to the office.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:54.440]   I'm like, I got a problem.
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:56.160]   I've decided to go to a new dance.
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:30:02.000]   Thank you all for joining us and come back next week for another edition of this week
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000]   in Google.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:04.000]   Stay tuned.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.680]   TNT is coming up next.
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:07.680]   Bam.
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:08.680]   Badabam.
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:09.680]   Oh, badaboom.
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:10.680]   Oh, no.
[01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:14.680]   You can give me the Squarespace copy off my desk.
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:15.680]   Bye, guys.
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:16.680]   Bye-bye.
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:17.680]   Good luck.
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:18.680]   Thank you.
[01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:19.680]   God bless you.
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:20.680]   Thank you for everything.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:21.680]   We'll see you on the internet.
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:24.200]   In the internet, I'm so glad you're still doing all about it.
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:25.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:26.200]   Comic-Con.
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.200]   I even said I could do it, so I will do it.
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:28.200]   Oh, it's really good.
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.200]   It's just awesome.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:31.780]   (upbeat music)
[01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:34.360]   (upbeat music)
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:36.940]   (upbeat music)
[01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:39.940]   [MUSIC]
