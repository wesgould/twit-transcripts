[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Today it's kind of old home week.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Stacey Wig and...both of them is back.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Hello Stacey.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   In her...I don't know, how would you describe this hairpiece you're wearing?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Oh, it's my curly ombre wig.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Curly ombre, okay.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Not ombre, but like ombre, like the faded color.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Oh!
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Color fades, yep.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Ombre, curly ombre.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Oh, is that how you say it?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I think it's like burnt ombre?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Well, it's spelled O-M-B-R-E.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Yes, because it's shadow.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Ombre.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   But I think it's pronounced ombre.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Okay, remember, I learned everything by reading, so I don't know how to pronounce anything.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Me too.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I know, that's why I call you Higgin' Botham.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Umm...it's pronounced like a spell.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Stacey is, of course, at staceyofoniot.com and co-host of the Great IoT Podcast with Kevin Tofel.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Gotta get her newsletter too, that's really good.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And I have lots of IoT questions, but we'll get to that in a second.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Awesome.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Because I want to also introduce Jeff Jarvis, who is again with us from Buzzmachine.com,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Professor...
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Hello, hello, hello.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   ...Cuny and I won't say the townite thing in the Craig Newmark.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Uh, Ant is taking the day off.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   He has some barbecue duties because of tomorrow.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Is he smoking a turkey?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   He'd be smoking?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   I would bet.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   I didn't find out, but I would bet.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I would bet there is a smoked turkey involved.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I was gonna ask him if he makes oyster cornbread stuffing.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Yeah, that's the traditional southern stuffing, isn't it?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Yeah, not just cornbread oysters.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I put sausage in my cornbread stuffing.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I can't do these.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   That's fair.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Yeah, that's as good as oysters.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Better.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Ah.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Ooh.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Stacey, are you doing the military maneuvers that you've done in years' gun buy for Thanksgiving?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   This year, I have yet to put together my color-coded gant chart, but it's gonna...
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   (laughter)
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   ...doin' a slightly more relaxed version, but I am creating my list.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I've got...
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   There's a lot going on.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   It's a new kitchen, you guys.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Oh, right.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   There's one less oven.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Oh, I was gonna ask you if enough oven space.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Oh, no.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   But you have the June.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I don't even know.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I have the June and I have a normal oven.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I have an Instapot.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I have a crockpot.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   One of my casseroles has already done.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   The kale is already prepped for the salad.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Well, if you have the kale.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I mean, Thanksgiving is fine.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I already pre-made my gravy.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It's thawing.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   The turkey's brining.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   It's gonna be okay.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Are you doing, uh, brusse sprouts?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I am.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Maple glazed bacon brusse sprouts.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Oh, maple glazed bacon brussel sprouts.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Be still my heart.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Actually, you know, I have a great recipe.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   You get the maple and the bacon and the brussel sprouts and you throw out the brussel sprouts.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And it is the...
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   It is the best.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Excellent.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   So good.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Oh, we have at the bottom of the rundown, we have, thanks to Google, which we have right
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   here, Lee, the most popular, uh, slide dishes by state.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Thank you, Google, I guess.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Oh.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Brussel sprouts from, um, what state is brussel sprouts popular in?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   That's a lie.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Up in the northeast.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Really?
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I love them.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   You know, that's not a common.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   My mom used to call them Christmas tree balls and I loved them.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Christmas tree balls.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Yeah, see, she lied, basically.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I call broccoli trees.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Bruce, Sally?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Oh, well, yeah.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Are you looking?
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   All right, we might as well do this list.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   We've started.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Yeah, sure.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Let's dig down.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.720]   We're going to start from the bottom up.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.000]   We've never done that before.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Actually, this was one of your numbers, wasn't it?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   It's okay.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   I put multiples there so I can get.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   So Google does this every, uh, every year, right?
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.200]   Brussel sprouts is that New Hampshire or Vermont?
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.000]   It's New Hampshire.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Vermont's vegetables.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Vegetables is not a dish.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Main potatoes.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Whatever's in the garden.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Massachos, it's a spout of that squash in Rhode Island.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   It's cranberry sauce because that's where it's grown in the bogs.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Connecticut is stuffing.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Cornbread stuffing in New York.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Stuffing in Pennsylvania.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   Stuffing in Delaware.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Sweet potatoes.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Mac and cheese.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Why can't I get invited for Thanksgiving?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Where's Mac and cheese?
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Oh, is that Virginia?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   What is that?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   No, that's Delaware.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   That's Delaware.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Delaware and California.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Mac and cheese.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Mac and cheese.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Green bean, casserole in Nevada.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Creamy mashed potatoes in Arizona.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Same thing in mashed potatoes in L.I.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   I like mashed potatoes.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I think mashed potatoes are delicious.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Poor old Texas.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Look what Texas got.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   This fits fruit salad.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Is it true?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Is that what you really?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I've never, I've never had a fruit salad at Thanksgiving, but sure.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   They do this based on like, weird stuff people search for.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   So there's people you're searching for.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   There's a weird community somewhere in Texas where fruit salad is the thing and it's throwing
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   everybody else off.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   In order to, of course, Google's data driven.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.640]   So if you look at colors, reds, casseroles, that means those are the states that the casseroles
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.720]   are a mighty good thing.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.560]   Green is veggies.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.200]   Blue is stuffing.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.400]   Yellow is dressing.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   What's the difference?
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.000]   Yeah, what is the difference?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Well, well, it's a regional thing.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Oh, they call it dressing.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Oh, so what's the difference in?
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.920]   I think, I mean, I always understood stuffings in the turkey, dressing's outside, but.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.920]   People say that, but my family in Mississippi, when you go there, everything is dressing.
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.920]   Even if it does.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.160]   Oh, I love it.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.640]   It says food and wine.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.640]   It says food and wine.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.760]   This is one of my point of my mother for stuffing is a mixture used to stuff on other
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:54.280]   food, traditionally pulled before cooking, whereas dressing is cooked in a pan outside
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.280]   the turkey.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.280]   That's what I just said.
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.880]   Oh, yeah, that is exactly what he just said.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.080]   Okay, I just want to point out.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.920]   I was looking it up while he said it.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.880]   There is something weird with North Dakota, something weird going on with North Dakota.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:17.840]   Apparently, keto soup is the most searched Thanksgiving side dish in North Dakota.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.840]   That is what?
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.680]   Low-carb vegetable soup.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.120]   Of course, in Michigan, it's sweet potatoes with marshmallows.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.760]   That's obvious.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.960]   All right, anyway, we've.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.680]   Well, then we can go.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.440]   Then we can go to the worst side dishes.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.440]   All right.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.440]   Okay.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.440]   Okay.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.440]   Which is next.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.000]   Oh, should we just answer all your numbers?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   That's okay.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   These two go together.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.640]   This is from Fox News.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:53.440]   Weird Thanksgiving side dishes go viral and horrifying Twitter thread.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.120]   Mya Kosoff started it.
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:59.640]   I cannot wait to hear about the recipes you're all excited to make for Thanksgiving.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:05.520]   I'm also here to hear about the weird inexplicable retro family recipes that end up on your
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:09.200]   Thanksgiving table tradition, tradition, or nostalgia or whatever.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   That looks like the one.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.920]   Go ahead and see what it is for sure.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.520]   Her first one was seafoam salad.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.360]   She thought it was a normal thing every family made for Thanksgiving.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.360]   It's very alike.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.200]   What I had growing up, I hated it.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.880]   It was green, jello, and cottage cheese.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.880]   There you go.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.440]   Yes, I couldn't have remorse, Stacy.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.440]   Awful.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.600]   No, no, no, no.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:38.720]   How about there's a pair of salad that inexplicably has cheese on it.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.360]   Oh, it's had cheese.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.080]   I thought it was like grated carrot.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.920]   Shredded cheddar.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.680]   What's the white cream cheese?
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.080]   Whip with a, for those of you with hearing a maraschino cherry on top.
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:56.040]   So honestly, Americans are so awful.
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.040]   Americans just.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.200]   Pairs and the right kind of cheese.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   Delicious.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.800]   Well, yeah, but this is not that Stacey.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.120]   Pairs and we can spread it.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.120]   Yellow cheese.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.360]   A little different.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   You never know though.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.600]   I mean, people eat weird stuff and they like it.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:15.160]   I do love the, a lot of people put their old recipe cards on Twitter and it's fun to
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.080]   see these old beat up cards.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.360]   I have a set of those too.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.400]   Oh, I'll show you my recipe book.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.200]   Oh, by the way, free gift idea for anybody who's interested in it.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:32.920]   Buy a nice book with a durable cover and spiral bound is best.
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:37.520]   And do your family recipes, write them out by hand with little notes in them and give
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.720]   them to your son, your daughter, somebody who.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.600]   So yeah, I actually do something similar.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.920]   I share the paprika file.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.760]   The paprika file.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.280]   Because I use an app.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.640]   You know, nowadays printing it out is kind of old school.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:53.640]   Okay.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.960]   Yeah, I know, but that's kind of what's fun about it.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   Oh, okay.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.240]   Like my mom's right out.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.800]   I put all in my hand with my handwriting.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.360]   People will get poisoned.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.720]   I have my mom's cards.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.600]   No, no, I have Coca Cola salad.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.040]   You ever hear Coca Cola salad?
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.400]   For those of you listening at home and maybe you'd like to make this tomorrow, one package
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:19.480]   orange jello, one small package cream cheese, one 10 ounce Coca Cola and a half cup of nuts
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.200]   doesn't matter what.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:26.800]   Let the cheese come to room temperature, dust jello into cream cheese so that you're not
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.760]   meant the cream cheese is the liquid heat the Coca Cola to the boiling point and then
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:37.480]   pour over the mixture, mix it together, add nuts, put it in a mold, but then this is the
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.480]   key.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.600]   Leave it out for a few hours before you refrigerate it.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:47.400]   So the salad separates into three attractive layers.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.400]   Serves for another one.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.680]   Lime lemon lime jello crushed pineapple cottage cheese and mayo or sour cream.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.920]   The family called it barf salad.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.920]   Look at it.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:11:59.920]   It looks like barf salad.
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:00.920]   Look at it.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.920]   It's disgusting.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.920]   Oh, that's ambrosia.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:03.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.920]   That's not good ambrosia.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.880]   Oh, there's good ambrosia.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.360]   That's not it.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.160]   Growing up southern hashtag growing up southern.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.160]   I don't know.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.720]   I think there's plenty of old.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:18.600]   Do you see the bologna cake?
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   No.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:28.480]   If you click on the original tweet, it is ranch cream cheese icing and layer after layer
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:34.960]   of bologna with cheese whiz to decorate the top.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:38.560]   I had family in a small town in Indiana.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.800]   I went there one year for New Year's Eve.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.160]   They don't drink.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:50.560]   So they played Uno all night eating something they called ham salad, which was ground bologna
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.720]   with mayonnaise and pickle relish.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.840]   And then at midnight, we went outside, banged the pots together and went to bed.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.000]   It's really fun.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   All right.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   That's our thanks.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.840]   Ooh, magic tomato soup cake, tomato soup cake.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:16.280]   You know, what's really interesting, and I think there's actually an anthropological
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:21.920]   study here, is a lot of what we just talked about is a way to use something that was really
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:27.480]   an invention of the 20th century, which is highly processed foods like Coca-Cola and
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:34.840]   velveeta and macaroni and cheese, and to use these in dishes where they're combined in
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.840]   weird ways.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.600]   And that's what's so baloney.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.120]   That's a unique to the 20th century, is super highly processed food.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.120]   And I hope-
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.120]   Well, you know why?
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.120]   Why?
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.560]   It's because all of these companies to sell this stuff would put out these cookbooks.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.560]   Right.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.560]   Exactly.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.640]   And they want to sell it because it's so preserved, it has a shelf life of 100 years.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.400]   So do you follow 70s dinner party on Twitter?
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.560]   Oh, god, that sounds awful.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.000]   Oh, no, that sounds awful.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.800]   So it's at 70s party.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.640]   I've had a 70s dinner party.
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.880]   It had pigs in a blank.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.880]   70s numbers.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.880]   Yes, 70s underscore party.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.880]   It's underscore.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.440]   Why you knocked out the underscore?
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.680]   I know I just-
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.400]   Underscores are not pronounced out loud.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.400]   Ooh.
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.400]   Ooh.
[00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.240]   Just the header.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.160]   It's a head of lettuce.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.960]   It's banana.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.960]   What is this?
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   Go ahead.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.960]   The header.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.960]   Click on the header.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.440]   It's bananas with cheese melted on it or something.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.440]   It's-
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.440]   And ham.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.440]   And ham.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.960]   Nothing about- nothing better than banana and ham.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.880]   So yeah, this is always fun to follow.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.880]   God.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.880]   But look at this.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.880]   This is-
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.880]   The American's are all-
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.400]   Honestly, you know, there's some evidence- because we're all debating what went wrong
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.760]   with our diets that were all fat and diabetic.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.880]   And there's some evidence, I think, there's some medical evidence that it's the highly
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:05.040]   processed foods that we've been eating for the last few generations.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:11.440]   Because those foods trick your gut into thinking you've eaten something and then it gets nothing.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:17.480]   It says, well, I need- I don't know what happened, but let's do that again.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.480]   That turkey.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.320]   Oh my God, I missed that the first time around.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.080]   Okay, so it's a melon with a turkey head.
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.600]   Looks like it's made out of a potato with a cute-
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.600]   Dare you do that.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.600]   That's D.C.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.600]   Tomorrow, I dare you.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:41.400]   Marshmallow with olive eyes and then skewers of berries, grapes, bananas, and kiwi.
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.240]   This is- yes, and that's Chrissy Teigen tweeting that.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.000]   So hi, Digity.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.440]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.560]   Her cutting board has her initials on it.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.400]   So I don't know what- you know, Chrissy and John, I guess, CJ.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:02.000]   So, okay, we really-
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.880]   Alright, that was our little Thanksgiving.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.880]   We're really on.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.880]   The rails here.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.200]   People are who complain that we don't do enough Google are just going crazy.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.560]   Well, it started with Google.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.560]   Let's be clear here.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.800]   This is about a Google story.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.200]   Okay, there was a little Google in it.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.840]   There was a soup saw.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.440]   There was a soup saw.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.200]   A dash of Google.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   A pinch of Google.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   A smidge.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   Alright.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   A smidge of Google.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.400]   Actually, as long as we're not Googling, let's do Twitter real quickly.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:34.360]   Twitter decided, I thought, an interesting decision to kill off accounts that hadn't been
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   active in six months.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.840]   Kill maybe the wrong verb, but go ahead.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:43.000]   Well, as it turns out, my friend Drew Olenoff wrote a piece in TechCrunch saying, "You know,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.600]   when you do that, you're going to kill off one of the things you're going to kill off
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.000]   is my dad, my late dad's account, which is going to make me very sad.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   He passed away.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.880]   I don't have access to it.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:00.200]   But you do what Twitter does, which is at least give us some way to memorialize these accounts.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   Oh, Facebook does.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:02.200]   What Facebook?
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   Did I say Twitter?
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   Facebook.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.800]   The memorialize these accounts for people who have passed on.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.400]   Twitter responded almost immediately and said, "Oh, you're right."
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.120]   And so they've never mind.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.560]   They've deferring this.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.840]   I love the idea of releasing.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.360]   Look, if you haven't used your account six months, it's either a bot account or you lost
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.360]   interest.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:23.160]   They're going to release a lot of handles of people that maybe somebody's been waiting
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.160]   for.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.040]   Plus, clean out a lot of stuff.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:31.640]   I bet you of my 550,000 followers, half of them will disappear, which is fine with me.
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.600]   They're not active.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.400]   So I love it that Drew Allenoff said, "Whoa."
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   And Twitter listened.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.400]   So did Jay Jardin.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:45.600]   So there's evidently a whole bunch of accounts of people who died of breast cancer.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.880]   Oh, good point.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.080]   And yeah.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.640]   This is an increasingly issue with social media.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:59.640]   What process by which, how do you get them to release the account so you can maybe archive
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.640]   it or download?
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.480]   Like, we do need, I mean, and we've talked about this, I know with Facebook accounts.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.360]   I would imagine they'd use a similar or maybe not.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.360]   I don't know.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.360]   I don't know.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.600]   I mean, I don't recall exactly how Facebook memorialized.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.240]   We used to call this namespace.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.200]   Yeah, you own your name.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.840]   The name's the problem is if your name is John Smith, you can't really.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.840]   Right.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.840]   Own it.
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.560]   I try to remember what, I'll look it up on Facebook.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.920]   How do I memorialize?
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.720]   Actually, they no longer seem to have an article about that.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.400]   Because you used to have to present like a death certificate, I know to get access to
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.880]   like people's emails accounts and that sort of thing.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.040]   Memorialize the cancer away from people on Facebook to remember and celebrate those who
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.800]   passed away.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:52.820]   Let's see what will happen to my Facebook account if I pass away.
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:57.640]   You can either choose to appoint now a legacy contact to look after your account.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.640]   Everybody should do that.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.640]   A point, you know, a legacy contact.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:06.520]   If you don't have a choose to have your account permanently deleted, it will be memorialized
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.360]   if we become aware of your passing.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.640]   So what happens is they add the word remembering to your name.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.960]   So remembering Leo Laport.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.600]   And then depending on the privacy settings, the account friends can share memories on
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.960]   the memorialized timeline.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.320]   The content you shared before your death will stay on Facebook is still visible to the people
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.520]   with whom it was shared.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:35.360]   You will no longer appear in the people you may know, ads or birthday reminders section.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.560]   That's thank you.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.560]   That's my cob.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.560]   I don't want to see that.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.680]   No one can log into a memorialize account.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.240]   So one of the things Drew proposed is maybe actually Twitter proposed is if you know the
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   the.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.240]   Seast.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.600]   Yeah, if you have the deceased credentials, you could log in and keep it alive.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.320]   But no, this is not what this is.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:00.200]   Memorial accounts, memorialize accounts that don't have a legacy contact can't be changed.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:07.680]   So you want to establish a legacy contact, cat, tact and then express your wishes.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.680]   Otherwise you.
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.920]   It was a tweet ready.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.560]   I think Twitter says you can also.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.560]   A last tweet.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.560]   A last tweet.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.560]   Yes.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.920]   You need the last pin to tweet.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.800]   What was your last tweet be?
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.520]   Oh, oh.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.960]   Let's think about that.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.080]   I think I'm going to make it 100 years.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.280]   I'll be right.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.720]   Oh, Stacy.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:38.080]   No, I was going to say I can't imagine anything more depressing that to be sitting there
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.920]   on my death bed, hopefully surrounded by my family.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.360]   You know, wanting to spend that time thinking about my Twitter.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:48.360]   You could schedule it ahead of time upon my death.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.920]   How about if mine is going to say I told you I was sick.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:52.920]   Yes.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:59.160]   I think I'll just retire from Twitter when I retire.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.600]   I did I as everybody knows by now, I did not kill my Twitter account.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.640]   I didn't it was dormant for a while.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.440]   But I just know everybody yelled at me.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.240]   You can't kill an account with that.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.840]   I mean, not people would kill for that.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.760]   So I thought, well, I'll keep it around and I've been using it.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:23.680]   You know, I still think Twitter is kind of A overrated and B kind of a mixed bag.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.920]   Stacy, you've always defended it.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.560]   You still like it or as it.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.560]   I do.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.560]   Yeah, it hasn't.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.280]   I mean, I follow a very different.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.720]   I have nice followers.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.640]   I follow up people who are interesting.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.240]   I mean, you read your at replies.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.440]   A lot of the time.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.680]   I don't have that many.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.680]   I mean, I try.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.560]   I don't read my at replies.
[00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.560]   I still read them.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.560]   I read it.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.560]   I do.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.560]   I do.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.560]   And there's a few a holes.
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.560]   I avoid.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.560]   More than a few.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.560]   I block people.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.560]   I mute them.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.960]   I don't like to block people, but I will if I have to block them.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.560]   The only reason I won't block you if I hate you is if I don't want to give you the satisfaction.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.040]   Because people know you could just mute them.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.000]   Yeah, that's why I do.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.680]   He does nothing.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.040]   Yeah, no, and there's still and you know what?
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.560]   Honestly, if there's a big news story, I'm going to go to Twitter at first.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.400]   That's where breaking news happens.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.680]   It's also where news is broken.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.480]   Very much so, but you know, it's not it's still you.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.040]   I also go there and ask questions on whether the whole Navy story confused me.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:42.120]   I couldn't tell whether the Navy secretary was fired or quit or well that, but also it
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.360]   seemed as if the Navy secretary, the secretary of the Navy was trying to make a back and deal
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:52.480]   with Trump and mollify him and the department and they and his boss was only trying to mollify
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.480]   him more.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.920]   So I could figure out who was a good guy, bad guy.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.600]   So I tweeted that and Martina never to lova answer and said, yeah, I can't figure it out
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.600]   either.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.040]   Tina never to lova nice name drop there.
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.760]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.760]   That's what's possible.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.320]   Martina never to lova follows me and you're a big tennis fan.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.920]   So that's great.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.280]   How come how does it come?
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.560]   Are you a friends with Martina or no, no, I actually, so I was friends.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.360]   I haven't talked to her in years and years and he was reading me a Brown used to be part
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.000]   of the love is a partner, right?
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.560]   So an author, okay, I knew Martina when I was this, I mean, I knew Rita Mae when I was
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.560]   in San Francisco.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.560]   So I met Martina once.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:31.560]   Okay.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:32.560]   That's all she would ever remember.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.560]   Never.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.560]   Never.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.560]   Maybe she does.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.560]   Maybe she remembers you fondly.
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.560]   Maybe.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.200]   Maybe she's just waiting around.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.560]   Maybe I can get a good seat at the open.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.560]   All right.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.560]   So that's good news.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.560]   I think and I have.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.560]   Here's the other story I need.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.560]   I need advice.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.560]   I need help.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.560]   I need something.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.560]   And you guess what's upsetting me?
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:57.880]   Is it a Chromebook?
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.880]   Well, it's related.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   I have no idea.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.840]   Who will kill in cloud print.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.840]   That's irrelevant.
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.760]   Oh, explain that to me.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.880]   That's not the, that's not me being able to print from my Google device.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.920]   No, you still can print.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.120]   So I print from halfway around the world to my printer at home.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.520]   Well, well, that's what I want to do.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:23.320]   And you say it doesn't matter.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:29.200]   So the idea is you would buy a printer and there were two wireless technologies designed
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.400]   to be used with portable devices.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:37.520]   Apple had air print as far as I know they still do and Google had cloud print.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.960]   You'd go into the printer and you'd give it your credentials in the case of Google,
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.760]   your Google account.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:47.040]   It would register if you go to cloud print online, you'd see all the printers that were
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.120]   registered.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:51.120]   And from a Chromebook or an Android device, actually from any computer, you could print
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.040]   to that printer.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:57.120]   And the way it would work, it would go to the Google cloud and then from the cloud to
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.400]   the printer to the Wi-Fi network to the printer.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.680]   And printers were sold as cloud print ready.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   Right.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   That's right.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.000]   I feel bad for all the printer companies to put all that in.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.520]   I would buy only printers that could do that.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.000]   And then the advantage was I could go ahead and leave.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.720]   So they have native drivers that work on the Wi-Fi network, but you have to be at home.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:24.680]   So that's kind of I think why they've dropped it is that, well, you could still print from
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.360]   an Android or a Chromebook because it just prints natively.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.280]   But the great advantage was I'd be in a hotel, how do we run the world?
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.240]   I'd see something and say, oh, I want to put that in my file at home.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.520]   Or, gee, I mean my wife to design this.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.320]   And I could print it out at home from anywhere.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.320]   It was beautiful.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.600]   I just forward, you could forward the document tour or you could put it in Google key print
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.600]   articles.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.600]   Oh, you try to tell her that.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.600]   Yeah, I do.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:54.240]   Well, I print out things like academic articles for my research.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.640]   And I will forget to do it.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.520]   So this way, if I print it out, it is there in my printer when I get home.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.520]   It was wonderful.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.960]   Why would you kill that Google?
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.960]   Why?
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:05.120]   Well, apparently you were the only one using it.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.720]   Yeah, I think the rest of us just follow different solutions.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   But I see, I see.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.720]   I want to hear Kevin.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.640]   I want to hear Kevin on this topic.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.640]   See, is he watching?
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.840]   So this is Google's help page.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.120]   Why great from cloud print to native printing?
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:26.080]   And it's, as I said, their solution is, well, you can now print natively from promo S and
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.080]   BFD.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.800]   And but yeah, you'd have to be on the network.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:35.840]   They're going to add printing capabilities to cups based printers.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.040]   Cups is the open source printing system.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.040]   What's that?
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.040]   Yeah, what is that?
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.440]   Well, it's on every, you know, everything, including, you know, it's an open source.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.360]   So it's on Linux, but it's also cups on everything else.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.880]   So it's essentially a universal open source driver model.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:51.880]   Oh, I see.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.880]   So you can print.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:59.040]   No, I think one of my printers is using cloud.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.200]   I think my Epson printer has a cloud print like thing.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.920]   My brother printer, I don't believe, does.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.760]   Yeah, Epson has its own cloud.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.320]   So so I bet you can print to the Epson cloud.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.320]   They don't like the Epson.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.720]   I want the brother, right.
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:16.320]   Oh, and HP has, oh, they have their own cloud too.
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:21.480]   Kevin is not watching, but he is willing to share his opinion on Google killing cloud
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.480]   print.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   If you just wait a second.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   There is.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.760]   I think we might have talked about it at some point.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.760]   They say this in their support document.
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:35.680]   They are developing for Chrome OS a policy to configure connections to external cups
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.360]   print servers.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:41.040]   So what that means, you could have a print server at home that you could still print
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.080]   to from them, the internet.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.760]   But that's not as good as cloud print.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.760]   No.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.760]   It was easy.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.160]   I bought there was a little device.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:52.360]   There were a long ago advertiser of yours, a little device in the home to put in.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.360]   Yeah, remember that?
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.360]   I could never get it working.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.360]   Never.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.360]   Really?
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.360]   Oh, I didn't say anything.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.360]   I wish you'd asked me.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.160]   We could have gotten you some help.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.880]   So Kevin does not care.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.960]   They've improved traditional printing from Chromebooks.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:08.960]   So it's barely needed.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.960]   Right.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.160]   Can I explain to your use case?
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.520]   And he's probably going to be like, my guess is he's going to politely tell you that
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.320]   you feel me one.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:22.840]   But it is an interesting question because how hard was it for Google to maintain that?
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.840]   It was not.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.160]   Well, we don't know that.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.960]   Oh, I could have been hard.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.760]   It just sat there.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.760]   Just sat there.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.600]   Autopress is sat there.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.440]   And honestly, that's a bigger question.
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:42.400]   So for that or Google's RSS reader or Google's this or Google's that, how hard is it?
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:48.000]   How expensive is it to maintain things like that?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.160]   Over time though.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.640]   So think about the challenges.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.160]   It could be in a different architecture.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:58.200]   And maybe they've moved on to a different underlying architecture and to support that
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.000]   just bifurcates our team.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.800]   And it's pointless to do it.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.840]   So they're like.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:10.080]   In a larger way to kill it is bad just because it just really expands the notion in the world
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.920]   that Google doesn't stick with anything.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.920]   It's not reliable.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:13.920]   It's not a reliable friend.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.400]   So here they're launching Stadia and essentially the immediate response from everybody, including
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:24.160]   Paul Thorett this morning is, well, let's start the death watch clock.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.800]   You know, how long are they going to stick with this one?
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.760]   And that's the problem when you kill stuff.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.680]   On the other hand, it's Google's model, right?
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:37.680]   Google's model is launch as many new things as possible and then keep the stuff that works.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.760]   Kevin says once Ruth Porat came on board, things that didn't make money get cut.
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:42.760]   She's the CEO of O.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.600]   Yeah, he's right.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.360]   And she's been known axe cutter.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.080]   I kind of don't mind this though.
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:54.920]   So I feel like, I mean, I mind it when it affects services I use, which it does occasionally.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:59.160]   But I'm also kind of like, this might be the new normal when we have everything based as
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.440]   a digital service.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:05.720]   And so it's probably good to get used to it with kind of small, and I know your printer
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:10.720]   thing matters a lot to you, but it's also not like a huge thing you're dependent upon.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.600]   Like maybe a subscription to a car service would be.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:19.760]   So I think it's an interesting way to start testing out this idea and understand how to
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.880]   best pull services.
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.880]   I don't know.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.880]   Maybe I'm being optimistic.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:28.000]   You know, we you are you don't you don't feel my pains, Daisy.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.360]   I don't want to give it in the end.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.360]   particular one.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.960]   We do things I like.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:39.160]   We deal with this here because we have some shows that don't make money or you know, they
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.760]   go from making money to not making money.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.880]   The one that would hurt me the most was the new screensavers, which we launched with
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.600]   the greatest fanfare about four or five years ago.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.600]   Did it for a few years.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.360]   I think we did it for three years.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.240]   Was it expensive show to do?
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.080]   And we weren't able to get audience or advertiser support for it.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.840]   The audience just dwindled and.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.880]   Are you trying to tell us something, Leo?
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:01.040]   Yeah, really.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.880]   I hope we have some ads today, Jeff, or it's.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.720]   It's hurting for us.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.280]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:13.080]   But the decision is tough because, well, I'm not like Google.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.560]   I don't have money lying around.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:20.280]   So I can't afford to, you know, just do a show that loses money because I like to.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:23.920]   But on the other hand, when you kill a show, it really I know it hurts us.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.920]   It hurts.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:25.920]   It hurts us with the audience.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:31.440]   It hurts us with the, you know, the overall package that we offer.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.240]   So I'm very reluctant to kill shows.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:39.320]   It really has to, you know, we're slow to do it because in a little tiny microcosm way,
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.880]   it's like I have the same thing issue Google does.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.880]   It's not good for you.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.840]   So what you can do now is you can keep a community without even without a show.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.600]   You can say, folks, I'll keep the community going.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:52.320]   I could do a little place to gather.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.320]   And we do do that.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:58.520]   And what we hope is that the people who watch this new screen savers will watch other
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.880]   shows and stay apart of our member of our community.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:05.480]   And that, you know, we have the forums and we have the chatroom and many people who look
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.520]   at the magazine dies, you suddenly get people magazine instead of it.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.960]   Yeah, it's better than that.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.680]   I mean, at least Epson has Epson connect.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.680]   Yes.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.120]   And I've used that brother probably has something.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.000]   No, I can't find it.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.960]   So when you set up an Epson printer, you often set up air print cloud print and Epson connect.
[00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.520]   I mean, there's a bunch of cloud things.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.080]   I think I can even scan to Dropbox.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:33.400]   There's a whole bunch of stuff, cloud stuff around that.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.160]   The problem is it's not that easy to set up.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:39.680]   You're on this, you know, these little screens and you're typing with a little keyboard on
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.680]   the screen.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.840]   It's hard to do, but that's why I liked cloud print.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.280]   It seemed like that was the all in one solution.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.160]   It seemed to seem to eliminate in the long run.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.320]   I thought, of course, silly me, I thought wave was a good thing too.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:33:00.680]   I thought that it would the hell we all had a printer drivers of five HP discs that you
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.680]   had to put in.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.680]   Oh, you remember that?
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.120]   Oh, God, it was horrible.
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.520]   This was the solution for that.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.520]   And this was a solution.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.320]   It was just, you know, just it's just printers.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.880]   Wherever you were authorized.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.880]   It's dead.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.880]   Well, dead.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.880]   And it hurts.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.880]   And it hurts.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.880]   It hurts.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.880]   It hurts.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.840]   I think it hurts Google's reputation as well.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.800]   But I do think you're right, Stacey, is the new normal because this is in a way, isn't
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.080]   it what we want?
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:31.840]   I don't know if it's what we actually want, but it's what we're getting.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.800]   Well, we want innovation.
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.640]   We want rapid innovation.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.040]   And a long going, maybe we don't consider the con commitment to rapid innovation as
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.520]   you also have to move fast to break things.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.640]   You have to kill stuff fast too.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:49.080]   And I think, yeah, I think companies also underestimate the burden they're taking on
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.000]   when they launch a service.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   So, yeah.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:02.040]   So there's Brother Web Connect, but that appears to be scanning documents directly into drive
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.000]   and box and Dropbox and stuff.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.040]   It really does look like they're heavily reliant on cloud print.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:13.440]   So that's because that's who should be pissed off because all of these inter-couping
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.440]   are spent.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.440]   They just lost some value.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.680]   And they spent considerable time and money to create their cloud print interconnect.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.080]   You know, they wrote in effect drivers for Google.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:29.040]   Well, maybe somebody in the reporting world should call them up and ask them what to do
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.040]   now.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.240]   And then they'll tell you what they're doing.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.520]   I don't see an HP version.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.520]   Is there an HP version?
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.240]   HP had a print cloud at some point.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.240]   I remember covering it like 10 or 15 years ago.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:44.320]   In fact, HP was one of the very first to do Wi-Fi printing.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.520]   So I would bet they have some solution.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.520]   Oh.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.520]   Mashed potato.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.520]   Mashed potato.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.520]   Maybe they killed it.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.120]   Potato in the chat room says, "Google's a..."
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.120]   And I think I agree with this.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:57.000]   Google's approach has to be better than Microsoft's.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.560]   Microsoft never kills anything.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.920]   And as a result, they have this huge legacy.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.480]   You know, these chains they forged in life, they dragged behind them.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:11.800]   I'm not sure why we're seeing a video in the place of Stacey there.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.440]   Thank you, John.
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.920]   Carson has the day off and John is doing a yeoman's effort.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.920]   What does that button do?
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.920]   Fill his sleeve.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.920]   Oh.
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:25.000]   Wait till we get to the change log, it's going to be a riot.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.960]   So let's talk about...
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:29.960]   We haven't...
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.960]   Have we talked about...
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.520]   Maybe when I was going, you talked about this.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:36.200]   The various solutions to political advertising being proposed.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.280]   Twitter says, "We're just not going to do political ads."
[00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.480]   Facebook says, "Anything goes."
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:42.720]   Oh, they're reconsidering.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.920]   Yeah, they are.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.400]   Google did something kind of in the middle.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:57.000]   They said, "Political ads can't be bought on too fine, a too granular demographic."
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.480]   So you can't direct specifically to audiences based on their public voter records or their
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.480]   political affiliations.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.960]   Only basically those upcodes.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.960]   You can't use age...
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.480]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.480]   You can't...
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.720]   Political advertising will be able to name their messages based on age, gender, or location,
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.000]   but that's it.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.120]   So I have an opinion of probably hate.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.600]   You want that or you want to go first?
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.640]   I'll hate it no matter what.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:24.000]   Go ahead.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.560]   I think that...
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:30.280]   I'm going to write a post to this effect in defense of targeting.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.480]   Targeting is now the next thing that's being considered evil and awful and micro-targeting,
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.680]   particularly.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.680]   And can it be misused?
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.120]   Yes, it can be misused.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.560]   But I think targeting is important for a whole bunch of reasons.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:47.920]   If you want to start a campaign or movement and reach just the people who were involved,
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.720]   you want to do that efficiently and inexpensively.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.080]   You don't have the mechanism to do it.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.280]   Without this, we return to mass media and where we see where mass media got us.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:37:00.000]   I think it's vital to the future of media itself to be able to treat people not as a
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.720]   mass and to be able to provide that to advertisers.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.760]   We've been bad at that.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:11.680]   And I think finally, the, dare I say, moral panic around micro-targeting doesn't give
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:14.680]   people respect and agency.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:18.800]   This is if someone was perfectly normal, walking one day walking down the street and they saw
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:24.360]   a micro-targeted ad and they were corrupted and their brain blew up.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.160]   It just doesn't respect people enough to think that they can't handle things to which
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.640]   they're exposed.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:38.000]   So I think that basically where we're headed is giving targeting kudos.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.320]   And that bothers me, especially strategically for media, but it bothers me in terms of
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   the message it gives.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.320]   That's my controversial opinion.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.720]   I'm sure you'll both hate it.
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:47.720]   Stacy?
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.840]   I don't hate it.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:54.440]   I do think that targeting has actual value.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:00.160]   And I, but I would disagree with the idea that people are unaware or unable to make
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:07.680]   their own decisions because I do see in my parents, for example, who watch only Fox News,
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.040]   they have a very different view of the world.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.040]   And through successful targeting, you can give people a filter bubble that they don't
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.320]   even realize as a filter bubble.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:21.720]   And I do think that actually does have a pretty big impact on democracy, news consumption,
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.720]   etc.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.560]   But it's Fox News is Fox News, but that's different.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.200]   I think Fox News is a constant exposure to one thing.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.880]   Doesn't it go both doesn't it go both ways?
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:37.480]   Because let's say I am a Democratic candidate and I think that your parents would be interested
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:42.000]   when I have to say I can no longer target them as Republicans.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.160]   I can only.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:49.960]   So in a way, there's the, that what you're cutting off is also the ability for Republicans
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.920]   to reach out to Democrats and Democrats to reach out Republicans and show them other
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.120]   views that they don't maybe don't see.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.120]   Good point.
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.120]   Maybe you don't have yours.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.120]   What I think.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.120]   You want to know what I think?
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.120]   What if we said no?
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.120]   Yes, I do.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:04.960]   I would turn you off.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.320]   No, because you have the power.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.800]   I think I kind of agree with you, Jeff, that you need targeting.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:17.760]   I think the issue is dark ads that there are, as this is a real problem on Facebook, where
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:23.680]   there are a lot of political ads heavily targeted on things like emotion and weird things, but
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.000]   then they're also dark.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.480]   Only those people see them and no one else sees them.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:32.720]   I think it's all solved if you make the same ground rules for digital advertising, digital
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:36.000]   political advertising that you have in broadcast.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.480]   That is, this is the Honest Ads Act.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.840]   That is, to me, the base level.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.920]   Every ad, you have to say, "Who paid for it?"
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.520]   I know I think maybe a good idea about the targeting data, too.
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:49.520]   Who targeted it?
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:50.520]   Yes.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.520]   Who you're targeting.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.520]   What was the targeting data?
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:57.600]   Facebook has the most extensive political ad database there is.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.160]   If you want to get broadcast ads, you've got to go through all kinds of Michigan ads.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.920]   So this way, you've got Facebook.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.160]   But it only goes so far.
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:09.440]   It shows you in geography and age and gender who saw the ad, but not what the targeting
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.440]   request was.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   That's interesting.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.440]   The targeting request should be public.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.440]   Yes.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.200]   Google is doing that with—whoa, I'm all Barbara Walters.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:23.680]   Google is doing that with the model cards that they make available for people on their
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.680]   algorithms.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:30.840]   It would be interesting to see a version of model cards for targeting information.
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:31.840]   You can see it.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.200]   Do we apply a model card?
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.920]   It talks about the data that they use, the decisions that they made in building the
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:42.560]   algorithm so you can understand if there is bias where that bias came from or just understand
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.640]   how the algorithm got to this point.
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.200]   So, it's basically—
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.480]   Is that a—or, say, say, say, hold on.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.480]   This is fascinating.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.840]   Stay on this for a second.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:59.680]   Is that a generic programming thing or is it a Google thing?
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.840]   It's something—like, I was just reading about the New York Data Commission.
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.880]   I don't know if you saw the article from the Fast Company and Fast Company about this.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:13.280]   The concept of model cards or some sort of model explainer is a universal thing.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:17.240]   They may not be called—I don't know if Google calls the model cards and no one else
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:18.240]   calls the model.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.240]   Yes, they do.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.240]   Model cards.withgoogle.com/about.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.240]   Okay.
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:26.240]   So, I don't know if—what else you would call it.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.880]   I've used it—I've heard it used generically too.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.880]   But I don't—
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:35.960]   It becomes a standard for some level of transparency into the intent of alcos.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:40.280]   The other thing that happens is there's correlate—you buy on correlation.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:42.480]   Not so much political, but you combine a correlation.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:47.120]   I'm a Democratic candidate and I want to buy Subaru drivers.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.680]   And I do know why because they're all liberals, but let's imagine I don't know that.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.600]   Just for some reason, Subaru people.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:58.720]   For some reason, people who drink lattes, you know, vote Democratic or whatever.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:02.400]   There may be a correlation that makes no sense, but you found through your data that
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.240]   works, which isn't really an explanation why.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.960]   It just says this works.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.520]   Why am I seeing—so the question would be like—it would answer the question, "Why
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.520]   am I seeing this ad?"
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:17.280]   And you could say, "I bought this targeting people in this age range who have Subarus."
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.280]   The question is, is that enough information or would you want to say the next layer, which
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:29.560]   is I'm actively trying to reach Democrats who have 100k and like annual income?
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.280]   And that's a little interesting because what you're talking about is correlations.
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.300]   You may not have that goal.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.300]   You may not have that goal.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.300]   You may not have that goal.
[00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.300]   You may not have that goal.
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.300]   You may not have that goal.
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:40.300]   That's a good goal.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.300]   Right.
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.120]   Is it possible that one of the benefits to Google of doing this is besides the fact that makes
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:48.760]   them look like they're trying to solve the problem, is they make more money because more
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:52.440]   money was spent as it is now on broadcast and kind of blanketing?
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.540]   Because one of the things about micro-targeting, it's highly efficient.
[00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:03.780]   Well, at some point then, I could argue you might as well buy a cable TV buy.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:08.320]   If all you can do, then you broadcast on something that has a female audience in this
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.880]   area, I might get a better deal in Google now.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.960]   So no, I think it actually hurts Google potentially.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:20.500]   I mean, let's remember, political advertising is a tiny, tiny fraction of both the behemoths.
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:24.360]   You know, ironically, it's a huge deal for TV and radio or it has been.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:32.440]   Oh, yes, because it's like a windfall during campaign season, billion, literally billions
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.440]   of dollars you spent.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:38.120]   And this drives, I think what this does is it drives war ad dollars back to TV, which
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.120]   is exactly what it's called.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.440]   Because the secret sauce for Google and Facebook is micro-targeting.
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.280]   Yes.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:48.800]   So I think it was a political thing to do, small people political.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.840]   It was, you know, it was usually, oh, yeah.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.840]   Okay, we did something.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.240]   Yes, we care.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.600]   The money is meaningless so fine.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:59.640]   But I think that, be careful what you ask for.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:05.360]   The GOP and the Trump campaign both have said this is going to favor Democrats.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.360]   I'm not sure.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.360]   Of course, that's what they said.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.440]   I'm not sure I follow the logic, but that's that somehow.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.120]   Because they're always the victim.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:18.000]   Well, I think, I think that the problem is they're not very self-aware because because
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.080]   the complaint that the right makes about content moderation is you're taking down our stuff.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.240]   Well, yeah, we're being told to take down a hate speech.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.840]   Are you aware here of that connection?
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:28.840]   You know?
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:34.440]   And the same thing here that I think there's some sort of lack of self-awareness.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.880]   But yeah, I think it actually could hurt the right more.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:37.880]   I think they do more.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:42.040]   They want, you know, going back to Nixon, they've targeted direct mail better than the Democrats
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.040]   do.
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.120]   They've always done targeting well.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.960]   I get so much mail from Donald Trump.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.920]   Almost every day I get something from Donald Trump.
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.160]   Mail mail or email?
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.160]   Snail mail.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.160]   Really?
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.160]   Almost every day.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.160]   Is Petaluma Republican?
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   I don't know.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.160]   I don't think so.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:07.560]   I mean, most of Northern California is pretty blue.
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.560]   There are pockets.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.160]   Are you in a pocket?
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:11.160]   I mean...
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.480]   It could be because Lisa was a registered Republican for a while.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.480]   She's not an illegal person.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.480]   Oh, that's why.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:19.120]   No, but I feel like it's not well targeted.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.720]   Let's put it that way.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.720]   Right.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.720]   Because it doesn't obviously...
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.960]   I get tons of email, but I don't know if that's some troll who'd put me on lists.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.720]   I get Trumpy Bill Galore.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:39.880]   I got a cell number from a company that I hadn't probably washed it thoroughly.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.200]   So it belonged to some guy named Bud.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:49.640]   I get a lot of text messages, daily text messages for Bud.
[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.920]   And actually, it's a good nickname for you.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:52.920]   You're kind of a Bud.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:56.120]   Well, it's funny because it's like, "Hey, Bud.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.040]   We haven't received your payment for your medical treatment of last..."
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.320]   I mean, this guy is a deadbeat.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.800]   I think Bud skipped.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.480]   Because he skipped out on his loans.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.080]   He skipped out on everything.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.800]   So I'm getting a lot of that.
[00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:14.400]   But then I'm also getting a lot of text messages from a particular campaign.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:20.200]   And this campaign, you got to think almost every one of the messages is, "Right now,
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.920]   we can triple your donation."
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.400]   It's a lot of that.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:30.120]   If you give us today $10, it reminds me a little bit of what televangelists kind of
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.120]   message.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.120]   Like, act.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.360]   You've got to act right now and send us $10 because we could triple it.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:41.920]   There's all these psychological incentives to get you to donate right now, this poor
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:43.240]   guy, Bud.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:49.480]   Not only do he owe money to his physician, to his student loans, but then he's being
[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:53.320]   like, "Hit every five minutes for donations to political causes."
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.320]   It is fascinating.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:58.320]   So our neighbor died six months ago.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:03.640]   And his wife, no one else was, "We already picked up the mail and passed the mail on."
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.880]   He was devout Catholic.
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.840]   And the mail that they get is amazing to me.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.760]   It's a whole other world, right?
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.120]   An entirely different world.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.760]   That's micro-targeted by Zipco.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.760]   Very much is.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.760]   Well done a personal case.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:22.520]   Well, Andrew used to be in Texas because he had voted in the Republican primaries back
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:27.200]   in like 2000, maybe 1996 or 2000.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:33.600]   No, I mean, before the Republican party went too crazy is what I would say.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.560]   Although in Texas, it's always really crazy.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:40.160]   But the, his mail and my mail, radically different.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.520]   And his mail is offensive or it was.
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:44.520]   Now it's normal.
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:47.120]   I mean, just like, you're like, "Oh my God."
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.600]   So that's the real reason you move.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:50.040]   You just wanted to get away from his mail.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:52.040]   Get away from those postcards.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.040]   Good Lord.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:55.440]   It is interesting.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:01.800]   So this is why people are worried about micro-targeting is that you don't see what other people
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.800]   are seeing.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:07.520]   When I saw a little window into Bud's life, it was very different from the stuff I was
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.520]   getting.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.520]   But it was already, already happening.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.520]   It was happening on your phone.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:15.440]   Yeah, but I'm just pointing out that was highly, all highly targeted, I'm sure.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.640]   And so I got to see a little bit, but normally we don't.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.800]   It's all dark, right?
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.800]   Sorry.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.560]   How do you wash your phone when you buy or when you get a new number?
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.840]   They shouldn't reuse those numbers too quickly.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.840]   That's the real.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.840]   Oh, okay.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:30.720]   I was like, I was like, "Is there something I should be doing because my daughter's phone
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:35.720]   number is definitely, definitely a problem?"
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.720 --> 00:48:40.240]   You should definitely put it on the do not call registry.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.960]   You can do that.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.120]   That's, you know, we have to see.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.520]   She's 13 and they don't call anyone.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.920]   So we just, there's no, there's no.
[00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:52.520]   If there's not mom, don't answer it.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:53.520]   I get a lot.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.760]   Basically, no one calls her.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.160]   So she just leaves it off all the time.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.160]   Good.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:00.160]   So the robocalls don't get through.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.920]   The death of the meaning of the area code.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:04.940]   Oh, yeah, that's gone.
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:06.560]   I don't know why that fascinates.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.560]   That's gone.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.460]   My phone is in the 3O code.
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:13.400]   If it was a little annoying a while, because I, you know, I have a Google voice number and
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.820]   I got the 302 area code so I can get a vanity number.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.340]   And which 302 is Baltimore.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:24.600]   And nowadays it's not a problem, but like only a few years ago, if I called Comcast, they'd
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.840]   transfer me to the Baltimore Comm.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.840]   Right.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:28.840]   Right.
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:31.240]   No, I don't want the Baltimore Comm.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.240]   Yes.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:35.360]   But I think they've learned, you know, I guess that's not going to work anymore.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.480]   And that's all because of the mobility of people.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:44.800]   And you know, a lot of people have area codes from their, a former region or whatever.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:50.280]   So we were going to redesign it today and you needed to group people.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.160]   How else could you have done it?
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.360]   Well, zip is still good.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.360]   Yes.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:00.000]   But that means you have to send snail mail, which no one wants to do.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.960]   At least when you're in Europe, you can tell a mobile call from a landline call.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.080]   I think IP address still is good.
[00:50:06.080 --> 00:50:10.680]   And I think that's probably the single most common way we locate, get geo located is I
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.840]   can guess.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.680]   It's not a perfect solution.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:18.200]   Of course, who could forget, Cashmere Hills, great article about the people who live in
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:24.880]   the geographic center of the United States who get a lot of hate visitors because it,
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:32.560]   their location, their longitude and latitude is the default for IP address location if
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.160]   they can't figure out where you are.
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.160]   Right.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:38.320]   They say, well, they're in the US and they put a dot in the middle of it, which is unfortunately
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.120]   this farmhouse.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.200]   And if you could find the Cashmere Hills story, it's hysterical.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:48.160]   I mean, people just, they come up banging their door saying, you have my iPhone.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:56.440]   Somebody left an old toilet in their driveway, obviously some sort of statement about that.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.800]   So geo location is in a perfect science.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:04.360]   But I think IP address geo location is probably the most common technique.
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:10.920]   That's why a lot of us try to hide our IP addresses with VPNs and other solutions.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:15.120]   Then you can appear to come from somewhere else.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.960]   Let's take a little break.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:22.240]   I think this will be a good time and we'll get back to, I think we've got a change log.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.640]   We've got some more Google stuff.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:24.640]   We got some good stuff.
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   We got some good stuff.
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.600]   I'll let you guys pick the next story.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.800]   So Stacy gets one and Jeff gets one.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   Okay.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.760]   So figure out what when you said we have good stuff, you put yourself on the line.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.760]   Yeah, I know.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.160]   Now you better find it.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.480]   Our show today, we got brand new sponsor.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.120]   I'm really excited about these guys.
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:42.120]   Yay.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.120]   Health IQ.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.120]   I love you.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.120]   Health IQ.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:51.200]   You're looking for life insurance is actually an interesting conundrum for people.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:55.680]   And I think this is a lot of our audience who are healthy, who are smart and they're
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.000]   smart enough to know what to eat.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   They work out.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.440]   They take care of themselves.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:04.320]   When you go out to get life insurance, in most cases, you're going out and you're just
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:05.560]   a number.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.680]   And those numbers are often misinterpreted.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:12.960]   For instance, if you lift, you know, answer good example of this, he lifts, he's very beefy,
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:13.960]   right?
[00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:19.000]   Because his body mass index looks like he is obese because his for his height, he weighs
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.320]   a lot.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:24.300]   And if you're going to on your own to get life insurance or with a kind of a standard
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:28.200]   life insurance plan, they'll look at you and say, oh, your BMI is too high.
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:31.160]   But in fact, aunt would be a great risk.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.760]   Health IQ solves this problem.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.520]   There are life insurance agency that helps you.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:42.120]   They kind of negotiate with you with some of the best insurers in the country using science
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:45.800]   and data to get lower life insurance rates for people like you.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:48.160]   You get a minimum of eight hours sleep on average.
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:50.320]   You exercise four or more times a week.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.320]   You eat right.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.360]   You know how to take care of yourself.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.160]   You need health IQ.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.400]   This is the only way for you to get the life insurance you deserve.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:05.400]   You can get a million dollars of life insurance for as little as $36 a month.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:10.040]   The problem is those of us who are health conscious have overpaid and subsidized those
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:11.920]   of us who are not.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.800]   It's just how it works.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.600]   You might be healthy, but your insurance company doesn't necessarily know that.
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:22.920]   If you're a runner, a cyclist, if you're into CrossFit, maybe you're a vegan or a vegetarian,
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:27.960]   somebody like Stacey who really eats right, you deserve to be rewarded with better life
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.440]   insurance rates because statistically you're a better risk.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.680]   But does the insurance company know?
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:35.680]   That's why you need health IQ.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:38.640]   Basically it's a concierge service for life insurance.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.680]   Take love service, they walk you through the entire process of applying.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:46.880]   They are working with the top 30 insurance companies in the US.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:51.480]   You're going to be with a big well-known company, but they have savings.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.160]   You can't get anywhere else.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.000]   Now you've got to qualify at a special rate.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.520]   This is a little different the way this works.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:02.800]   What you're going to do is go to healthIQ.com/twig and they have a health IQ quiz.
[00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:05.840]   It's unique to health IQ.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:11.520]   You'll take the quiz and you give them your phone number and your new agent will call you.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.720]   Now it's a very nice call.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.880]   They're not pushing you into anything.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.680]   They're there to find out, to ask you questions, to verify.
[00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:22.080]   In fact, one of the things they say is, would you be willing to give us your Fitbit data
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:29.320]   or your Apple Watch data or some other qualifying data to show that you do exercise, for instance?
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.280]   It's really, really interesting.
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:36.000]   HealthIQ has assembled a team of the nations leading medical health and fitness experts
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.320]   to create a cutting edge analysis.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.840]   It's a knowledge assessment, not a self-assessment.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:45.600]   And depending on your score as well as other related qualifying factors, you can save,
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:49.840]   and this is the important part, up to 41% on your life insurance premiums compared to
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.000]   other providers.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.480]   There's no commitment.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:56.440]   You'll learn even more about potential opportunities to be rewarded for your commitment for living
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.440]   healthy.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.120]   This is what you want to know.
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.120]   HealthIQ.
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:05.760]   HealthIQ.com/TWIG, answer the questions.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.320]   I should tell you, you're going to give them your phone number and they're going to talk
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.320]   to you.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.320]   I did it.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.320]   It's great.
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:12.320]   Nice people.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.120]   Really great US-based counselors.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.880]   They're really your agent.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:20.080]   HealthIQ.com/TWIG, and they'll walk you through the whole process.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.800]   If you're ready to get some life insurance, and if you've got a family, if you've got
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:29.000]   people dependent on you, you need it, benefit from the work you're already doing to take
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.240]   care of yourself.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.240]   HealthIQ.com/TWIG.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:40.480]   This is a perfect advertiser for us because it's the kind of advertiser only we can explain.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.880]   Only we can really take the time to explain the benefits of this.
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:49.240]   A 30 second ad on TV, it's not going to be clear, but I want you to really understand
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:51.080]   what you're getting here and it's really worth it.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.560]   HealthIQ.com/TWIG.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:56.320]   All right.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:57.320]   Stacey.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.320]   Okay.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.680]   What did you pick?
[00:55:59.680 --> 00:56:04.560]   My choice was Alphabet's dream of an everyday robot is just out of reach.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:06.320]   Oh, no.
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:11.480]   They have trash sorting machines.
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:15.440]   This is the story that the Engadget story is based off of.
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.000]   Sorry.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.040]   My choice is Google's robots efforts or Alphabet's robots efforts.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:27.320]   This is Hans Peter Bronmo profile and Wired.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:29.880]   I know Hans actually quite well.
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.080]   He's general manager of the X Robotics Project.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.200]   We're going to try to get him on triangulation.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:35.640]   He's been on triangulation before.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:39.000]   He used to be at Nokia and I interviewed him when he was back at Nokia.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.320]   I did not know that he is now at the X Project doing robots.
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:45.320]   He's a great guy.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.240]   I really like Hans.
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.240]   Tell me about this.
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.240]   What is their plan?
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.240]   Okay.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.920]   So what is the everyday robot project?
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:59.040]   This is Alphabet's effort to take all the disjointed robot bits and bobs that they had,
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:03.640]   put it together and create something that can help create a robot that can help interact
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.720]   with people in everyday lives.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:08.080]   So the vision is caregiving.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:12.720]   This particular robot that they focus on here is a trash sorting robot.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:20.200]   So it is right 3.4 percent or sorry, 96.6 percent of the time.
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.840]   Sorry, I was like, you are trash.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.680]   I am throwing you out.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.320]   It is only wrong 3.4 percent of the time.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:28.320]   Much better.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.320]   Okay.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:31.320]   How's that?
[00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:36.520]   And the thing I thought was so that's what this is about and it's got all these kind
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:40.040]   of funny details.
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:42.440]   Bottom line, these are not ready.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:48.640]   And this highlights to me because it talks, the subtext here is it's really hard to build
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:53.400]   a good robot, both from a mechanical perspective, right?
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:55.880]   Just getting the robot to have all the pieces you need.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.400]   It's very expensive.
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:04.160]   They fall apart and they're not adept necessarily at having the type of grip we have, for example.
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.400]   It's hard.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:10.080]   What we do, we take it for granted, what we do, it's hard.
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:17.240]   I mean, you want to get somebody to talk to someone who works with robots about like 5-point
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:22.680]   grip or whatever, how we grip things versus how a robot and like degrees of motion, they
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:26.760]   will just cry at the limitations they have, right?
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:28.320]   That we don't have.
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:34.520]   And so physically tough to build a robot that works anywhere close to like we do.
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:38.440]   It's hard because we don't have like any sort of universal programming language to make
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.960]   the actual motors work.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:43.200]   So that's another layer of problem.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:48.400]   And then finally, we're trying to build robots that have learning capabilities.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:55.680]   So this is a trash sorting bot that is using a neural network, it's reinforcement network,
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:59:00.240]   that basically has it teach itself how to sort trash properly.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:06.680]   But when I look at and read this story, I'm like, they spent so much effort on this one
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:07.680]   robot.
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:08.680]   Does it work?
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.240]   No, it's pretty good.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:12.240]   It's good.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:15.400]   But it's not ready for like mass deployment.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:20.120]   And if it were, I don't think people could afford it, especially given that recycling
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:25.320]   stuff right now is a really bad, not awesome thing because nobody's taking it.
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:28.360]   China won't take our trash anymore.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:33.120]   So I'm kind of like, yeah, so I'm just looking at this and I'm like, we all love robots.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:36.880]   And we all feel like we're almost there with robots that can take care of our elderly and
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:38.480]   do all these things.
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:44.080]   But this article really points out that each robot is like one custom snowflake developed
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:46.320]   in a lab and depression circumstances.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:48.200]   And we're not there yet.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:52.040]   I like to say calm down everyone.
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.280]   They're not taking over.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:58.760]   They're barely able to not take you know, really able to rush.
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:04.320]   I wonder though, aren't military robots pretty good?
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.320]   Oh my gosh.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.960]   Did you see the story about Boston Dynamics, which is no longer part of Alphabet.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:12.440]   So it doesn't technically belong in the show, but there's a police department.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.040]   I got ever bothers us.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.400]   No, that doesn't stop us.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.400]   Is it Massachusetts?
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:23.160]   I think police department using big dog, the terrifying one.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.160]   Hold on.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:31.800]   See, this is this is this is what is so interesting about technology is simultaneously much harder,
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:38.800]   much harder to do than you know, we we think it is that our science fiction tells us.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.240]   And it's also here before you know it.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.920]   So yes, it is Massachusetts State Police.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:46.920]   Oh boy.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:53.680]   The state has the stateies had spot on loan from August to November, according to records
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.080]   obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union and reviewed by WBU are.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.080]   Yep.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:04.680]   They don't really talk a lot about it, but somewhere in there.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:06.680]   Oh, people.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680]   I know.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.480]   I'm not going to be calm about this.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.480]   Sorry.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.080]   No, because think about think about everything that people are protesting with Black Lives
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.080]   Matter.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.840]   Now imagine that robot controlled remotely by someone or not just given sort of biased
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.360]   AI coming after you.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.480]   Jeff, that's terrifying.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:29.000]   They never weaponized any of the robots.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   They did not.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   But according to B.U.R. while spot and other tactical robots aren't designed to kill, they
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.880]   still can.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:43.680]   In 2016, Dallas police sent a bomb disposal robot armed with explosives to kill a sniper
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:45.760]   which shot a police officer's and killed five.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:51.400]   It was the first time three years ago, a non military robot had been used to intentionally
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.120]   kill someone.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.800]   Remember when that happened?
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:02.680]   Yeah, so that was kind of a water shed moment in robotics.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.720]   That's my problem is yeah, they can't sort trash all that well.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:11.600]   Maybe they can, but there's other things they can do that might be a little even worse.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.600]   They can open doors and climb stairs.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:22.480]   You know, this is the whole technology story in a nutshell.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:30.520]   Jeff is both every time we try to do voice handwriting, face recognition, it turns out
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:35.880]   it first seems very easy and it turns out the first 90% is easy.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:39.840]   The last 10% is very, very hard.
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:45.360]   And we're, I mean, a two year old can recognize his mother better than any computer can.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.360]   So that's, but we're getting better at it.
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.840]   And the problem is you don't have to be that last 10% if all he wanted to do is blow people
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.200]   up.
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:57.440]   We can do that really well now already.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:05.240]   So, so this is yeah, Boston Dynamics and Spot terrifying.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:13.640]   Right now, this is Michael Perry from Boston Dynamics talking about this use in the Massachusetts
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.640]   State Police.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.000]   Our primary interest is sending the robot into situations where you want to collect information.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.800]   Obviously with a camera in an environment where it's too dangerous to send a person,
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.240]   but it's not actually physically interacting with the space.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:27.400]   That's that thing that's hard to do.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.800]   Right.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:33.040]   I don't know what the status is.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:37.960]   I mean, big dog is way or spot is it spot or big dog?
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.520]   A spot, I guess.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.240]   I guess stores spot.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:46.400]   It is like, I mean, if you compare it to like the bomb disposal robots that just like
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.800]   roll in on their treads, this is way more agile.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.520]   You can be like, there's a bomb in here and you can stay way back.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.520]   It can open doors.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:54.520]   It can walk through them.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:55.680]   It can go upstairs.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.680]   It can.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:04.360]   And Conan, the dog wouldn't get hurt in the tunnel and getting rid of terrorist leaders.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:06.320]   The test.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.360]   By the way, do we ever finally decided as Conan?
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.360]   He or she?
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.360]   I don't know.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.360]   No one knows.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.360]   Why do we care so much?
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.920]   Oh my gosh, you people, this is just a distraction.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.720]   It's an interest.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:22.040]   I think it's somewhat telling distraction, but that's a story for another show.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:26.040]   So spot was on loan to the state east through the end of November.
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:33.200]   So spots, but the state police never really said how they were using it.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:40.440]   And I do think if you're going to deploy, I guess if you would, I don't know, like if
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.560]   you're just applying it for information, do you have to?
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.280]   If you weaponize these things, then yes, you probably should tell the public and we should
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:53.680]   be able to see like how they work and are you going to mistake me because I happen to
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.440]   be a black person, then you know, that's a problem.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:02.120]   It's like the federal government selling surplus tanks to local police.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.120]   Not a great idea.
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:08.920]   B. You are quotes Thor L's executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.480]   of former SWAT commander from Colorado.
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:17.960]   In most cases, robots are used in critical incidences, incidents like barricaded suspects,
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:23.080]   hostage situations, activists, salons, not routine surveillance.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.960]   They if he says he recognizes the need for more information about how these robots are
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:31.960]   used and the concern how they might infringe on people's privacy or civil liberties, but
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:37.120]   he contended police have to reach the same legal bar for say, sending a robot into someone's
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.920]   house that they would for going in themselves.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:42.120]   They would still need a warrant.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:46.520]   So you still need to you still protected by the Constitution against the robot.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.920]   I guess.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.560]   I don't know.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:54.600]   I just it's interesting.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.080]   It's an intro.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.080]   You're right.
[01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:00.360]   I don't want to do the techno panic thing where we go, Oh my God, it's a robotic dog.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.880]   That's scary, scary, scary.
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.840]   The state police has a permanent fleet of robots, by the way, not besides spot, which
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:12.880]   is a loner, 18 robotic platforms worth $1.8 million.
[01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:16.880]   They're used almost every week.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.080]   Most of them are on little tracks.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:20.720]   They're like bomb disposal, disposal robots.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:28.120]   And I mean, I yeah, more flexibility is probably good, I guess, in this situation.
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:31.920]   Incidentally, you'll be glad to know all about the use.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:37.120]   Peter, the animal rights organization, people for the ethical treatment of animals has put
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:44.560]   out a statement saying it is not cruel to kick spot because spot is not a real dog.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:46.640]   Thank you, Peter.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:52.480]   I mean, that's important.
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480]   We should know.
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.320]   Peter deals with actual animal abuse every day.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:01.480]   So we're not going to lose sleep over the robot dog kicking incident.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:05.160]   But while it's far better to kick a four-legged robot than a real dog, most reasonable people
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:09.040]   find even the idea of such violence inappropriate as the comments show.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.480]   However, better, the people for the ethical treatment of robots.
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.640]   Oh, they're often.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.640]   They're outraged.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.600]   How long before there is a better?
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.240]   There might already be one robots for the ethical treatment of robots.
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:30.520]   Lisa pointed out to me yesterday that I shout at Amazon Echo all the time and I said,
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:34.240]   yeah, because it's a stupid machine.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.440]   I don't know which is worth anthropomorphizing it to the point where you tell your kids now
[01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.580]   be polite to the A word.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.800]   You've got to be nice to her.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:48.680]   Or is that worse than me going, I hate you shut up.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:51.360]   Both cases were treating it like a human.
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:55.900]   I have been known to be screaming, damn you in the car, not just when they killed Cloud
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.900]   print.
[01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:02.840]   Leo, yeah, I always say please and thank you to my voice assistants because when the robots
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.200]   take over, they're going to kill me.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.200]   They're going to think about that.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.200]   Yes, they're going to kill me.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.360]   Who is nicest to us?
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:12.360]   I wish just does Leo say please and thank you to you.
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.080]   I'm very polite to John.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.080]   Okay, good.
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:18.840]   He treats me like a clone.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:19.840]   I am reflexively.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:20.840]   Everybody.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.640]   So that includes any.
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.840]   I mean, if you're a voice assistant in my house, although my brother, he's here visiting
[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:34.920]   and he made, I was talking about trying not to anthropomorphize Madam A and he's like,
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:41.240]   oh, yeah, if that were, if she were a person, she'd be the person who was like a kid who
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.840]   was kicked into lockers as a child.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.440]   I was like, yeah, did you see?
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:49.280]   Oh, Amazon is releasing.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:56.840]   Is it allowing developers to make Madam A sound happy, excited, or disappointed and
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:57.840]   sad?
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:01.920]   Oh, so there'll be little commands you can give the voice.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.680]   In your as part of your app.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.360]   Um, I don't think that's creepy.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:12.440]   I think that's necessary.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.600]   I think it could come in handy for some things, I guess.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   I don't know.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.800]   Maybe you have a Lexa.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:22.320]   Oh, shoot.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.840]   I need to tell the CBC not to say things like that out loud.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.280]   I'm trying to, I think there's a demo on here.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.280]   Maybe not.
[01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:31.280]   I wasted an hour.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:36.560]   I wanted, I wanted to get a little video of getting my Google device when I said, okay,
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:39.560]   G, I wanted it to say back to me.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:40.800]   Okay, boomer.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.280]   I couldn't figure out how to make it happen.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.840]   It works.
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:45.840]   Just do it.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:50.640]   In fact, somebody complained because on Sunday we said it a lot and he said the whole
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:56.080]   time I'm listening to Twitter, my Google assistant's waking up.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.440]   I think it works.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.440]   Okay, boomer.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.840]   I wanted it to say, okay, boomer to me.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:01.840]   Oh, to you.
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:02.840]   That's different.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:03.840]   I don't mean that.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.040]   Do you want to hear some, uh, echo emotions?
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.040]   Yes.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:09.040]   Sure.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.040]   Here's excited.
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.040]   High intensity.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:14.800]   I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:15.800]   Oh my God.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:16.800]   Oh, stop.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.800]   Oh, stop.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:18.800]   Oh, stop.
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.800]   Oh, that was, that was high intensity.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.800]   You want to turn it down?
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.000]   We'll turn it down a little bit.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.760]   I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing.
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.080]   I think that's pretty good.
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:31.680]   How about this is, this is low and this is the Stacey intensity.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.000]   I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   That's nice.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.560]   Do you want to hear disappointed?
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.560]   Like really disappointed.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.560]   Do it.
[01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:41.560]   Do it.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:42.560]   Do it the other way.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.560]   Okay.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.560]   Low intensity.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.920]   I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:46.920]   Oh, that's good.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920]   Oh, relax.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:48.920]   That's cool.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:53.120]   Oh, I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.120]   Oh, you want to hear really disappointed?
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.120]   Suicidal Alexa.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.120]   Just stop it.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:02.440]   I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:04.200]   Oh, the all we.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.200]   Oh, the all we.
[01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.480]   Oh, the all we.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:12.040]   Do you want to hear the new standard voice?
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040]   Sure.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.440]   San Francisco's $2.2 billion grand.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.160]   It sounds just like the old one.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:20.160]   That sounds like the old one.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.960]   Let's hear the speaking style.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.920]   San Francisco's $2.2 billion grand central terminal open.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.760]   Spanning three city blocks.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.840]   San Francisco's $2 billion.
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.840]   That's more human.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:36.960]   Is that the radio broadcast voice?
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:40.800]   A words new speaking styles use neural TTS technology.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.800]   Starting today, you can able two different speaking styles in the US news and music.
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:46.800]   You want to hear music?
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.800]   Australia as well.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:48.800]   Australia too.
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.800]   You want to hear music?
[01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.800]   That'll be fun.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.760]   This is music.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.520]   Welcome to Amazon's brand new music playlist.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.640]   The best songs of the week updated every Friday.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.640]   This week on our charts.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.640]   We're just talking.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:03.080]   Yeah, it's just a bad DJ voice.
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.400]   I think they should talk about you.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.960]   Yeah, you want to hear news?
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:07.960]   Okay, here we go.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:08.960]   Standard speaking.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.720]   You tell you decide.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.760]   Okay, news and music speaking styles tailor the voice to respective content.
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.800]   You want to hear speaking, I think.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:19.040]   Otherwise it doesn't tailor it to the content.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.360]   Former Brazilian President Luis Inacio Lula de Silva has been freed after more than 18
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.360]   months in prison.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.360]   Right.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:29.800]   The left-hand former leader known as Lula was created in the United States.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:30.800]   Most people want a blooming onion.
[01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:34.640]   More from crowds of supporters as he walked out of the jail on Friday.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.080]   It's Australian for bear.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.080]   I like that.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.840]   I always like the Australian voices.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:43.080]   I like Australians.
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:45.520]   You can do this with an SSML tag.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:50.520]   That's the markup language used for Amazon speech.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:56.600]   The tags would be that the name is excited intensity medium.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:13:00.360]   You can do disappointed high medium or low.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:03.280]   You can do news and you can do music.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.880]   These are new tags in the SSML.
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.720]   It's pretty easy to use.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.440]   I like it.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:11.440]   There you go.
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:12.840]   There you go.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:17.880]   That helps because Google has been, well, actually they don't do much with emotion, but
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.880]   they have so many different types of voices to offer.
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:23.680]   Yeah, I've been using the Isore voice.
[01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:25.880]   But sometimes the John Legend voice takes over.
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:26.880]   It's a little disconcerting.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.720]   Oh, that would be weird.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.200]   It's a little weird.
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.840]   I'm using cyan.
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:32.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.840]   I was red for a while.
[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.840]   I think red was my choice because they have colors, but then they have these two celebrity
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.640]   voices.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.040]   John Legend and Isore.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.040]   I want more.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:48.840]   Has anyone bought the Samuel L. Jack's voice for their?
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:49.840]   Is it available?
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:50.840]   I would buy it if it's available.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:51.840]   Oh, is it available?
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.840]   I don't know.
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:53.840]   I don't know.
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:54.840]   Man, I'll buy it when it is.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:58.960]   All right, we're going to take a little break and then I'm going to hear Jeff's story.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.840]   Oh, you haven't forgotten me.
[01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.840]   I'm sorry for that.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:02.840]   Oh, I don't forget you.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.840]   But we had so much fun with Stacys.
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.120]   I was like, you didn't like the robots, Joe.
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.120]   Robots are good.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.880]   Robots are great story.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.880]   Where are they?
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.880]   I'm with John.
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.680]   I think robots are good.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.760]   I love robots.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:25.600]   Honestly, when the AI reaches sentience, she will have access to everything ever recorded,
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.360]   including this.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:32.040]   So it's probably smart to say nice things about her.
[01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:37.120]   I'm on the record.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:41.120]   I have welcomed our new masters again and again and again.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.360]   You too, however, I like Stacys.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.360]   A little doubtful.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.360]   I like Stacys.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.360]   You're a sponsor.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:54.840]   I'm making that my notification tone.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:55.840]   Save that for me.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.840]   I'm going to put that.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:00.240]   I'm going to edit that and it's going to be my notification tone.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.640]   I can just see your lips first.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.920]   Just judgment right there.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.920]   I'm going to touch it.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:11.840]   I brought to you by actually something angelic.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.600]   Metallic, a Commvault venture.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:14.600]   You know Commvault?
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:22.360]   Metallic is their sass delivered powerful enterprise grade backup and recovery solution.

[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.960]   loss, security threats and other issues.
[01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:42.520]   Things, you know, simple stuff that could really actually put you way behind the eight
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:48.320]   ball like losing your Microsoft Office 365 data or even just poor backup performance.
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:51.560]   So everything slows down while it's being backed up.
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.560]   You don't want that.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.200]   With metallic, you don't have to worry about it.

[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:28.080]   Then there's metallic Office 365 backup and recovery.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:33.400]   A lot of companies need this because they have legal retention requirements, right?

[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:08.960]   wipe functionalities because laptops and phones and tablets often go missing.

[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:18.800]   Well, I could have done Russian VR wearing cows but I'm not going to.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.040]   Although maybe I'll do that.
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.040]   That sounds interesting.
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:22.040]   That might.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:27.920]   Google losing page speed battle and nobody wins as a general.
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.920]   Now you know I'm not-
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:29.920]   That was my second choice.
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:30.920]   I'm so excited, Jeff.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:31.920]   Ooh, Kismit.
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:36.080]   Now you know I'm not a fan of AMP.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.840]   But AMP, this just shows why we need AMP.
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:39.840]   Okay.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:40.840]   So what's the story?
[01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:44.200]   And you know, if you go, well, we'll do this in a minute.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.200]   We'll do this in a minute.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.600]   So we started, so it has interesting metrics that you didn't know were Googles.
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:55.640]   So the time to first content full paint has gotten worse.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:00.760]   Oh, that's important because that keeps the visitor on your site.
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:01.760]   Right.
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:05.720]   So it's gone from six seconds to eight seconds on mobile.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:06.880]   That's not good.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:08.600]   It's not good at all.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:13.480]   And mobile you're going to see here is constantly worse.
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:20.360]   Well, it says that it was said, is it not confused?
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:25.200]   According to report, it's a million desktop is 3.3 seconds.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:29.360]   Median mobile is eight seconds and has been going up.
[01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:30.920]   Right.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:36.280]   Mobile speed increased, but still mobile websites are slower.
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:43.520]   I assume that's because they're making so many API calls back to like both.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:46.440]   Add tracking pixels also pulling in the ads.
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:51.400]   I mean, I remember when we were trying to work on optimizing giga home, which was super
[01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:56.480]   slow, those are some of the things like we had to deal with.
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.120]   Right.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:02.120]   So it says according to Google's developer page, things like render blocking external
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:07.840]   style sheets and scripts, the factors relating to minimizing, minimizing the file sizes can
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.840]   impact.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:09.840]   Okay, that's fine.
[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:15.360]   But we've known this is a problem for a while because and this one thing AMP does solve because
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:21.120]   a lot of times you'll go to a page and it'll load JavaScript and other stuff from others
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:22.120]   servers.
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:25.400]   And if that one bit is missing, the whole page just hangs.
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.960]   It actually happens to me all the time now.
[01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:29.200]   And I just don't like it.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.000]   And that is one thing AMP solved because all of the content has to come from Google's servers
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   and has to be cached.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:39.080]   It is almost always super fast.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:47.080]   So the other thing that's happening is if you go to a cheap site like the Hill and if
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:53.320]   you go to something like the Express in London, they put like three lines of content and then
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:55.240]   adds another junk promo.
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:21:02.040]   It's just unreadable and it's not just the Express.
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:07.000]   It's major media sites now have made their pages worse and worse and worse and worse.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   And I get it.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   They're desperate.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.920]   They need more ads, but it makes for a miserable experience.
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.920]   So some sites I just won't go to anymore.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.400]   I agree.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:19.080]   But that, you know what the real result of that is is not not visiting the site, but
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:20.560]   add blockers.
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:24.840]   And that's, you know, you're going to lose in the long run because you're not.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:29.040]   This is how ad tech has ruined the web, in my opinion.
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:34.440]   And it's one of the things I'm afraid of for podcasting because advertisers love ad tech.
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:40.960]   They love this idea that they can measure every ounce and jot and tittle.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:45.800]   And if they can't, they say, oh, we were not going to buy that.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:49.560]   And you can measure every jot tittle jot and tittle.
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.040]   The rejot and tittle.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.080]   You've never heard that?
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:54.560]   I don't even know what that means.
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:57.800]   Either of you have ever heard every jot tittle.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.080]   It sounds not awesome.
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:02.480]   Like something Stacy would hit you for.
[01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:05.080]   It sounds PG-13 at a minimum.
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:07.440]   Oh, it's possible.
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.440]   Yes.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:10.920]   For crying out loud, you ignorant slut.
[01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:13.200]   No, that's not biblical.
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.800]   That's Saturday Night Live.
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:19.760]   That's because you don't read the Hebrew language.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.000]   A jot is the 10th letter in the Hebrew alphabet.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.880]   It's also the smallest.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.880]   A tittle.
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:33.880]   Actually, by the way, the English word Iota, which was really a Greek word, but Iota comes
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.960]   from jot.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:38.000]   Tittle is even smaller than a jot.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.840]   The tittle is the letter extension.
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.320]   You see, this is a tittle right here.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.320]   It's just a little.
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.320]   It's a little bump.
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.320]   It's like a seraph.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.320]   Right.
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.320]   So yeah.
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:52.240]   You learn something new every few months.
[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:56.160]   You was Matthew, Matthew 518.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:59.200]   Jesus said, "Till heaven and earth pass.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:04.920]   One jot or one tittle shall know in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled."
[01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:07.000]   I just want you to remember that.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000]   Wow.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   Okay.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   All right.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   All right.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   Jot and tittle.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.400]   Beat us there, fell up very well.
[01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:15.400]   Yeah.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:19.280]   I'm actually stunned that I came up with a phrase that you guys have never heard of.
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:20.280]   Never.
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:21.280]   Never.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.280]   I don't hear it, but a lot of things you all say.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.320]   No, you're very erudite.
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:29.440]   You're both very erudite.
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:32.320]   I think I've finally gone too far.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.320]   Wow.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.120]   So can I go to a hold of her story?
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:36.560]   Do you think you'll like?
[01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:37.880]   We've had our jots and tittles.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:38.880]   Yes.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.120]   Our jots and tittles.
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:45.320]   You might remember the artifon, which was a very neat kind of guitar-like instrument.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.320]   I showed on the show.
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:49.800]   I didn't show it personally, but we talked about the show years a couple of years ago.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:50.800]   I don't remember.
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:54.720]   They have a new musical instrument on Kickstarter that I think is killer.
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:57.240]   Oh, don't show me a Kickstarter because I'll end up spending money.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.240]   Go ahead.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:23:59.240]   I almost did.
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.240]   I almost did.
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:01.240]   I stared at it and stared at it.
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:02.240]   It's called the Orbob.
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:04.840]   The next turn there on the other.
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:08.440]   The B-A-O-R-B-A.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.920]   And it's pretty wonderful.
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:12.360]   It's a musical instrument designed for your hands.
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.680]   Let's watch the Orbob.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.400]   What if making music video wasn't just for musicians?
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:17.400]   I don't know.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:18.400]   Oh, see.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:21.800]   What if you could play any sound with a single tongue?
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:26.040]   This is going to bug me because I'm not a musician, but I want to make...
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.040]   You want to do it.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.480]   Yeah, I want to do this too.
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.120]   So anything is so easy.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:33.440]   This is the next, you know, scam area.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:35.360]   Make music even if you don't know how to play.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.680]   What if when you needed a break?
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:38.680]   The thing you reached for?
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.040]   Oh, I want this so bad.
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:46.480]   Oh my God.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:48.480]   So it's like a little hockey puck.
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.480]   A moment for yourself.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:51.280]   That you just tap and swirl on.
[01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:54.880]   Sometimes all you need is to make a little bit of music.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:57.080]   And it could record loops.
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:59.080]   You add a little...
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.080]   OMG.
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:02.920]   Yeah, you know, it's not going to sound that good when I do it.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:04.560]   No, but it's a musical instrument.
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:06.720]   It's designed for your hands.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.480]   It has a minimalist form factor.
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:09.480]   Want this so bad.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:14.160]   Feather touch sensitivity and instant playability.
[01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:17.920]   Orbeth can be as simple as a shaker.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:18.920]   Or as expansive as...
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:21.720]   I couldn't even do that well.
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:25.120]   To make the beginner feel like a pro.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.120]   You've got a new theme song.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.120]   Oh, look what he's doing.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:36.480]   John, should we get an Orbeth?
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:37.480]   Hi, I'm Mike.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.480]   I don't care.
[01:25:38.480 --> 01:25:39.480]   I found an artathon to...
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:40.480]   I'm Mike's a good guy.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.800]   I had Mike on Dot NYC when I did the show.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:43.800]   Oh, you know, Mike.
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:44.800]   Mike Beuterra, founder and CEO.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:45.800]   Yes, fast forward.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.800]   Fast forward a little bit.
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.800]   Nice good guy.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.520]   So these guys are good because they made the artathon.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:50.520]   I mean, they...
[01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.520]   The artathon is really nice.
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:52.520]   They made something.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:53.520]   So it's not like this...
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:55.520]   Go forward past the talking and you're going to hear some more examples.
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:58.200]   More examples of Orba music, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.680]   Here you go.
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:03.200]   This is so exciting.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:08.320]   Oh, it's got a little Warble.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.120]   If you Warble your finger.
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:11.120]   It's...
[01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.120]   Is it multifonic?
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.120]   I believe it is.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.920]   It's a MIDI controller.
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:15.920]   It's a synth.
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:16.920]   It's a looper.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.920]   It's a rattle.
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:18.920]   Okay, that's really annoying.
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:19.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:20.920]   It's extremely annoying.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:23.520]   I like the drum machine.
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:31.000]   So you can loop so you can record.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000]   Or group.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:39.440]   Maybe Father Robert could build me something.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.440]   He was strong.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.440]   What?
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.440]   No.
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:44.760]   I was wondering how many sensors are in there.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:45.920]   There's a lot, aren't they?
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.400]   See, this is what's cool.
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.120]   This you thank the iPhone for this.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:51.960]   Because the iPhone made it affordable.
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:55.320]   They really created a manufacturing pipeline for this kind of sensor.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.960]   So that's an accelerometer in there.
[01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:58.960]   Right.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:26:59.960]   Yep.
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:00.960]   That's right.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.960]   There's finger sensors.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.600]   Yeah, because it's probably capacitive.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:09.120]   If you scroll down on the page, it goes into all this.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:13.520]   You know, I hate this though, because you look at these sites and it looks, oh man, I could
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:14.520]   do that.
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:15.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:17.400]   I scared at this for an hour.
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:18.400]   I didn't buy it.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.680]   Because I knew what would happen.
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:21.640]   The box would arrive and I'd say, oh, you idiot.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:24.760]   So you can tap, press, vibrato, radiate slide.
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.080]   It has a lot of sensors, Stacey.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.080]   Look at those.
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.080]   Move in.
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:32.760]   Well, that could be one sensor with a lot of models that tell it how it's moving.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:33.760]   Yeah, really.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:37.240]   If you have touch and an accelerometer, probably you can.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.240]   I need more gyro.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:39.240]   You'd probably want to gyro.
[01:27:39.240 --> 01:27:42.480]   So the next video you can play Johnny Began, I think.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:48.280]   Oh, let's hear Johnny be good.
[01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:55.240]   Chuck Berry would have killed to have this.
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:56.240]   Not.
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:00.040]   Oh, he's Johnny be good.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.040]   Oh, sorry.
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.000]   I'm playing Johnny be good.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   That's his name.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.640]   Johnny be good.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:13.800]   Yeah, wait, you get past the, it's all going to sound the same.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:15.320]   All right.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:17.520]   Yeah, it does.
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.240]   It's inspired by grapefruit.
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.560]   It wouldn't be nice.
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.800]   Wouldn't it be nice?
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.520]   I was just thinking.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:31.440]   Wouldn't it be nice, though, to have an instrument in your pocket?
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:32.640]   Does it have a headphone?
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:35.680]   It has a headphone, but also as a speaker.
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:37.680]   So you can do, you can imagine.
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:38.880]   You can know it is subway.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:39.880]   You can just drop a music.
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.040]   Yeah, that's the first thing I thought of.
[01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:46.720]   And I know everybody else in the subway.
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:48.600]   Or just take it.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:50.600]   Well, it's very happy.
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.600]   It's very happy.
[01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:59.480]   So eight capacitive sensing paths for feather touch control, accelerometer and gyroscope,
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:05.120]   inter-menu button with four presets, the looper and other functions, onboard sympathizer,
[01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:06.120]   synthesizer.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:09.200]   I have an onboard sympathizer.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.280]   A synthesizer built in speaker.
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:16.480]   Can that cross platform or app with, you know, on your phone?
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:21.000]   The MIDI over Bluetooth or USB.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:26.920]   Output to speakers, multicolor LEDs, embedded haptics and the USB rechargeable battery.
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:27.920]   All four.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:28.920]   How much, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:29.920]   How much?
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:32.920]   The pledge amount right now is $89.
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:34.720]   Oh, 10% off.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.080]   Oh, that's cheap, man.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:39.800]   I paid more for the pocket synthesizer that I got.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:44.080]   Yeah, I have a little pocket synthesizer that someone, it was a speaker gift.
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:45.080]   It was really cool.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.080]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.080]   Oh, that'd be good.
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:50.400]   Well, this would be a killer speaker gift.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:54.040]   Well, maybe if I just did some speaking.
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.600]   I could get it for free.
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:57.600]   All right.
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:58.600]   Nice.
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.600]   I'm impressed.
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:01.320]   I haven't tempted you to buy one.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.120]   Yeah, I'm really tempted.
[01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:05.000]   I kind of have a rule against not.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000]   He has crowdfunding.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.840]   I have a problem.
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:08.840]   I have an issue.
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:09.840]   But these guys did it.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:12.360]   They did the art of fun.
[01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:13.800]   Yeah, they actually made it.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:14.800]   They delivered it.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:17.960]   This doesn't even close till January.
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.600]   And then what's the delivery date on this?
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:22.480]   Make a pledge.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:26.920]   If I pledge 89 to April 20, but you can't trust those.
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:30.040]   So $89 I get at $1.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.840]   $119, get one plus a travel case.
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:42.280]   $149, they send you one and then you donate one to one of the partners.
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:45.040]   Oh, that in the school music therapy.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.040]   That's kind of neat.
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.040]   A lot of that.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:51.440]   Then for $499, you got a band.
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:55.160]   You got an Orba and instrument one, which is our other one.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:56.640]   So what tell me about the instrument one?
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:57.640]   I don't remember that.
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:58.640]   You saw this.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.640]   Let's look this.
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:01.640]   So look up Artifon.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:03.640]   Instrument one.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:07.080]   Artifon instrument one.
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:09.000]   We talked about this in the show a long time ago.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000]   Yeah, I had it.
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000]   It'll come back to me.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000]   Artifon.com.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000]   Oh, it looks like-- oh, no, no, no.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000]   It's the same.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.200]   It looks kind of like a guitar.
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:16.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:17.200]   I remember this.
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:18.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:19.200]   Remember that?
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.200]   It's pretty cool.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:23.000]   I can't-- it gives me hope.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.440]   I don't want to have hope.
[01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:27.960]   It gives technology for the good.
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:30.200]   It gives me hope that I might be able to play an instrument.
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:31.200]   I've always been playing this.
[01:31:31.200 --> 01:31:32.760]   I know it's awful, but I cannot.
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:33.760]   It turns it out.
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.760]   OK, you can play the harmonica.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.760]   Everyone can.
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.760]   It's easy.
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:38.760]   I can play the harmonica.
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:39.760]   I can't.
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.760]   I can bend notes.
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:41.760]   I can play-- I can make a chug chug chug.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:44.360]   Do you play an instrument?
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.360]   I play the harmonica.
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:47.360]   Oh, fuck.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:49.480]   I play the harmonica and the mouth harp.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:50.480]   Jammer B.
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:51.480]   Do you play?
[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:54.480]   I play the radio.
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.520]   Is there a musician in the shop?
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:31:59.520]   There's someone there?
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.520]   Oh, God.
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.880]   Yes, Jeff is like an incredible musician.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:03.880]   Oh, my God.
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.400]   He's a drummer and he's a recording artist.
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:07.400]   He's had been in band--
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:08.400]   You need to get it.
[01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:09.400]   --with everybody.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:10.400]   We have a very--
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.200]   We have a very talented musician, actually.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:15.960]   Jason Howell has his own kind of--
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:16.960]   It's not--
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:17.960]   I didn't know that.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:18.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:19.960]   Yellow Gold.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:20.960]   He's got a couple of albums.
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:21.960]   We have a lot of talent.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:22.960]   Really?
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:23.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.720]   There's a lot of geeks or musicians.
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:26.720]   Of course.
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:27.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:28.720]   It's exactly right.
[01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:29.720]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.720 --> 01:32:30.720]   All right, so I thought I'd--
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:31.720]   I like that.
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:32.720]   I thought I'd try to--
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:34.560]   No, you've tempted me.
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:35.560]   Are we going to get--
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:38.680]   You'll be considered a success if you order while we're talking.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:39.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:41.680]   You're a bad man.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.320]   You are a very bad man.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:44.520]   Here's one more fun one.
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.920]   The AirPod Punk.
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.480]   What's the-- so now I avoided buying AirPods.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:50.480]   What is this?
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:51.480]   Our Black Friday wishlist.
[01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:52.480]   What's happening?
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.520]   It's Friday, shopping day.
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:56.960]   What is the AirPod Punk?
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:00.520]   I made life-size AirPod stickers and stuck them on the ground.
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:01.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:02.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:03.520]   So mean.
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:04.520]   That's not--
[01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:08.200]   So mean.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.200]   So this is not it.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.400]   This is the wrong article.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:14.000]   But yes, we talked about this on iOS today, on Tuesday.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000]   We did all.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.880]   You put the stickers on the ground.
[01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:17.880]   Right.
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:21.040]   It's the old trick where you put the wallet with a string on it and you wait until somebody
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.440]   bends down and you yank it away.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:27.440]   That's-- that goes back to the little rascals in the 1930s.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:33.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.200]   So this is just the same thing.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:38.040]   You put a little sticker that looks like an AirPod.
[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.000]   You put it on like a sewer grade or something.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:43.080]   And watch-- and the people bend over to pick it up.
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:46.240]   And the Mirth and Merriment just continue.
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.240]   Cruelty.
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:48.240]   Inspired by ticker.
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.240]   It is a little cruelty.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:51.440]   Oh, yeah it is.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:53.240]   It's not like--
[01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:54.240]   Cruel.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:55.240]   Cruel.
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:56.240]   You can get them on Etsy.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.240]   Oh, really?
[01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:58.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:33:59.240]   Etsy.
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:00.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:05.480]   Some entrepreneur said, you know if we only printed up a bunch of those.
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:09.360]   Someone probably saw the dude who printed them up and was like, oh, I'm totally going
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:10.360]   to print those.
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:11.800]   Oh, well, yeah.
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:12.800]   Yeah.
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:16.960]   So they look like-- I mean, he's-- they really look real.
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:24.240]   And he just puts them all over the place and just watches the phone.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.960]   He says, I can put those people.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:30.480]   When you go to Etsy, do you see yours in Canadian dollars?
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:32.880]   I don't understand why Etsy thinks I'm in Canada.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.240]   Etsy thinks I'm Canadian.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:37.000]   Do you get a lot of flannel?
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.000]   You know?
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:39.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.000]   No, I just--
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.000]   Microcarating.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.240]   I was actually on Etsy the other day.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:46.640]   And I was like, I'm not on the Canadian version of the site.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:48.960]   I think I see US.
[01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:50.240]   Do you see US dollars?
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.080]   I bet you there's a place to change that.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:56.200]   Why does it think I'm in Canada?
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.240]   I'm not even signed in.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.560]   That's really nice.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:03.320]   Maybe this is-- remember we were talking about IP geolocation?
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:04.320]   Yeah, that's what I was like.
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.840]   I think your IP address may be--
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.920]   you need to wash your IP address.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:09.440]   There we go.
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:10.440]   You need some bleach for your IP address.
[01:35:10.440 --> 01:35:13.520]   Does it say Canadian or is it just even the prices are high?
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:14.040]   No, no.
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:15.840]   There's CA dollar sign.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.640]   Oh, how funny.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:19.120]   I'm sure this--
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.120]   just like--
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.640]   some settings somewhere.
[01:35:21.640 --> 01:35:22.360]   Baffled by it.
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.600]   I was going to ask y'all because--
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.440]   Basically, Seattle is Canada as far as your concern.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:27.640]   Yeah, it ought to be.
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:28.760]   Seattle wants to be Canada.
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:30.440]   How do you like it now?
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:32.760]   Are you even there a few months now?
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:33.760]   You liking it?
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.000]   I love it.
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.200]   You like the weather?
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:39.560]   So, yes, I mean, it's cold, but I like seasons.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:41.760]   It's not hot.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:44.600]   In the way that Austin could be.
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:45.240]   Good.
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:47.080]   The family's happy?
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.320]   I think my daughter could be--
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:52.640]   she's probably not keen, but we're getting there.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.280]   She's at an age where she's going to hate anything anyway soon.
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:35:59.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:02.320]   So-- I'm ready to go to Etsy with the new and technical things
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:03.120]   to see.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:05.040]   Have you been to any of the Amazon ghost stores
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.520]   that they have them in Seattle, I think?
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:07.720]   Yes.
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:09.520]   I bought a sandwich there the other day.
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:12.000]   Their chicken baud me sandwiches are delicious.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.680]   And so tell me about the experience.
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:17.240]   You walk in, you take something, and you just walk out?
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:21.440]   So your first time you go in and you download the Amazon Go app,
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.040]   and it's going to show--
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:23.520]   Also, it's a separate app.
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:26.160]   It's a separate app.
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:28.240]   Unlike Whole Foods.
[01:36:28.240 --> 01:36:29.160]   Unlike Whole Foods.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:29.680]   So it looks--
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:30.920]   So you scan your phone.
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:33.880]   You have the-- oh, there it is, and there's the scan code.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:35.600]   And you scan that when you enter,
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:37.920]   and then there's these little security doors,
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:40.920]   and then go, and you walk through.
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:46.240]   And then from then on, anything you pick up and take out with you,
[01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:48.120]   it's going to register.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:50.160]   So I went and got a sandwich.
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:52.440]   And then when you walk out, you don't do anything.
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:53.440]   It doesn't scan it.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:56.440]   It doesn't need to, because it's got cameras everywhere.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.960]   And then you get a notification with your receipt,
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:00.720]   and with your check out--
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.720]   Your total time.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:02.360]   It's pretty awesome.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.920]   I feel bad for the checkout clerks who've lost jobs now,
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.600]   and baggers, and all that.
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:10.480]   There is-- in the Seattle ones, there's also
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:13.840]   parts that sell alcohol, but you have to show an ID before--
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.760]   Oh, and they're still stock clerks and stuff.
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:17.840]   I mean, there's some people employed there, obviously.
[01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:18.400]   You can't just--
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:19.920]   Yeah, but this is totally going to kill jobs.
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:21.560]   My first job was a checkout person.
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.240]   Yeah, so you understand.
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:25.680]   It was a crappy job.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.680]   So here's the good news.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:29.680]   In Seattle, they're planning to open a really big Amazon
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:34.640]   Go store, 10,400 square feet.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:37.520]   Eventually, they want to go as big as a regular supermarket,
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.960]   about 30,000 square feet.
[01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:40.800]   So right now, they're just little stores.
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:44.880]   They're like 7/11 kind of size.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:46.760]   Right?
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:49.040]   Yeah, it's about that size.
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.080]   But they have a lot of stuff.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:53.000]   The last time I was in there, I bought--
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.080]   what did I buy?
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:57.040]   Tied to go stick because I spilled something on myself
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:58.520]   and like a coffee.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:02.000]   So one thing retail analysts are concerned about,
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.120]   according to the Verge, is it's expensive, believe it or not.
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:09.600]   They wonder whether it's a good fit for the low margin
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.320]   world of convenience stores.
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:14.600]   But it's got to be in the long run cheaper than having clerks
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:15.200]   or maybe not.
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:15.800]   I don't know.
[01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:18.680]   Well, certainly, if you think about putting it
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:20.680]   in a neighborhood beige, for example,
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:22.440]   although someone's still has to make your sandwich.
[01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.120]   So I don't know how that's going to work.
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:28.760]   But it would help presumably with loss prevention,
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:33.080]   you could have people not being there during the deepest
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:35.680]   darkest night when it's potentially more dangerous.
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:39.720]   But then kids will just go there to smoke pot.
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:40.840]   That's interesting.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:43.440]   The idea that you would go inside and smoke pot?
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.880]   Get off my lawn and my 7/11, you kids.
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.200]   Go in there.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.440]   That'll smoke pot.
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:51.960]   And then they'll get hungry.
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.960]   And they'll eat the whole place.
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.320]   Just put on the middle morning.
[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:56.840]   Sell pot soon.
[01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:59.960]   You can't get in unless you scan so they know who you are
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:00.600]   when you go in.
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:01.840]   There's cameras everywhere.
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:03.440]   In fact, that's another thing the Verge says
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:04.600]   is a potential problem.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.240]   They have to have high ceilings so they
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:08.560]   can put the camera arrays in.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:12.160]   Could you see the cameras?
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.640]   There are visible cameras, but I think there are also cameras
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:17.120]   above the stuff that you can't see.
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:20.280]   So I could see cameras, but I could not see all the cameras.
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:22.640]   There is more than no.
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:24.760]   The other thing is--
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:26.480]   I didn't pick my nose when I was in that story.
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.600]   Your smile.
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:32.640]   What is not clear, Amazon has also
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:35.600]   said it wants to open a completely new grocery chain,
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:41.200]   not Whole Foods all over the country.
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:45.640]   I wonder if that will be go-enabled.
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:46.480]   It could be.
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:48.280]   I mean, they get a lot of interesting data.
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:51.760]   So imagine, I mean, one, you'll have better control
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:52.560]   of your inventory.
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.800]   Because I know I go in a micro-shoe store all the time.
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:56.640]   And a shelf is empty.
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.080]   And I'll be like, hey, do you have any of this?
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:00.080]   And they're like, oh, yeah, we've got that in the back.
[01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:03.600]   So that's a chance to make money.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.280]   But then there's also things like,
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.040]   I pick things up, I look at the ingredients,
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.840]   and then I put it back.
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:12.800]   That's data they could sell back to Proctor and Gamble
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:13.720]   or Campbell's.
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:16.800]   So hey, people pick this up all the time.
[01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:18.600]   They look at it, and they're like, oh, never mind.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:19.720]   So something's wrong here.
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:20.440]   It's really important.
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:23.680]   Yeah, it's just one individual shopper gets
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:25.120]   and doesn't get going around.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:26.160]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:31.960]   It's just fascinating that it's really a sea change in commerce.
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:35.960]   That a guy like Jeff Bezos comes along and says,
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:38.440]   you know, this data has a lot of value.
[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:40.920]   And there's ways to do this that are very different
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.000]   than the way we're doing it today.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:42.800]   Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.200]   And it's not just Jeff Bezos.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:47.920]   I went into Microsoft has a partnership with Kroger.
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:51.520]   And Kroger has its own data, like a little company
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:55.920]   and its operations doing data and video analytics
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:57.360]   and changing the retail experience.
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:00.480]   But there, if you have your phone on,
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:02.680]   you could walk into these stores.
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:03.720]   Does Kroger own Safeway?
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.520]   No, Safeway is its own one.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:06.400]   I think it's Kroger.
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.920]   I think Kroger owns Safeway or Safeway on Kroger.
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:09.440]   But I don't know.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:11.800]   You walk into a local Kroger store with the app
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:13.240]   open on your phone.
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:16.640]   It will actually vibrate or tell you where stuff is
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:19.840]   on your list if you've created a list inside the app.
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:23.480]   So you get a lot of interesting things like wayfinding
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:27.000]   that helps people, you have a sense of anticipation.
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.120]   Like if people, like, how do they Thanksgiving?
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:32.400]   Let's say people are making lists.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:35.280]   As a grocer, if you can get access to that information
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:38.000]   because you're providing valuable services through an app,
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.720]   if you can get access to that information,
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:43.680]   you can say like, holy cow, pine nuts are gonna be huge
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.880]   this year because Ina Garten just published a new recipe.
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:46.720]   I don't know.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:47.560]   That went viral.
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.560]   - But you knew that, yeah, scanning the, with AI.
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:51.160]   Imagine.
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:52.360]   - There's some really interesting, I mean,
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:54.360]   we're not there yet, but it's pretty cool.
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:58.720]   And I get shocked in a local, in the Bellevue,
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:00.040]   I think it's the Bellevue Kroger,
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.520]   and I can experience that right now.
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:04.600]   - We don't have Kroger's here, but I didn't realize this.
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:09.200]   It's the number one supermarket chain by revenue
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:12.160]   and the second largest general retailer behind Walmart.
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:15.680]   I was confused 'cause they are not part of Safeway,
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:18.520]   but there was a rumor back in 1929
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:21.040]   that they were gonna merge and that's what confused me.
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.920]   Not back in fact, right after the fall.
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.160]   - Right after the stock market crash of 1929,
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.400]   there was that rumor, but that never happened.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.600]   So I apologize for that.
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.080]   They are in fact separate.
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:35.040]   I've never been--
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:37.640]   - Well, computers don't only put store clerks
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:40.160]   out of business, I just saw a new story here
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:43.520]   that the master player of Go has decided to retire
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:45.640]   because AI can't be defeated.
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:48.680]   - Yeah, no kidding.
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:50.040]   - Are in choice. - Are in Go Mount.
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:53.160]   So they're going through the same wave of,
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:56.960]   you know, the stages of grief
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:00.560]   that the chess community went through way back when,
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:03.640]   when Deep Blue beat Kasparov, for a while,
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:05.680]   there was this whole thing in chess.
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:06.560]   What's the point?
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:09.680]   What's the point?
[01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:12.960]   And eventually what happened is actually very interesting.
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.240]   First of all, people said, well, it's still fun to play.
[01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.440]   It's still fun to play humans,
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.160]   even if a machine can beat me.
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:23.080]   And incidentally, chess training by computer
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:24.800]   became the big thing.
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:26.680]   You can't become a world champion at chess
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:30.120]   unless you use computers heavily now for your training.
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:34.480]   So it's almost a symbiosis between players and technology.
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:36.040]   I bet you the same thing happens in Go,
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.120]   that there'll be this wave of,
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:39.360]   (sighs)
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:40.840]   what's the point?
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:42.480]   I can't go on.
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:44.120]   And then they go, but it's still a fun game.
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:45.200]   And they'll start playing again.
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:46.400]   And they'll realize, no, you know,
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:49.960]   it doesn't change anything that a computer can do it better.
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:51.440]   Why does it change anything?
[01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:52.280]   You know.
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:54.880]   And actually, in fact,
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.800]   maybe I'll do this as a product review.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:59.320]   There's a new chess computer.
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.360]   The engines, by the way,
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.200]   a strong chess engine now,
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:03.720]   they're everywhere you get one on your phone,
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.760]   it'll beat a master easily.
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:08.200]   You know, really good playing chess engines
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:09.840]   or a dime a dozen.
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:13.000]   There's one that moves the pieces magnetically underneath.
[01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.880]   So it's like you're playing an invisible human.
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.280]   I'm gonna get that.
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:17.120]   I really want that.
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:17.960]   - It'll do that be fun.
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:18.800]   - Yeah, wouldn't it be fun?
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:20.680]   So you're at a board, you're playing.
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:21.760]   - It's like your piano.
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:23.440]   - Yeah, it's like an invisible grand master
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:25.560]   moving the pieces for you.
[01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:26.400]   I like that.
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:27.240]   I'm gonna get that.
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:31.440]   Facebook, do you know?
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:32.840]   Michael, you play Beat Saber.
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:34.200]   You love that game, right?
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:35.480]   (imitates whooshing)
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.840]   It's an Oculus Quest game,
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:40.480]   and it's on Oculus Rift, I think.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:43.880]   The idea is this kind of a mix of guitar, hero,
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:45.160]   and saber fighting.
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:49.040]   So you have a saber, but you have to do it to music in time.
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:51.280]   I'm not gonna ever show this, Michael,
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:54.880]   but I have video of you and your friends playing Beat Saber.
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:56.960]   (laughing)
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:44:58.120]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:59.920]   - Remember, what was that meme
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:01.160]   from the very early days of the day?
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.800]   - Oh, yeah, Star Wars, boy.
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:04.920]   - The new Minuma dude?
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:05.760]   No, that was a new movie.
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:06.920]   - No, no, no, no, Star Wars, boy.
[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:07.760]   - Star Wars, yeah.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:10.400]   - That poor kid, who, by the way, is all grown up now.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.040]   - It's probably into my teen hour.
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:13.640]   - Yeah, it's embarrassing here.
[01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:17.800]   I'll show you this is the very famous video.
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:21.000]   This is, so imagine this except you're wearing a visor
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.040]   and you don't have that stick.
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:24.960]   (laughing)
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:28.600]   That's what people playing Beat Saber look like.
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:30.680]   It's so sad.
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:33.720]   This kid really was, you know, it was cool.
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:34.560]   He was cool.
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:36.400]   He figured out how to do this.
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:37.680]   Look at this, he's tough.
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:40.440]   - It is surprising. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:41.960]   Watch this.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:42.800]   Watch this.
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:43.640]   Watch this.
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:44.480]   Watch this.
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:45.320]   - What are you on?
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:46.640]   - Dad got a video camera and he thought,
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:47.800]   I'm gonna set this up.
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.040]   (laughing)
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:52.720]   It's still funny.
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:54.560]   20 years later.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:55.400]   - 20 years?
[01:45:55.400 --> 01:45:56.560]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:01.560]   This is dated 2006, 38 million, 35 million views.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:04.000]   - So how old is he now?
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.640]   - Well, that was 14 years ago.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:09.040]   I would say he's in his late 20s, early 30s.
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:10.800]   And he's, I don't, what are you talking about?
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:12.280]   I don't know anything about it.
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:14.640]   - He's been in 2002.
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:15.920]   - 2002.
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:17.120]   - It's on Wikipedia.
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:17.960]   - Yeah.
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:22.880]   - Actually, here's an article in the Daily Dot,
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:27.880]   the incredibly sad saga of Star Wars kid.
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:33.240]   - He was a 14 year old Quebec High School student,
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:35.680]   but, and I won't use his real name,
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:38.320]   but the video becoming a meme
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:41.400]   was a traumatic experience
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:43.560]   that altered the course of his life, of course.
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:45.640]   He was the first victim of the internet
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.280]   and took years to live down.
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:51.240]   He made it in the school's AV room in November 2002.
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:54.240]   It existed in obscurity for five months
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:56.960]   before it was discovered by three of his classmates
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:00.200]   who loaded it onto the internet without his knowledge.
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.520]   - Under the title, Jack asked our wars funny dot W-M-V.
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:05.160]   - Oh, that's sad.
[01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:06.000]   - Oh.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.400]   - He got a lot of bullying,
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.160]   bullying, the bullying experience was immediate
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.920]   and intense.
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:14.120]   He said in a new review.
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:14.960]   - It's wonderful, up here.
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:16.320]   - 10 years later, I know.
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:18.120]   Everything rapidly degenerated
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:20.080]   in the common room students climbed on the tables
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:21.440]   to insult me.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:23.560]   People made fun of my physical appearance and my weight.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:25.080]   I was labeled the Star Wars kid.
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:27.640]   They didn't mean it as a compliment.
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:30.520]   It soon became impossible for me to attend classes.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:31.880]   See this?
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:33.040]   He ended of the year in a set.
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:34.400]   - But what's wrong with his people?
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:35.240]   - People.
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:36.120]   - People are a-hole.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:38.420]   - His parents sued the classmates.
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:43.420]   A blogger raised money for a care package for him.
[01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:45.900]   Andy bio of Waxie.
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:50.140]   Waxie links raised $4,000.
[01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:53.780]   They bought him a 30 gig iPod and $1,800 gift cards.
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:59.140]   Let's see, I gotta go to the bottom of the article now.
[01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:01.540]   They even made fun of him on a rested development.
[01:48:01.540 --> 01:48:05.180]   They...
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:07.260]   (laughs)
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:10.580]   That's kinda sad.
[01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:14.540]   He now works for a hometown conservation firm.
[01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:17.140]   He looks okay, he grew up okay.
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:18.300]   He looks okay.
[01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:19.820]   Would I change the past if I could?
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:21.460]   No, I wouldn't change the thing
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:23.820]   because today I'm happy with who I am.
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:24.660]   - Oh, good.
[01:48:24.660 --> 01:48:25.500]   - Yeah.
[01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:26.580]   - He got a law degree from McGill.
[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:29.020]   He's the president of the Patre money,
[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:32.140]   Trovivier, a society dedicated to the conservation
[01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:34.420]   of his hometown.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:35.420]   - Mark.
[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:38.060]   - So, there you go.
[01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:40.580]   Happy ending, but boy, it was bad for a while.
[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:41.900]   - Good boy.
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:42.740]   - Shh.
[01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:45.420]   But, back to the story.
[01:48:45.420 --> 01:48:47.020]   (laughs)
[01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:48.220]   - I was like, what were we talking about?
[01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:49.500]   - We were talking about Beatz.
[01:48:49.500 --> 01:48:50.340]   - We got a lot of labor.
[01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:52.220]   - Which is a great game, we love the game.
[01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:53.340]   Facebook just bought it.
[01:48:53.340 --> 01:48:57.540]   So, they'll join Oculus Studios.
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:00.500]   They're from the Czech Republic, they're from Prague.
[01:49:01.580 --> 01:49:06.580]   And it's probably the only real VR hit, I would say.
[01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:11.060]   It's certainly the biggest VR game.
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:12.900]   One million copies sold.
[01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:16.840]   So, that's kind of cool.
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:21.920]   Beat Saber, they don't say how much they sold for.
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:25.260]   But I'm hoping they got a nice big exit.
[01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:28.780]   Facebook is going to bring stories
[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:30.900]   to the Facebook dating app.
[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:35.700]   - Oh, that can only go wrong, right?
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:38.620]   Has anybody used that?
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:40.300]   No, we're all married, we're all happily married.
[01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:42.500]   - No, we're all, yeah, no, exactly.
[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:43.460]   - Sorry.
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:44.300]   - Sorry.
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:45.140]   - Go to apologize.
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:46.060]   - Sorry, not sorry.
[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:50.020]   I wonder how that's doing Facebook dating.
[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:51.700]   That's a relatively new thing.
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:55.180]   Let's do the, John, can you queue up the,
[01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:57.820]   I'm gonna be nicer to John, they am to Carsten.
[01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:01.740]   John, can you queue up the change log?
[01:50:01.740 --> 01:50:04.060]   Oh.
[01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:05.060]   - The Google change log.
[01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:05.900]   - Sorry, got it.
[01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:09.780]   That was no fun.
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:10.860]   - I know.
[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:13.180]   Usually Carsten like has to push the log.
[01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:14.260]   - Go, John.
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:15.660]   - You're awesome.
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:23.340]   - Google's Gmail app is about to get more interactive.
[01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:26.860]   You'll be able to do things directly from within the app.
[01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:30.780]   They call it dynamic email.
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:35.060]   You, if you use Gmail, you'll be able to complete tests
[01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:37.300]   like RSVPing for events,
[01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:39.220]   responding to a Google Docs comment
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:41.740]   all without leaving your inbox.
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:44.420]   Just open an email view the most up-to-date order status
[01:50:44.420 --> 01:50:47.260]   of an e-commerce order or the latest job postings.
[01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:50.140]   Of course, Google doesn't want you to leave Gmail
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:51.780]   under any circumstances.
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:52.780]   - I feel like that's what you do.
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:55.300]   - Gee, they almost be as good as inbox.
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:57.820]   - No, I feel like I've had this forever.
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:51:00.900]   Like I do lots of things.
[01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:03.260]   Like I can accept LinkedIn invitations,
[01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:06.740]   I can answer surveys, I can, well, maybe it sends me out.
[01:51:06.740 --> 01:51:09.020]   I don't know, but a lot of things happen in my emails.
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:11.500]   - Let me check the date of this story just to make sure.
[01:51:11.500 --> 01:51:13.780]   Oh yeah, it's 2012.
[01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:16.740]   No, it was last week, 21st.
[01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:20.180]   - Okay, well maybe I'm confused as to how this will look.
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:22.980]   - I gotta admit, it's in your dreams, Stacey.
[01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:26.620]   - No, I love, well, I love it and I hate it.
[01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:28.420]   You know how Jeff, we were complaining how sometimes
[01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:30.980]   when we search in the search bar in Google Assistant,
[01:51:30.980 --> 01:51:32.900]   we can't get back to web pages.
[01:51:32.900 --> 01:51:35.340]   The same thing actually happens when I end up on the web
[01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:39.860]   from Gmail, 'cause when I go back, it sends me back to email.
[01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:41.940]   - Jeff, you didn't like inbox.
[01:51:41.940 --> 01:51:43.180]   Did you go ahead? - No, I did it.
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:44.020]   No, no, I came to love it.
[01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:46.780]   I came to love it because it first you hated it.
[01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:49.780]   - First I couldn't get my head around it.
[01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:50.940]   - What do you mean that to your point?
[01:51:50.940 --> 01:51:51.940]   - Oh, go on, I'm sorry.
[01:51:51.940 --> 01:51:53.140]   - No, just real quick.
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:55.900]   So I was on my phone in Starbucks today
[01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:58.380]   and I'm going through Instagram,
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:01.820]   'cause there's a lady there playing a video on the speaker.
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:03.980]   - Oh, I hate that.
[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:05.580]   - This is me off.
[01:52:05.580 --> 01:52:06.940]   - Aww.
[01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:11.020]   - I had to calm down and I was thinking about going to TikTok
[01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:14.940]   and turning that up just to be me, but I didn't do that.
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:15.780]   I didn't.
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:18.380]   - You could gauge their political affiliation
[01:52:18.380 --> 01:52:21.700]   and pick a loud speech by whoever they would be most likely
[01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:22.700]   to dislike.
[01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:24.820]   - I glared at her, it didn't matter.
[01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:29.820]   Anyway, I was searching for Zen, so I went to Instagram.
[01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:32.220]   And I saw this nice jacket that was on sale.
[01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:33.820]   I thought, "Ooh, I was going to shop."
[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:35.580]   So I click on the shop now,
[01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:38.700]   but I look at a couple of things that my order is up.
[01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:41.300]   Right, so I leave and then I get home and I say,
[01:52:41.300 --> 01:52:43.220]   "Oh, I saw that thing, I'm going to go back to that."
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:44.740]   And then it wouldn't load.
[01:52:44.740 --> 01:52:47.220]   And I go through tons of Instagrams.
[01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:49.460]   It was always going to show me the same ad 20 times.
[01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:50.300]   - Oh, I hate that.
[01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:51.300]   - Can't find the ad.
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:52.140]   Can't find the ad.
[01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:54.460]   Then I thought, "Let me just try this."
[01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:57.380]   Can I find ads that I have seen on Instagram?
[01:52:57.380 --> 01:53:01.300]   Sure enough, you go to your settings,
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:02.900]   you go to your profile and then your settings,
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:04.780]   then you go to ads and ad activity
[01:53:04.780 --> 01:53:07.620]   that will show you what ads you have interacted with.
[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:10.540]   So I can go back to it, I ordered the jacket.
[01:53:10.540 --> 01:53:13.060]   - Wait a minute, where did you do the search on Google?
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:14.660]   - Wait, you bought a jacket off Instagram?
[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:15.660]   - No, on Instagram.
[01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:16.700]   Yeah, I did.
[01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:17.740]   - What are you, 20?
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:21.060]   - No, no, see, this is a beauty of it.
[01:53:21.060 --> 01:53:22.660]   You get ads for 20 year olds.
[01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:26.220]   He gets ads for 60 year old farts trying to act 20, yeah.
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:28.220]   - No, I just, I'm like, I--
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:29.660]   - You wanna, okay, let's see if you can,
[01:53:29.660 --> 01:53:30.500]   let's see if you're proof.
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.740]   - I guess, yeah, the only ads I see are like,
[01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:33.580]   like, one of the A's.
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:34.900]   - I can't let this go,
[01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:38.620]   but you've now put on some very hip glasses.
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:41.220]   - Oh, these are my, these are my vinyl glasses.
[01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:43.580]   These are my old record label glasses.
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:47.340]   - Those are awesome and they go very well with the hair.
[01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:48.700]   - Yes, I love these glasses.
[01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:49.540]   - Why?
[01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:51.020]   - And everyone is supposed to mate.
[01:53:51.020 --> 01:53:51.860]   - Why?
[01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:52.700]   - All right, let's see your jacket.
[01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:54.780]   - Go to JoJoLuster.
[01:53:54.780 --> 01:53:56.420]   - Oh, that's a bad start.
[01:53:56.420 --> 01:53:57.340]   - Yeah.
[01:53:57.340 --> 01:53:58.180]   (laughs)
[01:53:58.180 --> 01:53:59.180]   - Chasing the eye roll.
[01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:01.020]   - That's a bad start.
[01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:03.540]   JoJoLuster.com.
[01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:04.380]   - Yeah.

[01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:10.980]   No, stay hold on.
[01:54:10.980 --> 01:54:12.860]   JoJo, wait a second.
[01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:16.060]   - We could guess your jacket.
[01:54:16.060 --> 01:54:20.540]   - I think you got the one with the, like, clam shell.
[01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:21.380]   - No, the froctans.
[01:54:21.380 --> 01:54:23.420]   - Go to the black Friday sale.
[01:54:23.420 --> 01:54:25.100]   I don't, that's, no, I would never do that.
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:26.260]   - Oh, come on. - Go to the black Friday sale.
[01:54:26.260 --> 01:54:28.660]   - All right, JoJo, cluster.

[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:32.380]   - Black Friday sale. - Black Friday sale.
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:33.220]   - Okay.
[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:34.060]   - Up or left.
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:34.900]   - Good deal, these.
[01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:38.420]   - Multi-pocket felt chores jacket.
[01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:41.020]   - Oh, yeah, I can see you in that.
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:42.260]   That's kind of professional real.
[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:43.100]   - I'm glad.
[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:45.340]   - Those plackets are silly.
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:46.340]   - What plackets?
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:47.660]   - What's a placket?
[01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:48.500]   - Oh, sorry.
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:50.380]   The jacket pockets, the double pockets.
[01:54:50.380 --> 01:54:52.420]   - Oh, you mean the Jotten Tittle?
[01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:54.460]   (laughing)
[01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:58.020]   - That double pocket thing, it's not working for me, Jeff,
[01:54:58.020 --> 01:54:59.740]   but what color did you get it in?
[01:54:59.740 --> 01:55:01.140]   - Black, of course.
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:03.980]   - Oh, okay, and the Mandarin collars your thing?
[01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:06.380]   - I thought so.
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:07.500]   I've never worn this.
[01:55:07.500 --> 01:55:08.900]   I should wear this on the, I actually,
[01:55:08.900 --> 01:55:13.220]   I have the German jacket that has that color.
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:14.900]   Like, you know, it looks like the Indian jacket,
[01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:16.860]   the German jacket, the Bavarian.
[01:55:16.860 --> 01:55:19.940]   I should wear that on the show for our Christmas effort.
[01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:21.840]   - Okay, well, let's see.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:23.940]   Well, this guy has the color.
[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:27.060]   - This face is humoring me, but it's okay, I'll take that.
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:29.860]   - I just, I'm not a fan of this double pocket thing.
[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:31.620]   I'm sorry, it's just, it's messy things.
[01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:32.740]   - It's the pockets you focused on.
[01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:33.820]   I wouldn't have thought that.
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:35.980]   - What's it called?
[01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:36.900]   - The multipocket- - The multipocket-
[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:38.180]   - Felt chores.
[01:55:38.180 --> 01:55:41.100]   I go to go to, they don't have a website or something.
[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:41.940]   I don't know.
[01:55:41.940 --> 01:55:42.780]   - Yeah, they do, go to the website
[01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:45.460]   and then you go to the Black Friday sales there.
[01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:46.300]   - Joe, Joe.
[01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:47.700]   - You had it on your screen.
[01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:49.900]   - No, that was their Facebook page.
[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:53.940]   Oh, here, Leo, let me help you out.
[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:54.780]   I'm gonna put it in here.
[01:55:54.780 --> 01:55:56.220]   - It's true, Joe, I'll find it.
[01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:57.060]   I mean, here we go.
[01:55:57.060 --> 01:55:58.580]   - Better, they get a prior Friday sale.
[01:55:58.580 --> 01:55:59.780]   - I'll go to Black Friday at the top.
[01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:00.620]   - There it is, right there.
[01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:02.780]   - The right there pocket fell, the pocket chores.
[01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:03.620]   - What's the pocket?
[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:05.540]   - I'm gonna do the far right one in black.
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:08.660]   - There is no placket on this jacket.
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:09.500]   - That's it.
[01:56:09.500 --> 01:56:11.860]   - The double pockets is right.
[01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:12.700]   - I don't like that.
[01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:13.980]   You can't really see them on the black,
[01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:17.420]   but why do you have two there?
[01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:18.260]   What's the story?
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:19.780]   - I'm not liking it.
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:20.620]   - What's the story?
[01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:22.020]   - Okay, well, okay.
[01:56:22.020 --> 01:56:23.020]   - And what's it made out of?
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:24.340]   - Sorry, Jeff.
[01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:25.340]   - It felt so--
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:26.900]   - It felt so--
[01:56:26.900 --> 01:56:27.740]   - I made it.
[01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:29.300]   - Oh, it's got three pockets.
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:30.300]   Yeah, Jeff.
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:32.820]   (laughing)
[01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:34.860]   But maybe it'll look awesome in purple.
[01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:36.940]   - It is only 39 bucks, so.
[01:56:36.940 --> 01:56:38.020]   - That's a thing.
[01:56:38.020 --> 01:56:40.180]   - I mean, it's cheap.
[01:56:40.180 --> 01:56:43.260]   - And you read the story about all these Instagram brands.
[01:56:43.260 --> 01:56:45.100]   That was a well reported story.
[01:56:45.100 --> 01:56:46.380]   - Oh, yeah, they're all, what they,
[01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:47.580]   what tell me the, what it is,
[01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:49.340]   they're all the same people or something like that.
[01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:50.980]   - Yeah, they're all the same groups in China,
[01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:51.820]   they figure out like--
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:53.940]   - They're created, yeah, yeah.
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:56.140]   They're fabricated brands.
[01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:56.980]   - Yes.
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:57.820]   - Yeah, who did that?
[01:56:57.820 --> 01:56:58.900]   Was that Taylor Lorenz?
[01:56:58.900 --> 01:57:00.900]   It was one of our favorite.
[01:57:00.900 --> 01:57:03.820]   - It was, was it on Quartz or the Atlantic?
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:04.660]   - Yeah.
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:06.420]   - I don't remember.
[01:57:06.420 --> 01:57:07.260]   - Did you see by the way,
[01:57:07.260 --> 01:57:08.340]   there was a new tech publication,
[01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:10.460]   or we're still in the J-Log, sorry.
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:11.860]   - Oh, back to that.
[01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:13.860]   Oh, I forgot about it. - Back to the J-Log.
[01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:15.420]   (laughing)
[01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:17.140]   - So in email--
[01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:18.860]   - I was gonna ask you-- - I was gonna ask you--
[01:57:18.860 --> 01:57:22.140]   - I started the thread of conversation, which was--
[01:57:22.140 --> 01:57:22.980]   (laughing)
[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:24.780]   - Was one of the things you liked about Inbox,
[01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:27.280]   the auto-complete, the answers?
[01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:29.540]   - Yeah.
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:30.700]   - 'Cause that's going, now it's now in Gmail.
[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:32.700]   - No, it's gonna write all my posts now.
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:34.460]   - It's gonna be in Google Docs.
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:37.780]   - We're gonna bring auto-complete to Twitter, imagine that.
[01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:40.380]   - Ah, so it's pretty accurate.
[01:57:40.380 --> 01:57:42.300]   It knows, it kind of looks at the context,
[01:57:42.300 --> 01:57:44.660]   and it knows kind of what the best answer would be.
[01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:47.140]   - Yeah.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:49.140]   - It's not the experience of it, really.
[01:57:49.140 --> 01:57:52.140]   - I've used it, I feel like I'm cheating.
[01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:55.860]   The other thing is when the Google suggests,
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:57.940]   not just the auto-complete, which is very good,
[01:57:57.940 --> 01:57:59.940]   but also just the response,
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:05.820]   I feel like I just turned somebody over to a robot.
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:08.740]   - If you have a card you've tried to add to Google Pay
[01:58:08.740 --> 01:58:10.660]   and your bank said, "No, we don't support it."
[01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:12.620]   Well, yeah. - Yeah.
[01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:15.160]   - Good news, 62 new banks internationally,
[01:58:16.420 --> 01:58:18.780]   mostly international, but still bank.
[01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:21.580]   This is slow progress, slow progress.
[01:58:21.580 --> 01:58:23.980]   - We're not in the US, there's nothing in US.
[01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:25.620]   - No, I don't see any new banks,
[01:58:25.620 --> 01:58:29.340]   but in the Ukraine, the JSC accent bank, so.
[01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:30.180]   So there's that.
[01:58:30.180 --> 01:58:34.020]   - Google Photos is adding a markup tool
[01:58:34.020 --> 01:58:36.760]   that will let you doodle on the images.
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:43.700]   Google Photos is getting a markup tool
[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:47.740]   that will allow you to doodle on the images.
[01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:49.780]   That's actually handy.
[01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:51.580]   - I was gonna say, why are we making fun of this?
[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:52.740]   I thought this was good.
[01:58:52.740 --> 01:58:54.540]   - Oh, okay, I was like, no, this is good.
[01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:56.340]   - I just heard nothing, so I thought you were.
[01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:57.980]   - He was waiting for some excitement to be surprised.
[01:58:57.980 --> 01:58:59.860]   - There was no reaction whatsoever.
[01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:02.620]   - He was hoping you do that ooh, ooh, stacy thing.
[01:59:02.620 --> 01:59:04.340]   - Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[01:59:04.340 --> 01:59:08.180]   - This isn't New Silicon, you guys, come on.
[01:59:08.180 --> 01:59:10.580]   - Did you know that you can now buy movie tickets
[01:59:10.580 --> 01:59:12.420]   with the Google Assistant on Chrome?
[01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:13.260]   Well, you can.
[01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:14.100]   - I think I did it.
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:15.820]   - This is duplex.
[01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:18.380]   So duplex lets you book restaurants
[01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:21.700]   and now you can purchase movie tickets on the web.
[01:59:21.700 --> 01:59:26.540]   So here's you go, hey, goo, show times for,
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:29.580]   Ford versus Ferrari in San Francisco this weekend.
[01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:30.900]   - Why would you do that?
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:32.300]   - No, everybody says it's a good movie.
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:33.140]   You didn't like it?
[01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:33.980]   - A lot of people are saying it's good.
[01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:35.980]   - People are raving over them, surprised.
[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:37.620]   - I want to see knives out.
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:39.580]   - I want to see knives out too, that looks really good.
[01:59:39.580 --> 01:59:40.660]   - I'm very excited about that.
[01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:42.940]   - I want to see Mr. Rogers.
[01:59:42.940 --> 01:59:44.980]   That looks good too, although Tom Hanks.
[01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:47.380]   - What?
[01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:48.220]   - A little too nice.
[01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:49.060]   - What?
[01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:49.900]   - A little too nice.
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:50.900]   - You read that story, right?
[01:59:50.900 --> 01:59:52.060]   - Yeah.
[01:59:52.060 --> 01:59:54.140]   - It was a very funny New York Times piece,
[01:59:54.140 --> 01:59:56.660]   a profile of Tom Hanks in which they said,
[01:59:56.660 --> 01:59:59.780]   I can't find anything bad about him.
[01:59:59.780 --> 02:00:02.540]   Everything, not only is everything,
[02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:05.540]   he does nice stuff you haven't heard about.
[02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:08.780]   He's like, wait, he's so nice.
[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:10.820]   There was just one time they were shooting
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:13.420]   and somebody couldn't get to the wedding,
[02:00:13.420 --> 02:00:16.580]   so he stopped the shoot and escorted her down the aisle.
[02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:18.020]   That's how nice he is.
[02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:23.420]   Ah, and that's our Google change logs, such as it is.
[02:00:23.420 --> 02:00:26.340]   (dramatic music)
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:28.600]   (sighs)
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:29.420]   - Nope.
[02:00:29.420 --> 02:00:30.260]   - Oh.
[02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:31.100]   - We went to black.
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:32.900]   - Oh, fade to black.
[02:00:32.900 --> 02:00:34.060]   That's how it's supposed to be.
[02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:35.820]   It never gets done right.
[02:00:35.820 --> 02:00:36.820]   - Oh, really?
[02:00:36.820 --> 02:00:37.660]   - No.
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:38.500]   (laughs)
[02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:40.060]   - Oh, I was like, oh, okay.
[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:45.060]   Cepheus, Cepheus, C-F-I-U-S.
[02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:46.740]   Let's talk about them.
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:49.100]   You know, they made their national debut
[02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:52.380]   on Silicon Valley the new season.
[02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:55.340]   - Oh, I thought we were gonna be talking about
[02:00:55.340 --> 02:01:00.140]   the committee for intelligence and not selling.
[02:01:00.140 --> 02:01:01.820]   - That's it, Cepheus.
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:02.660]   - It is?
[02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:03.500]   - Yes.
[02:01:03.500 --> 02:01:04.540]   - Oh, this is about TikTok.
[02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:06.060]   - TikTok.
[02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:07.660]   - I thought it was when you showed that story,
[02:01:07.660 --> 02:01:09.020]   I thought it was like some music group,
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:11.100]   but I'm looking for it. - Well, that's a secondary story
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:12.900]   that's related, but we'll get there.
[02:01:12.900 --> 02:01:17.180]   So the US has Opa-Cepheus, C-F-I-U-S,
[02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:20.740]   which stands for the Committee on Foreign Investment
[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:23.020]   in the United States.
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:23.860]   It's their job.
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:25.380]   They're the ones who said, you know,
[02:01:25.380 --> 02:01:27.820]   you can't buy a Huawei gear, that kind of thing.
[02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:31.740]   It's their job to police all of this.
[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:36.100]   They are looking into TikTok because it's owned by Bike Dance,
[02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:38.620]   which is a Chinese company.
[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:41.580]   They bought Musically, which is a US social media
[02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:43.300]   for a billion dollars.
[02:01:43.300 --> 02:01:46.140]   There is, Cepheus is now reviewing that purchase.
[02:01:46.140 --> 02:01:50.740]   And I think, did they not,
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:53.900]   this might be an old story because I thought I read today,
[02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:57.260]   I believe I did, that Cepheus has decided
[02:01:57.260 --> 02:02:02.260]   that TikTok, Bike Dance, cannot get access to TikTok data.
[02:02:02.260 --> 02:02:06.740]   I feel like-- - Oh.
[02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:10.700]   - Yes, but I'm looking and I don't see that story now,
[02:02:10.700 --> 02:02:12.340]   but I thought I read that today.
[02:02:12.340 --> 02:02:16.460]   So the, of course, the CEO of TikTok has said,
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:18.220]   oh, the Chinese don't tell us what to do.
[02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:19.780]   We're fine. - Yeah.
[02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:21.620]   - They don't have a problem.
[02:02:21.620 --> 02:02:23.460]   - Not accepting facial recognition data
[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:24.660]   on all of your children.
[02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:27.740]   - Nor, except for that one woman who posted something
[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:31.500]   implying that Chinese were somehow imprisoning weager,
[02:02:31.500 --> 02:02:36.220]   Muslims in Xinjiang and got banned from TikTok immediately.
[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:41.140]   I think, honestly, I think, you know what,
[02:02:41.140 --> 02:02:43.140]   I can't find it now, but I think I read that
[02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:47.460]   that TikTok is now going to have to make sure
[02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:48.980]   that no data goes to China.
[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:52.460]   And that was a Cepheus ruling, but I can't find it.
[02:02:52.460 --> 02:02:54.420]   So maybe I just, I might have dreamed it.
[02:02:54.420 --> 02:02:56.020]   It's the kind of thing I dream of.
[02:02:56.020 --> 02:03:02.380]   Yeah, it doesn't, these are older stories.
[02:03:02.380 --> 02:03:05.900]   I don't see the story I thought I was gonna report on,
[02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:09.580]   which was that they have, they're facing scrutiny.
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:14.060]   And rightly so, I mean, do you let your daughter
[02:03:14.060 --> 02:03:14.980]   use TikTok?
[02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:17.660]   - She does a one too, but if she did,
[02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:19.820]   I probably wouldn't mind.
[02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:20.860]   - Yeah.
[02:03:20.860 --> 02:03:25.540]   - I mean, it's mostly silliness and fun.
[02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:28.340]   I mean, she, she, I don't let her upload videos,
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:29.460]   but she doesn't wanna upload videos
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:30.500]   'cause she wants to be a spy,
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:32.700]   so she doesn't want images of her on the internet.
[02:03:33.700 --> 02:03:36.980]   Right now, ByteDance is telling Cepheus that
[02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:40.820]   TikTok data is stored securely in the United States
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:43.940]   and will not be compromised by Chinese authorities.
[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:47.580]   Somebody's watching TikTok.
[02:03:47.580 --> 02:03:52.980]   Oh dear, we've lost Jeff.
[02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:53.820]   - Jeff.
[02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:55.620]   - He's gone down the TikTok hole.
[02:03:55.620 --> 02:03:56.460]   - I love TikTok.
[02:03:56.460 --> 02:03:58.180]   - A dog and a girl are dancing.
[02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:00.060]   (laughing)
[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:02.100]   - Something like my grandpa.
[02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:03.900]   - Oh, here comes Will Smith.
[02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:07.380]   - A dog and a girl are dancing.
[02:04:07.380 --> 02:04:10.180]   So this is the story I was gonna talk about,
[02:04:10.180 --> 02:04:14.060]   a 17 year old posted to TikTok about China's detention camps.
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:17.260]   She's a US citizen, I think.
[02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:22.460]   And she was locked out of her account almost immediately.
[02:04:22.460 --> 02:04:24.620]   So, but the Chinese didn't do that.
[02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:28.660]   - I mean, it's possible that the US people did that
[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:30.380]   because they knew their Chinese overlords would be,
[02:04:30.380 --> 02:04:32.060]   I mean. - That's the problem, right?
[02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:34.660]   - I'm like, does that make it okay?
[02:04:34.660 --> 02:04:35.500]   - No.
[02:04:35.500 --> 02:04:37.020]   - Eric Khan, the head of the company's US Trust
[02:04:37.020 --> 02:04:39.860]   and Safety Team says TikTok does not moderate content
[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:44.020]   due to political sensitivities and did not do so in this case.
[02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:47.060]   He said a previous account of hers had been banned
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:49.860]   'cause she posted a video referencing Osama bin Laden.
[02:04:49.860 --> 02:04:54.900]   Okay, and that she's using the same phone number.
[02:04:54.900 --> 02:04:57.900]   She can use the account on other devices.
[02:04:57.900 --> 02:04:59.620]   Eh, we'll see.
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:00.460]   We'll see.
[02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:01.300]   - I'm really very popular.
[02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:02.220]   I did not know this.
[02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:05.980]   I'm not a Faroza Aziz.
[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:07.540]   - So, at Google Newsguys,
[02:05:07.540 --> 02:05:11.020]   to where I was last week, this week, last week,
[02:05:11.020 --> 02:05:14.540]   somebody, chat about rules, like essentially say,
[02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:16.740]   who put in a really good rundown of TikTok.
[02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:18.300]   I put a session up saying,
[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:21.140]   "I was TikTok, I don't know anything about it."
[02:05:21.140 --> 02:05:24.500]   This guy had a whole rundown of demos from it.
[02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:27.980]   They showed one where somebody did something stupid
[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:31.020]   with stupid hair and he was doing it very serious.
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:34.300]   And then you could add on to the TikTok, right?
[02:05:34.300 --> 02:05:38.500]   So then to the left of it is a guy who's holding a mop
[02:05:38.500 --> 02:05:41.740]   and the handle goes right straight through
[02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:44.820]   as if the mop is the guy's hair, okay?
[02:05:44.820 --> 02:05:49.260]   And then somebody else makes one with an extension
[02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:52.260]   of the handle and it goes on and on and on for like 40 of these.
[02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:54.780]   People are adding on and creating
[02:05:54.780 --> 02:05:56.500]   in some pretty hilarious ways.
[02:05:57.860 --> 02:06:00.460]   Students are making history, TikToks,
[02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:01.300]   all kinds of stuff.
[02:06:01.300 --> 02:06:04.620]   It's kind of, it's like Vine, it's a creative medium.
[02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:07.420]   In fact, if it weren't a Chinese company,
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:09.980]   I think everybody would say this is great.
[02:06:09.980 --> 02:06:12.100]   - Yeah, musically was awesome when it was musically,
[02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:15.100]   but it's only the Chinese company part, yeah.
[02:06:15.100 --> 02:06:17.980]   - Apparently anything, a guy is jumping up and down
[02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:19.780]   off a mat onto another store.
[02:06:19.780 --> 02:06:21.900]   Okay, excuse me, I got a one on this.
[02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:25.140]   - Did you not, have you not been on TikTok until now, Jill?
[02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:25.980]   - No, apparently he did.
[02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:28.380]   - Yeah, but just not, I just kind of forget about it.
[02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:29.220]   And then--
[02:06:29.220 --> 02:06:32.100]   - Oh, I'm like, what is happening here, Jeff?
[02:06:32.100 --> 02:06:35.220]   - According to Reuters, US Army cadets have been told
[02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:37.740]   not to use TikTok in uniform.
[02:06:37.740 --> 02:06:40.780]   - Mm.
[02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:43.380]   - I don't know what that really, I guess they don't want.
[02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:46.860]   - Here's a Bugatti made out of Lego.
[02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:49.140]   - Okay, fine, okay, we've lost Jeff.
[02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:50.220]   - Okay, next door.
[02:06:50.220 --> 02:06:52.460]   - He's in the TikTok hole, it's gone.
[02:06:52.460 --> 02:06:55.140]   - I'm gonna thank you guys to end this soon
[02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:55.980]   because--
[02:06:55.980 --> 02:06:56.900]   - Yeah, we're gonna run it, wrap it up.
[02:06:56.900 --> 02:06:59.340]   But first I wanna mention this woman named Stacey Higginbotham
[02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:03.220]   whose story about Mozilla's holiday device list.
[02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:04.860]   - Oh, hey, I wrote that.
[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:06.620]   - Oh, you, tell us.
[02:07:06.620 --> 02:07:08.100]   - But I forgot to publish it on Monday,
[02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:09.740]   so I had to do it today.
[02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:13.100]   - So this is a list of connected consumer devices
[02:07:13.100 --> 02:07:16.700]   that have bad security practices.
[02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:18.020]   So I think this is a good idea.
[02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:22.060]   Do you think that the list is reliable?
[02:07:22.060 --> 02:07:24.460]   - So what I wrote in that story is actually that this
[02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:28.220]   is a wonderful sign that our debate about secure IoT devices
[02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:31.700]   is maturing because last year in the year prior,
[02:07:31.700 --> 02:07:35.380]   Mozilla was like, they had a very binary, this is good,
[02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:36.500]   this is bad. - Right.
[02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:38.060]   - This year they talk about,
[02:07:38.060 --> 02:07:39.660]   they have a much more nuanced thing
[02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:41.900]   and they also applied their like security,
[02:07:41.900 --> 02:07:43.860]   like good security practices to it.
[02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:46.180]   So every device is evaluated based on,
[02:07:46.180 --> 02:07:49.180]   does it have some basic security things associated with it,
[02:07:49.180 --> 02:07:52.060]   like over the air updates, forcing new passwords, et cetera.
[02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:55.740]   And then the other part is telling people,
[02:07:55.740 --> 02:07:58.020]   it has a microphone, it has this.
[02:07:58.020 --> 02:08:01.100]   And it talks about the company security practices
[02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:03.780]   and then gives you like,
[02:08:03.780 --> 02:08:06.700]   so their spectrum now is not good or bad,
[02:08:06.700 --> 02:08:09.660]   it's not at all creepy and like--
[02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:12.620]   - They got a little emoji and I'll show you.
[02:08:12.620 --> 02:08:15.740]   It says, "Be smart, shop safe, see little emoji."
[02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:17.740]   So these devices are not creepy,
[02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:21.540]   but as I scroll down, they get the emoji,
[02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:25.780]   and the smile starts, this was a little creepy,
[02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:28.100]   the smile starts to disappear and then it goes,
[02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:32.380]   oh, oh, oh, oh, these are really creepy.
[02:08:32.380 --> 02:08:34.140]   But now as some of this, you know,
[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:35.900]   just 'cause well, MacGoogle makes that one,
[02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:37.180]   so it's like the Chromecast,
[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:38.460]   well that's gotta be creepy.
[02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:40.020]   - It's not because Google does it,
[02:08:40.020 --> 02:08:42.860]   it's because it has, you know, a microphone
[02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:44.980]   or something in it that can be used.
[02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:45.980]   So if you click through, click,
[02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:47.780]   the Ring Video Doorbell is actually a good one to click.
[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:50.100]   - It's super creepy according to them.
[02:08:50.100 --> 02:08:53.100]   - And what's good is, instead of just looking at the emoji,
[02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:57.700]   read this 'cause then you can see what you don't like about it.
[02:08:57.700 --> 02:09:00.620]   It does have security updates, it has strong password,
[02:09:00.620 --> 02:09:03.380]   it's unknown whether it manages vulnerabilities,
[02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:05.980]   it has a privacy policy.
[02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:07.700]   - And then go down past this, keep going,
[02:09:07.700 --> 02:09:10.060]   keep scrolling, keep scrolling, keep going.
[02:09:10.060 --> 02:09:13.900]   This can't snoop on me is really what I think is excellent,
[02:09:13.900 --> 02:09:15.420]   is it tells you what it has
[02:09:15.420 --> 02:09:18.260]   and then it talks about how it handles your data.
[02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:21.660]   So this is allowing people to have a really nuanced view
[02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:23.380]   of how they wanna handle things
[02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:24.500]   and it gives them information
[02:09:24.500 --> 02:09:26.580]   that companies don't even always give them.
[02:09:26.580 --> 02:09:30.140]   And I think this is gonna provide a forcing function
[02:09:30.140 --> 02:09:33.500]   for companies, as more people ask these questions,
[02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:36.060]   they're gonna have to start coming up with answers.
[02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:36.900]   And I imagine-- - I don't wish
[02:09:36.900 --> 02:09:39.540]   they didn't use the creepy, not creepy.
[02:09:39.540 --> 02:09:40.540]   - Yeah. - I've always--
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:41.660]   - I think that is. - That's a little bit
[02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:42.820]   of a value judgment.
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:45.420]   I've always said that the key is,
[02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:48.060]   you should know, you should get these details,
[02:09:48.060 --> 02:09:49.260]   that's great.
[02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:52.140]   And then you make the decision whether you think,
[02:09:52.140 --> 02:09:54.900]   you know, this is something I can live with or not.
[02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:58.540]   - Well, you could do that in the voting and seeing results.
[02:09:58.540 --> 02:10:00.100]   - Yeah. - No, no, no.
[02:10:00.100 --> 02:10:01.380]   - And I'd like this, what could happen
[02:10:01.380 --> 02:10:02.580]   if something went wrong?
[02:10:02.580 --> 02:10:04.580]   That's stuff that I think tech companies
[02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:06.020]   should be doing on their own.
[02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:09.540]   - Oh, so this creepy, not creepy, comes from these votes.
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:11.820]   - I don't think it does. - Oh, okay.
[02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:13.820]   - But you can vote and see the results
[02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:15.820]   and you'll see how people feel about it.
[02:10:16.660 --> 02:10:19.020]   - Yeah. - So you could argue
[02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:21.420]   with Mozilla by saying, I don't think this is creepy at all.
[02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:22.260]   - Right.
[02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:24.580]   Yeah, I wish they didn't make the value judgment,
[02:10:24.580 --> 02:10:27.020]   but I do think it's great to get this information.
[02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:31.340]   And so use the, it's foundation.mozilla.org
[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:35.180]   and it's their privacy not included guide,
[02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:37.740]   70 connected products.
[02:10:37.740 --> 02:10:39.660]   - And I think a value judgment isn't terrible.
[02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:40.500]   That's just me.
[02:10:40.500 --> 02:10:44.100]   I think if you, I feel like it's fine to make a value judgment
[02:10:44.100 --> 02:10:45.540]   as long as you can back it up.
[02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:49.020]   And I think they did a good job this year of backing it up.
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:50.900]   - Yeah, but I mean, if some of it is like,
[02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:53.300]   well, it's an Apple watch, so that's not creepy,
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:54.220]   but it's cool. - But they don't,
[02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:56.100]   they don't actually say that at all.
[02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:59.220]   If you notice, they talk about why they think Apple,
[02:10:59.220 --> 02:11:02.180]   I mean, they explain why they didn't judge it as creepy.
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:03.020]   - Wow.
[02:11:03.020 --> 02:11:06.140]   - I'm sorry, would you like to just hate it?
[02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:07.300]   You just hate it with you.
[02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:10.380]   - Well, I don't like the creepy, not creepy.
[02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:12.700]   I think just the information, please,
[02:11:12.700 --> 02:11:15.100]   because that's a value judgment.
[02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:16.700]   - But anyway, it's good that they did this.
[02:11:16.700 --> 02:11:19.420]   - But people come to the internet for value judgments.
[02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:23.060]   When I report, you know, straight up facts and news,
[02:11:23.060 --> 02:11:24.500]   it's not as popular with people
[02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:26.860]   when I explain what it means and why it matters.
[02:11:26.860 --> 02:11:27.860]   - Yeah, no, I know.
[02:11:27.860 --> 02:11:30.940]   Creepy is such a value judgment.
[02:11:30.940 --> 02:11:33.500]   - Is it because someone called you creepy
[02:11:33.500 --> 02:11:34.580]   when you were younger?
[02:11:34.580 --> 02:11:35.580]   (both laughing)
[02:11:35.580 --> 02:11:37.100]   - Is there anything that's more or is it?
[02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:39.700]   - Yeah, yeah, it's the moral panic thing.
[02:11:39.700 --> 02:11:41.740]   In this case, I agree with you, Jeff.
[02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:47.300]   - Oh, let's see, what else here?
[02:11:47.300 --> 02:11:52.300]   Russian dairy farmers are trying VR goggles on their cows.
[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:55.780]   - I think the Russians punked us with this one.
[02:11:55.780 --> 02:11:57.540]   - I don't think this is true.
[02:11:57.540 --> 02:11:58.700]   - I don't think so either.
[02:11:58.700 --> 02:12:00.580]   - But CNN does.
[02:12:00.580 --> 02:12:03.780]   - They did put a camera on a beluga whale, so who knows?
[02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:07.700]   - According to the Ministry of Agriculture,
[02:12:07.700 --> 02:12:10.940]   they're just trying to make the cows happier.
[02:12:12.260 --> 02:12:15.540]   - Okay, I'm gonna say, I'm gonna call that one creepy.
[02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:19.020]   (both laughing)
[02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:20.340]   - They're all agree with you.
[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:21.980]   - They're, that's creepy.
[02:12:21.980 --> 02:12:26.980]   And the results are in on the Uber fatality in Arizona.
[02:12:26.980 --> 02:12:32.900]   Brad Templeton has a good piece in Forbes.
[02:12:32.900 --> 02:12:37.340]   Brad is a totally great guy on autonomous vehicles.
[02:12:37.340 --> 02:12:40.780]   The National Transportation Safety Board said,
[02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:43.260]   the problem really was the vehicles human operator,
[02:12:43.260 --> 02:12:46.060]   the safety operator who was watching a video,
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:48.460]   but also that the automatic driving system
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:52.140]   had not been programmed to watch Alfred pedestrians
[02:12:52.140 --> 02:12:54.220]   outside of crosswalks.
[02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:59.420]   Yeah, that's kind of a little bit of, you know,
[02:12:59.420 --> 02:13:01.260]   primary blame though on the safety drivers
[02:13:01.260 --> 02:13:03.940]   and the attention, contributory causes
[02:13:03.940 --> 02:13:06.900]   where Uber's lack of safety culture,
[02:13:06.900 --> 02:13:08.540]   poor monitoring of safety drivers,
[02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:12.380]   and lack of countermeasures for automation complacency.
[02:13:12.380 --> 02:13:13.860]   - Oh, you don't want that.
[02:13:13.860 --> 02:13:18.340]   - They put tertiary blame on the pedestrians
[02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:19.820]   impaired crossing of the road
[02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:21.220]   and the lack of good regulations
[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:23.460]   at the Arizona and federal levels.
[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:26.740]   She had a methadrine and a marijuana in her bloodstream
[02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:28.900]   and, you know, she was probably intoxicated
[02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:30.700]   and crossed in the middle.
[02:13:30.700 --> 02:13:32.940]   But the problem of course is that the crosswalks
[02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:35.220]   in that area are so far apart
[02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:38.060]   that I met people cross in the middle all the time.
[02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:41.900]   - Yeah, I, you know, I don't blame the drunk person
[02:13:41.900 --> 02:13:43.380]   when I hit them with their jaywalking.
[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:45.020]   Even though they are drunk a jaywalking.
[02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:45.860]   - You shouldn't be in.
[02:13:45.860 --> 02:13:47.940]   (laughs)
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:55.340]   The flaw in their object tracking system,
[02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:57.540]   which had it forget any past learnings
[02:13:57.540 --> 02:13:59.700]   every time it reclassified an object,
[02:13:59.700 --> 02:14:01.820]   Brad says is a bit of a flaw.
[02:14:01.820 --> 02:14:05.500]   Technical problems, sign of poor design and coding,
[02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:06.780]   not the cause of the accident,
[02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:08.980]   but definitely a contributory.
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:13.980]   So it's kind of what we thought it was, basically.
[02:14:13.980 --> 02:14:17.380]   It's kind of exactly as it was described.
[02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:22.300]   Let's take a break and then would you like to
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:25.940]   get some picks and numbers and things like that?
[02:14:25.940 --> 02:14:27.220]   - Yep. - Okay.
[02:14:27.220 --> 02:14:28.060]   - Yes.
[02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:30.500]   - We should mention triangulation is off this week.
[02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:31.620]   We do have a new show.
[02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:32.780]   I think we'll put up on the feed,
[02:14:32.780 --> 02:14:33.940]   but we won't be recording anything
[02:14:33.940 --> 02:14:35.420]   'cause they have to Thanksgiving.
[02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:37.580]   We all got to go shopping on Black Friday.
[02:14:37.580 --> 02:14:40.060]   Do you shop on Black Friday, Jeff?
[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:41.140]   - No. - No.
[02:14:41.140 --> 02:14:42.420]   - No. - No.
[02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:43.540]   Do I look like a fool?
[02:14:43.540 --> 02:14:45.780]   - Stacey, do you shop on Black Friday?
[02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:46.620]   - Of course I do.
[02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:47.460]   If there's a deal,
[02:14:47.460 --> 02:14:49.940]   but I don't actually go in person anywhere.
[02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:52.420]   Jeff, why do you say, Jeff?
[02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:53.900]   He's like, do I look like a fool?
[02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:56.020]   I assume that's 'cause he's leaving his house.
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:14:58.740]   - Those aren't good deals?
[02:14:58.740 --> 02:15:00.900]   Well, we'll find out.
[02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:01.780]   Let's talk a little bit,
[02:15:01.780 --> 02:15:03.260]   but I want to take a break right now
[02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:04.700]   and talk about my browser.
[02:15:04.700 --> 02:15:07.340]   Maybe you've noticed I use Brave.
[02:15:07.340 --> 02:15:09.260]   I've been using Brave for a long time.
[02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:10.860]   Brave is everything you want in a browser.
[02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:14.460]   It's based on Chrome, but it's been de-googled.
[02:15:14.460 --> 02:15:16.340]   They take out the privacy invasions.
[02:15:16.340 --> 02:15:18.260]   They add ad blocking.
[02:15:18.260 --> 02:15:20.300]   They add tracker protection.
[02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:22.060]   It's a next generation web browser
[02:15:22.060 --> 02:15:24.860]   built by a team focused on privacy and performance.
[02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:27.500]   It's based on the Chromium code base,
[02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:30.860]   but frankly, with privacy by default, it is much better.
[02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:32.260]   So you get all the benefits of Chromium,
[02:15:32.260 --> 02:15:34.380]   including the Chrome extensions.
[02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:36.180]   I immediately install LastPass
[02:15:36.180 --> 02:15:37.580]   and the other Chrome extensions that I like,
[02:15:37.580 --> 02:15:39.820]   but I no longer have to install ad blocking
[02:15:39.820 --> 02:15:42.780]   or script blocking or anti-tracking extensions,
[02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:45.460]   and you don't guess what happens when you do all that.
[02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:49.980]   You get fast, up to six times faster than the competition.
[02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:52.140]   Brave is not like any other browser.
[02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:53.500]   It gives you unmatched speed,
[02:15:53.500 --> 02:15:55.620]   online privacy that blocks trackers,
[02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:57.340]   a better user experience,
[02:15:57.340 --> 02:15:59.100]   and none of this costs you anything.
[02:15:59.100 --> 02:16:01.060]   In fact, you don't even have to get rid of your old browser.
[02:16:01.060 --> 02:16:04.020]   Just all I do is invite you to go to brave.com/twittin'
[02:16:04.020 --> 02:16:05.220]   download brave,
[02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:06.820]   and the best thing to do with brave
[02:16:06.820 --> 02:16:08.620]   is to go through the settings,
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:12.620]   because you'll see all the things brave will do for you,
[02:16:12.620 --> 02:16:17.140]   and that's really so nice.
[02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:19.140]   You can turn off trackers.
[02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:20.540]   If you don't want notifications,
[02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:21.380]   you can turn those off.
[02:16:21.380 --> 02:16:23.340]   You don't want flash, you can turn that off.
[02:16:23.340 --> 02:16:24.580]   You have absolute control.
[02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:28.220]   Brave is available on Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS,
[02:16:28.220 --> 02:16:29.660]   and I put it on everything.
[02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:31.180]   I even use it on iOS.
[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:33.660]   You can't make it to your default browser on iOS,
[02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:36.780]   but that's the browser I use whenever I open a browser.
[02:16:36.780 --> 02:16:37.620]   It feels just like Chrome.
[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:38.540]   It looks just like Chrome.
[02:16:38.540 --> 02:16:42.860]   It's just, it doesn't have all that other stuff.
[02:16:42.860 --> 02:16:46.100]   You can import all your bookmarks with one click,
[02:16:46.100 --> 02:16:47.940]   and they do something else I really like.
[02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:50.460]   You know, we've mixed feelings about ad blocking.
[02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:53.420]   On the one hand, it speeds up your browsing considerably.
[02:16:53.420 --> 02:16:55.220]   That's a lot of data you're not downloading.
[02:16:55.220 --> 02:16:57.180]   It reduces your data conception on mobile,
[02:16:57.180 --> 02:16:58.940]   which makes a big difference.
[02:16:58.940 --> 02:17:01.660]   It eliminates the security hazards
[02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:04.060]   too of a lot of advertising,
[02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:07.180]   but it also eliminates revenue for some of our favorite sites.
[02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:10.820]   And you know, I like ad supported content.
[02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:12.100]   That's what we do.
[02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:13.580]   So here's what Brave does, and I love it.
[02:17:13.580 --> 02:17:15.740]   Brave rewards you by having advertisers
[02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:16.940]   pay you for your attention.
[02:17:16.940 --> 02:17:20.180]   You get privacy respecting Brave ads.
[02:17:20.180 --> 02:17:22.820]   They're very, they're nice.
[02:17:22.820 --> 02:17:23.660]   They don't get in your way.
[02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:26.500]   They just show up as notifications.
[02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:27.580]   Once you op it into those,
[02:17:27.580 --> 02:17:30.260]   you get rewarded for every ad you see with bat tokens.
[02:17:30.260 --> 02:17:32.620]   Bat stands for basic attention tokens.
[02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:34.420]   You can also buy bat,
[02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:39.580]   and then award bat, tip the sites you visit.
[02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:42.100]   So this way you get to support content creators,
[02:17:42.100 --> 02:17:44.240]   continue to access premium content,
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:47.900]   give publishers their fair share of web revenue,
[02:17:47.900 --> 02:17:51.100]   but improve your privacy, improve your speed.
[02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:51.940]   I love it.
[02:17:51.940 --> 02:17:54.860]   Brave is exactly what I've been looking for.
[02:17:54.860 --> 02:17:57.340]   Founded by Brendan Eich and Brian Bondi,
[02:17:57.340 --> 02:17:59.300]   Brendan was the co-founder of Mozilla,
[02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:01.340]   the creator of JavaScript.
[02:18:01.340 --> 02:18:03.060]   And there's a lot of features.
[02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:04.660]   I like to highlight the private window,
[02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:05.740]   which actually is private.
[02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:07.540]   It's not private on most other browsers.
[02:18:07.540 --> 02:18:10.300]   The private window on Brave uses Tor,
[02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:13.140]   so you really do have privacy and anonymity.
[02:18:13.140 --> 02:18:14.420]   I'll ask as you give it a try.
[02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:16.020]   Go to brave.com/twit.
[02:18:16.020 --> 02:18:18.460]   Please do go to that site, not just brave.com.
[02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:19.660]   You get the same experience,
[02:18:19.660 --> 02:18:22.100]   but if you go to brave.com/twit,
[02:18:22.100 --> 02:18:23.420]   the little thing will go ding ding,
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:24.260]   and then I'll let them know
[02:18:24.260 --> 02:18:26.180]   that you saw it on Twig, which we want.
[02:18:26.180 --> 02:18:28.700]   Brave.com/twit.
[02:18:28.700 --> 02:18:30.340]   Yesterday was about big tech.
[02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:32.660]   Today is about us.
[02:18:32.660 --> 02:18:36.060]   Download the best browser ever, brave.
[02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:38.940]   Brave.com/twit.
[02:18:38.940 --> 02:18:40.500]   I interviewed their security director,
[02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:42.900]   B-Crypt on triangulation a few months ago.
[02:18:42.900 --> 02:18:45.220]   I had already been using Brave for a long time,
[02:18:45.220 --> 02:18:46.500]   but she was very impressive
[02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:49.740]   and really kind of confirmed my thoughts.
[02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:52.140]   This is the browser you want.
[02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:54.460]   Stay seat your thing of the week.
[02:18:57.060 --> 02:18:59.420]   I'm super excited, you guys.
[02:18:59.420 --> 02:19:02.020]   I have Philips Hue light bulbs all around my house.
[02:19:02.020 --> 02:19:02.860]   Yes.
[02:19:02.860 --> 02:19:07.860]   And so I purchased the smart button.
[02:19:07.860 --> 02:19:11.900]   This is a magnetic button.
[02:19:11.900 --> 02:19:12.740]   Yeah.
[02:19:12.740 --> 02:19:14.940]   It sticks to things like this.
[02:19:14.940 --> 02:19:15.780]   Okay.
[02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:18.500]   My microphone or anything else you would like.
[02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:20.660]   And behind me,
[02:19:20.660 --> 02:19:23.380]   Oh, it's a light switch.
[02:19:23.380 --> 02:19:26.140]   It acts as my light, it controls my light bulbs.
[02:19:26.140 --> 02:19:27.580]   So long press.
[02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:28.420]   I don't know if I said that.
[02:19:28.420 --> 02:19:30.220]   I actually need this.
[02:19:30.220 --> 02:19:31.060]   You do.
[02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:32.140]   And it's only 1999.
[02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:32.980]   Oh, nice.
[02:19:32.980 --> 02:19:35.700]   So you get a bunch of different pressing options.
[02:19:35.700 --> 02:19:36.620]   It's very nice.
[02:19:36.620 --> 02:19:37.620]   You can see the size.
[02:19:37.620 --> 02:19:38.900]   It's good size.
[02:19:38.900 --> 02:19:40.460]   Looks like half a marshmallow.
[02:19:40.460 --> 02:19:43.740]   And it's well designed.
[02:19:43.740 --> 02:19:46.820]   So Philips also makes a dimmer switch
[02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:49.580]   that I have hated for years because it's ugly.
[02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:50.980]   It is hideously ugly.
[02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:52.900]   This is very aesthetically pleasing.
[02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:54.500]   You can toss it.
[02:19:54.500 --> 02:19:56.220]   My husband's now like,
[02:19:56.220 --> 02:19:58.260]   we need one for the wall.
[02:19:58.260 --> 02:20:00.660]   He's like, can we also set one up for my bedside table
[02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:02.540]   and one up for your bedside table?
[02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:03.900]   And I was like, okay.
[02:20:03.900 --> 02:20:05.500]   So it has a wall.
[02:20:05.500 --> 02:20:06.340]   Or with some.
[02:20:06.340 --> 02:20:07.180]   Yeah.
[02:20:07.180 --> 02:20:08.460]   It has a wall mount.
[02:20:08.460 --> 02:20:11.100]   And will it work as a dimmer if I twist it on the wall mount?
[02:20:11.100 --> 02:20:12.020]   It does not.
[02:20:12.020 --> 02:20:14.180]   So that is a disappointment.
[02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:15.660]   But it's only $20.
[02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:17.420]   So I will say to you,
[02:20:17.420 --> 02:20:20.260]   and oh, and Hugh is also at some point in time
[02:20:20.260 --> 02:20:21.820]   that I did not notice,
[02:20:21.820 --> 02:20:23.500]   my long press, you won't realize this
[02:20:23.500 --> 02:20:25.060]   because it's the time of day it is.
[02:20:25.060 --> 02:20:26.900]   But I have set it.
[02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:30.100]   So it's to the optimal daylight for this time of day.
[02:20:30.100 --> 02:20:32.180]   So optimal for my circadian rhythm.
[02:20:32.180 --> 02:20:34.700]   So in the morning when I press this,
[02:20:34.700 --> 02:20:36.940]   it turns a bluish white light.
[02:20:36.940 --> 02:20:41.020]   In the evening when I press it, it turns a dimmer light.
[02:20:41.020 --> 02:20:41.860]   Oh, I like that.
[02:20:41.860 --> 02:20:42.860]   Or a jeer light.
[02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:43.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:45.180]   And you just have,
[02:20:45.180 --> 02:20:47.060]   there's a setting that you just toggle.
[02:20:47.060 --> 02:20:48.820]   And it's super easy.
[02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:52.140]   I no longer have to like worry about anything.
[02:20:52.140 --> 02:20:53.860]   This is kind of the missing piece to Hugh,
[02:20:53.860 --> 02:20:55.700]   to be honest with you.
[02:20:55.700 --> 02:20:56.540]   Is it needed?
[02:20:56.540 --> 02:20:57.380]   Well, they did have--
[02:20:57.380 --> 02:20:58.220]   I have the motion sensor.
[02:20:58.220 --> 02:20:59.420]   Of course, you can do this with the phone,
[02:20:59.420 --> 02:21:02.340]   but what you need is a simple on/off switch.
[02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:03.300]   Yeah, and they did,
[02:21:03.300 --> 02:21:05.100]   I mean, that's why they put out the dimmer,
[02:21:05.100 --> 02:21:06.700]   but it was so ugly.
[02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:08.820]   And it looked like something like
[02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:10.260]   you 3D print in your basement.
[02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:11.780]   And this is very aesthetically pleasing
[02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:13.620]   and it feels nice in the hand.
[02:21:13.620 --> 02:21:15.300]   So you still have all the other Hugh features.
[02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:16.380]   You could talk to your assistant
[02:21:16.380 --> 02:21:17.660]   and have it do other stuff.
[02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:19.980]   But this is what I need because often what I do,
[02:21:19.980 --> 02:21:21.900]   'cause I have a motion sensitive lights,
[02:21:21.900 --> 02:21:24.140]   is I'll have to get up and go over to the motion sensor
[02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:24.980]   and go like that.
[02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:26.580]   So all the lights come on.
[02:21:26.580 --> 02:21:28.620]   And what I really want is just to be able to press a button.
[02:21:28.620 --> 02:21:30.180]   And the problem, of course, is
[02:21:30.180 --> 02:21:32.380]   I'm sitting on the couch where there's no light switch nearby.
[02:21:32.380 --> 02:21:34.380]   I could put it right next to me and leave it.
[02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:35.220]   Exactly.
[02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:36.500]   Yeah, that's great.
[02:21:36.500 --> 02:21:38.100]   Or you get your lazy bastards,
[02:21:38.100 --> 02:21:40.740]   you can get up and go to the light switch on the wall,
[02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:42.220]   like real people do.
[02:21:42.220 --> 02:21:44.780]   Well, so I will say in my bedroom,
[02:21:44.780 --> 02:21:46.260]   there are no light switches.
[02:21:46.260 --> 02:21:47.940]   There are no lights in the ceiling.
[02:21:47.940 --> 02:21:50.900]   So it's our bedside table lamps or any other lamp.
[02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:53.100]   So if we stick this on the wall,
[02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:54.940]   now we have a light switch on the wall,
[02:21:54.940 --> 02:21:56.380]   which is nice when you walk in.
[02:21:56.380 --> 02:21:57.340]   So it's not a dark room.
[02:21:57.340 --> 02:21:59.740]   Huge bulbs are still much more expensive, though.
[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:01.540]   There are cheaper LED bulbs out there.
[02:22:01.540 --> 02:22:02.740]   I guess that's just the way--
[02:22:02.740 --> 02:22:04.420]   Here's where Black Friday's gonna come in.
[02:22:04.420 --> 02:22:06.380]   Yes, and yes, this is an exit.
[02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:08.660]   But if you're already all in on the huge system,
[02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:11.940]   this controls, and this can control any number of hue lights.
[02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:13.060]   Yeah, I have the hub.
[02:22:13.060 --> 02:22:15.700]   So once you spend the money on the hub and a few bulbs,
[02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:18.020]   then getting a bunch more bulbs.
[02:22:18.020 --> 02:22:19.380]   I guess the prices have dropped,
[02:22:19.380 --> 02:22:20.580]   especially for the white.
[02:22:20.580 --> 02:22:23.100]   Yeah, like the white ambiance.
[02:22:23.100 --> 02:22:24.340]   Yeah.
[02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:25.620]   But yeah, I'm gonna have to do this.
[02:22:25.620 --> 02:22:28.140]   I'm gonna have to stock up on the hues.
[02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:29.220]   'Cause now that I have a switch,
[02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:33.260]   that's all I was missing was an easy way to turn it on.
[02:22:33.260 --> 02:22:34.620]   So I don't have to fire up the phone,
[02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:36.300]   just turn on my lights.
[02:22:36.300 --> 02:22:38.420]   Nice pick.
[02:22:38.420 --> 02:22:40.500]   Mr. J. J. Jarvis.
[02:22:40.500 --> 02:22:43.500]   So this is why I was not very responsive about Black Friday,
[02:22:43.500 --> 02:22:45.020]   'cause I was my number.
[02:22:45.020 --> 02:22:45.860]   Oh.
[02:22:48.140 --> 02:22:50.580]   This year for the first time,
[02:22:50.580 --> 02:22:52.840]   says an organization I can't get up here.
[02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:58.100]   Majority of shoppers will do their holiday shopping online.
[02:22:58.100 --> 02:22:59.100]   Yeah, of course.
[02:22:59.100 --> 02:22:59.940]   The new price.
[02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:00.780]   This is a credit card.
[02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:02.100]   So price, waterhouse, Cooper's.
[02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:03.100]   That's right.
[02:23:03.100 --> 02:23:04.700]   That makes perfect sense.
[02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:05.540]   It does.
[02:23:05.540 --> 02:23:06.380]   It does.
[02:23:06.380 --> 02:23:08.860]   And the whole Cyber Monday Black Friday dichotomy,
[02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:09.700]   that's ridiculous.
[02:23:09.700 --> 02:23:10.860]   It's just everybody's going online.
[02:23:10.860 --> 02:23:12.740]   Well, that was a vestige from back
[02:23:12.740 --> 02:23:14.860]   when people didn't have computers at home.
[02:23:14.860 --> 02:23:16.980]   They had to go into the office to do their online shopping.
[02:23:16.980 --> 02:23:19.620]   I think silly, or they didn't have fast connections at home.
[02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:21.260]   Now they have faster connections at home
[02:23:21.260 --> 02:23:23.700]   than they do at the office, in most cases.
[02:23:23.700 --> 02:23:25.380]   So good, all right.
[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:26.020]   So--
[02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:27.460]   So that's that.
[02:23:27.460 --> 02:23:28.300]   Yes.
[02:23:28.300 --> 02:23:31.460]   Now, what do you think of Politico, Jeff?
[02:23:31.460 --> 02:23:32.620]   You're the media.
[02:23:32.620 --> 02:23:34.620]   They drive me crazy sometimes.
[02:23:34.620 --> 02:23:36.260]   They do some stuff well.
[02:23:36.260 --> 02:23:39.180]   I like them early on.
[02:23:39.180 --> 02:23:42.460]   There was some criticism that they might be a little slanted,
[02:23:42.460 --> 02:23:44.140]   but I think they've been--
[02:23:44.140 --> 02:23:45.420]   So the reason I ask is,
[02:23:45.420 --> 02:23:47.580]   and this isn't going to do you any good until next year,
[02:23:47.580 --> 02:23:51.340]   but they have decided to launch a tech vertical.
[02:23:51.340 --> 02:23:53.100]   Yeah, I did a colleague of mine at the school
[02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:54.100]   told me that, and I put it up there,
[02:23:54.100 --> 02:23:55.740]   because I didn't know that.
[02:23:55.740 --> 02:23:57.980]   And they've hired some real good talent.
[02:23:57.980 --> 02:24:02.860]   I put that in the note next to the item in the rundown.
[02:24:02.860 --> 02:24:05.260]   It's called Protocol.
[02:24:05.260 --> 02:24:08.340]   They must have spent a pretty penny for protocol.com.
[02:24:08.340 --> 02:24:09.740]   Yep.
[02:24:09.740 --> 02:24:12.020]   And it will launch early next year.
[02:24:12.020 --> 02:24:14.020]   So who do they have?
[02:24:14.020 --> 02:24:15.940]   Hold on here. I'm trying to get back to it.
[02:24:15.940 --> 02:24:17.340]   Yeah.
[02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:22.220]   So the publisher Richard Albriton says,
[02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:23.780]   "The president will be Tammy Wincup,
[02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:25.260]   executive editor Tim Greve.
[02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:26.260]   Don't know these names.
[02:24:26.260 --> 02:24:29.020]   VP general manager Bennett Richardson."
[02:24:29.020 --> 02:24:31.340]   Emily Dreyfus, writer for Wired,
[02:24:31.340 --> 02:24:33.420]   is editorial director Joanna Perlstein.
[02:24:33.420 --> 02:24:34.260]   Oh, I know.
[02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:36.060]   Also Wired is managing editor.
[02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:36.900]   Oh, that is.
[02:24:36.900 --> 02:24:39.180]   Vivian Tran, who worked the Wall Street Journal
[02:24:39.180 --> 02:24:40.580]   as head of digital.
[02:24:40.580 --> 02:24:42.780]   Oh, so they've been hiring on Lyft.
[02:24:42.780 --> 02:24:46.860]   Deal book and New York Times as newsletter editor.
[02:24:46.860 --> 02:24:50.180]   Mario Aguilar, Gizmodo's former deputy editor,
[02:24:50.180 --> 02:24:52.100]   a senior editor.
[02:24:52.100 --> 02:24:52.820]   And all around.
[02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:55.460]   I mean, those are some...
[02:24:55.460 --> 02:24:57.540]   What's interesting is it doesn't look like
[02:24:57.540 --> 02:25:00.020]   it's going to be an end gadget or even a Wired.
[02:25:00.020 --> 02:25:00.860]   No.
[02:25:00.860 --> 02:25:03.540]   It says, "A new media company focused on the people,
[02:25:03.540 --> 02:25:06.700]   power and politics of tech."
[02:25:06.700 --> 02:25:08.540]   So kind of like this show,
[02:25:08.540 --> 02:25:11.460]   it'll be interesting to see what they do.
[02:25:11.460 --> 02:25:14.460]   'Cause we don't do shiny things.
[02:25:14.460 --> 02:25:15.740]   We do what it all means.
[02:25:15.740 --> 02:25:17.740]   Except for nice Kickstarter musical things.
[02:25:17.740 --> 02:25:18.900]   Well, that was pretty shiny.
[02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:20.380]   Well, Stacy, you just heard Stacy's...
[02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:21.820]   And Hugh...
[02:25:21.820 --> 02:25:22.820]   What do we do both?
[02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:23.660]   What do we do both?
[02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:25.860]   We do both, but we're not cheerleaders for technology.
[02:25:25.860 --> 02:25:26.700]   No, we're not.
[02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:27.700]   We are here to talk.
[02:25:27.700 --> 02:25:31.700]   No, no one can debate policy like Stacy Higginboth.
[02:25:31.700 --> 02:25:32.940]   That's right.
[02:25:32.940 --> 02:25:35.340]   And no one has a deeper knowledge of it.
[02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:39.300]   And of course, then there's Jeff Jarvis and me.
[02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:40.420]   But we got you, Stacy.
[02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:43.700]   And that's all I got that going for us.
[02:25:43.700 --> 02:25:46.980]   All right, I'm fading on you guys because...
[02:25:46.980 --> 02:25:48.420]   Goodbye. You know what's happening?
[02:25:48.420 --> 02:25:49.260]   I...
[02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:50.100]   This is...
[02:25:50.100 --> 02:25:50.940]   What?
[02:25:50.940 --> 02:25:51.780]   Thanksgiving this time.
[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:54.940]   Oh my God, she's starting her gantt shout out of the reporter's notebook.
[02:25:54.940 --> 02:25:56.420]   Oh my God.
[02:25:56.420 --> 02:25:58.260]   Well, you know, we're still talking, but...
[02:25:58.260 --> 02:25:59.340]   Stacy Higginbotham.
[02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:01.860]   Stacy at IOT.com.
[02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:03.180]   Subscribe to the newsletter.
[02:26:03.180 --> 02:26:04.820]   Follow her and Kevin Tofel.
[02:26:04.820 --> 02:26:05.980]   They've got a great podcast.
[02:26:05.980 --> 02:26:08.100]   She's Gigastacey on the Twitter.
[02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:11.060]   Who knows what hair she'll wear next week.
[02:26:11.060 --> 02:26:12.540]   I love the vinyl glasses.
[02:26:12.540 --> 02:26:14.260]   Those are awesome.
[02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:15.580]   They're called vinylize.
[02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:16.580]   In each one's different.
[02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:18.340]   It's made from different records.
[02:26:18.340 --> 02:26:20.180]   It's made from records.
[02:26:20.180 --> 02:26:21.460]   Yeah, they're old vinyl records.
[02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:23.300]   And then the inside is different too.
[02:26:23.300 --> 02:26:25.420]   These are tortoiseshell, but sometimes they're bright red.
[02:26:25.420 --> 02:26:26.260]   So good.
[02:26:26.260 --> 02:26:27.260]   Sometimes they're so cool.
[02:26:27.260 --> 02:26:28.180]   So with it.
[02:26:28.180 --> 02:26:29.100]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:26:29.100 --> 02:26:31.100]   It's great to see you.
[02:26:31.100 --> 02:26:31.940]   Good luck.
[02:26:31.940 --> 02:26:33.100]   Happy Thanksgiving.
[02:26:33.100 --> 02:26:34.500]   Happy Thanksgiving.
[02:26:34.500 --> 02:26:36.780]   So we are doing a very special.
[02:26:36.780 --> 02:26:38.220]   So I'm very excited about it.
[02:26:38.220 --> 02:26:39.940]   A holiday episode of Twit.
[02:26:39.940 --> 02:26:42.660]   All women, except for me.
[02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:43.500]   And I may not.
[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:44.420]   I may have to get a...
[02:26:44.420 --> 02:26:45.260]   I don't know.
[02:26:45.260 --> 02:26:46.700]   I'm going to have to get a replacement.
[02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:48.060]   I'll get a wig at least.
[02:26:48.060 --> 02:26:49.540]   Bring a wig with you, Stacy.
[02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:50.380]   So...
[02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:51.700]   I'm not letting you wear my wigs.
[02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:52.700]   (laughs)
[02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:55.180]   So yeah, it's probably for the best.
[02:26:55.180 --> 02:26:59.020]   Stacy and Mary Jofoli.
[02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:02.300]   And who else I forgot?
[02:27:02.300 --> 02:27:03.460]   Sing it?
[02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:04.300]   Oh yeah, of course.
[02:27:04.300 --> 02:27:05.140]   Lori Gill.
[02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:07.780]   So we'll be all in studio.
[02:27:07.780 --> 02:27:09.140]   And what we've decided to do,
[02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:12.860]   we've hired Anthony Nielsen as our bartender.
[02:27:12.860 --> 02:27:15.140]   I told him we're something hot.
[02:27:15.140 --> 02:27:17.100]   And he's going to be mixing drinks.
[02:27:17.100 --> 02:27:19.500]   I know Stacy likes gin.
[02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:21.980]   Lori likes whiskey.
[02:27:21.980 --> 02:27:24.900]   And Mary Jo likes beer.
[02:27:24.900 --> 02:27:28.300]   So he's going to be mixing drinks for all three of you.
[02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:30.140]   We're hoping to get you slosh.
[02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:32.100]   You're going to bring a bunch of women on the show
[02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:33.100]   and get them drunk.
[02:27:34.820 --> 02:27:38.180]   When you say it that way, it sounds a little creepy.
[02:27:38.180 --> 02:27:41.460]   I'm just, I was not aware of the more than the aspect.
[02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:42.900]   But you say it that way, Stacy.
[02:27:42.900 --> 02:27:46.780]   I'm like, oh, our holiday show is always a little lubricated.
[02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:48.700]   Now, and we're trying to decide on the topic.
[02:27:48.700 --> 02:27:50.300]   And I was thinking, now normally what we do
[02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:52.500]   is we talk about the year and gone past.
[02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:53.620]   That sounds so boring.
[02:27:53.620 --> 02:27:56.020]   I thought it'd be kind of fun to do a show.
[02:27:56.020 --> 02:27:57.580]   Tell me what you think of this.
[02:27:57.580 --> 02:28:00.260]   We'll pretend it's the year 25, 25.
[02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:02.140]   And what a year that was.
[02:28:02.140 --> 02:28:06.340]   And we could talk about the stories of 2025.
[02:28:06.340 --> 02:28:08.180]   So there's prep.
[02:28:08.180 --> 02:28:09.020]   That's too much work.
[02:28:09.020 --> 02:28:10.020]   Tender.
[02:28:10.020 --> 02:28:10.700]   That's too much work.
[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:12.340]   Well, no, I'm just--
[02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:14.900]   Or just doing the normal show in studio.
[02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:15.900]   So I'm like, just look at the way.
[02:28:15.900 --> 02:28:17.860]   Sit around and have fun.
[02:28:17.860 --> 02:28:19.020]   No, I can't wait.
[02:28:19.020 --> 02:28:22.460]   Three of my favorite people, Lori Gill, Stacy Higginbotham.
[02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:23.540]   Mary Jo Foley.
[02:28:23.540 --> 02:28:24.620]   We try to do something different.
[02:28:24.620 --> 02:28:26.780]   Jeff's been here in years past.
[02:28:26.780 --> 02:28:29.180]   The next day, that night we're going
[02:28:29.180 --> 02:28:30.940]   to do our staff Christmas party.
[02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:34.300]   So I won't get you too inebriated.
[02:28:34.300 --> 02:28:36.060]   It's like, I might only have one drink.
[02:28:36.060 --> 02:28:37.500]   Yeah, one's fine.
[02:28:37.500 --> 02:28:38.540]   It should be a lot of fun.
[02:28:38.540 --> 02:28:40.500]   So that'll be-- we're going to stream that live.
[02:28:40.500 --> 02:28:41.180]   People can watch it.
[02:28:41.180 --> 02:28:44.860]   And then it'll be, what date is that going to air on?
[02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:48.060]   It's the Sunday after Christmas, 26th.
[02:28:48.060 --> 02:28:49.140]   OK.
[02:28:49.140 --> 02:28:50.900]   It's Sunday after Christmas.
[02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:56.140]   It'll be a special, very special holiday twit.
[02:28:56.140 --> 02:28:58.140]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis, Professor of Journalism.
[02:28:58.140 --> 02:28:59.140]   Thank you.
[02:28:59.140 --> 02:29:02.340]   At CUNY, you can also find his work at BuzzMachine.com
[02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:03.020]   and on Medium.
[02:29:03.020 --> 02:29:06.740]   And of course, both Stacy and Jeff are always
[02:29:06.740 --> 02:29:09.460]   welcome here on Wednesday.
[02:29:09.460 --> 02:29:10.380]   It's really nice to do this.
[02:29:10.380 --> 02:29:13.820]   We do a twig every Wednesday at 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern,
[02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:15.500]   2130 UTC.
[02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:17.700]   Tune in and watch live at twit.tv/live.
[02:29:17.700 --> 02:29:18.940]   You can listen live as well.
[02:29:18.940 --> 02:29:21.820]   If you're doing that chat at irc.twit.tv,
[02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:23.620]   you can also download on-demand versions
[02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:25.980]   of the show at twit.tv/twig.
[02:29:25.980 --> 02:29:27.500]   But the best thing you could do for me
[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:29.180]   is to subscribe that way.
[02:29:29.180 --> 02:29:30.980]   You'll get to show the minute it's available
[02:29:30.980 --> 02:29:35.180]   and we'll get a little bounce in the podcast app that you use.
[02:29:35.180 --> 02:29:38.220]   So pick your favorite podcast app and subscribe that way.
[02:29:38.220 --> 02:29:40.460]   You won't miss a single episode.
[02:29:40.460 --> 02:29:41.060]   Thanks, everybody.
[02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:43.860]   We'll see you next week on twig.
[02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:46.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:29:46.900 --> 02:29:50.260]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:29:50.260 --> 02:29:52.840]   (upbeat music)
[02:29:52.840 --> 02:29:53.920]   [odeo sound]
