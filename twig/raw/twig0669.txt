[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   But it's coming.

[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   38 degrees for our friends above the 49th parallel.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   That's very hot.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And it's a little cooler now.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I think it's only 90.

[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   What was that?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   That's one of the new thing you can do from the new camera.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   He's doing a little trick.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Alright we'll talk about your new camera and your little camera tricks in a second.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   But first noxious things I can do is pretty obnoxious.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   [laughing]
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   First let's say hi to hands on photography host.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   He's sitting in the dark ladies and gentlemen at Pruitt.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And then the lights come in.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   There it is.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   We forced him to do that.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Put that TV slash HOP.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Hey can I say how much fun I had last week doing your book club Stacey?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Oh thank you.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   I had so much.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I was so glad that you came and I can't wait to.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Oh I guess you can't find out tomorrow.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Can I come some more?
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Yeah you are always welcome at the book club.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Oh good because I actually nobody would ever let me be in their book club.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   [laughing]
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Why was it?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   It's actually like Neil Stevenson.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Because I talk too much.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And I'm afraid I did that again on Thursday but.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Did you get picked for the basketball teams?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   What?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   You scream?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   [laughing]
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   No I'm a nerd of course not.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I was always last picked.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I don't know on that one.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Yeah I was always last picked but I don't get how that's germane.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Or you don't get picked for the book club?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   No I lost them both ends.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I didn't get the nerd pick either.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Yeah you're right it's kind of rude.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   That.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   That is chosen for both so I can't.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   [laughing]
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Yeah I bet you were.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Are you tall?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Are you tall?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Yes I was five nine when I was in seventh grade.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Yeah that's tall.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So I was less impressive as to.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Do we know yet what book we're going to do?
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You're going to do next?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   No we've got to wait.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   You've got until Friday to vote.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Where is the vote taking place?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   It is in our discord on the book club channel.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Oh okay.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Actually I could probably pin it if I didn't pin it up.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   No no that's alright.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It's a so use the reaction boats buttons on this vote to post.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   So waist tied binty or Clara in the sun.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Clara in the sun is pulling away.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   But that's because you sold it.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   You sold it.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   By the same guy.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   It's also short yeah.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Yeah well this other one was so long.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   That was like eight book clubs worth of.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Stevenson.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.320]   Alright good alright so we will we will continue the vote until Friday and then announce the
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.000]   next Stacey's book club.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   They're always sci-fi right?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.480]   Yeah it's a sci-fi book club but we do try to pull in authors from like different parts
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:57.000]   of the world or different points of view so it's we really try to get a variety in there.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   It is for club trip members I'm sorry so you have to go to if you're not a club trip member
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.900]   twig.tv/clubtwig.
[00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.640]   You do get a lot of other benefits but this is one of the benefits is the Stacey's book
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.040]   club.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.360]   And then you go to the book club but conversation and aren't discord and you can vote there
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.840]   and do so quickly.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.240]   That was really fun anyway.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.240]   Thank you for inviting me.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.760]   Thank you for letting me be in there.
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.360]   You didn't you didn't talk too much is I'm assuming that's what you're thinking but I
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.640]   was like the fact that you sold me on given the book another try.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.400]   You did only you know what else you did.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.400]   Last.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.320]   Was it last week that you did?
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.320]   Go ahead.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.360]   Oh no I was going to say last week you did you convinced me to stick with cloud cuckoo
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.920]   land and I did and you were right.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.920]   Yay!
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.680]   But yes.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.480]   I knew I knew the sci fi I don't want to I don't want to rule it for anybody but there's it
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:03.480]   turns into sci fi which is what's so neat about it because the future stuff is there.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.280]   I don't think I convinced you because I haven't read it.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.840]   Oh okay that was Jeff.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.840]   Jeff you were right.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.840]   Holy.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:17.280]   Get the history books out folks and add a line.
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.560]   So I should add that to my book subscriptions as well.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.000]   I think actually it's on my wish list I think yeah it is because of you.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   So that's worth reading.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   All right good.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.080]   Well Stacey I'm impressed you stuck with it because that's that's yeah I was a little
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.960]   dubious for a while too but then I then I got into it.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:41.600]   Yeah after I got the 12% the way through it then I was like boom I'm in it.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.200]   Sometimes books are like that you have to read enough.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.640]   Oh I have two new credits.
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.640]   It's the 22nd.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.640]   Oh I love.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.640]   Oh happy day.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.360]   My favorite time of the month when I get two new credits unaudible.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.960]   Oh yay.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.000]   Good now I guess I'll add Cloud Cuckoo land and oh no but I got a wait because I don't
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.520]   know yet what the book club book will be.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.000]   You can always buy extra credits as I do constantly.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.520]   Yeah you're a reader.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.160]   I am actually reading and I highly recommend it to anybody who's a geek.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.080]   The biography of John von Neumann.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.800]   I've read a little bit of that to you.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.920]   I figured it was because it was it was on the list.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.360]   It's quite good.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.360]   Thank you.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.280]   That explains things very well which is which a lot of physics.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:34.640]   Yeah a lot of physics in it but it's also I mean he is in many respects the father of
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.640]   modern computing.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.640]   We often call our computers von Neumann machines.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:44.120]   The Man from the Future by Ananyo Bhattacharya.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:49.560]   He's computing and I always think of him as a hardware side of computing.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:50.560]   That's right.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:56.360]   And then Claude Shannon as computing is in information science and computer science.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:02.400]   But von Neumann also designed the atom bomb and more particularly the hydrogen bomb.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.680]   He did a lot of stuff.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.000]   He was very political so it's very interesting and it's a good story.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.800]   I think Bhattacharya makes a good case for him being kind of like from Mars.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.880]   Like so brilliant that he's almost an alien.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:24.160]   There was a whole it was interesting because there was a whole group of Hungarians from
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:28.640]   the 20s who were like brilliant mathematicians.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.560]   There was this whole renaissance coming out of Hungary and he kind of addresses this a
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.320]   little bit why was it the schooling?
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.280]   It was the cultural environment most of them were Jewish.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.320]   You know of course a lot of them had to flee because of the after during World War II.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.480]   It's very interesting story.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.360]   That's where Andy Grove came from one of the founders of Intu.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.160]   Can I recommend a few war books?
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.360]   I've had two successes in a row here.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:07.520]   Always interested.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:16.280]   Trust by Heronandias from the Gilded Age period and a story told from four perspectives and
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.280]   the audio book has four narratives.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   Nice.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.280]   It's quite an eight.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.280]   Nice.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.200]   The Gilded Age is fascinating.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.880]   I find the Gilded Age fascinating.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.880]   I do too.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.880]   I do too.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.880]   That's why.
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.000]   I'm working on so that's why I've been researching.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:38.240]   The early part of the 20th century particularly in the US and the Rockefellers and the Morgans
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.240]   and the Asters.
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.240]   That are the HBO show.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.680]   I actually like the HBO show but you're right there's more to it.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.120]   It's basically Eith Wharton.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.120]   Just read Eith Wharton.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.120]   Go ahead.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.120]   What was the other one?
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.120]   City on fire by Dan Winslow.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.880]   Not my kind of novel normally but it's really good.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.880]   It's a crime novel.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.960]   Oh I left on Winslow.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.960]   He's so great.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   This new one is good.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   City on fire.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   It's amazing.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.480]   And the audio version is really good at the accents and voices.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.600]   And coming from Jersey I can tell you even though it's Massachusetts it's kind of the
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.680]   same thing.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.720]   Sentence by Daniel Genis, G-E-N-I-S.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.280]   Guy who was a schmuck and he got sentenced to 10 years in prison and he read a thousand
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.240]   books while he was there.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.240]   10 years?
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.240]   A thousand books.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.240]   I might skip that one.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.240]   Wait did you read the sentence?
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.240]   Oh wow.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.240]   By Louis Erdrich.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.240]   Erdrich is sitting the sentence.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.120]   No I haven't yet.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.120]   That's really good.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.120]   Newspaper access.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.720]   The newspaper access.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:43.800]   A little more historical here but it's the bad newspaper moguls in the day who were against
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.560]   FDR and created the war.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.840]   I suddenly realized why I have so many books in my wish list.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.800]   It's your fault.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.320]   It's totally your fault.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.760]   I just looked at Candy House I talked about last week.
[00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:57.760]   Clearly.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.760]   Which book?
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.680]   Candy House I talked about last week was very good.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.240]   I added that one.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.840]   And then I just started meet me by the fountain.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   A history of the mall.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.840]   Oh god.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.080]   I find fascinating.
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.440]   I have that.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.440]   I just that came in from the library for me.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.640]   I'm really excited about that one.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.640]   Yes.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.360]   Because I'm a child in the 80s and 90s.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.320]   It's more academic in the sense that it's thorough and so on but it's going to be an
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.320]   interesting topic.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.320]   Wow.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.320]   Mall's gone.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.520]   Yeah they're now open area shopping kind of plus.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.880]   I mean there still is the mall of America and stuff.
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.880]   I mean they exist.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.720]   There's still one in Santa Rosa.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.720]   Oh they're still around.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:44.320]   Did I tell you my story about almost a partner in a mall in New Jersey.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.320]   What?
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   Guy came to me and he said I gotta talk to you.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   I gotta talk to you.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.320]   I read your book.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.920]   We gotta find out what Google would do about shopping.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   And he's a brilliant guy.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.280]   He used to be a president of a major mall company and he had a whole new concept for
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.880]   malls which is that it wasn't for fulfillment.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.680]   It was for marketing.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:12.320]   And I was with the media store in New Jersey and politics got in the way.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.960]   You probably have better off.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:21.280]   Well, this book begins with the digital.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.960]   Disaster that it is the mall because they made it into a standard mall and it's a mess.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.960]   It's going to go bankrupt.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:35.320]   But his ideas I think not wrong which is we no longer need stores to go get stuff.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.920]   It's really they're going to be more place to get to learn about things, more of a social
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   experience.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.920]   Really?
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.320]   That's rescued best by now.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.720]   So you go in there and you have a cup of coffee and.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.880]   No you don't have a cup of coffee but the brands rent space.
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.880]   People there.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.880]   Oh, that's right.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.880]   That was so the beta store pioneered that they actually sit shut down because COVID just killed.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.880]   Really?
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.880]   I didn't know that.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880]   It was really sad.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.880]   Like probably four months ago I want to say they shut down.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.880]   February.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.880]   The idea was oh, there you go.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.880]   Oh, that was for.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:16.880]   Wow.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.880]   Wow.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.600]   Yeah, it was really a bummer because I really loved going in there and like playing with
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.120]   stuff and seeing all this kind of crazy stuff.
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.920]   But did you ever buy anything there?
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:26.920]   That's the problem.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:33.080]   I thought well, no, because their whole business model was actually predicated on marketing,
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:38.840]   like the stuff like the companies would pay to show off their stuff.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.840]   For the real estate.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:45.600]   And then they pivoted to like video online video sales during the pandemic like live video
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.600]   demos.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.760]   And that didn't do too great.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.040]   But yes, I did buy things there.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.040]   One more.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.360]   Are you fans of libraries?
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.360]   Do you like libraries?
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.400]   I already have that book.
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.600]   Is it the library by Susan Orlean?
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.600]   No, the library by Andrew Pettigree and Arthur Devine.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.200]   Yes, I ordered it because of you.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   To me.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.200]   And I have.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.200]   I have my academic here.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.200]   And yet to read it.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.200]   No, I've read it.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.080]   I haven't finished it yet to finish it because I had to read something else.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.080]   But.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.080]   Pronation shop.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:26.640]   But you know, between you and you, Jeff and Andy and Aco, that's my whole wish list.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.080]   But the library of fragile history, I do have it.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.680]   And I still have 14 hours and 21 minutes left.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.160]   But I really, no, I did.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.560]   I started it and I really liked it.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.160]   I just, like I said, it's a fascinating.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.520]   There's too many good books and I, unlike you, I don't have time to read as much as you
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.520]   do.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.520]   I don't want driving.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.520]   When you drive places.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.240]   Sound drive places.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.240]   I miss that.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.240]   That's what gets me.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.760]   I know you don't have a lot of time yet.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:56.120]   You're still able to get all of these books in that just blows my mind and makes me feel
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.120]   a lot.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.280]   Audio books for me is the savior because I can listen while I'm doing other stuff.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.120]   That's the thing I do audio books.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.400]   That's pretty much the only way I can consume books.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:10.400]   And I'll try to do it while I'm out on the walk or doing some chore or shooting or what
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.120]   have you and still end up not having as much time as you should.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.840]   You shouldn't actually read books.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.320]   You should listen to podcasts.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.480]   I realized we're really shooting ourselves in the foot.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.440]   In fact, I got an email from somebody who says, "I haven't heard you showing a long
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.440]   time because you introduced me to Audible and frankly I don't know."
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.920]   And I knew that though.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.480]   I mean, you know, look, I'm not going to...
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.120]   I listen to a lot of podcasts.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.280]   I usually tweet what I'm listening to to try to help spread the gospel of podcasts.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.120]   We live in...
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.240]   There can't have ever been a moment in history where there was this much content available
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.240]   in our fingertips.
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.240]   I know there never has been anything like this.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.240]   Absolutely not.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.240]   Absolutely.
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.240]   Not even close.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:59.400]   I'm working on a project about magazines and it occurs to me that writing used to be
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.680]   something that was a special skill.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.280]   Not forever did writers get paid.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:06.520]   But once they started getting paid and became commercial and became companies and so on
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:11.880]   and so on, that's going away because now in a world of abundance the value of writing
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.520]   is going toward an ill.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:20.400]   Yeah, especially when Lambda and GPT-3 starts writing.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   They take over and...
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.880]   Have you played with GPT-3?
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:24.880]   No.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.880]   Have you?
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.880]   You can.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.880]   Did you know that?
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.880]   It's on the rundown.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.120]   From OpenAI, this is one of the artificial intelligences.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.680]   We've been talking about Dali from OpenAI, which you have to get on a list to play with,
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.280]   but you can play with GPT-3 now.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.280]   How do you do that?
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.480]   I don't know where they put it.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.480]   They have a guy.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.760]   I don't know the number for you.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.760]   You can search.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.760]   That's all right.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.520]   I'm just looking at OpenAI.org.
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.440]   It's 156-157.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.080]   Thank you.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.040]   There was a TikTok of a guy who got GPT-3 to take an SAT test question.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.720]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.720]   Here let's watch that.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.440]   Oh, I don't have audio turned on.
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.440]   Here we go.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.960]   And I still don't have audio.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.960]   What?
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.960]   What are you?
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.960]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   Okay, play it now.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.320]   We're going to find out if an AI can take the SAT.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.560]   In the past year or so, you may have heard of a tool called GPT-3.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.080]   That's what we're going to use.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:26.160]   It sounds more complicated than it is, and let me show you why it's not.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.160]   This is the GPT-3 OpenAI.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.240]   By the way, this guy is...
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.520]   My mom's vision of what a nerd looks like.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.520]   I just...
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.520]   Just say.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.720]   This is it, right there.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.440]   You're friendly, especially before beginners.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.880]   You guys describe what you want it to do, and it doesn't.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.680]   Which is great because I'm way too lazy to actually code this.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.600]   Anyway, taking the SAT means answering questions.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.080]   So we're going to find some.
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.680]   OpenAI is really good at reading.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.680]   So we're going to give it some reading.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.720]   This is one of those two minutes 51-second TikToks.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.600]   I think you practice the guy that the college board put up.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.200]   And then we're going to see a change before you answer the questions.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.040]   So what happens?
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.360]   He puts in reading comprehension.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.360]   He gives it two sample questions to make sure that it knows what it's supposed to do.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.640]   It didn't do the ones in order because the first two were A and A is the answer, so he
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.640]   didn't do that.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:18.120]   Then he puts in a question, the next question that gets it right and does it in format.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.120]   It does it right.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.120]   I went on and played with it.
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.120]   Wow.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:30.200]   And so I blaze Aguera Ialkas from Google responsible AI team.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.200]   And I'm sorry, the Atlantic, yeah.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.760]   In the Economist last week.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:42.400]   So I took his scenario from that and I asked GPT-3 similar questions.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:47.560]   This is the one where he did the daisy and the three kids in the playground and all that
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.560]   stuff.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:49.560]   Exactly.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.560]   So I asked GPT-3.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.200]   And so Jeff talks a lot about moral panic and media coverage of the internet.
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.000]   Stacey always disagrees.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.480]   Who's right?
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:03.000]   And then let's say there is no right or wrong answer to this question.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.080]   It depends on each person's opinion, which sounds very much like Stacey.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.080]   Okay.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.720]   That's all right.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:14.680]   So you can do this at beta.openai.com/playground.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.640]   You do have to create an account which I'm doing right now.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   And then--
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.640]   Sign up with Google.
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:26.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.000]   And then you can give it prompt and then have it.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.640]   And then it wants to know, I'm exploring a personal-- I'm a journalist.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.640]   There you go.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.640]   No, no, no, don't do that.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.640]   Then they need to go back, go back, go back.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.640]   Go back.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.640]   Hey.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.640]   Oh, you know.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.640]   Oh, I'm suddenly not a journalist.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.640]   I'm exploring personal use.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.640]   Whoo.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.640]   This is journalism.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.880]   That was a close one.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.200]   Now I'm a lying journalist.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.680]   Thank you very much.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.680]   All right.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.160]   Did we just do that on air?
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.160]   That's hysterical.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.200]   Just say journalism.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.600]   You know, they always tell me, you never, when you're crossing into a country, say
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.120]   on your passport that you're a journalist, that's just, you know, you're going to get
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   arrested and turn into a Gulag.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.720]   We're crossing the AI Silicon Valley, which is another country.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.960]   Is it different Gulag, I guess, but it's the same thing.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.280]   Well, that was fun.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.760]   Probably better than the top story of the week, which is Ilani Elani Elani Elani Elani Elani.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.200]   Let's talk about instead of Elon.
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.280]   We'll get to Elon later.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.440]   Let's talk about VidCon, which is Wednesday.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.840]   Information article.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.920]   It's just all right.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.560]   It starts today in beautiful Southern California Anaheim.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.320]   Jeff, you're the one who turned me on to VidCon.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.440]   This is where you discovered the new media is going.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.440]   Gun.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.440]   Great guns.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:49.680]   Created by the Greens, really for YouTube creators initially, it's now really a TikTok.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:52.760]   Should have sold to VidCon in the meantime too.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.160]   And I noticed Jim Laderback is no longer running it.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.160]   He's a consultant.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.160]   He left in April.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.160]   Tiktakers, Tiktakers everywhere writes the information.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.920]   Terms, terms, everywhere is my...
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:15.000]   Although YouTube's still there, and although Susan Wojcie is not, they sent a couple of
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   other people...
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Oh wow.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   ...the lower down.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   That's new.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I had a talent development at Snap.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   She's still at YouTube.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   She's done great.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   She's long-chevity.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   They're thrilled with her.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Are you kidding?
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   She's done great.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.840]   But it is no longer YouTube's rodeo.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:40.200]   And there are considerable warnings that the recession is going to cause a little bit of
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.120]   a shrinkage for creators.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.640]   And I think that that's probably the case.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:53.600]   Although they say, "It's interesting," they quoted Ezra Cooperstein, who is president
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.600]   of Mr. Beast's talent management company.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:03.160]   He says, "Buckle up," because tough times are ahead for content creators.
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   Is the ad business going to go down one?
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.040]   Yeah, because advertisers are taking longer than usual to ink sponsorship deals.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:14.520]   Brands are thinking twice, and some are canceling sponsorship deals.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.680]   And they're pointing out that the recessions put a lot of people out of work who will then
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.720]   turn to content creation.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.360]   How competition?
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.080]   So there'll be a lot more competition.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:28.480]   Some people are going to try to pursue content creation, says Jenny Lou, a partner at early
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.280]   stage fund MacVenture Capital.
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.480]   This could be a vital new channel for them to grow a career.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:41.800]   So expect a little bit of a squeeze in the creator economy going forward.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.200]   Recession is not good.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   No.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.200]   I have been the rundown.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   Go ahead, Slicia.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:51.320]   Oh, no, I was going to say, I feel like we dodged a bullet with COVID, so we got a few
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   extra years in there.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:57.120]   Because really, I thought like everything was going to go to hell once the pandemic started
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.120]   two years ago.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.120]   This is just long COVID.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:03.680]   I'm like, so, you know, we got a little bit of a break.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.560]   We suffered considerably from COVID initially, and it came back around, started to come back
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:11.640]   around fourth quarter of last year.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:18.640]   But I think that it's, you know, with a very high inflation, collapsing stock market and
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:24.280]   recession looming, you know, I think that it's probable that it'll get tough again.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.960]   You know, this tries to be nuts these days.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.440]   We've got clear causes for all of that.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.400]   We've been through a pandemic.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.800]   We miraculously did well.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   Employment is phenomenal.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.040]   Supply chain is messy for all kinds of reasons, including consumption.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.200]   And there's a war defending democracy.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.560]   And rather than talking about the necessary sacrifices we need to make for that and the
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:56.440]   blessing we have of having survived so far with a million people lost survived.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:01.600]   So I use that with caution, a pandemic that the economy is still working and so on.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.440]   Instead, don't whine, whine, whine, all gases a little more.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.680]   It's just driving me nuts.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   So a lack of generosity.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.320]   World War II, people were, you know, metal drives.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.080]   They were planning victory gardens, buying restaurants.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.080]   We had ration books.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.240]   They knew that this was a sacrifice, that this was tough, but there was this feeling
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.040]   in the country of this is what you do.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.960]   You hold together, you hang tight.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:32.120]   In the 73 oil embargo, which I covered as a cover reporter, my first big story in the
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.080]   business, we had rationing and price controls.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.360]   You could only get $3 worth of gas for a time.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.400]   There were huge lines.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.240]   The gas price was decided is now.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.680]   Everything's better than then.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:48.600]   People, did people in the gas price?
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.080]   Dollar getting into old men.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.080]   I know.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.000]   They were a member when they...
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   I wish she...
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   Dollar, you're gowing.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.720]   Actually, I remember when gas was 33 cents a gallon.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.320]   That's how old I am.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.080]   Holy cow.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.880]   And you could make a phone call for a nickel.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880]   Nickel.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:13.400]   Elon Musk says he wants Twitter to become the WeChat of the Western world.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.080]   Elon met last week with employees of Twitter.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:25.240]   Incredibly rude because he called it on his phone.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.240]   It was just so rude.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   You ready to give me my 40 hours in the office?
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.240]   Oh my gosh.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.400]   That's what you're going to do.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.400]   Well he did say...
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.640]   He calls it in.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.560]   He phoned it in.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.760]   He phoned it in.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:39.760]   And let me see.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.200]   I had an image.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:45.200]   This is not the image of him on his phone, although...
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   That's pretty good.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.400]   He's kind of like that.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   Somewhere somebody...
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.840]   Because I imagine this was a closed meeting, but you know, if you have 8,000 employees
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.680]   on it, they're going to...
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.840]   Maybe it was Casey Newton on platformer that had it.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:03.160]   But he said, "You know, if you're an excellent employee, maybe we can think about you not
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:08.160]   working on-prem."
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.760]   If you're an excellent employee.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.680]   He has plans to be as big as WeChat.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.480]   WeChat has a billion monthly active users.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.200]   He says, "Twitter should have a billion monthly active users.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:30.120]   Don't know exactly how he plans to get those extra 750 million, but that's his goal.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.760]   WeChat is in a country with a lot more people too.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.840]   It's a platform for so many other things.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:37.840]   Exactly.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.800]   Well he said that.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.600]   He said, "You live on WeChat in China because it's so helpful, so useful to daily life.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.760]   I think if we achieve that or come even close to that with Twitter, it would be a success.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:48.760]   So does he...
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.480]   Is he going to add WeChat like features?
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.040]   That would be interesting.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:57.360]   I don't know if I would pay for things via Twitter or want to buy things on Twitter.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.480]   I mean, you sort of see that happening.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.520]   You can buy things through TikTok or Instagram and there are people who buy things through
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.520]   Instagram.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:11.080]   Everything.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.080]   Everything.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.280]   I don't even like Instagram anymore.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.120]   It's become a video platform.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:23.120]   They're suffering so badly from TikTok envy that they're trying to turn into TikTok and
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.240]   they're just kind of a bad TikTok.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   Be what you are.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   Don't try to...
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.720]   It's disappointing to me because I really liked WeChat.
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:36.040]   Here's the image of how Elon phoned it in.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:41.840]   He's not gonna see it in a hotel room.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.240]   Somebody behind him.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:45.680]   You could have been there.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:49.080]   That just sounds like he's in the breakfast room at a day's end.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.400]   And the general reaction, exactly.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.760]   Maybe he's actually where he is.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.760]   He's not in the days end, y'all.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.000]   That guy's getting his eggs.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I was making pancakes.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   You know those machines are really neat.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.440]   I think you're right.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.040]   Well, we know it doesn't have a house.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.040]   He's got to live somewhere.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.280]   He lives in a friend's house in Austin.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.280]   Oh.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.280]   But I don't own it.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.960]   So there.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.200]   He says a lot of things.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:27.400]   The basic reaction according to Casey Newton, his platformer...
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.200]   Is it a sub-stack platformer?
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.120]   I want to say sub-stack.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:37.320]   His platformer newsletter, Casey who got a lot of inside stuff, said that the basic
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:43.920]   reaction from Twitter employees was, "That was disjointed."
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.360]   And you know, here's the three words.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.440]   He says, "If I were to make a word cloud of employee responses, some bigger ones would
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:55.440]   be incoherent, rambling, uninspiring."
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:02.200]   At one point, Musk mentioned he has seen no evidence of alien life, and no one knew what
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.200]   to make of that.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.000]   I don't know where.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.840]   That's fair.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:15.440]   I have seen no evidence of alien life, just in case you want to know.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.000]   I think he's still going to buy it.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   I mean, you know, meeting with his staff kind of implies that.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.120]   The room was pushing for the purchase to go ahead and follow through whether the shareholder
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.120]   or a sub-stack.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.120]   Well, everybody is.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.240]   The shareholder is suing rather, but I think Twitter is insisting.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.840]   They're saying, "You said you were going to buy it.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:41.320]   There's legal recourse for them."
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.320]   You break it, you buy it.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.320]   There's the motto right there.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.920]   Hey, there's a poem there somewhere.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:58.040]   Pretty to look at something to hold, but if you break it, it's sold.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:02.000]   There's a poem in there somewhere.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.880]   Twitter's losing money, says Elon, and that's not a great situation.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   Oh.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.200]   Analysts think he's going to cut as much as 20% of the workforce.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.200]   He wouldn't say...
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.720]   He's got a lot of debt to pay off of this thing.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:25.760]   So, cut 20% of the workforce, yet work them crazy to add more fee-tossed to come to the
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.760]   next week.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.440]   And grow, quadruple the size.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.440]   I love Casey, dude.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:37.400]   Casey writes, "Must-offered, bong-rip platitudes about the future civilization."
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:45.040]   I want Twitter to contribute to a better long-lasting civilization where we better understand the
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:47.720]   nature of reality, man.
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:55.480]   I was going to ask a minute ago, what is stopping Twitter from becoming the next week chat?
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:02.880]   I mean, yes, it's here in the US, but if they put these features in and get the masses interested,
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.680]   it seems like it could totally take off, right?
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.680]   But then he said...
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.680]   You do it by...
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.160]   Because 20% of the staff, I don't know about that.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:14.400]   You do it a lot in China with QR codes, so you can use WeChat to open and pay for things
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.040]   via QR codes, like everywhere in China.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.800]   It's not hard to imagine how you could add all those features to Twitter, but the challenge
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:28.320]   is if you do that, will the existing user base stick around, let alone will you gain
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:31.040]   770 million new users?
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.720]   This is the problem always with Twitter.
[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.240]   I can get company to adopt you as a standard for transactions.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.240]   That's true, too.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.240]   You've got to make it use.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.920]   Although, Elon, I mean, if anybody could make the deals, it would be Elon.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.920]   So I mean...
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.920]   Really?
[00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.920]   Really?
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.920]   Who would trust Elon?
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:51.880]   I mean, if you had like Square, if you had the Jack Dorsey Square angle with Twitter, then
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.400]   you could do kind of...
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.920]   You could do something like that.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:55.920]   So maybe...
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.080]   Yeah, because this Boz in our chatroom points out quite accurately.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.440]   WeChat's a payment platform.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.120]   That's the real secret.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.200]   I mean, Apple messages or Facebook messages could...
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.400]   It's more likely going to be a WeChat than Twitter.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:15.880]   Twitter is not something you keep on your watch or your phone ready at any time.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.880]   Twitter is...
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:24.000]   So historically, Twitter has been slow to add features because if you get too complicated,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.240]   part of the success, or at least early on in Twitter, was its simplicity, right?
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.240]   180 characters.
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.240]   It was all messages.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.240]   It was simple.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:37.040]   And it's gotten more and more complicated over time.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.200]   And there's a risk.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:45.480]   Like Instagram, I think, is really running that risk by adding all this stuff and crapping
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.600]   itself up instead of being what it is natively.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:52.120]   Twitter did add a feature today, which is interesting.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.400]   Twitter notes.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.560]   Remember Twitter bought a newsletter company.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.440]   I think just the second in size two, Substack.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:03.440]   I can't remember its name now.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.440]   But...
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.440]   Review?
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.440]   Yeah, review.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.440]   REVUE, that's right.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   They are...
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.000]   They have somebody young here who has a memory.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.440]   You can remember stuff.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:16.600]   Stay, see, I like that about you.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:21.760]   You can now write or will be, it's rolling out to some people initially, eventually to
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.760]   everybody.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:28.520]   A note, not just a 280 character, a tweet, but a note which will then...
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.000]   A note they show it on the web interface, not the mobile interface.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Right.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.400]   They'll have a link on the mobile interface.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.640]   So this is their way...
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.720]   I think this is actually pretty smart of becoming a newsletter platform, right?
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:43.320]   People are already doing this with tweet threads, which is ridiculous.
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.240]   No, because we paid a watch.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:52.600]   We have the option because we spend money on Twitter blue to see our tweet threads.
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.440]   We've applied.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.440]   Okay.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.760]   You're just in that kind of mood today.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.760]   I've not heard it.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:58.760]   No, I've always...
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.760]   I've always...
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:00.920]   No, no, no.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.920]   I'm consistent on this.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:06.000]   I've always said, if you're going to write a blog post, write a blog post, don't divide
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.760]   it up into 20 separate tweets.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.760]   That's ridiculous.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:10.760]   It's hard for you.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.760]   It's a form of its own sort.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.440]   Well, I think it's great for like...
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.200]   I love tweet threads for like events.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.560]   Like if you're at an event and you're like, "Oh, that's different."
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.120]   It's kind of like a more fun live blog.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.480]   That's different because you're live-lying it.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.720]   But why would somebody take a medium post?
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.720]   I also like shooting it up.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.080]   And then go one-on-one slash two slash three.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.760]   Yeah, just put that in medium.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.400]   I agree with you on that.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.880]   I do it for literally silly stories.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:37.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.880]   Yeah, there's suspense you can build up.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:46.240]   And I can link to or like just one idea in the thread.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.240]   I often do that.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.760]   I often say, "Oh, this is the essence of it.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.760]   This is what I want to point out."
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.760]   You can't do that number one.
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.600]   You have this like, "This is your lead right here, baby journalist."
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.960]   You're a nut graph.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.960]   Nut graph.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.960]   Nut graph.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.360]   Oh my God, did we jinx each other?
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.000]   A nut graph?
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   Oh no.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Jeff and I might be on the same wavelength.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Do you think that this will eliminate tweet storms and threads or?
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   No.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   No, people still do the threads because you could really do a thread as a note, a Twitter
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   note.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   But you could add a thought later.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   I mean, do it a whole time where, you know, sometime later, "Oh, I found the answer to
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   that."
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Or somebody you could respond to.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   No, that's a good point.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   Somebody says that.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   If your thread is a conversation.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   That's okay.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   That's a good point.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.320]   Each item in the thread then people can respond to and now you've got a conversation starter.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:45.200]   But that makes it even more, you know, just-
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.840]   Use notes for apologies.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:53.840]   That's when you want to say something like, "Oh, yesterday I said something on a podcast
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.480]   that wasn't clear or I didn't realize."
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.440]   What do you think of this idea though, this Twitter-red idea that it's like basically
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.960]   turns Twitter into a blog kind of, right?
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.440]   You could make your blog be on Twitter.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.440]   No.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.440]   No one's-
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.440]   I don't-
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.840]   Dave Weiner is very happy about this.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.840]   He says he's been waiting for this.
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.840]   Apparently-
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:19.440]   I think that you have so many platforms to communicate on.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.360]   Like I feel like, like I've got, you know, I am on Twitter a lot.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.320]   I do news letters.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.320]   I do blog posts.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.640]   I do threads and every now and then I write an actual article for a magazine.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.000]   And they're all very different.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.040]   Like I instinctively know which platform to go to for different things.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.080]   So I feel like all of these are useful, I guess.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.240]   Yeah, as long as you-
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:47.600]   And then you're saying there's kind of a native-
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.440]   There's a place for each of these.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:51.360]   There's a native way of writing to each of them.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.360]   You wouldn't-
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.160]   You don't do what a lot of people do, which is unfortunate, which is write a blog post
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:59.520]   and then kind of copy it to 18 other places or write a tweet copy.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.760]   No, I can't even copy my blog post to like-
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.360]   That was all the rage for a while.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:08.960]   In fact, Hootsuite and a bunch of apps were created so that you could write one message
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.000]   and then have it go to everywhere.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.880]   And I always felt like that was kind of cheating, right?
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:16.360]   Well, I cheat.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.920]   Do you do that?
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.360]   Yeah, I was like, I actually- I use it to publish-
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:25.040]   Like I get everyone- I mean, I publish something that says Stacy published.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.440]   I tweet my stories via an automated thing.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.800]   Well, yeah, no, that's fair.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.400]   That's publicity.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:35.200]   What I'm saying is you write one message and use Hootsuite or something like that to post
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:41.120]   it to- there's fewer platforms now, but first- I mean, probably you and you do it to Instagram,
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.720]   Facebook and Twitter, right?
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.960]   But it used to be a lot more places.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   My Twitter typically-
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:53.400]   I will share to Twitter and LinkedIn depending on what the message is just through one service
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.760]   buffer and it does it automatically throughout the game.
[00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.680]   And like I said, yeah, that's cheating, but it also helps me from a promotional market
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:07.160]   and standpoint and frees up about two hours in a day.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.920]   Yeah, and that's probably what I don't like about it is it really is just a market-
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.280]   people who use it are marketers.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.120]   It's going to be a marketing message, basically.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.080]   Well, but some people are on Twitter just like plenty of people, like LinkedIn, especially,
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:27.760]   I would say, I check there once a day maybe just to see what's filtering up in like the
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.480]   people are talking about in my thread, right?
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.960]   I want it to be authentic is what I want.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:35.000]   I want to be you and your sandwich or whatever.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.040]   I mean, it's still authentic.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:41.120]   I still wrote some and basically like minor just like, hey, I wrote this thing.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.120]   It's about this.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.880]   Well, and to be honest, I mean, that's the only way I use Twitter.
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.880]   I don't put anything authentic on there.
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:52.440]   But for instance, as an example, I wouldn't I would say if you post something on Mastodon
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.880]   on Twitter.social, you should post something different on Twitter.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.080]   Most people don't do that, by the way.
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:01.560]   Like no, to me, that's different audience.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:03.080]   It should be a different thing.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.080]   Right.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.080]   You should write it.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.240]   And I do that with some of my content too.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.040]   Some things don't go to LinkedIn that goes to Twitter in my automation.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.040]   All content should be.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:20.000]   And I also agree with you with authenticity because there are times where I will directly
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.440]   go to Twitter to post something, you know, and not have it all scheduled out because
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:29.560]   yeah, there has to be an authentic version of me out there to not just the autopilot
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.560]   version, right?
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:34.080]   I mean, I would never like not.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:39.880]   I mean, y'all, if you follow me on Twitter, you know that I am like, most of my stuff
[00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.400]   is me and not my content or it's me.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:48.120]   Oh, I mean about weird stuff like smart pay games.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.120]   In case so.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:55.120]   Delicious.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.720]   All right.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:05.840]   So now are we thinking positively about Elon's interest in Twitter or no, no, we're still
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:07.400]   not if we're not thinking positive.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.560]   I mean, if it happens, it's going to happen.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:14.480]   I don't think his plans for we chat with the we chatification of Twitter are going to
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.480]   be.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:18.280]   I don't think that's the right way to go necessarily.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.880]   I also don't know how he could achieve it.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:27.320]   I think the way Elon works and this is a perfect example is he just says stuff.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.600]   I don't think he has a like a plan.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   No, no.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.640]   At the moment, that seemed like a good idea and tomorrow it'll be something else, which
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:38.000]   is part of the problem.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.200]   If you wanted to turn it into we chat, you would actually have to do a lot of stuff.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.840]   Oh, I could just say it.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.840]   You won't.
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.840]   But do it.
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.040]   Again, to his credit.
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.920]   He's got a history of putting the right people in the place at the right time.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:52.920]   Sure.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.320]   Although I can't count him out even though he sounds like he's talking out the side of
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.720]   his neck a lot of times.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.120]   I can't count this guy out.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:08.480]   You did see the open letter from SpaceX employees who said Elon was an embarrassment and a distraction.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.040]   Oh, right.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:15.200]   Frequent source of distraction and embarrassment through his public actions.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.520]   They also said the space flight firm wasn't living up to either.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:26.320]   It's no asshole mantra or a zero tolerance policy on sexual misconduct.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:30.080]   Elon fired, I think at least four people.
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.680]   Well, he didn't.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:37.920]   His head of his into CEO at SpaceX fired at least four people for creating the letter.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:42.640]   But apparently hundreds of employees signed on to it.
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.000]   Not all of them were fired.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.280]   Isn't there some sort of labor law regarding retaliation?
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.040]   But I guess it varies from state to state.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.040]   No.
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.520]   There's some question about whether that was legal and we'll see.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.320]   And whether it was a crash to be organized.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:57.320]   You can't fire people.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.760]   But if you're just complaining.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:59.760]   Sure.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:01.760]   I think you probably can.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.840]   But again, I've seen that question raised by a number of people who apparently know
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:09.840]   what they're talking about.
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:13.040]   The document claims that employees, the verge got a hold of it.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:14.040]   It was not an apologize.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.040]   It was not an open letter.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.040]   It was a private letter.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:21.720]   But I think it got on the company slack or something.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:27.520]   In the internal chat system, employees are being encouraged to sign on to the letter's
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.200]   suggestions either publicly or not.
[00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:34.000]   So with the signed version of the letter to be delivered to the desk of SpaceX president
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:42.160]   Gwynne Shotwell, the document claims that employees across the spectra of gender, ethnicity,
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:47.880]   and the already in technical roles have collaborated on writing the letter.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.440]   They say it's not known who wrote the letter.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:54.800]   The verge says, although I believe there were at least four people fired probably after
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.400]   the verge wrote this article.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:59.360]   This is June 16th.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:09.840]   You know, so I think it's unfortunate because if Elon just shut up for a little while.
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.840]   It's impossible.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.840]   It's just a smidge.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:14.840]   It's just a smidge.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.840]   Sure, we wouldn't be talking about him.
[00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:20.280]   He'd be a chess master and he would be a chess master.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:24.120]   Could advice be a chess master.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:28.640]   If you're Magnus Carlson, the champion of the world, you don't go around saying, here's
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.600]   what I'm going to do in my next game.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.440]   You just do it.
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.000]   You just move the pieces.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.080]   Move the pieces.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:46.240]   Microsoft, Meta, and others are founding a metaverse open standards group.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:52.360]   Apple and Google, notably not yet members.
[00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:57.960]   They will focus on pragmatic action based actions like hackathons.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:02.960]   You couldn't even get through it.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.960]   Hackathons.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:04.960]   Wow.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.360]   Wow, you're talking.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.280]   And prototyping tools for supporting common standards.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:15.560]   They also want to develop a consistent terminology for the metaverse.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.520]   Who wants to trademark it?
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.720]   Right.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.560]   Worldwide web consortium is involved.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.120]   I don't know though.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:28.760]   It doesn't sound like a standards body kind of thing if you're saying, well, we just have
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:30.600]   to agree on the words.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:36.320]   It's not like you're saying, let's be interoperable, which is really what I would expect.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.760]   You don't want to be, oh, you're going to join a metaverse, but you've got to decide
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   which one.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   Is it meta's?
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   Is it apples?
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   Is it Google's?
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.760]   Is it Microsoft?
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.920]   Who's metaverse you're going to be in?
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.560]   Because it's messaging all over again, right?
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.560]   Right.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.600]   You've got these silos, but that doesn't look like that's what they're going to be working
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:53.600]   on.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:59.040]   Oh, you might be excited about this.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:05.280]   Also joining Nvidia Qualcomm, the makers of the chips, the hardware, Sony, Unity, the
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:13.080]   software used widely by metaverse creations and Laminar One, which is a blockchain payment
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.920]   startup co-founded by Neil Stevenson.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.920]   Yay.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.680]   Just don't have a word about it.
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:26.080]   This will be waiting forever and ever to get the conclusion.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.720]   I'm disappointed in Neil.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.240]   I have to say it'll take months to clear.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.640]   I'm a transaction fan.
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.160]   Well, the good news is no transactions will ever finish.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.000]   So you never know.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.920]   Snow Crash author Neil Stevenson, and by the way, termination shock author, Neil Stevens
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:48.600]   is building a free metaverse called Laminar One.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:53.840]   He actually was, I think, I think he's one of the main reasons all these people are want
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:59.540]   to make a metaverse because Snow Crash described such an incredibly interesting metaverse.
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:02.840]   He was really the very first to do it, I think.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.360]   And a lot of people were inspired by that.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.360]   That's great.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:12.720]   He certainly in Cryptanoma County talks about cryptography, so it's not surprising that
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:16.160]   he might be interested in cryptography.
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:20.600]   The project describes itself as a free metaverse aimed at helping get artists and other value
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.440]   creators paid properly for their work.
[00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:24.960]   So we like that.
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.120]   Helping the environment, it'll be provably carbon negative.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.160]   That's one of the big issues people have with cryptocurrency is.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.440]   So how do you do that?
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.520]   I don't know.
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.800]   And you're asking me?
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:37.960]   I host a podcast.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.360]   I don't know this stuff.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:42.800]   And I'm seeing a truly open metaverse gets built.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.360]   And see, this is exactly what I was talking about.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:49.000]   Instead of seeing the metaverse vision co-opted by monopolies.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.560]   Okay.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.120]   So that takes us back to silos then, right?
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.120]   No, it takes us away from silos, a truly open metaverse getting built instead of seeing
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.720]   it co-opted by monopolies instead of having meta.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.520]   It's web five.
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:05.520]   Okay.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.520]   It's what?
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:07.520]   Okay.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.520]   Web five.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.520]   Web five.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.520]   That's the Jack Dorsey.
[00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.520]   Jack Dorsey.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:19.320]   And we tried to show you the PowerPoint, but we got hopelessly lost somewhere in the middle.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.800]   So this is not Facebook's vision.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.600]   Well, like, let's think about this, right?
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:29.120]   If you're going to do a metaverse, there's so many layers you could be open up, right?
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.440]   You could have all your hardware work together.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:36.040]   You could have like one or two operating systems on which you build things.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:42.160]   Do you want to have the same vector kind of models for things so you could interchange
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.320]   like art from one place to another?
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.320]   Right.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.320]   So that's us.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.320]   But then if you think about that, they don't want that money.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:52.320]   Right.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:57.920]   So, I mean, in somewhere's what we used to like build all the way up and it was super
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:58.920]   cool right in the web.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.720]   And then we got kind of too aggressive and built too far down and then we had no interoperability.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:07.640]   So I think we'll probably move a little bit kind of in the middle here.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.760]   And maybe that's what this will be, but I have my doubts.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:12.760]   I think everyone just joined it for publicity.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:21.240]   The other thing that Lamina, the new Lamina one, Stevenson's thing is saying is not merely
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.920]   as kind of a standard format for stuff.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:25.920]   By the way, those formats exist.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.960]   There's, you know, Apple's USDZ.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.320]   Which is an open format.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.320]   There are a lot of formats for 3D objects.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.960]   So that's not so hard.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:39.400]   But payments, they can't be a meta buck and a Google buck and a Microsoft buck.
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.760]   There should be one common payment platform.
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:46.160]   And that's why he's saying you need blockchain because there needs to be one decentralized
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:52.360]   way of accounting so that you don't need a decentralized payment platform for the metaverse.
[00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.840]   The credit card processor works just fine.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.680]   Well, that's what Corey Doctorow said.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.680]   Isn't that when he was on Twitter?
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:03.080]   He said, we're solving all these things that we already have solutions for that are perfectly
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.920]   sane and sensible and work.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.040]   Anyway, you can, if you're interested in Lamina one, you can join their discord.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.080]   And what have you said that?
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:14.400]   I think you're saying, "Homena, Homena, Homena, Homena, Homena, Homena one."
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:19.120]   Hey, why don't you and I start a cryptocurrency called, "Homena, Homena, Homena, Homena?"
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.120]   It's going to the moon.
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:23.120]   To the moon.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:28.280]   All right, I'm going to join Lamina one because why not?
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.640]   There's only 3,000 members.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.080]   So this is getting an early.
[00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:32.560]   You get into your mastodon?
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.560]   You're getting an early.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:38.160]   I'll add it to my mastodon.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.160]   Let's see.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.160]   Let's see.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.160]   So anyway, I don't know.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:47.120]   We'll have to watch and see what this metaverse open standards group is up to.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.760]   The W3C is involved, which is a good sign, the worldwide web disorder.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:55.680]   So to Stacy's point, if I buy my designer clothes on the Facebook metaverse...
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:56.680]   Can you wear them?
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.680]   Can I wear them?
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.680]   On the Microsoft metaverse.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:50:59.680]   On the Microsoft metaverse.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.920]   Good question.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:01.920]   Right now, if this is...
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:02.920]   No one knows.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.920]   Because it's all made up.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.920]   Because it's all made up.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.480]   Facebook is going to let you buy designer clothes.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:08.480]   Right.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.720]   People think that's a standard, right?
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.960]   But you would have to standardize on so many different...
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:16.680]   That's all the way up...
[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.200]   Sorry, application layer.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:19.200]   Right.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:21.560]   Like even beyond the normal application.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.280]   So part of this that gets so...
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.880]   It's like marketing BS is like, "Oh, we'll create a standard."
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.240]   And they may.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:34.160]   But the tech standard and the consumer understanding of a standard are very different.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.160]   Also...
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:41.560]   A standard, especially as somebody like the World Wide Web Consortium, W3C, who sets
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:46.120]   the standards for HTML5 and all sorts of web standards that we all use.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.120]   I mean, that's a very complicated technical thing.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:52.240]   You want everybody, you want all the stakeholders involved in the conversation.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:56.400]   It's not clear to me that this is exactly what they're trying to do.
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.960]   By the way, Apple's not a member, as I mentioned.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:51:59.960]   Google's not a member.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:00.960]   Niantic.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:05.000]   I mean, which is doing probably the most aggressive right now.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.360]   AR stuff, Pokemon Go.
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:10.000]   And Roblox, the other one is huge.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.240]   None of them are members.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.240]   Maybe they'll join the...
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.480]   You need Unicode fashion.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.480]   Unicode luxury fashion.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.480]   Oh, that's what you need.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.480]   Exactly.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:17.480]   For the metaverse.
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:18.480]   Exactly.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:25.600]   I can't get a little part of it here that you can buy now designer fake clothes.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.040]   This is just a subrism gone to its extreme.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:32.080]   Well, are they fake if Balanciaaga says they're not?
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:36.480]   I mean, that's just art.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:44.080]   If you think of fashion as art, then they're just doing art in two or 3D for the metaverse.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:48.080]   No, this is going to happen.
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:51.000]   It happened on Second Life.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.680]   You said the words "Lenden Dollars."
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.680]   It happened in Second Life.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.400]   It happens in Minecraft.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:58.400]   What's that one?
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.400]   Fortnite.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.400]   Absolutely.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.400]   Huge.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.400]   It's billions and billions of dollars.
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:06.880]   Meta is launching a digital clothing store where you could purchase outfits for your avatar.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:12.600]   From designers like Balanciaaga, Prada, and Tom Brown, they're involved.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.800]   Oh, I recognize the Tom Brown ones.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:15.800]   The one with the stripes.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:16.800]   The gray one.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.800]   The striped.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:18.800]   The striped.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.800]   The tailored outfits.
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.800]   That's Tom Brown for sure.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:26.200]   That looks like somebody who got fired from United Airlines and it does look like a storage
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:27.200]   snap.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.760]   Tom Brown's clothes are amazing.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:30.200]   Do not mess with it.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.200]   Okay.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.200]   Hashnow.
[00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.200]   How do you feel about Balanciaaga?
[00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:35.200]   I don't like Balanciaaga.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:36.200]   No.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.200]   And then the middle one is Prada.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.200]   It looks like a tennis.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.200]   I like Prada.
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.200]   We're going to play tennis.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:44.720]   I'm just a champion or Russell on there.
[00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.720]   No, not yet.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.720]   But you know, I can imagine.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.720]   You're so plebeian.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.720]   They're will Nike.
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:52.200]   I'm sure they're well.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.200]   They're holding out.
[00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.560]   You know, they're waiting to see who the big metaverse is and then want to go with the
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.600]   of course, they want to go with the winner.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:01.680]   Blu-ray versus HD DVD.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:10.600]   Tom Brown, I was very tempted by the Tom Brown Samsung watch and Samsung.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.480]   It's ultra and S 22, ultra and all that.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:18.880]   They do the Tom Brown versions over there stuff where he likes the stripes and apparently
[00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:23.640]   feels that men need to wear bikini tops.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:27.200]   It's a man's ear.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.520]   Is that why is this like to say see that from Seinfeld?
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.800]   Yeah, the man's here.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.200]   I don't think I'm just looking at this guy.
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.600]   I don't think he needs a man's ear.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:36.600]   No, he doesn't.
[00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:40.040]   Well, but you know, tell you it's about not showing the nipple.
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:41.040]   He's got nipples.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.040]   No, but wait a minute.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:45.480]   There's his nipples in the picture right above.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:48.160]   He took off his man's ear.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.400]   So see in this one, no one's wearing a top.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:54.200]   That's very confusing.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:58.360]   In the swimwear, his is hers and hers is his, they say.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.680]   That's not very modern.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.880]   I don't see it's there's no is there no color at all and his stuff.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.560]   No, he his last show was awesome.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.480]   It was like a Toy Story theme show.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:14.320]   It was gray, red, mostly reds and gray is some blues.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.320]   It was very cool.
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.320]   A lot of greats.
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   Tom Brown is.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   No, I kind of like it.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:23.520]   It's a little pricey.
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.600]   He's he's he's a fancy designer.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.040]   He's not like good stuff.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.200]   Usually is.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:34.680]   I think you should get the shower sandals and for $650.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:35.680]   What?
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.680]   What?
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:39.000]   What?
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.840]   How about this t-shirt?
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:41.840]   $420.
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:42.840]   Got a straight.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.720]   You don't buy Tom Brown t-shirts.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.080]   You buy the suits or the dresses.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   Let's get this suit.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.080]   That's nice.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.080]   I like that.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.840]   I was wanting to wear shorts with a suit.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.160]   You look like Angus.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:57.800]   You look like AC DC.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:55:59.560]   What the hell?
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.240]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:02.240]   Yall are just.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:05.880]   We're putting in your crew.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:09.080]   Oh, you're right.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.320]   I need to get that for the cruise.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:14.800]   The cruise.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:15.800]   For the captain's dinner.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:19.760]   Oh, I would wear shorts to the captain's dinner and he'd say, well, you can't wear shorts
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:20.760]   in here.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.760]   I said, but this is Tom Brown.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.000]   No, they'll probably say.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.920]   Can you take table 28?
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.920]   They're caviar.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:28.920]   Okay.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:32.320]   Do you remember Oscar Isaac's outfit at the Met Gala?
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.320]   I was.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:35.320]   That was wild.
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:37.200]   Lizzo wore Tom Brown.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:41.200]   Lizzo wore Tom Brown the night that I'm all over Tom Brown.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.920]   I am a Tom Brown guy.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.560]   Although it's so good.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.200]   Stripes everywhere.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.200]   It's never fun.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:50.200]   She gives up.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.200]   Follisty fashion.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.200]   We are.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.200]   We're fashion Follisty.
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.200]   Oh, man.
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.200]   I actually love that.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.480]   We could see her give up right there.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.680]   Here's Lizzo's Tom Brown outfit.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:06.240]   And in TikTok, she actually played the flute for like four notes.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.240]   That is beautiful.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.480]   Look at that.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:12.640]   Tom Brown just took that off to bed, wrapped it around her and said, there we go.
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:13.640]   You're on your way.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:14.640]   Oh my gosh.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:15.640]   I'm done.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:16.640]   I'm done.
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:17.640]   I am done.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.120]   And you could use it as a drapery after it.
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:22.080]   It'll be very nice.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:26.440]   Here's Christine Bransky and Tom Brown also at the Met Gala.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.440]   Look at that cloak.
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.640]   Look at how clean those lines are.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.640]   It's beautiful.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.560]   It's classic.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.560]   It's elegant.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:35.800]   Yes, it is.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:36.800]   It's used.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.960]   And it's very, it tends more masculine.
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.360]   And I just, I like it.
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:43.360]   It's clean.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:47.360]   I mean, if I'm going to buy like an investment piece that's that I'm wearing.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:51.720]   He's a Yaya Abdul-Mateen II in his Tom Brown.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:54.640]   It looks like little bees on his jacket.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:55.640]   That's cute.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.640]   And he's also got tails.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:57.640]   Look at that.
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:58.640]   Tails.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:57:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:05.160]   It's a Missy Williams in her Tom Brown outfit.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.160]   So yeah.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.160]   Okay.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.160]   See?
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.160]   See?
[00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.160]   Oh, look at that.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.960]   Oskar Isaac wearing his skirt.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:13.320]   That is your look Leo.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.320]   That's me.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:16.360]   I'm going to the captain's dinner like that.
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:20.440]   I am wearing a skirt.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:22.800]   He is a brave, brave gentleman.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:23.800]   He really is.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:24.800]   Okay.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:25.960]   I have no problem with kilts.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:29.400]   Is it a kilt though or I think it's more like a midi skirt.
[00:58:29.400 --> 00:58:31.040]   Well, that's on midi.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.040]   It's a skrip.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.040]   Midi.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.040]   Midi.
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:35.040]   Okay.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.520]   We are not this week in fashion.
[00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:38.520]   Thank God.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:41.520]   Because aren't you grateful?
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:44.280]   She has been to be near us right now.
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.200]   She is going to rub off on her.
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.720]   I don't want to do this on me, says Stacy.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.880]   Look at this.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:53.560]   Jordan Roth's Tom Brown creation.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:54.560]   Okay.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:57.480]   So that looked a lot like his his couture show from.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.640]   Look at that.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:59.640]   Is that a hat?
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.640]   Is that a giant hat?
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.640]   That's hysterical.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.640]   No, it's funny.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.640]   I love it.
[00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:08.200]   High fashion is interesting.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.200]   It's art.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.200]   It's art.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.200]   It is art.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.200]   It is art.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:14.200]   All right.
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.200]   Moving right along.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.200]   Let us.
[00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:18.200]   It's fun.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.200]   Travis Barker.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:21.800]   Give me some Halston or Elsa Paredy.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:24.040]   I have Elsa.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.040]   I have Elsa.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.640]   Fred Gwyn from the Munsters on the left there.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:34.280]   I just like it, but he's got tattooed hair.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:38.680]   The only problem with tattooed hair is you have to keep shaving your real hair in order
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:39.680]   to see it.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:42.360]   On the other hand, if you decided you didn't like it, you just broke your real hair.
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:46.040]   You said you wouldn't know that you've got a tattooed and a hair.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.280]   It's not a problem for long.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.280]   That is a very...
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.000]   It's a look.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   It's a look.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   Okay.
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.920]   Anyway, that was the fashion segment of this week in Google.
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.320]   Let's take a little break.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.920]   I love it.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.920]   I love it.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.920]   I think it's fascinating.
[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.920]   I think it's fascinating.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:06.920]   I'm just throwing tomatoes at their speakers right now.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.920]   I know.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.920]   They're like, "Fast, how long are they going to be talking about this?"
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.920]   Fashion.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.720]   Well, it's also very visual and I apologize to our audio listeners.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.560]   But you can imagine...
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.760]   How did we get on Tom...
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.120]   Oh, because the meta...
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120]   Meta.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.120]   Meta...
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.120]   Meta to the meta.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:27.120]   Oh, you're on twig.
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:31.240]   I showed it a brought to you by the company that's going to keep you from waking up in
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.200]   the middle of the night tonight.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:40.360]   If you're an engineer, if you're responsible for a network, a system, global cloud, you
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.720]   know, these things happen.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.720]   What was it?
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.720]   Was it last night?
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.240]   The entire internet went down, thanks to Cloudflare.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.120]   And I bet you, a lot of the companies that, you know, the guy was getting a call in the
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.440]   middle of the night, it's down.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.200]   And you don't know what's going on because you don't have observability implemented in
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.200]   your network.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.880]   So you've got to try a bunch of different tools and, you know, just your heart is pounding,
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:08.120]   the boss is calling, you've got your team members scrambling, you need new relic.
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.520]   You need it.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.840]   New relic did a study, only half of all organizations have implemented observability for their networks
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.840]   and systems.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:19.240]   That means half of all the companies out there are getting up in the middle of the night,
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:21.200]   heart pounding, not knowing what's gone wrong.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.600]   The other half, fix the problem, go back to bed with new relic.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.600]   Isn't that that worst feeling?
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.600]   What's going on?
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   Is it the back end?
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:30.600]   Is it the front end?
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.600]   Is it the global?
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.600]   Is it the server?
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.600]   Is it the network?
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.600]   Is it the cloud providers at our CDN?
[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:35.600]   Do we have slow running queries?
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:36.600]   Here's the worst one.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:41.560]   Did I introduce a bug in my last deploy?
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:47.480]   If you've got new relic, you can know exactly what's wrong, right down to the line of code,
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:52.080]   which means you can fix it fast, push the fix and go back to bed.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:56.960]   New relic combined, 16 different monitoring products you'd normally get separately.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:03.480]   But 16 in one means one software stack gives you all the answers you need.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:09.200]   You get application monitoring, APM, unifying monitoring for your apps and your microservices.
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:13.320]   If you use Kubernetes, you'll love PIXI, instant Kubernetes observability, you'll get
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.680]   distributed tracing without management headaches, fine and fixed issues fast.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.680]   And you know what?
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.560]   With network performance monitoring, if it is cloud flare, you'll know because you get
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:25.560]   a system wide correlated view, no data silos here.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.440]   So you have to guess where the performance issues start.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:32.200]   And that's just four of the 16 tools.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:37.400]   That's why the dev and ops teams at DoorDash and GitHub and Epic Games, one of the 14,000
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:41.040]   companies use new relics so they can sleep better at night.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.000]   They use it to debug their software, to improve their software, to solve problems when they
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   crop up.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.080]   Whether your cloud native startup, Fortune 500 companies use it, it just takes five minutes
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.800]   to set up new relic in your environment no matter how complex.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.080]   So you know that late night call, it's just waiting, it could be happening tonight.
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:02.680]   Why don't you before you go to bed the night get new relic?
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:07.480]   You can get access to the whole new relic platform for free, forever.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.760]   No credit card required.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.920]   The entire platform, 100 gigabytes of data a month, free forever.
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.520]   So at least do yourself a favor and start off right now with new relic.
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.480]   Get it set up five minutes from now, you'll feel a lot better.
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.480]   New relic.com/twig.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:29.760]   N-E-W-R-E-L-I-C.com/twig.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.760]   Is it the server?
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:31.760]   Is it the network?
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.440]   New relic knows.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:34.640]   New relic knows.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:37.360]   New relic.com/twig.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.200]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google and you support us by the
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:47.280]   way when you go to New Relic.com/twig.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:53.400]   Amazon is hiring and firing so fast.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:58.760]   They're worried they're going to run out of people.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.280]   Leaked Amazon memo warns this is from Vox.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:09.680]   The company is running out of people to hire by 2024 according to a leaked Amazon internal
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.600]   research report.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:13.520]   This was from a few years ago.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.720]   Recode actually found it.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.720]   They could run out of people to hire in their URS/U.S. warehouses.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:25.520]   Immigration.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.520]   Raising wages.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:28.640]   Behind every scalable platform.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:29.640]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.640]   Some people.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.760]   Remember, I certainly do.
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.520]   Back in the 1900s when the phone company said if it keeps up we're going to have to
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.520]   hire every woman in the world to work as operators.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.960]   Because at the time it was a manual process, right?
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.240]   Number please and you had the person had a patch bay and they would connect the two
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.800]   numbers and you could talk but that was not scalable.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:56.720]   Eventually they came up with automated switching equipment and eventually we went digital and
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.080]   solved it entirely.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:05.120]   So Amazon, oh today they did launch their first autonomous robot for the warehouse.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.120]   What do you think?
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.120]   The rescue.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.120]   There's the answer.
[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:14.200]   So in this report which was leaked recently was written in mid-2021.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:21.440]   They talked about six levers Amazon could pull to delay the labor crisis by a few years.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:23.200]   Raising wages was one of them.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.040]   Oh what a thought.
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.040]   Imagine that.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:33.920]   You could argue that Amazon is a major factor in inflation because of wage inflation because
[01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:38.400]   they raised their salaries to $15 and it forced others to do so too.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.680]   But $15 is so low.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.680]   I know.
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.960]   Imagine what it was before.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:50.040]   Apple raised their starting wage at the Apple stores from $20 to $22 and that was to discourage
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:57.040]   unionization but the first Apple store was unionized this week in Towsen, Maryland.
[01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.440]   The other way one of the other levers increasing warehouse automation.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.840]   So there you go Stacy.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.200]   That's why the robots.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:09.160]   Of course it's a lot better to build robots than to pay people more money.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:14.600]   Well it depends on your business.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.440]   You're paying people to build your robots.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:21.640]   Amazon showed that the company was expected to exhaust its entire available labor pool
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:27.120]   in the Phoenix area by the end of 2021 in the inland empire region of California by
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:28.920]   the end of 2022.
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:32.880]   They must have done something to fix that.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:37.600]   Amazing right?
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.600]   That's scale.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:48.160]   I'm not saying it's a good thing or a bad thing but wow.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.640]   And when was this document?
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:54.760]   Was written in 2021 but recode just got it.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.200]   So that's what we're talking about today.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.240]   We just found out it's news to us.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.240]   News to us.
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.680]   Not apparently to Jeff Bezos though.
[01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.680]   You knew all.
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:14.040]   I don't know anything about that news Amazon CEO I guess things are just.
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.040]   Andy Glassie.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.040]   Andy Glassie.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.040]   Jesse.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.040]   Jesse.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:21.480]   Oh yeah that's his stare at this glassy.
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:22.680]   His name is Jesse.
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:24.240]   What are you doing okay?
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.120]   Well I think so right.
[01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.000]   He did immediately change some things right.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.200]   To be a little bit less of a scary corporate culture I've heard.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.400]   Oh that's right.
[01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:42.240]   Being a little bit more friendly to the warehouse folks if you will.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:44.240]   Not necessarily.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:46.280]   Do they get air conditioning?
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.240]   What about actual p-breaks?
[01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.240]   Anything?
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.240]   Anything?
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.040]   Are they still managed by automated systems?
[01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:08:00.800]   I'm worried that you can actually be fired without any human intervention at all based
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:06.080]   on metrics based on you know production productivity and stuff.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.080]   I thought that was a lot.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.080]   I mean you could be fired at.
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.080]   Oh boy.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.080]   Yeah that was less.
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:12.080]   Is it going on?
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.200]   Well how come I just saw it man.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:17.600]   I think I saw it on Twitter.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:18.600]   Oh boy.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:23.040]   But again I mean there's a lot of media companies now.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.040]   If you don't get enough clicks you're out.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.040]   Yeah I mean.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:30.520]   Yeah but you're not out fired by a machine.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.520]   Still there's some human intervention.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:33.520]   You have a managing by metrics.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.520]   Right.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.520]   That's been around forever.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.720]   I guess it doesn't really matter.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.520]   I mean I've heard enough burgers.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.520]   Yes.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.720]   So your boss that doesn't care about you tells you.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.720]   I mean yay.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:44.720]   Gee.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.160]   Jack Welch supposedly the brilliant CEO about the screw up the company.
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.000]   You know every year you're fired at the bottom 10%.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.360]   So black out.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.040]   Yeah you're right these are all.
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:00.760]   We actually the first story about this was from April 2019.
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.000]   So never mind.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.040]   I don't know maybe I just noticed it recently.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:08.040]   Your Twitter algorithm is a little out of whack sir.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.120]   That's right.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.040]   We even I even covered the story.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.040]   I should notice.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.640]   We even talked about it on the show.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.960]   This is like the 600 and something episode of this show.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.800]   So you're forgiven for not remembering everything.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:24.800]   Everything.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.800]   Everything.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.360]   Everything's new under the sun.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:35.000]   You just got to be on Twitter more so it can serve you you know things and fresher stuff.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.920]   Well that is one thing I don't like about Twitter and is that there's the algorithmic
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.920]   feed.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.360]   You get stuff that's a day old.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.520]   I really bothers me.
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:44.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:48.600]   I always switch it to latest whenever I see I like it because it tells me who I missed.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.000]   Well and that's the other side of it.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.760]   So sometimes I do want to see that you're right because it's people I care about generally
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.120]   right.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:01.200]   You should create identical accounts different names but following the same people and then
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.520]   just wait and go back and make it one time.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.520]   You can go back and forth.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.520]   No is that too much trouble?
[01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:12.160]   I'm just saying if you if you don't want to.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:15.120]   If that's too much trouble for you separate accounts.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.120]   That's a lot.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.000]   Oh you know what I'm excited about a story on here.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:25.040]   Oh before you do that let me do an ad so we can all prepare ourselves for Stacy's excitement.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.040]   Wait wait wait.
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.520]   We literally okay.
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.840]   You feel like we just did an ad?
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:30.960]   Didn't we just do an ad?
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.760]   Did I just we can miss an ad?
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:36.800]   Let me go check because I'm not supposed to do it too close together.
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.920]   Yeah I did it 10 minutes ago you're right.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.920]   Never mind.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.440]   Oh my god I'm losing time.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:44.440]   Never mind.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.440]   Is that terrible.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.880]   Hold on is that the keys?
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.880]   Find out what excites stays.
[01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:52.200]   No because I can't do ads that close together.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.440]   They get angry angry ads.
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.440]   So go ahead Stacy.
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.440]   What are you excited about?
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:01.520]   Okay now I've lost what I was.
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:05.400]   People want to shoot down Android Amazon drones.
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.400]   Is that it?
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:09.600]   Lockford California is going to be the first to get drone delivery.
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:15.920]   Some locals say not Montana I'm all shooting down.
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:21.640]   I read an 1809 New York Times story today that said that farmers were shooting autoists
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.280]   and one actually fired at it.
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.280]   Ever thus.
[01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:28.080]   Farmers are shooting what shooting autoists.
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.080]   What's an autoist?
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:32.280]   This is from 1909 you think you're 12 feet tall.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.280]   Oh no.
[01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:34.280]   Jeff is always.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.280]   Drivers.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:39.560]   An 82 year old woman who lives directly across the street from the under construction drone
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:42.480]   facility Amazon's building in Lockford.
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:47.280]   She lives there with her dog horse two ponies and a small herd of goats.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:49.040]   No no this is not a New York Times story.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.360]   It's the Washington Post.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:54.480]   Said no one had mentioned Amazon's plans to her.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.000]   The same went for two brothers busily converting the neighborhood winery they recently purchased
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.960]   into a marijuana farm.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:07.240]   A man in a local archery shop that'll help commented jokingly target practice when he
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.280]   found out we have our headline.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:13.000]   We're going to shoot at it.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   No that's it.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.240]   That was the headline from.
[01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.240]   What?
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.240]   Sensational.
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.240]   Jeff.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.240]   Anti attack.
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.720]   They're not going to shoot at it.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:25.720]   Some guy in an archery shop jokingly said target practice.
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:30.320]   Suddenly locals want to shoot them.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.880]   What if you shoot someone like have we figured out what airspace above people's home?
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.080]   You cannot shoot down a drone anymore.
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:38.080]   You could shoot down an airplane.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.240]   I don't care whose airspace it is.
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.240]   The drones are big though.
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:44.680]   It would be easy to hit six and a half feet wide four feet tall.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:45.680]   Wow.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.840]   They're supposed to drop the packages on a predetermined spot.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.840]   Noisy.
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.440]   It's going to be from four feet.
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.200]   So don't order a TV with it.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:57.600]   Oh wait a minute.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:03.000]   They don't even have permits from San Joaquin County yet and they don't have sign up from
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.920]   the federal and aviation administration.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:06.920]   Oh wait a minute.
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:07.920]   Here's somebody.
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.360]   Here's somebody's going to shoot it down.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:14.600]   They're invading our privacy says Tom Blight in a cement contractor who doesn't even live
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.760]   in Lockford.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:24.760]   He once threatened to shoot down a neighbor's drone.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:25.840]   I hate my business.
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.280]   God I hate them.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:33.200]   He's worried about Amazon cameras seeing into his backyard.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.200]   But anyway.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.200]   They're doing their Tom.
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.360]   He's not worried about the person hiding in the back woods.
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.240]   Anyway, I'm not an Amazon guy.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:43.720]   I think they're going to wreck everything.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.760]   Amazon is cooperating with local authorities.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:50.400]   However, I'm still looking for somebody who's going to actually shoot them down.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.000]   Is she going to shoot him down?
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.040]   She looks like she's like the guy in 1909 did actually shoot an autoist.
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.440]   Yes, he shot an autoist.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.440]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.480]   I mean, someone has shot drones down before.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.480]   That's a thing.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.920]   I found out what I remembered what I was so excited about when we're done talking about
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.720]   shooting things.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:11.760]   How much longer do I have to do this story before Stacy forgets again?
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:15.200]   That might be a worthy subject for your wagers.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:18.720]   Challenge accepted.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:22.640]   Former flight assistant, Chetty Skeets.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.200]   So me.
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.200]   Chetty Skeet.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:30.080]   See, if your name is Skeet, you don't want to talk about things being shot down.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:35.080]   Former flight assistant, Chetty Skeet, is spoken out publicly about his safety concerns
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.520]   regarding prime air.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.560]   No one has so far though in this article.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.400]   This entire article actually proposed.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.000]   Some guy once shot his neighbor's drone.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.320]   Another guy says it'd be good for archery practice.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:52.920]   Some Lockford residents said it could make sense for them.
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:15:07.440]   I've got a lot of room.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:09.440]   Why not?
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:16.440]   Or is he thinking like, "There's a lot of room for it to land?"
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.440]   I think it's landing.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.840]   It's not going to land.
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.400]   It drops it from four feet.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:26.440]   You don't have to have anywhere for it to land.
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:31.800]   But you have to have a clear spot that's like six or seven feet wide across if it's
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.320]   six and a half feet.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.240]   Here's one person Nadine Koster.
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.880]   She says that drone will frighten the animals.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.440]   That's a lot of people are legitimately concerned about it.
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:49.240]   This is a very rural area with lots of animals, a lot of ranches.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.040]   Amazon says the companies work to reduce noise and will work hard to minimize any potential
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:55.040]   disruption.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:16:00.240]   Lockford resident Joy Huffman earlier pictured said her daughter's order so much from Amazon
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.520]   that she gets a package delivered almost every day.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.600]   That's raining Amazon.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:10.280]   Again, these fine folks need to understand it.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.400]   Everything is not going to come on a dad gum drone.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:15.640]   You can or it's very limited.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.040]   That everything is not coming from the drone.
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.040]   It's not.
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.240]   Someone should educate them.
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:27.040]   So in this entire article, Carolyn O'Donovan, who is mad because she was actually probably
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:31.560]   sent to Lockford to collect these quotes.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:36.600]   No one has said no one said they want to shoot them down.
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:38.360]   Not one.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:43.120]   One jokingly one one archer said jokingly a good target practice.
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:47.920]   Another guy who doesn't even live in Lockford said a shot of neighbors drone once and that's
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:48.920]   it.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:49.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:54.760]   I thought, you know, what?
[01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:55.760]   I don't know.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:56.760]   Editors.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:02.960]   She was sent poor woman was sent all the way to San Joaquin Valley to Lockford to wander
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:03.960]   around the town.
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:08.080]   Look, here's a store selling psychic crystals.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:12.400]   She was wandering around trying to find somebody who'd say anything like they'd shoot it down.
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.400]   And I obviously she didn't write the headline right.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.200]   Jeff, somebody else writes the headline.
[01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:17.200]   Right.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.120]   She probably saw it and said, Hey, my story didn't say that.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.120]   You shouldn't do that.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:25.400]   But no, she's well, she probably didn't have any pool either.
[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:28.720]   Maybe they mean metaphorically they want to shoot him down.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:30.240]   They want to shoot the idea down.
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:34.480]   No, it says some locals want to shoot them.
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.400]   All right.
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:38.400]   I don't know.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:41.040]   Don't shoot don't shoot drones.
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:42.000]   You know what you could do though?
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.720]   You could set up a net like a giant net with what led weights on and capture it.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.080]   That'd be a little mini EMP.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.120]   Yeah, or an EMP.
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:54.600]   That was the best part of that book, by the way, termination shock was the little mini
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.600]   EMP.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:56.600]   That was clever.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.080]   It wasn't a nuclear explosion.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:03.160]   It was collected the harvested energy from its descent into the atmosphere through the
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.160]   atmosphere.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:07.160]   Haven't finished yet.
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:09.080]   But I'll take your word for it.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.080]   You know what?
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.080]   You don't have to finish it now.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:13.080]   It's okay.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:14.080]   You really don't.
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:18.320]   I really don't think you're going to get the value out of it that you think you are.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.320]   So of all the people.
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.320]   And I'll reimburse you.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.320]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320]   Wait a minute.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.760]   I forgot that maybe she did too.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.760]   I had a story.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:30.520]   What are you excited about?
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.520]   I'm excited.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:33.360]   And I think you will be too.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.120]   The NPR Smart Audio Report came out.
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:42.400]   So every year NPR teams up with Edison Research to talk to people who own smart speakers and
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.680]   people who don't.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:49.080]   And I thought the most interesting bit of this report, which I should put in the rundown
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.080]   for you.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.800]   Well, I can Google it.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:52.800]   That's all right.
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:53.800]   I'll find it.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:54.800]   Okay, that's true.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.800]   Google that.
[01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:56.800]   The Smart Audio Report.
[01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.800]   Here it is.
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:01.600]   About my favorite thing to talk about, which we don't talk about enough, is Amazon and
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:04.440]   Google devices talking back.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:08.840]   So there's a lot in here like ownership on blah, blah, blah.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:15.840]   But I don't know about y'all, but I get a lot of like pushback from Alexa lately.
[01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.640]   And it's like, I'll be like, what's the weather?
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:19.640]   And it'll tell me the weather.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:25.200]   And it's like, by the way, such and such, toilet paper is 50% off.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.960]   Would you like to add it to your shopping list?
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.520]   And I'm like, I hate you.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:29.520]   Go away.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.520]   And I hate it.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:35.480]   And it turns out that there are people who don't mind that.
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:36.960]   And that was the most.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:42.520]   But wasn't that the whole plan of Madam A in Amazon is to be able to give you that one
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:47.960]   little extra in to make you hit by now or I had to cart?
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:52.880]   No, it was supposed to be a voice interface for for doing things.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.240]   It was just a new computing card.
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:58.680]   I mean, I figured I was just thinking because that was the first thing that came to my
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:04.440]   mind years ago when I saw that it was Amazon, you know, why don't I don't think people like
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:08.640]   listening to their smart speaker that way?
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:14.520]   Because you're trying to do something quickly in stopping that process with an ad seems
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:16.200]   really rude.
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:23.600]   But when smart speakers were offering like when they offered you more information than
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:27.520]   you requested, 40% of people were not bothered at all.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:30.400]   42% were bothered a little.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:35.160]   When it recommended a feature without your prompting like, hey, by the way, if you'd
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:40.040]   like to learn about your commute, you can ask me blah, blah, blah.
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.600]   That didn't bother 39% of people at all.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:50.080]   And it only bothered 37% a little and suggesting you purchase something without your prompting.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:54.160]   33% of people were bothered a lot by it.
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:57.480]   Yeah, I don't want to give it to tell me to buy stuff.
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:00.360]   But 40% of people were like, yes, it's not so bad.
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:06.960]   You're saying that what you said, 33% were bothered that it was suggesting the shopping
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.240]   just 33%.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.240]   Just 33.
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:14.520]   Only a third of people were pissed when it suggested that you purchase something without
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.520]   their prompting.
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.360]   And I was like, that should be like two thirds.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:20.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.360]   I hate it.
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:25.240]   Like, you're like, like, this happens to us like once a week.
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:29.680]   I'll be like, Madam A, set an alarm for seven in the morning.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:33.320]   And it's like alarm set for seven p.m. or seven a.m. tomorrow.
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:38.400]   Did you know I could do something else that you don't want me to do?
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.560]   I hate that.
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:43.760]   And I swear at it every single time I debt probably doesn't help.
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.120]   I don't want to chat.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.120]   Yes.
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.120]   I don't want to chat.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.120]   Chatty.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.120]   Chatty.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.120]   Kathy on my speaker.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.120]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:54.360]   They're talking about the RTR and they spent so much time talking about advertising on
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.360]   smart speakers.
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.360]   No, I'm not.
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:59.360]   A significant portion of this was about advertising.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:05.800]   No, only like, I mean, a significant, I thought this report was actually hilarious because
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:09.320]   it really shows how stagnant the speaker market is.
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:14.680]   And then it had these hilarious how it started, how it's going memes in there that it's
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:15.680]   not just that stagnant.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:16.680]   I mean, it's growing.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.760]   A 35% of Americans own a smart speaker.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.760]   That's pretty good.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.520]   But if you look at the increase.
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:29.640]   So in part of this is, you know, increasing from a small number, but in 2017 to 2018,
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:35.480]   they saw a 13% increase 2018 to 19 was 16, 19 to 20 was 29%.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:37.400]   Oh, I have that graph here.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:42.400]   And then, but in the last year, 21 to 22, it was only a 9%.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.400]   So we've stopped increasing.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.640]   Growth is slowing.
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:52.080]   But what doesn't that make sense considering is not like a smartphone, which even with
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:58.200]   smartphones, people aren't buying those as often because they tend to last up to a certain
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.200]   extent.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:06.080]   With the speaker, how often do you expect to buy new speakers that are assistant capable?
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:07.080]   Because they're just speaking.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:11.320]   I think a lot of the growth happened early on is people tested one.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.320]   They bought one and tested and then they were like, okay, I'll put three of these.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.320]   Interesting.
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.320]   I'll buy some more.
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.920]   And I guess this is one of the things you're laughing at.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:23.200]   The reasons people got a smart speaker in 2017 are identical to the reasons they got
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.200]   it in 2022.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.800]   That has not changed.
[01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:27.360]   Number one, listen to music.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:30.200]   Number two, ask questions without needing to type.
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:33.360]   Number three, seems like a fun new gadget.
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.840]   How often did a dude each of you use your smart speaker?
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:37.840]   Every day.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:38.840]   Wow.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:39.840]   Many times every day.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.600]   They actually have a stat.
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.040]   And I'm.
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:45.840]   I don't own one.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:48.280]   What if I wanted to use that type of capability?
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:49.480]   I use the pixel.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:53.960]   But you don't have a matime with a device or a Google.
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:54.960]   No, sir.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:55.960]   I have.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:56.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.200]   They sent one of them little freebie things.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:03.480]   And I think the hard hit has it somewhere, but I don't use it.
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:08.880]   Antid, you know that 86% of Americans agree smart speakers allow for a more convenient
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.880]   living experience.
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.880]   Did you know that?
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:21.480]   86% 86% there's so if you don't have one, why don't you have one?
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:23.440]   And what did they say?
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:26.840]   I never really never just saw the need for it.
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.800]   Oh, you're not worried about privacy, then.
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:29.800]   It's not a privacy issue.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:30.800]   Okay.
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:34.160]   No, it's not according to this because I have a dad gum smartphone.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.160]   I know that.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.160]   They listen.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.160]   I have it.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.160]   And I never ever ever use it.
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.160]   I use it.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:47.040]   First thing in the morning, I say, hey, what time is it?
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:52.120]   And then I say, oh, crap, I got to get going.
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.880]   What's the weather going to be like?
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:58.280]   And then I go in the bathroom and I say, a minute, a long time ago, called a watch.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.280]   Wow.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.720]   I don't wear a watch in bed.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:04.800]   And I don't ask my wife because she'll say, it's seven ish.
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.480]   So I want to know.
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:10.640]   So so so it tells me, look, it's the best thing you could just say.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.680]   Hey, you know who, what time is it?
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:15.040]   And by the way, I have Amazon.
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.120]   I have Google.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:18.600]   I have Siri in my bedroom right next to my bed.
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:22.040]   I have all of them everywhere in the house.
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:23.040]   So I can choose.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.960]   You thought today was Tuesday.
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:30.560]   Well, that, you know, but other than that, that's because nobody was here for me to ask.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.840]   I get in the bathroom.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.480]   I play music or I do my vocal warmups.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:38.880]   I say, hey, goog, play the 10 minute vocal warm up.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:42.160]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, we got to hear you do vocal
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.240]   warmups.
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.800]   I need to hear this.
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:45.800]   Yes.
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.800]   Why would you want to hear that?
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:47.800]   Oh, I want to hear this.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:48.800]   I definitely want to hear this.
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:49.800]   I'll get it.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:52.040]   Okay, I'll play my ringtone.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:58.200]   My, okay, I'm going to, this is the one I do.
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:01.480]   And this is what I, and the Google speaker will play it for me out of here.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:02.480]   Ready?
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:05.040]   We are starting with the hum.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:15.440]   But then my favorite, oh, my favorite is mommy made me match my met M&M's.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.840]   Mommy made me match my M&M's.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.240]   Mommy made me match my M&M's.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:24.680]   Mommy made me match my M&M's.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.680]   Mommy made me match my M&M's.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:30.960]   Mommy made me match my M&M's.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.320]   Mommy made me match my M&M's.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:52.800]   do it every day except Monday because Sunday had do so much talking but the best one. Mm-hmm.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:27:22.780]   They go and now, goog. Goog goog goog goog goog. Goog goog goog goog. Anyway, that's my tent. Okay, so that's playing through my Google speaker. Oh, and the report house is like, it's Tuesday. You know, I don't feel so bad about Lisa or Michael because they kind of know but I do feel bad for my neighbors because when there's one. Mommie. They might think, I think they probably think they live next door to an opera singer is what I think.
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:39.780]   I had a neighbor in my network. You hope they think. Who did nothing but play the scales of the piano. Nothing. Yeah, but they're good at the scales. Only the scales. Mommie made me watch my M&Ms. Mosh, Mosh. I can't do it without the guy.
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:28:04.780]   Now say, Mommie made me match my M&Ms. Sorry. How confused does that video have? Oh, a lot. There's, but by the way, this is not the only one on YouTube. There's dozens of these. This one has 5,572,000 views. But remember, there's only about 100 people using it. They just use it every day.
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:13.780]   But there's all sorts of them. Are you going to do this on the cruise? I have to do it every day. My vocal coach told me to do it every day.
[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:27.780]   Is this so you sing better or is this for talking? It's for talking. Okay. You know, I use my voice for words. I don't know how to use any part of it. I was actually going to try singing. I'll be honest with you.
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:40.780]   I never did for almost 50 years as a broadcaster. I never did. But I was starting to worry that I didn't want to sound like Jeff as I age. So I was starting to... Hey.
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:54.780]   Hey. No, I was afraid. I want to keep doing this, right? I don't want my voice to deteriorate. And I was starting to worry that maybe it would. I don't smoke. I don't do a lot of the things. What do you sound like Larry King or something?
[01:28:54.780 --> 01:29:07.780]   I don't want to sound like Larry King. No. My daughter got notes, vocal notes. And so that's what made me aware of it. And we were talking about it. And so I thought, "Oh God. Maybe I haven't been treating my voice right."
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:23.780]   So I... No, no, no, no. This is professional training. So I talked to Scott Wilkins and his wife who happens to be a vocal coach. This is what she does. And I said, I'm most particularly interested in not having my voice get sound. Oh, I don't want to sound like an old man. As I get older. I mean, I guess it will.
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:28.780]   It's the substance of what you say that makes you sound old. But go ahead. Well, that's true. That I give you.
[01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:38.780]   It's that. I'm going to let Jeff insult you because I was pretty beautiful right now. There's no cure for that one. Mr. Ottoist. But...
[01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:50.780]   Gutenberg. Gutenberg. But... So she told me, you know, there's just a few things I need to do and all of that. No, so it's good. I think it's good. I should take care of my voice.
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:56.780]   I mean, I feel bad that I haven't all this time. I mean, I... This was a reveal. I like that.
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:30:02.780]   Yeah. So anyway, so that... Okay, then I go in the kitchen. Oh, we were... I know we're only beginning his...
[01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:15.780]   Oh, this is my day with my voice assistant. I go in the kitchen. I say, "Madam A, play my flash briefing." And so she plays the news. You can set up all the news things you want to hear.
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:25.780]   The piece is always listening to her flash-flash briefing. Or when I'm cooking something, I might say, you know, set a timer for three minutes for mashed potatoes or whatever.
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:35.780]   And then... You're a wonderful machine? In my machine, I don't have to set the timer because it plays little musical tunes. The Thermomix is an amazing piece of...
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:37.780]   Sorry, Stainie.
[01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:48.780]   There's a new Thermomix in town, by the way. There's a competent competitor that's less expensive. That looks like it was even more.
[01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:51.780]   I can't remember the name. Somebody was showing it to me. I'll try to remember.
[01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.780]   Leo!
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:31:01.780]   Oh, man. I wish I could... I think Dick... Oh, I could find it. Dick DiBartolo mentioned it on...
[01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:02.780]   More mate?
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:04.780]   On the gizmos. On the gizmos.
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:13.780]   No, no, I'll find it for you. Dick was talking about it. I said, "Well, that's just a clone of the... He does this on the radio show. He brings gadgets."
[01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:22.780]   I said, "That's just a clone of the Thermomix." But instead of $1,500, here it is. The Cooking Pal Molto.
[01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:25.780]   Oh, I said Molto. Did you say the Molto? Yeah.
[01:31:25.780 --> 01:31:26.780]   I said it.
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:28.780]   This looks just like a Thermomix, basically.
[01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:29.780]   It does.
[01:31:29.780 --> 01:31:40.780]   Yeah. It does. It says, "Chops, sautés, needs, steams, boils, whisks, ways, emulsifies, blends, grates. Mummy made me match my M&M's."
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:42.780]   [laughter]
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:43.780]   [unintelligible]
[01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:45.780]   And it doesn't have cookie-do as its app.
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:54.780]   You know what? Stan is actually a flaw in the Thermomix. I have to constantly re-log into cookie-do, and you pay 30 bucks a year for it, even though you paid all that money for the hardware.
[01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:59.780]   But this looks kind of neat. So yeah, I would look at - it's about half the price, too, I think.
[01:31:59.780 --> 01:32:00.780]   All right.
[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:06.780]   Yeah. Actually, I would love it if you got one, and then you could tell me if it's good or not. The Molto.
[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:07.780]   Okay.
[01:32:07.780 --> 01:32:13.780]   The Molto Intelligent Cooking System by Cooking Pal. I think these are all European.
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:17.780]   Yeah, $9.99 to $1,500.
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:18.780]   Mm-hmm.
[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:21.780]   You could buy it on time, $91 a month.
[01:32:21.780 --> 01:32:22.780]   Yeah.
[01:32:22.780 --> 01:32:29.780]   And it - like these are exactly the same attachments. It looks just like a Thermomix.
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:35.780]   So I think it's the same thing. And one advantage it has is it has a tablet separate from the base.
[01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:36.780]   See it in AR?
[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:37.780]   Sure, you want it?
[01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:40.780]   Oh my God, it comes with its own tablet. That's kind of weird.
[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:41.780]   Well, yeah.
[01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:42.780]   I need this.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:43.780]   The Thermomix.
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:45.780]   God, it's huge.
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:48.780]   Oh, God. Wait till you see the Thermomix.
[01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:49.780]   I've seen the Thermomix.
[01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:54.780]   Well, this is even - but this has - what is this? Smokstack in the back.
[01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:58.780]   That worries me a little bit.
[01:32:58.780 --> 01:32:59.780]   Yeah.
[01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:00.780]   I don't know.
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:02.780]   I think that's a container.
[01:33:02.780 --> 01:33:04.780]   My space is gone.
[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:06.780]   No, my space.
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:07.780]   Oh, I see.
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:08.780]   Okay.
[01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:11.780]   Do you already ordered this?
[01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:15.780]   No, I don't need it. I have a Thermomix. I'm trying to sell Stacy on it.
[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:18.780]   He's trying to convince me that I don't spend $1,000.
[01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:20.780]   I'm just about talking to my significant other.
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:21.780]   No, that's expensive.
[01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:22.780]   We have deals.
[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:23.780]   Yeah.
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:26.780]   No, and as you should, I mean, that's a lot of money.
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:28.780]   But if you tell them it makes the best amount of potatoes.
[01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:31.780]   It's like a whole ton of brown pair of flats.
[01:33:31.780 --> 01:33:34.780]   I get this instead of the flats.
[01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:36.780]   She's got priorities, folks.
[01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:41.780]   Here comes the sun to end civilization.
[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:43.780]   Here's an uplifting little story from Wired.
[01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:45.780]   A little moral panic here about the sun.
[01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:48.780]   Any moral here? This is just panic panic.
[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:50.780]   Oh, okay.
[01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:57.780]   Because, you know about solar spots and you know about sun storms and all of that stuff
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:33:59.780]   and how they can cause problems.
[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:01.780]   But this is just one more thing to worry about.
[01:34:01.780 --> 01:34:06.780]   If you worry about a giant comet hitting us, it's just one more thing like that.
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:12.780]   Every once in a while, the sun will send out a blast of plasma.
[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:16.780]   Oh, you know, almost always doesn't go towards the earth.
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:20.780]   It's a, yes, a CME, a coronal mass ejection.
[01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:25.780]   But if it did hit the earth and it, oh yeah, jammer v is all over this.
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:32.780]   And it didn't, it didn't get bounced away by the earth's magnetic field because they could
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:33.780]   be opposite polarity.
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:40.780]   So it's a lot of ifs, but it would basically blow out all the electronics in the world.
[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:44.780]   There's also a super volcano under Yellowstone.
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:45.780]   Oh, wow.
[01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:47.780]   Is that what old faithful is?
[01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:49.780]   It's just the tip of the super volcano.
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:54.780]   Old faithful is not the tip of the super volcano, but there is a potential super volcano under
[01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:55.780]   the other.
[01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:56.780]   Wow.
[01:34:56.780 --> 01:35:02.780]   So there is a deep space climate observatory, which is a satellite about a million miles
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:08.780]   from the earth that analyzes the speed and polarity of incoming solar particles.
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:14.780]   And if the clouds magnetic orientation is dangerous and heading towards the earth, we could get
[01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:17.780]   an hour of warning before impact.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:19.780]   What do we do on plug everything?
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:21.780]   That won't help.
[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:23.780]   [laughter]
[01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:24.780]   Ravin tin foil.
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:25.780]   I don't know.
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:27.780]   It is possible to shield stuff.
[01:35:27.780 --> 01:35:29.780]   Most stuff is not shielded.
[01:35:29.780 --> 01:35:33.780]   The biggest issue is it could knock out the electrical grid.
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:38.780]   We have a lot of transformers, especially old transformers, that would be very susceptible
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:40.780]   to this, and they would blow.
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:48.780]   And it could in effect render us without power for months in the United States.
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:50.780]   Imagine how that would be.
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:53.780]   How much fun that would be.
[01:35:53.780 --> 01:36:00.780]   In the summer of 2012, during the historically quiet cycle 24, two mammoth coronal mass
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:05.780]   ejections narrowly missed the earth.
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:08.780]   So, just something more to us.
[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:09.780]   So cheery.
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:10.780]   Thank you, Wired.
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:15.780]   I particularly like the headline, "Here comes the sun to end civilization."
[01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:18.780]   [laughter]
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:21.780]   Matt Reibel writing in Wired Magazine this week.
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:24.780]   But the sun gives life.
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:26.780]   Yeah, it does.
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:27.780]   It is...
[01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:28.780]   It kind of takes it away.
[01:36:28.780 --> 01:36:29.780]   Yeah.
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:31.780]   We did it against Stacy.
[01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:32.780]   What's that?
[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:33.780]   Oh, what'd you do?
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:35.780]   Just some more jinxing again.
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:36.780]   Yeah, same thing.
[01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:38.780]   You said the same thing?
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:39.780]   Yeah.
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:41.780]   I don't know, man.
[01:36:41.780 --> 01:36:42.780]   All right.
[01:36:42.780 --> 01:36:45.780]   Now I think I better do a little break here.
[01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:48.780]   Although, Stacy, I actually like this smart audio report.
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:50.780]   I feel like we didn't even really...
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:55.780]   60% of adult Americans use a voice assistant.
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:37:00.780]   My favorite stat was that the number of people, like the number of tasks people complete.
[01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:02.780]   We actually went through it.
[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:05.780]   Like you were doing, Kevin and I, if we talked about this on my show.
[01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:11.780]   We went through it and figured out what we talked to our voice assistants to do.
[01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:14.780]   And surprisingly, we had a hard time getting above 10.
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:15.780]   We made it.
[01:37:15.780 --> 01:37:19.780]   But we actually only do a few things with these.
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:20.780]   I think that's really common.
[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:28.780]   I think playing music and setting timers is for most people, mostly what they do.
[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:35.780]   We asked about the weather before we're going out, before deciding what to wear.
[01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:38.780]   Lisa, I will say what's the weather going to be in Petaloma.
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:44.780]   And because I have Samuel L. Jackson on my Amazon Echo, as well as Melissa McCarthy, depending
[01:37:44.780 --> 01:37:47.780]   on my mood, I might say, "Hey, Melissa, what's the weather going to be?"
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:52.780]   And he swears, by the way, when he tells you what the weather is going to be.
[01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:53.780]   He's really good.
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:56.780]   It's really funny.
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:58.780]   And then we could set alarms.
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:03.780]   Oh, we'll, you know, frequently we say, "Hey, Siri, play ocean sounds when we go to bed."
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:06.780]   And there's a nice pleasant ocean sounds coming.
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:12.780]   You know, we have Siri, Apple's little speakers by the bed and we listen to music and stuff.
[01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:14.780]   We use it quite a bit.
[01:38:14.780 --> 01:38:19.780]   Fortunately, they are constantly beeping and booping at us.
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:23.780]   They're triggered accidentally all the time.
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:24.780]   Right.
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:25.780]   That's it.
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:30.780]   You know, I mean, and they mention that in this study, a surprisingly large number of
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:37.780]   people, even those who have smart speakers, are worried that they're listening in.
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:38.780]   So...
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:40.780]   Yeah, but that's...
[01:38:40.780 --> 01:38:41.780]   Everybody worries about that.
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:44.780]   Yeah, we're just always worried about that, right?
[01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:48.780]   We always think we're so important and people want to talk to us.
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:54.780]   47% of smart speaker owners worry that our smart speaker is always listening.
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:39:00.780]   Wow, 43% worry that the smart speaker could allow the government to listen into our private
[01:39:00.780 --> 01:39:01.780]   conversations.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:08.780]   But 58% agree that the companies are going to keep your information secure.
[01:39:08.780 --> 01:39:11.780]   LAM!
[01:39:11.780 --> 01:39:18.780]   You know, I never really had much success with the assistant stuff.
[01:39:18.780 --> 01:39:25.780]   Maybe it's because I'm on Android and it's not as great as the Madamaze and Siri, but I just
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:31.780]   never really had the desire to do anything other than ask for the weather or maybe play a
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:32.780]   song.
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:35.780]   But most of the time when I ask it to play a song, it struggles to find a song that I'm
[01:39:35.780 --> 01:39:40.780]   looking for.
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:45.780]   How do you think of my phone and type in what I want to do?
[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:48.780]   Google actually was the worst when it came.
[01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:53.780]   So I've got Spotify integrated and Google's Spotify API was terrible in the beginning.
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:54.780]   It's much better now.
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:56.780]   You always play the karaoke version of things.
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:58.780]   That was a big problem, wasn't it?
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:40:03.780]   There's a lot of gamification on Spotify where people will put stuff because you're going
[01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:06.780]   to get stuff hoping to get you.
[01:40:06.780 --> 01:40:09.780]   And there's a lot of crap on Spotify taking advantage of that.
[01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:12.780]   Maybe Spotify has fixed that.
[01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:14.780]   I think they must be Spotify, right?
[01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:18.780]   I think the more you use it, it was Google working with the API.
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:22.780]   The way they had set up their API is what I heard.
[01:40:22.780 --> 01:40:23.780]   Interesting.
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:24.780]   I'll be right back.
[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:30.780]   The number of speaker owners who listened to a podcast on their smart speaker, by the way,
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:35.780]   is something else I do in a typical way you increase 22% over the past five years.
[01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:41.780]   So it's now 39% of smart speaker owners listen to podcasts.
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:42.780]   I do that all the time.
[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:44.780]   But see, I wonder what that number is.
[01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:49.780]   That says from 2017 to 2022, what is it from like 2020 to 2022?
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:52.780]   I bet it is more significant then, right?
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:57.780]   Maybe it increased over the past five years, but yeah, I don't know.
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:02.780]   I bet most of it happened during 2020 to 2022.
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:05.780]   I would assume that 2017 is the 20th.
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:07.780]   Oh, we are stuck in the house.
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:10.780]   Oh, you're right, because you were listening in the car mostly.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:14.780]   It's certainly something we're aware of.
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:19.780]   After every show, we do a flash briefing, snip it from the show and make that available
[01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:21.780]   to Echo users.
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:26.780]   We definitely think that for podcasting, always one of the issues of podcasting,
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:31.780]   at the early days was how hard it was like you had to jump through hoops to listen.
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:35.780]   So I've always said, if as soon as it's easy to listen to a podcast as a radio show,
[01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:37.780]   we will do better than radio.
[01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:38.780]   And I think that that's come true.
[01:41:38.780 --> 01:41:43.780]   And a lot of that is due to smart speakers, just the ease of listening.
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:44.780]   You can, by the way, you can --
[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:45.780]   And cars.
[01:41:45.780 --> 01:41:48.780]   And cars, but you can do, yeah, it's easier in cars too now,
[01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:52.780]   because your smartphone is already connected to your car, so you can easily listen to a podcast.
[01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:58.780]   But just for people who listen, you can ask for Twig, you can say, play the latest this week
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:01.780]   in Google podcast, and almost all of them will do that correctly.
[01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:04.780]   You can listen to Twit Live, our live stream.
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:06.780]   Amazon Echo used to call it Twit Live.
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:08.780]   I don't know if they fixed that or not.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:10.780]   [laughter]
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:11.780]   I'm good with that, man.
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:12.780]   I'm good with that.
[01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:17.780]   Maybe I'll try this assistant stuff a little more over the next week or so,
[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:19.780]   but I just never really had any interest.
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:25.780]   The only thing that I can say I use regularly is if I have those pixel buds in
[01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:28.780]   and the little notification chime goes in.
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:32.780]   And so then I'll just tap and hold and listen to the notification.
[01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:37.780]   But that's about it, because when I try to respond to, say, a text message,
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:39.780]   it's a crap show.
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:40.780]   Oh, I do that all the time.
[01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:42.780]   Do you have any smart stuff in your home, Ant?
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:45.780]   Do you have any smart light bulbs or anything like that?
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:46.780]   No, yeah.
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:50.780]   It might be like probably half of my things are instructing my oven to preheat
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:54.780]   or my thermostat to go or my lights to turn on or doors to lock.
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:55.780]   So...
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:43:00.780]   I just, every night when I go to bed, I say, "Hey, goog, turn the lights out."
[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:05.780]   And the hue lights that I have that are hooked up and connected to the Google,
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:08.780]   those are about nine lights to turn off.
[01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:10.780]   That's a nice thing.
[01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:11.780]   You know, nice feature.
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:12.780]   You should have a good night routine.
[01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:15.780]   Leo, why don't you advance yourself a little bit,
[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:17.780]   add in your door locks, be like, "Can you change anything?"
[01:43:17.780 --> 01:43:20.780]   I don't have automated door locks, so...
[01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:21.780]   Yet?
[01:43:21.780 --> 01:43:22.780]   I don't think so.
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:23.780]   I thought about it.
[01:43:23.780 --> 01:43:25.780]   It could check your garage door and make sure it's closed.
[01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:29.780]   It could, because I have a smart garage door, so it could do that.
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:32.780]   I actually have a routine where I walk around the house, make sure all the windows
[01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:35.780]   and doors are closed, I check the garage, and then I'll lock the door,
[01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:39.780]   and as I'm going by the last stage, I say, "Hey, goog, turn out the lights."
[01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:41.780]   And that's the last stage before I go to bed.
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:43.780]   So that's, I mean, so that's the last thing I do.
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:44.780]   Is the last thing I do.
[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:46.780]   You don't do a vocal warm-up to go to bed or...?
[01:43:46.780 --> 01:43:51.780]   No, no, you only do that once a day.
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:54.780]   After you work out, when you do your push-ups, I want you to go, "Mommy,
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:58.780]   maybe match Miami and M's."
[01:43:58.780 --> 01:44:01.780]   Here's one reason I think there's some growth in this.
[01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:03.780]   Small kids.
[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:07.780]   In fact, this was the number one reason for wanting a smart speaker was to
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:12.780]   entertain children, and that's increased 36%.
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:13.780]   Actually, it's not the number one reason.
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:17.780]   The number one reason is to discover new songs, but the fastest growing reason
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:18.780]   is entertain children.
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:22.780]   And that makes a... by the way, podcast is number three, so thank you.
[01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:23.780]   But that makes a lot of sense.
[01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:29.780]   Everybody knows that young kids complains, because they're young kids will say,
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:33.780]   "Play Baby Shark over and over and over."
[01:44:33.780 --> 01:44:34.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:38.780]   Kids love it though, because they've got something that they can boss around.
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:39.780]   Authority over, yeah.
[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:40.780]   Yeah.
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:45.780]   Well, and if your parents don't let you have access to a smartphone,
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:50.780]   I mean, if you think about it, kids, it's greater variety than those toys you used
[01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:55.780]   to punch for, you'd punch something at a play a little song and you'd have three
[01:44:55.780 --> 01:44:56.780]   options, right?
[01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:57.780]   A busy box.
[01:44:57.780 --> 01:44:58.780]   You can tell that you do whatever.
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:44:59.780]   Yeah.
[01:44:59.780 --> 01:45:04.780]   I liked it because it did give my daughter, when we got the... it gave her the
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:09.780]   ability, when she was about six or seven, to control things in the house that she
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:14.780]   had to do, and play her music in a way that she couldn't, because everything was
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:15.780]   digital by then.
[01:45:15.780 --> 01:45:22.780]   Because if you think about it, I mean, I had a radio and I had a record player,
[01:45:22.780 --> 01:45:24.780]   so... but she had none of that.
[01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:31.780]   No, when my son got out of college, you know, you would give him a stereo maybe
[01:45:31.780 --> 01:45:32.780]   or something like that.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:34.780]   I gave him the Google Home Max.
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:35.780]   That's his music.
[01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:37.780]   It's a great little speaker.
[01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:40.780]   He can... it does everything in... it's a great choice, I think.
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:43.780]   And now he carries out, you know, he doesn't carry it around, but every time he
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:45.780]   moves, he brings his... his home Max.
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:47.780]   That's a... that's his stereo.
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:48.780]   Yeah.
[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:50.780]   I think it actually plays your sodos.
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:53.780]   Yeah, but they're just so stupid.
[01:45:53.780 --> 01:45:55.780]   [laughter]
[01:45:55.780 --> 01:45:56.780]   I told you so.
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:45:57.780]   They're so...
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:45:59.780]   Smart speakers.
[01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:00.780]   I'm just disappointed.
[01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:01.780]   I think so.
[01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:02.780]   Missed up.
[01:46:02.780 --> 01:46:03.780]   Missed up.
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:05.780]   Honestly, the Google Hub Max is a better choice.
[01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:07.780]   I don't think Madamay and my sodos.
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:10.780]   But for some reason it stops playing after 15 minutes or not even that long,
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:12.780]   maybe 10 minutes, it'll just stop.
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:13.780]   Oh, that's another thing I...
[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:15.780]   Oh, you know, my Madamay did that for a while.
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:17.780]   Yeah, did you ever figure out why?
[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:19.780]   Nope, I just threw it Madamay away.
[01:46:19.780 --> 01:46:20.780]   Yeah.
[01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:21.780]   I mean, I put her in the storage closet.
[01:46:21.780 --> 01:46:22.780]   Put her in the closet.
[01:46:22.780 --> 01:46:23.780]   That's all Madamay deserves.
[01:46:23.780 --> 01:46:25.780]   I can't play a whole symphony.
[01:46:25.780 --> 01:46:26.780]   All I can ever get is one of those stupid...
[01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:27.780]   Oh, a movement.
[01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:28.780]   Yeah.
[01:46:28.780 --> 01:46:30.780]   A little bit for people who don't like classical music.
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:31.780]   I don't know how to do it.
[01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:34.780]   You have to ask for the album.
[01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:42.780]   So you want Deutsche Gramophone, Opus No. 37, the Mozart, Inert,
[01:46:42.780 --> 01:46:43.780]   Kleiner, not music.
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:45.780]   Yeah, because in the albums they never mention movements.
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:46.780]   I think about it.
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:47.780]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's for the album.
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:49.780]   I think we don't play the whole thing.
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:50.780]   Yeah, okay.
[01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:51.780]   Yeah.
[01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:54.780]   What was I going to say about Sonos?
[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:56.780]   Do you have Sonos, Stacey or no?
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:47:00.780]   I got rid of most of my Sonos, but I still have...
[01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:01.780]   I still have one.
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:05.780]   I was going to get with the voice assistant just to test it out.
[01:47:05.780 --> 01:47:09.780]   Yeah, I have the moves, the most modern ones.
[01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:12.780]   So they charge it on a charger, but you can carry them around.
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:16.780]   And those do Madamay or Google or Sonos is a voice assistant.
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:18.780]   And they sound good.
[01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:20.780]   I mean, they're good speakers.
[01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:22.780]   If I could get it so it didn't stop.
[01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:25.780]   That's another thing, by the way, listening to audiobooks as well as podcasts.
[01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:30.780]   So if you have a Madamay and you use Audible, you can just say literally,
[01:47:30.780 --> 01:47:33.780]   read to me and it will pick up wherever you left off.
[01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:35.780]   That's most of how I listen to Neil Stevenson.
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:38.780]   You know, moving around the house and stuff.
[01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:46.780]   All right, now I really do have to take a break because otherwise this show is going to be eight hours long and Stacey's going to kill me.
[01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:47.780]   She's going to kill me.
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:48.780]   I'll just leave it.
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:49.780]   I'll be like, "Yeah, where's Meg?"
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:50.780]   I thought you did, actually.
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:53.780]   When you said I have to go, I thought you would never come back to be honest.
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:55.780]   No, I had to...
[01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:57.780]   My husband was running out the door and he asked me if I wanted something.
[01:47:57.780 --> 01:48:00.780]   So I wanted him to go pick up some fruit for me.
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:01.780]   Oh, isn't that nice?
[01:48:01.780 --> 01:48:02.780]   Sorry.
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:03.780]   Oh.
[01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:07.780]   Yes, Sonos has its own voice assistant, which didn't we just find out is the voice of the...
[01:48:07.780 --> 01:48:08.780]   Yeah, they developed it.
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:12.780]   They launched it at the beginning of this month and they developed it all on their own.
[01:48:12.780 --> 01:48:19.780]   It only works with music, but it is supposed to be much better for music and not have some issues that we can light about.
[01:48:19.780 --> 01:48:20.780]   Oh, good.
[01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:22.780]   And it's the guy from Breaking Bad.
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:24.780]   Somebody told me.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:25.780]   Yes.
[01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:28.780]   And what's interesting, they actually didn't...
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:34.780]   They had a couple of him recording things, but they had him record a whole bunch and then they actually computer generated...
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:35.780]   Yeah.
[01:48:35.780 --> 01:48:37.780]   95% only like the...
[01:48:37.780 --> 01:48:39.780]   That's how Google does it too.
[01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:40.780]   Yeah.
[01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:43.780]   G.N. Carlos Esposito's voice, they synthesized it.
[01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:45.780]   They call it Esposito AI.
[01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:48.780]   He just has to do enough.
[01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:51.780]   He gets the pros-ity, he records the pros-ity.
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:55.780]   And then they can modify it.
[01:48:55.780 --> 01:49:00.780]   Now that I know that, I can definitely turn that on.
[01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:02.780]   That's pretty cool.
[01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:07.780]   Esposito's voice may eventually converse in more languages than English.
[01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:09.780]   His English is Spanish.
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:14.780]   In fact, they just added Ukrainian, which is really cool.
[01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:18.780]   So as long as they have the pros-ity, I guess they can apply it to other languages.
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:21.780]   Speaking in a non-native way.
[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:25.780]   I would be speaking in a non-native way anyway though.
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:30.780]   Well, but you should get somebody who's a native speaker, right?
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:32.780]   Well, they're not going to have a person.
[01:49:32.780 --> 01:49:34.780]   If they're going to have an AI.
[01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:36.780]   They're going to essentially have a deep faith.
[01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:40.780]   Using the pros-ity of a native speaker is what I'm saying would be better.
[01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:42.780]   But who knows what they're going to do.
[01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:45.780]   Anyway, let's take a little break, come back with more.
[01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:48.780]   Stacey Higginbothamstacey on IOT.com.
[01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:49.780]   Wonderful.
[01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:50.780]   As always to have you.
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:55.780]   I always worry every week, every Wednesday I walk in and say, "Stacey, you're going to be here?
[01:49:55.780 --> 01:49:56.780]   Is she going to be here?"
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:49:57.780]   Then there's Jeff Jones.
[01:49:57.780 --> 01:49:59.780]   Do you wonder what color my hair is going to be?
[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:00.780]   What color is it today?
[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:01.780]   Purple?
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:02.780]   It's purple.
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:03.780]   It's very nice.
[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:04.780]   It's a subtle purple.
[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:06.780]   It looks more like a sheen.
[01:50:06.780 --> 01:50:07.780]   Like-
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:09.780]   Oh, it's very purple.
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:10.780]   Is it?
[01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:11.780]   Maybe the camera's just not-
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:12.780]   My lighting is terrible.
[01:50:12.780 --> 01:50:14.780]   Your touch jacket there, Leo.
[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:15.780]   Yeah.
[01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:16.780]   My touch jacket.
[01:50:16.780 --> 01:50:17.780]   My touch jacket.
[01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:18.780]   He likes my purple touch jacket.
[01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:20.780]   Yeah, just like a purple velvet tux.
[01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:22.780]   Yeah, did you like that?
[01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:25.780]   That's Jeff Jarvis Buzzmachine.com.
[01:50:25.780 --> 01:50:26.780]   [laughs]
[01:50:26.780 --> 01:50:27.780]   [laughs]
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:29.780]   Okay, so he's got a new camera.
[01:50:29.780 --> 01:50:30.780]   We sent him.
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:31.780]   What do we send you?
[01:50:31.780 --> 01:50:32.780]   I can't remember the name of it.
[01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:34.780]   It's called the Luminah.
[01:50:34.780 --> 01:50:36.780]   The Luminah, it was a Kickstarter, I think.
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:39.780]   And the idea is, "Oh, this camera is going to be great.
[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:43.780]   It's going to be as good as a DSLR, but it's a webcam."
[01:50:43.780 --> 01:50:45.780]   Yeah, and I think it is good.
[01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:46.780]   I think it looks good.
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:47.780]   It solves some of the problems.
[01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:49.780]   But what are those two hickeys?
[01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:51.780]   You can just add a few.
[01:50:51.780 --> 01:50:52.780]   There's a lot of lights.
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.780]   It's like a lot.
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:57.780]   Because it's AI, it could do things like that.
[01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:00.780]   But I can also become very, very sharp.
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:04.780]   Yeah, don't make it sharp because that actually made you soft.
[01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:06.780]   You want un-sharp.
[01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:07.780]   So-
[01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:09.780]   It blur any amount I want.
[01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:11.780]   It's the Baba Wawa.
[01:51:11.780 --> 01:51:13.780]   Yeah, but it's all done in software.
[01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:16.780]   This is powered by AI, which means it's software.
[01:51:16.780 --> 01:51:18.780]   The Baba Wawa.
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:20.780]   It's cool looking.
[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:21.780]   But, yeah, it seems to be.
[01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:23.780]   It's 4K.
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:24.780]   Well, and it's really wide.
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:25.780]   So you have it zoomed.
[01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:27.780]   In fact, we could zoom in a little more.
[01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:29.780]   I'll zoom out first to show how wide it goes.
[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:30.780]   It goes really wide.
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:31.780]   That's a work.
[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:32.780]   Yeah.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:33.780]   But you can zoom in a little bit.
[01:51:33.780 --> 01:51:35.780]   That'll be good if you have like a few animals
[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:36.780]   that you're windowing.
[01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:37.780]   No, stop, stop.
[01:51:37.780 --> 01:51:39.780]   That's what we want right there.
[01:51:39.780 --> 01:51:41.780]   No, I don't like it.
[01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:42.780]   I don't like it at all.
[01:51:42.780 --> 01:51:44.780]   Oh, if you're listening on audio, be thankful.
[01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:45.780]   Yeah.
[01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:48.780]   Finally, a reasonalism on audio.
[01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:51.780]   Our show today brought- Oh, and the improvements also here, of course,
[01:51:51.780 --> 01:51:54.780]   from hands-on photography and Mr.
[01:51:54.780 --> 01:51:55.780]   Maru Panic.
[01:51:55.780 --> 01:51:58.780]   That's the only truth.
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:51:59.780]   I love that.
[01:51:59.780 --> 01:52:03.780]   That's a better trick than yellow hands clapping.
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:08.780]   Our show today brought to you by Policy Genius.
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:11.780]   Do you have life insurance?
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:12.780]   You should.
[01:52:12.780 --> 01:52:13.780]   You should.
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:15.780]   Whether you're graduating from school, planning a wedding,
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:18.780]   welcoming a baby, switching jobs.
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:21.780]   Now's the time to protect your family's finances.
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:24.780]   When we had- When the kids were born, that was the very first thing
[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:25.780]   I did when I got life insurance.
[01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:26.780]   Now I'm a grown-up.
[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:27.780]   Now I've got responsibilities.
[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:31.780]   And if anything should happen to me, I don't want them to suffer.
[01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:35.780]   Life insurance gives you peace of mind that your loved ones will
[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:37.780]   have a financial cushion if anything should happen to you.
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:41.780]   You may have some life insurance to do your job most of the time.
[01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:42.780]   It's not enough.
[01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:46.780]   In fact, on average, people need ten times the coverage to properly
[01:52:46.780 --> 01:52:48.780]   provide for your families.
[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:51.780]   Typically, life insurance gets more expensive as you get older,
[01:52:51.780 --> 01:52:56.780]   so it's a good idea to get your policy sooner than later.
[01:52:56.780 --> 01:53:01.780]   The Policy Genius is a very good one-stop shop to find the insurance
[01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:03.780]   you need at the right price.

[01:53:22.780 --> 01:53:25.780]   between different policy insurance companies.

[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:12.780]   pilot.
[01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:15.780]   They have options that offer coverage and as little as a week.
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:20.780]   You can get, if you want, options for insurance without medical
[01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:21.780]   exams.
[01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:23.780]   They've been doing this for a while, too.
[01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:25.780]   They've been around since 2014.

[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:17.780]   That's the lower quarter, lower half.
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:22.780]   Actually, I have a whole section that we're going to start doing
[01:55:22.780 --> 01:55:26.780]   from now on called "On the Market Off the Market."
[01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:28.780]   "On the Market Off the Market."
[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:32.780]   So, off the market, sorry.
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:35.780]   Actually, let me do "On the Market" first because this is the
[01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:36.780]   good news.
[01:55:36.780 --> 01:55:39.780]   Rupert Murdoch is on the market.
[01:55:39.780 --> 01:55:41.780]   (Laughter)
[01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:44.780]   His short-lived marriage, well, six, seven years.
[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:45.780]   That's not bad.
[01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:46.780]   To Jerry Hall.
[01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:51.780]   His fourth wife, Jerry Hall, former spouse of Mick Jagger,
[01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:53.780]   so she had the qualifications.
[01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:55.780]   She was used to wrinkly old men.
[01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:57.780]   He's 91, she's 65.
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:55:59.780]   May, December.
[01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:00.780]   Just didn't work out.
[01:56:00.780 --> 01:56:02.780]   I thought he was married to Wendy Dang or something like that.
[01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:03.780]   That's the old one.
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:05.780]   That's not wife number three.
[01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:06.780]   Sorry.
[01:56:06.780 --> 01:56:07.780]   But hey, good news.
[01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:09.780]   "On the Market."
[01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:10.780]   Bad news.
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:11.780]   Off the Market.
[01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:14.780]   Bill Nye, the science guy, just got married.
[01:56:14.780 --> 01:56:16.780]   Congratulations to all.
[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:17.780]   Oh.
[01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:18.780]   I know.
[01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:19.780]   I thought he'd never get married.
[01:56:19.780 --> 01:56:20.780]   (Laughter)
[01:56:20.780 --> 01:56:22.780]   I didn't really think about him being married or not.
[01:56:22.780 --> 01:56:24.780]   But, you know, I hope he's happy.
[01:56:24.780 --> 01:56:26.780]   (Laughter)
[01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:28.780]   66 years old.
[01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:30.780]   So, you know, he married journalist Lisa Monday.
[01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:32.780]   She's 61.
[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:34.780]   The ceremony was officiated.
[01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:37.780]   I love this by an actor from Star Trek.
[01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:38.780]   (Laughter)
[01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:39.780]   Of course.
[01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:41.780]   We need Neil deGrasse Tyson.
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:43.780]   No, I don't think so.
[01:56:43.780 --> 01:56:47.780]   Robert Piccardo, who plays the doctor on Star Trek.
[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:49.780]   Star Trek Voyager.
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:53.780]   Bill Nye and Neil deGrasse Tyson might have like this fun rivalry.
[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:54.780]   I'm sure they do.
[01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:57.780]   But Neil deGrasse Tyson has Bill on his show.
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:56:58.780]   Yeah.
[01:56:58.780 --> 01:56:59.780]   But I have to say this.
[01:56:59.780 --> 01:57:02.780]   Neil deGrasse Tyson is a scientist.
[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:04.780]   Bill Nye's just a science guy.
[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:06.780]   He does not a trained scientist.
[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:08.780]   He's really a host.
[01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:09.780]   He's a communicator.
[01:57:09.780 --> 01:57:11.780]   He's as much a scientist as I am a scientist.
[01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:12.780]   (Laughter)
[01:57:12.780 --> 01:57:13.780]   He's media.
[01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:18.780]   He did wear a bow tie, black bow tie with a white shirt and orange flower on his lapel according
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:20.780]   to the Daily Mail.
[01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:25.780]   Pete Sousa, another celebrity, former White House photographer for the Alma Bum Obama administration,
[01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:28.780]   was the wedding photographer pretty nice.
[01:57:28.780 --> 01:57:31.780]   Pretty nice.
[01:57:31.780 --> 01:57:36.780]   So I'm very happy for Bill Nye, the science guy.
[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:42.780]   His new wife wrote the book "Code Girls," the untold story of the American women codebreakers
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:43.780]   of World War II.
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:44.780]   Oh.
[01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:45.780]   Yeah.
[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:48.780]   In fact, that's how they met.
[01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:55.780]   Because in the book, she mentions Bill Nye's mom, who was a cryptanist analyst, Jacqueline
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:57.780]   Jenkins Nye.
[01:57:57.780 --> 01:57:58.780]   He emailed her.
[01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:00.780]   They developed a rapport.
[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:02.780]   They started dating.
[01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:05.780]   And now the end is Nye.
[01:58:05.780 --> 01:58:09.780]   (Laughter)
[01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:12.780]   Jammer V hit the rim shot.
[01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:16.780]   Another weird thing I learned.
[01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:24.780]   That Jerry Hall's marriage to Mick Janger was annulled.
[01:58:24.780 --> 01:58:25.780]   What?
[01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:27.780]   They were married forever.
[01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:28.780]   I know.
[01:58:28.780 --> 01:58:31.780]   I didn't know you could, I have to ask Padre about this.
[01:58:31.780 --> 01:58:32.780]   (Laughter)
[01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:33.780]   I didn't know.
[01:58:33.780 --> 01:58:38.780]   I thought you had to be annulled mean like you didn't consummate it or like it was under false
[01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:39.780]   pretenses.
[01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:40.780]   I don't know.
[01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:43.780]   They were together forever.
[01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:44.780]   Oh.
[01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:45.780]   Hmm.
[01:58:45.780 --> 01:58:46.780]   Anyway.
[01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:47.780]   No word.
[01:58:47.780 --> 01:58:52.780]   By the way, the story about Murdoch and Jerry Hall is still just rumor.
[01:58:52.780 --> 01:58:56.780]   But I hear what?
[01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:58.780]   We don't report rumor.
[01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   You reported that like it's fact.
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:03.780]   Well, there are times when I was.
[01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:04.780]   Get them.
[01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:07.780]   Let me see where the authoritative...
[01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:09.780]   According to two people, I was knowledge of the decision.
[01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:10.780]   Two people acknowledge.
[01:59:10.780 --> 01:59:14.780]   Speak unonly anonymously to discuss a personal matter.
[01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:18.780]   That means that Rupert and Jerry told them, but don't quote us.
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:19.780]   Yeah.
[01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:20.780]   And she gets nothing.
[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:23.780]   It's unlikely according to the New York Times to alter the ownership.
[01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:29.780]   This is why it's news because, you know, he's got Fox News, the Wall Street Journal.
[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:34.780]   It is unlikely to alter the ownership structure of business he holds stakes in.
[01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:35.780]   How they would know this?
[01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:38.780]   Well, because Rupert told them.
[01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:44.780]   The Murdoch family shares in the company's reside in a strictly managed trust.
[01:59:44.780 --> 01:59:49.780]   Voting rights are split with his four oldest children, Lachlan, Elizabeth James and Prudence.
[01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:52.780]   Just like the TV show's succession.
[01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:56.780]   And has arranged them so that he can never be out voted.
[01:59:56.780 --> 02:00:04.780]   So when Rupert goes, which may happen never, because he's a vampire, Lachlan is not going
[02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:09.780]   to take over, but there are rumors that James would manage a palace coup given the structure
[02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:12.780]   at that point and could change Fox News.
[02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:16.780]   You know, my, I want to add this, if it was my father, my 96 year old father, who I loved
[02:00:16.780 --> 02:00:21.780]   nearly used to be a Fox News watcher and everything that came along with that.
[02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:26.780]   Then in the pandemic his hearing aid basically broke, which we didn't really fix until we
[02:00:26.780 --> 02:00:28.780]   knew that and got him up here.
[02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:33.780]   And so he didn't really watch Fox News for two years.
[02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:35.780]   It cured him.
[02:00:35.780 --> 02:00:38.780]   He has said Joe Biden's doing a good job.
[02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:43.780]   He says, what Donald Trump is a problem and he's glad he's out.
[02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:46.780]   It's amazing how it can happen.
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:47.780]   If we could just try it off.
[02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:49.780]   All because his hearing aid broke.
[02:00:49.780 --> 02:00:51.780]   Pretty much, I think.
[02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:53.780]   By the way, let's give full credit to Bill Nye.
[02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:57.780]   He is a mechanical engineer and worked at Boeing and invented a hydraulic resonance suppressor
[02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:00.780]   tube that is used on the 747.
[02:01:00.780 --> 02:01:03.780]   Yeah, you tried, you tried doing that Leo in 1986.
[02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:05.780]   So he's not like us.
[02:01:05.780 --> 02:01:14.780]   But wait, but wait, but wait in 1986, in 1986, which is if I'm correct, like 40 years ago,
[02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:19.780]   he left Boeing to pursue comedy, writing and performing for the local sketch television show
[02:01:19.780 --> 02:01:24.780]   Almost Live, where he regularly conducted wacky science experiments.
[02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:29.780]   So, so I guess, yeah, he was an engineer.
[02:01:29.780 --> 02:01:32.780]   He had an engineer, mechanical engineering background.
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:33.780]   I don't know.
[02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:37.780]   Is mechanical engineering a science or is it a applied science?
[02:01:37.780 --> 02:01:38.780]   It's close enough.
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:39.780]   It's more than I have.
[02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:40.780]   I have a Chinese.
[02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:42.780]   I don't even have a degree.
[02:01:42.780 --> 02:01:43.780]   I studied Chinese.
[02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:44.780]   So nothing.
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:46.780]   I get nothing.
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:52.780]   Anyway, so I apologize, Bill Nye, for be smurching you.
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:55.780]   He is a science guy.
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:02:04.780]   I'm avoiding the other depressing story, which is that.
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:06.780]   Hachikusis?
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:07.780]   Yes.
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:09.780]   How did you know?
[02:02:09.780 --> 02:02:15.780]   I, you know, as someone who is very excited about hot tubs, I was like, Oh, no, Hachikusis.
[02:02:15.780 --> 02:02:16.780]   Well, don't worry.
[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:17.780]   Those are particle boards inside.
[02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:22.780]   There's not much they could do to you if they hack your jacuzzi, but they can't apparently,
[02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:25.780]   you know, get your name, address, and phone number.
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:26.780]   That's about it.
[02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:27.780]   Yeah.
[02:02:27.780 --> 02:02:28.780]   It's not the worst.
[02:02:28.780 --> 02:02:29.780]   Yeah.
[02:02:29.780 --> 02:02:30.780]   It's not the worst.
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:32.780]   What, what, what story were you avoiding, Bill?
[02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:42.780]   I was going to be talking about the one where it turns out that aviation fuel for small planes is still leaded and has been for years, which is incredibly depressing, especially.
[02:02:42.780 --> 02:02:47.780]   My IQ is like seven points lower because I'm a child of the leaded gasoline area.
[02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:48.780]   Oh my God.
[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:51.780]   Well, that's a relief because if you were any smarter.
[02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:53.780]   Yeah, we've terrified.
[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:54.780]   You would be Alexa.
[02:02:54.780 --> 02:02:55.780]   Yeah, he could.
[02:02:55.780 --> 02:02:56.960]   You'd be lambd
[02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:01.780]   A lot of, a lot of small airports though are near residential neighborhoods.
[02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:06.780]   And this lead is very much a reason why children have lower IQs.
[02:03:06.780 --> 02:03:08.780]   Health problems is not a good thing.
[02:03:08.780 --> 02:03:13.780]   And of course, leaded gasoline was eliminated years ago, but apparently not.
[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:16.780]   There's a hundred ninety-
[02:03:16.780 --> 02:03:17.780]   Is this just small?
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:19.780]   No, it's small planes.
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:23.780]   One hundred ninety-two million gallon a year loophole.
[02:03:23.780 --> 02:03:27.780]   This is quartz, which kind of discovered this.
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:33.780]   If you're a piston engine airplane, there's a hundred seventy thousand of them.
[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:37.780]   You are because you need the compression ratio of lead.
[02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:39.780]   In fact, they really haven't found a solution for it.
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:43.780]   They're still trying to make a gasoline that would work in these small planes.
[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:45.780]   600 tiny hamsters.
[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:46.780]   Yeah.
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:53.780]   Quartz just published a six-month investigation about how aviation fuel is poisoning a generation
[02:03:53.780 --> 02:03:54.780]   of Americans.
[02:03:54.780 --> 02:03:59.780]   And after decades of delays in resistance by oil companies, aircraft manufacturers, even
[02:03:59.780 --> 02:04:05.780]   federal agencies, there may be a solution in Ada, Oklahoma.
[02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:07.780]   So thank you, Quartz.
[02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:11.780]   And of course, they have video of small planes flying over playgrounds because-
[02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:13.780]   Wait, what is the solution?
[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:17.780]   A new kind of, I guess, gasoline.
[02:04:17.780 --> 02:04:19.780]   Oh, it looks like the hamsters?
[02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:20.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:22.780]   No, it's not hamsters.
[02:04:22.780 --> 02:04:26.780]   Would you fly in an electric-powered plane?
[02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:27.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:27.780 --> 02:04:31.780]   Does that sound freakier or- No, no, no, I'd do it.
[02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:32.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:32.780 --> 02:04:35.780]   The problem is distance, of course.
[02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:36.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:39.780]   Because the batteries are very heavy and they, you know, you can't carry enough battery
[02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:46.780]   in a long way.
[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:51.780]   I think actually there are- I'm not a fan of hydrogen fuel cells for personal vehicles.
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:58.780]   Although Mike Elgensson loves his Toyota Mirai because he lives next door to a hydrogen
[02:04:58.780 --> 02:04:59.780]   fuel station.
[02:04:59.780 --> 02:05:02.780]   There's a hydrogen plane in termination shock.
[02:05:02.780 --> 02:05:05.780]   Remember, she had to land every 100-something miles.
[02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:06.780]   Yeah, right.
[02:05:06.780 --> 02:05:06.780]   But it does- fuel cells make more sense for long-distance trucking, for things that need a lot of energy in a small
[02:05:06.780 --> 02:05:07.780]   space and airplanes.
[02:05:07.780 --> 02:05:10.780]   But yeah, but you don't have the infrastructure yet.
[02:05:10.780 --> 02:05:12.780]   She had to land all the time.
[02:05:12.780 --> 02:05:15.780]   It was very frustrating.
[02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:16.780]   Let's see.
[02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:21.780]   You ready for the top 50 most popular websites for news in the world?
[02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:26.780]   I don't care if you are Jeff Jarvis's and here they are.
[02:05:26.780 --> 02:05:27.780]   I bet you put this in here, right?
[02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:28.780]   No, I didn't.
[02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:29.780]   Oh, I must have done it for you.
[02:05:29.780 --> 02:05:30.780]   Just on here.
[02:05:30.780 --> 02:05:31.780]   No.
[02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:33.780]   Maybe, maybe, maybe Jason did.
[02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:34.780]   I got it in.
[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:37.780]   The top- oh no, you know what?
[02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:38.780]   Maybe it was me.
[02:05:38.780 --> 02:05:39.780]   Maybe it was me.
[02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:42.780]   I saw this and thought of you.
[02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:45.780]   New York Times, you're on your growth.
[02:05:45.780 --> 02:05:47.780]   Oh, I know I put this in here.
[02:05:47.780 --> 02:05:49.780]   36% this year.
[02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:50.780]   Why?
[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:51.780]   Wertle.
[02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:52.780]   Wertle.
[02:05:52.780 --> 02:05:58.780]   They bought Wertle for not a lot of money.
[02:05:58.780 --> 02:06:01.780]   Six figures, I think, is like low millions.
[02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:08.780]   And it has powered 301,000 new subscribers in the first quarter alone.
[02:06:08.780 --> 02:06:09.780]   Subscribers?
[02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:11.780]   Subscribers to news.
[02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:15.780]   No, it's subscribers to Wertle.
[02:06:15.780 --> 02:06:17.780]   And that's got to learn the new Wertle.
[02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:19.780]   Yeah, yeah, it's funny, isn't it?
[02:06:19.780 --> 02:06:21.780]   I play it, but I don't pay for anything.
[02:06:21.780 --> 02:06:24.780]   It's, am I still considered a subscriber?
[02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:26.780]   You play a Wertle for free?
[02:06:26.780 --> 02:06:28.780]   No, you're what we call a freeloader.
[02:06:28.780 --> 02:06:29.780]   Oh, I didn't know you could play it for free.
[02:06:29.780 --> 02:06:30.780]   All right.
[02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:31.780]   Yeah, I haven't paid for anything.
[02:06:31.780 --> 02:06:34.780]   I still play it when I remember.
[02:06:34.780 --> 02:06:37.780]   I've given them my information.
[02:06:37.780 --> 02:06:40.780]   Number two says New York Times in the URL.
[02:06:40.780 --> 02:06:45.780]   In terms of fastest growing sites, New York Post, where Mertox, New York Post.
[02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:49.780]   Daily Mail, number three, Mertox Daily Mail.
[02:06:49.780 --> 02:06:51.780]   Both tabloids.
[02:06:51.780 --> 02:06:55.780]   And you talk about junk, msn.com, number four.
[02:06:55.780 --> 02:06:59.780]   I tell you what, I know exactly how.
[02:06:59.780 --> 02:07:02.780]   It's Windows 11, and you'll see how.
[02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:04.780]   It's foisted upon everybody.
[02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:05.780]   That's Windows 11.
[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:09.780]   Oh, it shows up in all the wrong places.
[02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:14.780]   If you move your mouse to the left, if you do a search, M is in.
[02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:16.780]   And it's terrible.
[02:07:16.780 --> 02:07:17.780]   It's the worst.
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:20.780]   CNN flat, year on year growth.
[02:07:20.780 --> 02:07:22.780]   CNBC flat.
[02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:24.780]   Fox News down a percent.
[02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:26.780]   That's the Trump effect, right?
[02:07:26.780 --> 02:07:28.780]   Finance, Yahoo!
[02:07:28.780 --> 02:07:31.780]   Finance down 5% Washington Post down 6%.
[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:32.780]   Uh-oh.
[02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:41.780]   And that's 7% down for news.google.com.
[02:07:41.780 --> 02:07:42.780]   Anything to say about that?
[02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:43.780]   This is the 20th.
[02:07:43.780 --> 02:07:48.780]   In fact, I'm not at an event just today that I was invited to to mark the 20th birthday
[02:07:48.780 --> 02:07:49.780]   of Google News.
[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:50.780]   Crystal Burmese.
[02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:52.780]   I like Google News.
[02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:57.780]   I like Google News.
[02:07:57.780 --> 02:07:59.780]   Compare to MSN or Apple News.
[02:07:59.780 --> 02:08:02.780]   Google at least gives me pretty good stories.
[02:08:02.780 --> 02:08:05.780]   They stopped your top 5, though, which I'm disappointed.
[02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:06.780]   I like that.
[02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:10.780]   Google News, they're every time-- oh, sorry, it's talking to me.
[02:08:10.780 --> 02:08:14.780]   Every time I search something new, it decides that's my new favorite thing.
[02:08:14.780 --> 02:08:15.780]   Oh, I know.
[02:08:15.780 --> 02:08:17.780]   They're a little too much on the algorithms.
[02:08:17.780 --> 02:08:19.780]   It has a redesign today.
[02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:20.780]   That could be a change log.
[02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:21.780]   I don't know.
[02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:22.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:08:22.780 --> 02:08:23.780]   I'm not going to say that.

[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:06.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:06.780 --> 02:09:07.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:07.780 --> 02:09:08.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:08.780 --> 02:09:09.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:09.780 --> 02:09:10.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:11.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:11.780 --> 02:09:12.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:13.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:14.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:15.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:15.780 --> 02:09:16.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:16.780 --> 02:09:17.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:18.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:18.780 --> 02:09:19.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:20.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:21.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:21.780 --> 02:09:22.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:22.780 --> 02:09:23.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:23.780 --> 02:09:24.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:24.780 --> 02:09:25.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:25.780 --> 02:09:26.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:27.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:27.780 --> 02:09:28.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:29.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:30.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:31.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:31.780 --> 02:09:32.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:33.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:34.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:34.780 --> 02:09:35.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:35.780 --> 02:09:36.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:37.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:38.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:39.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:40.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:41.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:42.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:42.780 --> 02:09:43.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:43.780 --> 02:09:44.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:45.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:46.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:46.780 --> 02:09:47.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:48.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:49.780]   I'm not going to say that.
[02:09:49.780 --> 02:09:53.780]   I didn't finish the top 50 English language news sites in the US by number of visits.
[02:09:53.780 --> 02:09:54.780]   Number one, CNN.
[02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:59.500]   Yeah, they didn't grow, but they are number one.
[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:07.780]   Then the New York Times, then MSN, that's totally because of Windows, then Fox News, news.google.com.
[02:10:07.780 --> 02:10:11.780]   Yahoo Finance, Washington Post, New York Post Daily Mail, CNBC.
[02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:12.780]   We're out at the top 10.
[02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:13.780]   Guardian used to be top 10.
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:14.780]   I still 16.
[02:10:14.780 --> 02:10:16.780]   Oh, that's too bad because I really like the Guardian.
[02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:18.780]   USA Today 13.
[02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:19.780]   People.com 14.
[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:23.780]   Do you think closing the magazine down will impact that?
[02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:25.780]   I wonder if it'll go up or down.
[02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:29.780]   Wall Street Journal is only 17, but it's pay wall.
[02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:30.780]   It's expensive.
[02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:32.780]   Well, there's a lot of stuff there.
[02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:34.780]   They're going to start like their own wire cutter.
[02:10:34.780 --> 02:10:38.780]   They're doing more stuff outside the pay wall to try to goose the audience.
[02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:41.780]   That's where the Times did a very good job, right?
[02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:42.780]   Because Wordles free.
[02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:43.780]   But...
[02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:47.780]   Actually, I don't know what what.
[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:50.780]   Because they want people to convert.
[02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:55.460]   Martin Nissenholz, who was the first VP of news at the Times, people went after him and
[02:10:55.460 --> 02:10:56.460]   said, "It's original sin.
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:57.460]   You give away the content."
[02:10:57.460 --> 02:10:58.700]   And he said, "We hadn't done that.
[02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:02.700]   We would never be as big as we are to convert 2% to paid."
[02:11:02.700 --> 02:11:04.500]   Right.
[02:11:04.500 --> 02:11:06.940]   That's the key is you got to convert a certain percentage.
[02:11:06.940 --> 02:11:08.420]   Is it only 2%?
[02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:09.420]   No.
[02:11:09.420 --> 02:11:11.780]   Yeah, it's mostly 2% to 3%.
[02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:14.500]   You know, of paid news out of the total audience.
[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:17.620]   The total audience is huge.
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:19.460]   But that's a lot better than any other news site.
[02:11:19.460 --> 02:11:25.620]   If you go to the PODUNK Daily Disgrace in any metro area, conversion is 0.3%.
[02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:27.620]   And the audience is lots more.
[02:11:27.620 --> 02:11:28.620]   I'm an...
[02:11:28.620 --> 02:11:29.620]   I subscribe to Daily Disgrace.
[02:11:29.620 --> 02:11:30.620]   I'll subscribe to my Daily Disgrace.
[02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:31.620]   And it's excellent.
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:33.940]   The Daily Disgrace is very, very...
[02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:35.820]   I pay for the Daily Disgrace.
[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:36.820]   You do too, Stacey?
[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:38.940]   I pay for three day.
[02:11:38.940 --> 02:11:42.620]   I pay for my city paper at the Bainbridge Island Review.
[02:11:42.620 --> 02:11:43.620]   Is it called the...
[02:11:43.620 --> 02:11:45.740]   It should be called the Bainbridge Bugle.
[02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:46.740]   It's not...
[02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:48.340]   It's the Bainbridge Island Review.
[02:11:48.340 --> 02:11:52.540]   I pay for the Kitsap County Sun and I pay for the Seattle Times.
[02:11:52.540 --> 02:11:53.540]   Good for you.
[02:11:53.540 --> 02:11:56.260]   And I pay for the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.
[02:11:56.260 --> 02:11:58.260]   Oh yeah, I stop paying for the Wall Street Journal.
[02:11:58.260 --> 02:11:59.260]   I stop paying for the Wall Street Journal.
[02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:00.260]   Oh God, no.
[02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:01.260]   No, it's all digital.
[02:12:01.260 --> 02:12:02.260]   All right.
[02:12:02.260 --> 02:12:03.260]   I just subscribe...
[02:12:03.260 --> 02:12:04.980]   I do it with a print paper.
[02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:10.780]   I just subscribe to my first sub stack and it made me feel weird, but I really wanted
[02:12:10.780 --> 02:12:11.780]   to read this.
[02:12:11.780 --> 02:12:14.020]   Do you know Seth Abrams?
[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:16.020]   Abrams and...
[02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:20.100]   I don't have a proof.
[02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:22.260]   He's kind of an independent investigative reporter.
[02:12:22.260 --> 02:12:24.940]   It's only five bucks a month.
[02:12:24.940 --> 02:12:26.900]   He kind of backs up his conspiracies.
[02:12:26.900 --> 02:12:30.740]   He's got almost a million subscribers though, so that's a lot of money.
[02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:31.740]   Wow.
[02:12:31.740 --> 02:12:34.380]   Is it a conspiracy thing?
[02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:35.380]   No.
[02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:38.540]   No, he's on the edge of...
[02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:39.540]   He's left-wing.
[02:12:39.540 --> 02:12:40.540]   He's like the left-wing drudge.
[02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:43.700]   Yeah, that's what I wanted to put it.
[02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:44.700]   Yeah.
[02:12:44.700 --> 02:12:45.700]   But I like that.
[02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:46.700]   He's wrong.
[02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:49.060]   I'm just saying that he's out there farther.
[02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:58.740]   I feel like he's actually manic because there's some people that just...
[02:12:58.740 --> 02:13:01.580]   There's so much content.
[02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:04.100]   He must be like never sleep.
[02:13:04.100 --> 02:13:08.340]   He has a whole page of notable people who subscribe.
[02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:09.340]   You know?
[02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:12.340]   That his Twitter feed is still constant.
[02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:13.340]   Yeah.
[02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:17.340]   Well, that's how I got into it because he was very smart.
[02:13:17.340 --> 02:13:18.340]   He teased.
[02:13:18.340 --> 02:13:24.740]   He had a Twitter tweet storm about January 6th and he said, "If you want to read more,
[02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:27.140]   it's all in proof.
[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:29.380]   That's how he got me.
[02:13:29.380 --> 02:13:31.340]   That's how he got me."
[02:13:31.340 --> 02:13:32.340]   I probably...
[02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:33.340]   You know what?
[02:13:33.340 --> 02:13:36.300]   It's probably a waste of money because I probably never read it.
[02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:37.300]   You could see.
[02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:38.300]   So John, you subscribe?
[02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:40.660]   No, my bowl is full of food.
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:41.820]   Oh, you're aware of it.
[02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:43.100]   Oh, because of his Twitter feed.
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:47.860]   He says in his Twitter feed, "930,000 subscribers a month."
[02:13:47.860 --> 02:13:51.660]   So at $5 each, that's a pretty...
[02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:52.860]   You're making some money.
[02:13:52.860 --> 02:13:53.860]   That's...
[02:13:53.860 --> 02:13:54.860]   Right.
[02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:55.860]   Yeah.
[02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:56.860]   So there...
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:14:04.140]   Oh, Leo, you did a horrible disservice on this SpaceX dish.
[02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:05.380]   Let's do it.
[02:14:05.380 --> 02:14:06.380]   5G story.
[02:14:06.380 --> 02:14:07.380]   SpaceX.
[02:14:07.380 --> 02:14:08.380]   No, no, I did.
[02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:09.380]   I was just...
[02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:11.420]   That was called a hot take from reading the headline.
[02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:12.420]   Oh, no.
[02:14:12.420 --> 02:14:13.420]   Okay.
[02:14:13.420 --> 02:14:15.140]   So here's the deal.
[02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:18.180]   They're fighting over 12 gigahertz spectrum.
[02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:19.660]   So both of them...
[02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:22.020]   Well, dish is like, "We can share."
[02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:28.100]   And SpaceX is like, "No, we can't because our satellite dishes currently the way they're
[02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:32.220]   designed, there will be interference with the 12 gigahertz spectrum."
[02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:33.220]   So basically...
[02:14:33.220 --> 02:14:34.420]   So this is just dishes.
[02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:36.260]   This is just dishes 5G.
[02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:37.420]   Not anybody else's 5G.
[02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:38.420]   Yeah.
[02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:39.420]   This is dishes 5G.
[02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:41.820]   It's dish doing a spectrum grab.
[02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:44.620]   Or rather trying to do one.
[02:14:44.620 --> 02:14:49.340]   So in dish has done this before, I should never have said that because Charlie Ergin
[02:14:49.340 --> 02:14:51.180]   will come after me.
[02:14:51.180 --> 02:14:52.180]   Go on.
[02:14:52.180 --> 02:15:00.380]   But dish says the opening, the 12 gigahertz range to 5G represents a win-win for all involved.
[02:15:00.380 --> 02:15:01.380]   Okay.
[02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:02.380]   Yeah.
[02:15:02.380 --> 02:15:03.540]   So this is straight up.
[02:15:03.540 --> 02:15:08.140]   We had this with like, remember the DTV transition back in 2008.
[02:15:08.140 --> 02:15:09.900]   I mean, this is very common.
[02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:14.020]   So what's going to happen is the FCC is actually going to have to do its job, which it's actually
[02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:18.740]   really good at it has the technical expertise to assess this.
[02:15:18.740 --> 02:15:20.260]   There is probably interference.
[02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:24.220]   It's probably an issue of like, "Hey, SpaceX, you're going to have to put more shielding
[02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:25.420]   on your dishes.
[02:15:25.420 --> 02:15:29.300]   It might narrow the capabilities of SpaceX to do this."
[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:35.580]   In dish will have to do something with like probably guard bams to help reduce that interference.
[02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:38.580]   But this is actually an interesting and meaty story.
[02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:39.580]   Thank you.
[02:15:39.580 --> 02:15:41.500]   No, I'm glad you looked it up.
[02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:44.100]   I mean, literally, I didn't even know about it till I looked at it.
[02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:45.100]   Okay.
[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:46.100]   I read the article.
[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:47.820]   And it's analysis.
[02:15:47.820 --> 02:15:51.700]   SpaceX claims, and again, the FCC will be the ultimate arbiter here.
[02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:56.060]   SpaceX claims some amount of harmful interference from terrestrial mobile service within the
[02:15:56.060 --> 02:16:01.820]   12.2 to 12.7 gigabits gigabyte Hertz.
[02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:02.820]   Giga Hertz.
[02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:04.420]   Yeah, there's an extra B in there.
[02:16:04.420 --> 02:16:06.260]   And this might be a typo.
[02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:14.060]   The 12.2 to 12.7 GHZ, it should be not GBHC spectra, would occur about 77% of the time,
[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:18.140]   which could result in full Starlink outages three quarters of the time.
[02:16:18.140 --> 02:16:23.500]   Yeah, but this is an issue of like, is this real interference or did you just design your
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:24.500]   equipment back there?
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:25.500]   Right.
[02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:26.500]   Like remember all the way around this spectrometry.
[02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:28.300]   Well, that's the altimeter problem, right?
[02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:29.300]   Exactly.
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:30.300]   It's altimeter problem.
[02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:31.300]   It's the wireless mic problem.
[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:35.340]   And to be fair, you design for the cheapest constraints you have to work with, right?
[02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:39.420]   So if there's nothing in that band, and then what always happens is when you start using
[02:16:39.420 --> 02:16:42.780]   that band for everything else, you're like, oh crap.
[02:16:42.780 --> 02:16:43.780]   Yeah.
[02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:44.780]   So.
[02:16:44.780 --> 02:16:45.780]   So, yeah.
[02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:46.780]   So that's it.
[02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:48.580]   I just, I, sorry, I had to go back.
[02:16:48.580 --> 02:16:50.540]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:16:50.540 --> 02:16:52.580]   I count on you for that.
[02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:53.940]   No, thank you.
[02:16:53.940 --> 02:16:55.940]   I appreciate it.
[02:16:55.940 --> 02:16:57.780]   Really important.
[02:16:57.780 --> 02:16:58.880]   I didn't want to misrepresent it.
[02:16:58.880 --> 02:17:05.260]   I just, you know, I could see why they might not like Verizon doing it, but dish doesn't
[02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:06.260]   even have a product yet.
[02:17:06.260 --> 02:17:09.980]   This was part of the T-Mobile Sprint merger.
[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:13.500]   T-Mobile promised that, oh no, no, no, don't worry.
[02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:14.700]   You're not going to lose a carrier.
[02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:17.740]   You're going to gain dish as a 5G carrier.
[02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:19.380]   Dish had no infrastructure.
[02:17:19.380 --> 02:17:20.900]   Hadn't set it up at all.
[02:17:20.900 --> 02:17:25.220]   Now they're rushing to set it up, which is good, I guess, except that sounds like they're
[02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:29.980]   doing so in a way that is potentially bad for others.
[02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:36.780]   So, dishes only 5G phone right now cost $900.
[02:17:36.780 --> 02:17:37.780]   Yeah.
[02:17:37.780 --> 02:17:38.780]   It's the Motorola Edge Plus.
[02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:39.780]   That's crazy dish.
[02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:40.780]   Yeah.
[02:17:40.780 --> 02:17:46.260]   I think this was a bill of goods that T-Mobile sold the, sold the FTC to allow them to merge
[02:17:46.260 --> 02:17:48.700]   with Sprint.
[02:17:48.700 --> 02:17:50.940]   And I think it was a, it was a bogus.
[02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:53.940]   I don't think dish really was ready to do it.
[02:17:53.940 --> 02:17:57.460]   Dish is always, okay.
[02:17:57.460 --> 02:18:00.180]   Charlie Ergin, who is the chairman of dish.
[02:18:00.180 --> 02:18:03.260]   I know well, I've been on, I've been on Charlie's show.
[02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:05.380]   He has a show?
[02:18:05.380 --> 02:18:06.380]   Charlie Chat.
[02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:07.380]   Yeah.
[02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:09.980]   That was a guest on Charlie Chat.
[02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:12.180]   I flew out to Denver and everything.
[02:18:12.180 --> 02:18:13.180]   Wow.
[02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:14.180]   Wow.
[02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:16.300]   I've done something for dish, but did I meet Charlie?
[02:18:16.300 --> 02:18:17.300]   I don't know.
[02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:18.300]   I can't remember.
[02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:22.180]   There was many years ago, this was when dish was just getting started.
[02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:27.380]   So dish is trying to cover 20% of the US and they're going to do that, they think.
[02:18:27.380 --> 02:18:28.380]   Yeah.
[02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:34.620]   People, but this additional stuff, Charlie is very famous for just...
[02:18:34.620 --> 02:18:36.660]   He's a tough guy.
[02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:37.660]   He's all the...
[02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:39.420]   He goes through the FCC.
[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:40.420]   Yeah.
[02:18:40.420 --> 02:18:41.420]   Does it?
[02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:42.420]   Yeah.
[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:43.420]   So he's one of those folk.
[02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:44.420]   They...
[02:18:44.420 --> 02:18:45.780]   So this does not surprise me.
[02:18:45.780 --> 02:18:52.260]   They were actually in a fight with T-Mobile because T-Mobile wants to shut down the 3G network.
[02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:56.700]   And dish was fighting with them.
[02:18:56.700 --> 02:18:58.700]   And it has.
[02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:00.260]   Hasn't it been shut down right now?
[02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:01.260]   Yes.
[02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:02.980]   They shut it down on March 31st.
[02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:05.540]   Like it was recently, right?
[02:19:05.540 --> 02:19:06.540]   Yeah.
[02:19:06.540 --> 02:19:10.620]   This recently, this story came out today, I think.
[02:19:10.620 --> 02:19:13.060]   Oh no, on February.
[02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:15.180]   Dish appears to be mending fences with T-Mobile.
[02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:19.860]   Ergin also said, "In February, AT&T will still remain our primary vendor in the one we work
[02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:22.620]   with on a day-to-day basis.
[02:19:22.620 --> 02:19:25.300]   Dish had struck a 10-year, $5 billion wholesale deal.
[02:19:25.300 --> 02:19:31.660]   Oh, there are going to be an MVNO for AT&T."
[02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:35.740]   Dish owns Boost Mobile, Ting Mobile, and Republic Wireless.
[02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:37.460]   That I didn't know.
[02:19:37.460 --> 02:19:38.660]   They've been buying up.
[02:19:38.660 --> 02:19:41.860]   Ting used to be two cows.
[02:19:41.860 --> 02:19:43.180]   They've been buying them up.
[02:19:43.180 --> 02:19:47.020]   They own Boost Mobile, Ting Mobile, and Republic Wireless.
[02:19:47.020 --> 02:19:48.020]   Wow.
[02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:49.020]   Okay.
[02:19:49.020 --> 02:19:50.020]   Wow.
[02:19:50.020 --> 02:19:52.620]   Oh, Ting was sold in August of 2020.
[02:19:52.620 --> 02:19:53.620]   Yeah.
[02:19:53.620 --> 02:19:56.460]   Yeah, they weren't advertising for a while.
[02:19:56.460 --> 02:19:57.460]   Yeah.
[02:19:57.460 --> 02:20:02.060]   In fact, we still use Ting for my father-in-law.
[02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:07.900]   Dish confirmed it sunk about $250 million into costs related to the CDMA shutdown fiasco.
[02:20:07.900 --> 02:20:08.900]   All right.
[02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:15.980]   Sorry, I just had to circle back on that because I was like, "Wait a second."
[02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:17.460]   Much respect.
[02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:23.260]   If there's one thing I know, it's spectrum.
[02:20:23.260 --> 02:20:28.420]   Ting Mobile was supposed to help Dish create a competitive replacement for Sprint, but they've
[02:20:28.420 --> 02:20:33.420]   been fighting ever since to sell regulators in their $26 billion mega merger.
[02:20:33.420 --> 02:20:37.460]   Ting Mobile and Sprint executives told anyone who'd listened the deal would provide near
[02:20:37.460 --> 02:20:38.620]   miraculous benefits.
[02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:46.340]   Economists warned that US telecom mergers are problematic and promises are historically
[02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:50.700]   meaningless and that the reduction in overall competitors was sooner or later result in
[02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:53.140]   higher prices and job cuts.
[02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:56.940]   US antitrust enforcers concocted an elaborate workaround.
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:20:58.140]   This is from the Verge.
[02:20:58.140 --> 02:21:03.700]   They would erect Dish Network as the nation's new fourth major wireless carrier under the
[02:21:03.700 --> 02:21:07.100]   plan Dish received some T-Mobile spectrum.
[02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:10.780]   That's how they got Boost Mobile and the insurance at T-Mobile would help Dish run a
[02:21:10.780 --> 02:21:15.700]   mobile virtual network operator, but then they got in a fight.
[02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:19.300]   Now they're replacing T-Mobile with AT&T.
[02:21:19.300 --> 02:21:20.940]   What a mess.
[02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:24.140]   You don't want to be a telecom reporter.
[02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:25.140]   I was a telecom reporter.
[02:21:25.140 --> 02:21:26.140]   I know.
[02:21:26.140 --> 02:21:27.140]   It was super fun.
[02:21:27.140 --> 02:21:28.140]   Wasn't?
[02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:30.540]   Gosh, it seems like there are such characters.
[02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:31.540]   They're characters.
[02:21:31.540 --> 02:21:32.540]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:21:32.540 --> 02:21:35.980]   I mean, I don't know.
[02:21:35.980 --> 02:21:38.740]   It's way more fun than being a social media reporter.
[02:21:38.740 --> 02:21:40.540]   Yeah, I agree.
[02:21:40.540 --> 02:21:41.940]   No, and it's chewier.
[02:21:41.940 --> 02:21:42.940]   There's more than--
[02:21:42.940 --> 02:21:50.420]   Yeah, and there's physics, and you can't argue with physics, and I love that because
[02:21:50.420 --> 02:21:52.740]   people will be like, "We're going to do this," and I'm like, "How would you do that?
[02:21:52.740 --> 02:21:54.140]   That doesn't make sense."
[02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:55.580]   Right, right.
[02:21:55.580 --> 02:21:56.580]   Let's see.
[02:21:56.580 --> 02:21:58.700]   Oh my God, we got to get going here.
[02:21:58.700 --> 02:22:00.140]   Let's try-- let's do the change log.
[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:01.140]   Why don't we do that?
[02:22:01.140 --> 02:22:02.140]   Let's do the change log.
[02:22:02.140 --> 02:22:03.140]   Yeah, let's do the action.
[02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:04.140]   Roll time.
[02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:05.140]   Roll time's sake.
[02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:06.140]   You remember this.
[02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:08.140]   We used to do this all the time.
[02:22:08.140 --> 02:22:14.300]   The Google Change Log.
[02:22:14.300 --> 02:22:18.140]   Yes, Google News is 20 years old, and you're right.
[02:22:18.140 --> 02:22:23.380]   It is part of our change log today, but it's only on the desktop, the redesign.
[02:22:23.380 --> 02:22:32.020]   news.google.com has a new, fresh look and a brand new briefing and customized topic.
[02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:33.820]   Shall we try it out?
[02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:34.820]   Ta-da.
[02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:35.820]   Ta-da-da-da-da.
[02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:37.820]   Oh, that's-- yeah?
[02:22:37.820 --> 02:22:39.380]   Looks just like the ruin.
[02:22:39.380 --> 02:22:40.380]   It was dark mode.
[02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:41.380]   Oh, OK.
[02:22:41.380 --> 02:22:42.860]   Let me see if I can change that for you.
[02:22:42.860 --> 02:22:44.860]   Keep it on dark mode, Jesper.
[02:22:44.860 --> 02:22:45.860]   Yeah, let's see.
[02:22:45.860 --> 02:22:47.020]   Oh, I can't.
[02:22:47.020 --> 02:22:48.940]   You care about your eyes.
[02:22:48.940 --> 02:22:50.700]   Never, never dark theme.
[02:22:50.700 --> 02:22:51.700]   Oh, so bright.
[02:22:51.700 --> 02:22:52.940]   And like there be light.
[02:22:52.940 --> 02:22:54.700]   Doesn't that hurt your eyes?
[02:22:54.700 --> 02:22:55.700]   Mm.
[02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:56.700]   All right.
[02:22:56.700 --> 02:22:59.100]   I'm just painful.
[02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:00.100]   So yeah, I--
[02:23:00.100 --> 02:23:02.020]   You're getting the binary life slipping.
[02:23:02.020 --> 02:23:05.780]   It was foolish of them to do the top of your top five stories.
[02:23:05.780 --> 02:23:07.340]   Because I like that feature.
[02:23:07.340 --> 02:23:10.460]   They don't do that anymore.
[02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:11.860]   I do think that Google-- you know what?
[02:23:11.860 --> 02:23:13.700]   I am going to use this page more.
[02:23:13.700 --> 02:23:17.620]   I do feel like this is a good summary of kind of the things I've been discussing.
[02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:18.620]   You know what I have to do?
[02:23:18.620 --> 02:23:20.100]   I don't know if it's going to be better now.
[02:23:20.100 --> 02:23:27.460]   Because I do my research to clutter up the rundown every week.
[02:23:27.460 --> 02:23:31.380]   I go in and I used to type in Google in Google News.
[02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:35.940]   And I got-- hey, that's better now.
[02:23:35.940 --> 02:23:44.020]   Because if you actually just search for the word Google, and then go to the News tab,
[02:23:44.020 --> 02:23:45.020]   it's better.
[02:23:45.020 --> 02:23:46.020]   Oh.
[02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:47.020]   Different.
[02:23:47.020 --> 02:23:49.660]   That's the original Google News.
[02:23:49.660 --> 02:23:53.420]   Yes, I hope they don't deprecate it because shh.
[02:23:53.420 --> 02:23:56.020]   Something Google didn't kill yet.
[02:23:56.020 --> 02:23:57.940]   So what do you do?
[02:23:57.940 --> 02:24:00.140]   You search for the word Google.
[02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:01.140]   Google.
[02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:02.140]   Google.
[02:24:02.140 --> 02:24:03.380]   Poor Google, but you hit News.
[02:24:03.380 --> 02:24:06.660]   And this is the old Google News.
[02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:08.980]   This is the old Google News much better on the search.
[02:24:08.980 --> 02:24:11.060]   No, this is News about Google.
[02:24:11.060 --> 02:24:12.260]   Oh, I like this, dude.
[02:24:12.260 --> 02:24:14.100]   This is not-- oh, no, that's what I meant.
[02:24:14.100 --> 02:24:15.100]   It's News about Google.
[02:24:15.100 --> 02:24:18.700]   It's not what Google News is.
[02:24:18.700 --> 02:24:20.260]   Well, no, no.
[02:24:20.260 --> 02:24:22.940]   Then put it in Facebook.
[02:24:22.940 --> 02:24:29.380]   This is how I get a better search on Google News because the Google News search is sucky.
[02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:30.380]   Who's on first?
[02:24:30.380 --> 02:24:39.620]   So you're saying if I go to as I am now, news.google.com and search for Google, you've got a yucky search
[02:24:39.620 --> 02:24:40.620]   result.
[02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:41.620]   I don't know.
[02:24:41.620 --> 02:24:42.620]   It looks pretty good to me.
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:44.700]   Well, but it's not very deep.
[02:24:44.700 --> 02:24:47.380]   If you now go to the other one, it has a lot more stuff.
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:51.300]   It also brings them into the clusters of stories.
[02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:57.540]   It's brave of Google because, among other stories, it's like, is Google dying from the
[02:24:57.540 --> 02:24:58.540]   Atlantic?
[02:24:58.540 --> 02:24:59.540]   The Atlantic.
[02:24:59.540 --> 02:25:00.540]   Hot take.
[02:25:00.540 --> 02:25:01.540]   Get them while they're hot.
[02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:04.620]   Google faces second, fine, and rush over banned content.
[02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:07.620]   Yeah, they leave all this stuff.
[02:25:07.620 --> 02:25:09.540]   They leave all this stuff and good for them.
[02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:10.540]   I like it anyway.
[02:25:10.540 --> 02:25:13.540]   But also Google News is back in Spain after an eight-year hiatus.
[02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:14.540]   I saw that.
[02:25:14.540 --> 02:25:15.540]   They made a deal.
[02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:18.060]   Yes, they're happy.
[02:25:18.060 --> 02:25:22.020]   So there is a 4U tab in the new Google News.
[02:25:22.020 --> 02:25:26.900]   Let's just see what they think I'd be interested in.
[02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:28.260]   See how accurate.
[02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:31.460]   Here's what the nothing phones real lights, rear lights do.
[02:25:31.460 --> 02:25:34.540]   A Sonoma town hit 106 degrees yesterday.
[02:25:34.540 --> 02:25:36.460]   Yeah, I'm interested in that.
[02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:37.780]   How hot are you?
[02:25:37.780 --> 02:25:43.140]   And then, oh boy, the, the, everybody, Daisy and Gary shock everyone at the below.
[02:25:43.140 --> 02:25:45.140]   Exhaling out season three reunion.
[02:25:45.140 --> 02:25:46.140]   It's gotcha.
[02:25:46.140 --> 02:25:47.140]   Who knows?
[02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:48.140]   They know me.
[02:25:48.140 --> 02:25:49.620]   It drops the mic.
[02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:52.740]   I'll pretend I'm not reading that story later.
[02:25:52.740 --> 02:25:54.700]   Flight cancellations, weather and staffing.
[02:25:54.700 --> 02:25:58.060]   Yes, they know because Google knows that I am flying next week.
[02:25:58.060 --> 02:25:59.900]   They know that, right?
[02:25:59.900 --> 02:26:02.940]   Google password manager now is an Android home screen shortcut.
[02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:04.580]   Wait a minute.
[02:26:04.580 --> 02:26:07.780]   That should be in the change log.
[02:26:07.780 --> 02:26:10.420]   And reviews of the MacBook Pro, Tesla.
[02:26:10.420 --> 02:26:11.820]   So they're pretty, that's pretty good actually.
[02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:13.180]   I'm knowing what I'm interested in.
[02:26:13.180 --> 02:26:14.700]   A lot of local stuff there.
[02:26:14.700 --> 02:26:16.620]   Wait, what's happening with the Queen?
[02:26:16.620 --> 02:26:18.020]   No, that's my news.
[02:26:18.020 --> 02:26:19.020]   Not yours.
[02:26:19.020 --> 02:26:20.020]   All right, you want to know.
[02:26:20.020 --> 02:26:21.820]   Oh, I guarantee the Queen's on my news.
[02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:22.820]   Yeah.
[02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:27.860]   You saw Queen Elizabeth appears to have gotten a post platinum Jubilee.
[02:26:27.860 --> 02:26:33.660]   Oh, I thought, you know, maybe she got a haircut.
[02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:35.860]   Oh, this is People magazine.
[02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:37.500]   I don't need to care about that.
[02:26:37.500 --> 02:26:44.580]   By the way, did they ever put the episode that we played the Paddington the bear clip
[02:26:44.580 --> 02:26:45.580]   with Queen Elizabeth in?
[02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:48.420]   Did they ever put loud that back on YouTubers is still blocked?
[02:26:48.420 --> 02:26:49.940]   No, they took that down.
[02:26:49.940 --> 02:26:50.940]   They took it down.
[02:26:50.940 --> 02:26:51.940]   No.
[02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:52.940]   Was taken down.
[02:26:52.940 --> 02:26:55.620]   Okay, so there were two people who were mad at us.
[02:26:55.620 --> 02:26:58.220]   Demolition man, because I played a little clip of Demolition Man.
[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:01.180]   You may remember this three weeks ago.
[02:27:01.180 --> 02:27:02.820]   But we said, no, no, that's fair use.
[02:27:02.820 --> 02:27:04.660]   And they said, yeah, I guess nobody's watching the movie.
[02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:05.660]   So, okay.
[02:27:05.660 --> 02:27:08.460]   And by the way, I don't understand why they would even want us to take it down.
[02:27:08.460 --> 02:27:11.020]   I played literally 10 seconds.
[02:27:11.020 --> 02:27:12.980]   That makes people watch the movie.
[02:27:12.980 --> 02:27:15.420]   This isn't a place watching the movie.
[02:27:15.420 --> 02:27:16.820]   What are you nuts?
[02:27:16.820 --> 02:27:22.140]   But I did play in full, padding to the bear, taking tea with the Queen.
[02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:28.380]   Because I thought that's newsworthy and surely everybody else is playing it.
[02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:33.420]   It got us not only, we didn't get a strike, they took it down.
[02:27:33.420 --> 02:27:34.420]   Bam.
[02:27:34.420 --> 02:27:36.420]   But it's here now.
[02:27:36.420 --> 02:27:37.420]   I see it.
[02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:38.420]   Yeah, is it back?
[02:27:38.420 --> 02:27:39.420]   Oh good.
[02:27:39.420 --> 02:27:40.420]   Thank you, Studio Canal.
[02:27:40.420 --> 02:27:41.420]   They own Paddington.
[02:27:41.420 --> 02:27:45.100]   But I so I hope they're not going to take down the Queen's new haircut.
[02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:47.860]   I think it just looks like she kind of pushed it back a little bit.
[02:27:47.860 --> 02:27:48.860]   That's all.
[02:27:48.860 --> 02:27:50.860]   It actually doesn't look like a very good haircut.
[02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:52.860]   It looks like a terrible haircut.
[02:27:52.860 --> 02:27:53.860]   Yeah, no, that's all.
[02:27:53.860 --> 02:27:54.860]   Okay, she's 96.
[02:27:54.860 --> 02:27:57.060]   Just we don't care.
[02:27:57.060 --> 02:28:00.740]   She's, you know, apparently people really care.
[02:28:00.740 --> 02:28:02.260]   I love the Queen.
[02:28:02.260 --> 02:28:03.260]   God bless it.
[02:28:03.260 --> 02:28:06.620]   Oh, yeah, I'm just like, we're not going to just harsh on an old woman's haircut.
[02:28:06.620 --> 02:28:07.620]   No, it's beautiful.
[02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:08.620]   It's beautiful.
[02:28:08.620 --> 02:28:10.180]   It's what they did to our Queen.
[02:28:10.180 --> 02:28:12.220]   Yeah, no, she's she's awesome.
[02:28:12.220 --> 02:28:14.860]   She's fantastic.
[02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:20.500]   Every country should have billionaires in running them.
[02:28:20.500 --> 02:28:23.220]   I think I just, you know, it's a good thing.
[02:28:23.220 --> 02:28:24.380]   Google's password man.
[02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:26.020]   Wait a minute.
[02:28:26.020 --> 02:28:27.020]   How did that happen?
[02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:30.740]   Google's password manager now has an Android home screen shortcut.
[02:28:30.740 --> 02:28:33.380]   Yes, Google News.
[02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:34.780]   No.
[02:28:34.780 --> 02:28:38.220]   Is this a is this a widget?
[02:28:38.220 --> 02:28:41.220]   I guess it is.
[02:28:41.220 --> 02:28:43.420]   Google Play Services got an update.
[02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:44.900]   You can access your passwords.
[02:28:44.900 --> 02:28:48.500]   See, I don't put my password manager on the front page because I feel like that's just
[02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:49.500]   asking for trouble.
[02:28:49.500 --> 02:28:50.500]   Yeah.
[02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:51.500]   Right.
[02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:53.500]   Pretend you don't have one.
[02:28:53.500 --> 02:28:55.420]   Don't make it too easy.
[02:28:55.420 --> 02:28:59.620]   Is this the Chrome password storage that you're not supposed to be using anywhere?
[02:28:59.620 --> 02:29:04.500]   Or is this does Google have their own like last pass service?
[02:29:04.500 --> 02:29:08.100]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:29:08.100 --> 02:29:11.300]   You're going to have to read the article.
[02:29:11.300 --> 02:29:16.060]   Yeah, no, it's not Chrome.
[02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:24.140]   It's there is a pass or go to settings, privacy, auto fill service from Google passwords.
[02:29:24.140 --> 02:29:27.380]   Click the gear at a shortcut.
[02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:33.300]   No, Google password manager is what they're storing your stuff in Chrome in.
[02:29:33.300 --> 02:29:34.300]   Okay.
[02:29:34.300 --> 02:29:35.500]   So this is Google pet.
[02:29:35.500 --> 02:29:36.500]   It's the same thing.
[02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:40.860]   So if you store something in Chrome, you end up storing it in your Google password manager.
[02:29:40.860 --> 02:29:42.340]   So it's giving you the link to that.
[02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:44.780]   You can go to passwords.google.com and see them.
[02:29:44.780 --> 02:29:46.780]   They have on device encryption.
[02:29:46.780 --> 02:29:49.060]   Don't just got added.
[02:29:49.060 --> 02:29:50.220]   Don't do it though, right?
[02:29:50.220 --> 02:29:54.740]   Well, I guess if there's on device encryption, I mean, they do make you add like before you
[02:29:54.740 --> 02:29:58.420]   can see any of your passwords, you do have to verify, right?
[02:29:58.420 --> 02:30:03.860]   Yeah, put your it used to be you could see it in the clear in the browser and Google's
[02:30:03.860 --> 02:30:04.860]   answer to that.
[02:30:04.860 --> 02:30:05.860]   Yes.
[02:30:05.860 --> 02:30:06.860]   Really?
[02:30:06.860 --> 02:30:07.860]   This was not too long ago.
[02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:10.260]   Google's answer that is, well, you know, you're on the device.
[02:30:10.260 --> 02:30:11.700]   Of course you can.
[02:30:11.700 --> 02:30:13.740]   Like, well, you must be authenticated.
[02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:15.580]   Yeah, that was not a good answer.
[02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:19.420]   So obviously they've taken it more seriously because yeah, it used to be in the clear, which
[02:30:19.420 --> 02:30:22.260]   was really a good reason not to use it.
[02:30:22.260 --> 02:30:25.460]   Oh, here's the answer to your question.
[02:30:25.460 --> 02:30:31.500]   Chrome 103 replaces built in password list with Android's default manager.
[02:30:31.500 --> 02:30:36.700]   So Android does in fact have a password manager separate from Chrome.
[02:30:36.700 --> 02:30:39.740]   Oh my God.
[02:30:39.740 --> 02:30:41.700]   But it's only on Android.
[02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:45.020]   This explains why I'm always and I switched to LastPass.
[02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:49.060]   But God, everywhere I'm at, I'm just constantly entering passwords.
[02:30:49.060 --> 02:30:50.060]   Pass keys.
[02:30:50.060 --> 02:30:51.460]   Like that's my whole life.
[02:30:51.460 --> 02:30:52.460]   I'm praying.
[02:30:52.460 --> 02:30:54.260]   Pass keys just takes over the world.
[02:30:54.260 --> 02:30:59.540]   Although yesterday on the security now, Steve Gibson, once again, raised issues with
[02:30:59.540 --> 02:31:04.580]   pass keys, the chief of which is and and the final alliance says, yeah, we haven't really
[02:31:04.580 --> 02:31:06.180]   figured out how to do this.
[02:31:06.180 --> 02:31:07.180]   It's non portable.
[02:31:07.180 --> 02:31:10.580]   So if you set up pass keys with your Apple device, you're stuck.
[02:31:10.580 --> 02:31:13.820]   You can't move to an Android device and vice versa.
[02:31:13.820 --> 02:31:21.940]   And the final alliance says, yeah, it would be insecure to allow export a password so we're
[02:31:21.940 --> 02:31:24.100]   not going to.
[02:31:24.100 --> 02:31:27.540]   But every password manager does allow export of passwords for this very reason.
[02:31:27.540 --> 02:31:29.540]   I think it's a very important feature.
[02:31:29.540 --> 02:31:30.540]   So here I am.
[02:31:30.540 --> 02:31:35.420]   I went to passwords.google.com and these are passwords saved in my Google account and
[02:31:35.420 --> 02:31:38.980]   they are to apps as well as to web pages.
[02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:40.820]   So that's good.
[02:31:40.820 --> 02:31:43.540]   There's only you're not supposed to use those.
[02:31:43.540 --> 02:31:44.540]   I mean, oh, I don't.
[02:31:44.540 --> 02:31:45.540]   This is from old.
[02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:46.540]   This is old.
[02:31:46.540 --> 02:31:50.940]   This is like you can do it for things like you're jacuzzi because that's insecure anyway.
[02:31:50.940 --> 02:31:54.020]   But don't do it for like your bank.
[02:31:54.020 --> 02:31:55.340]   It's already insecure.
[02:31:55.340 --> 02:31:56.580]   You're fried anyway.
[02:31:56.580 --> 02:32:00.140]   So that's in Chrome 103 Google password manager.
[02:32:00.140 --> 02:32:01.140]   Wow.
[02:32:01.140 --> 02:32:02.140]   This whole show is about it.
[02:32:02.140 --> 02:32:03.700]   Old changelog.
[02:32:03.700 --> 02:32:06.580]   Google password manager starts offering on device encryption.
[02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:08.620]   I just mentioned that on Android.
[02:32:08.620 --> 02:32:10.740]   iOS and Chrome.
[02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:15.420]   So it is cross platform.
[02:32:15.420 --> 02:32:17.380]   Maybe this isn't a bad choice.
[02:32:17.380 --> 02:32:23.740]   No, the issue is when things are stored in the browser, but they're not.
[02:32:23.740 --> 02:32:25.180]   This is that's a new thing.
[02:32:25.180 --> 02:32:27.780]   This is not Chrome's password manager.
[02:32:27.780 --> 02:32:30.220]   This is a new thing.
[02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:31.220]   Okay.
[02:32:31.220 --> 02:32:32.220]   Maybe.
[02:32:32.220 --> 02:32:34.020]   I don't know.
[02:32:34.020 --> 02:32:35.020]   Yeah.
[02:32:35.020 --> 02:32:36.020]   And it's done on device.
[02:32:36.020 --> 02:32:40.620]   Because it's not just in Chrome is the point.
[02:32:40.620 --> 02:32:41.620]   What is it?
[02:32:41.620 --> 02:32:43.740]   The emotinette or something?
[02:32:43.740 --> 02:32:47.700]   What virus emotinette browser?
[02:32:47.700 --> 02:32:52.300]   The encryption key used to access your passwords is safely stored in your Google account.
[02:32:52.300 --> 02:32:53.820]   So Google has access to it.
[02:32:53.820 --> 02:32:58.540]   And Google then uses this key to decrypt your passwords.
[02:32:58.540 --> 02:33:05.500]   On device encryption cannot be removed once set up and can be enabled on multiple devices.
[02:33:05.500 --> 02:33:12.140]   I, you know, we got to have to investigate this more, but it sounds like Google has kind
[02:33:12.140 --> 02:33:17.220]   of beefed up its password manager beyond Chrome.
[02:33:17.220 --> 02:33:19.860]   It's now, you know, device wide.
[02:33:19.860 --> 02:33:22.980]   It has on device encryption.
[02:33:22.980 --> 02:33:23.980]   Sounds pretty good.
[02:33:23.980 --> 02:33:26.340]   At least it's a free choice.
[02:33:26.340 --> 02:33:27.340]   It's better.
[02:33:27.340 --> 02:33:28.340]   Let's put it that way.
[02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:31.700]   I mean, I think you're right to use last pass or a bit more in our sponsor or some third
[02:33:31.700 --> 02:33:32.700]   party.
[02:33:32.700 --> 02:33:35.700]   Google TV profiles are here.
[02:33:35.700 --> 02:33:39.900]   I signed in my Google TV this morning and it said, Hey, profiles are here.
[02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:41.260]   Who are you?
[02:33:41.260 --> 02:33:42.260]   And I said, I'm Leo.
[02:33:42.260 --> 02:33:44.860]   I said, good.
[02:33:44.860 --> 02:33:49.940]   Now you can click switch account and add other people to your profile and they can have their
[02:33:49.940 --> 02:33:55.860]   own settings and their own memorized shows and so forth and so on.
[02:33:55.860 --> 02:33:57.500]   I actually quite like Google TV.
[02:33:57.500 --> 02:33:58.500]   That's in the newest Chromecast.
[02:33:58.500 --> 02:34:00.420]   And I think it's quite good.
[02:34:00.420 --> 02:34:02.020]   I'm very happy with it.
[02:34:02.020 --> 02:34:05.620]   It's like what the other apps are doing.
[02:34:05.620 --> 02:34:08.100]   Yeah, everybody else does with a platform.
[02:34:08.100 --> 02:34:09.100]   Right.
[02:34:09.100 --> 02:34:10.100]   Right.
[02:34:10.100 --> 02:34:12.540]   Although it's super fun to like totally mess with your family.
[02:34:12.540 --> 02:34:18.460]   Like how many of y'all will watch something like Bridgerton on my husband's Netflix?
[02:34:18.460 --> 02:34:19.820]   Oh, that's so mean.
[02:34:19.820 --> 02:34:20.820]   Stop.
[02:34:20.820 --> 02:34:21.820]   Oh my God.
[02:34:21.820 --> 02:34:22.820]   That is mean.
[02:34:22.820 --> 02:34:26.580]   You know, you might want to watch episode four of Bridgerton.
[02:34:26.580 --> 02:34:28.580]   You've been enjoying it so far.
[02:34:28.580 --> 02:34:29.580]   Good.
[02:34:29.580 --> 02:34:30.580]   How do you feel about Outlander?
[02:34:30.580 --> 02:34:32.500]   And he's like, oh, this looks interesting.
[02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:35.220]   And then he's like, oh, romance show.
[02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:40.620]   Really, do you just watch like period period piece romance shows?
[02:34:40.620 --> 02:34:42.580]   That's your that's your jam.
[02:34:42.580 --> 02:34:43.780]   It's not my only jam.
[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:44.780]   Oh, yeah.
[02:34:44.780 --> 02:34:49.100]   I am like sci-fi period romance, British murder mysteries.
[02:34:49.100 --> 02:34:50.100]   Me too.
[02:34:50.100 --> 02:34:51.740]   And spectrum.
[02:34:51.740 --> 02:34:52.740]   And spectrum.
[02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:59.700]   If they were a TV show about forget the chips radio frequency spectrum, it would be
[02:34:59.700 --> 02:35:04.020]   a hit with one person stays here about them.
[02:35:04.020 --> 02:35:08.780]   Finally, Google Maps dark mode appears broken on Android Auto.
[02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:11.020]   God, there is a God.
[02:35:11.020 --> 02:35:15.780]   Now, come on, when you're driving in your car, you want dark mode.
[02:35:15.780 --> 02:35:18.700]   You don't want the it'll blind you at night.
[02:35:18.700 --> 02:35:22.020]   No, no, you don't want that at night, Mr. Dark.
[02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:23.860]   It's really bad.
[02:35:23.860 --> 02:35:28.140]   Actually, you're not going to like this because it's broken in the sense that it's stuck in
[02:35:28.140 --> 02:35:29.140]   dark mode.
[02:35:29.140 --> 02:35:31.140]   I never put it in dark.
[02:35:31.140 --> 02:35:33.340]   Oh, sounds like it happened to me.
[02:35:33.340 --> 02:35:34.820]   Oh, OK.
[02:35:34.820 --> 02:35:36.820]   All right.
[02:35:36.820 --> 02:35:40.700]   Well, I don't use the Android Auto anyway.
[02:35:40.700 --> 02:35:42.100]   I like my car play.
[02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:43.100]   I admit it.
[02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:44.100]   I admit it.
[02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:49.700]   And that's the Google change law.
[02:35:49.700 --> 02:35:58.020]   And just for Stacy, why America will lose semiconductors, tangible bipartisan solutions
[02:35:58.020 --> 02:36:04.620]   for solving a national security crisis?
[02:36:04.620 --> 02:36:07.980]   Stacy Higginbotham has the story.
[02:36:07.980 --> 02:36:09.980]   I put that in there.
[02:36:09.980 --> 02:36:11.980]   No, no, I jumped.
[02:36:11.980 --> 02:36:12.980]   Why?
[02:36:12.980 --> 02:36:13.980]   Why bring politics into semiconductors?
[02:36:13.980 --> 02:36:15.620]   They're so pure and good.
[02:36:15.620 --> 02:36:19.060]   Oh, that's true.
[02:36:19.060 --> 02:36:20.140]   So we really have been done.
[02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:25.220]   I do not know this, but we have been dominant up to now all the not only the, you know, the
[02:36:25.220 --> 02:36:31.100]   companies, but the conductor, semiconductor equipment companies, the design companies,
[02:36:31.100 --> 02:36:36.780]   the software companies, all U.S. based, the biggest ones, the best known ones.
[02:36:36.780 --> 02:36:38.580]   Yeah, we got really worried about it.
[02:36:38.580 --> 02:36:42.660]   And that's why we started to see equipment manufacturing go overseas.
[02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:43.660]   Right.
[02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:44.660]   We freaked out.
[02:36:44.660 --> 02:36:46.500]   We created some attack.
[02:36:46.500 --> 02:36:50.820]   And that was in the late 80s or early 90s.
[02:36:50.820 --> 02:36:59.060]   That dominance is shifting away, writes the author of this sub-stack piece, Dylan Patel,
[02:36:59.060 --> 02:37:01.740]   two countries oppose as geopolitical risks.
[02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:07.580]   U.S. share of chip manufacturing is at all time low, thanks to TSMC and Samsung and others.
[02:37:07.580 --> 02:37:10.820]   The U.S. will lose the semiconductor industry unless immediate action has taken.
[02:37:10.820 --> 02:37:14.900]   This is a national security crisis.
[02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:20.260]   So the reason we lost it is because it is so freaking expensive in Wall Street, Punishes
[02:37:20.260 --> 02:37:25.140]   companies for investing in these long-term, I mean, this is like basically saying, yeah,
[02:37:25.140 --> 02:37:31.060]   capitalism is dumb when it comes to R&D and that's going to cost us in the long-term.
[02:37:31.060 --> 02:37:33.620]   Capitalism is bad for long-term investments.
[02:37:33.620 --> 02:37:34.620]   Yeah.
[02:37:34.620 --> 02:37:36.420]   Yeah, we suck at that.
[02:37:36.420 --> 02:37:37.420]   Yep.
[02:37:37.420 --> 02:37:39.940]   That's by the way, that's what he's saying.
[02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:47.140]   U.S. private market, adventure capital and angel investing is completely off its rocker,
[02:37:47.140 --> 02:37:52.100]   investing in software platform based tech companies, the Ubers of the world, while this
[02:37:52.100 --> 02:37:56.180]   type of investing is fine, these same venture capital and angel investors have completely
[02:37:56.180 --> 02:38:02.020]   ignored the semiconductor and hardware space.
[02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:06.100]   That's, you reap what you sow.
[02:38:06.100 --> 02:38:08.020]   Is it waffle time?
[02:38:08.020 --> 02:38:09.860]   Yeah, sure.
[02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:14.260]   Let me do the final advert.
[02:38:14.260 --> 02:38:16.140]   And then we can do picks of the week.
[02:38:16.140 --> 02:38:17.140]   I bought it.
[02:38:17.140 --> 02:38:18.140]   I did repeat.
[02:38:18.140 --> 02:38:19.140]   And I stand corrected.
[02:38:19.140 --> 02:38:25.660]   I thought our show was from three weeks ago, but it was actually another week, so it still,
[02:38:25.660 --> 02:38:27.540]   it's still, it'll never come back.
[02:38:27.540 --> 02:38:31.500]   Paddington, when it comes to business, it's a shark.
[02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:32.500]   It's all right.
[02:38:32.500 --> 02:38:33.500]   I'm sorry.
[02:38:33.500 --> 02:38:34.740]   I think I might have gotten you to play that.
[02:38:34.740 --> 02:38:35.740]   I'm sorry.
[02:38:35.740 --> 02:38:36.740]   No, no, you know what, I play it.
[02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:41.820]   I knew that that could, but the problem is I don't like the chilling effect of this
[02:38:41.820 --> 02:38:43.220]   content ID.
[02:38:43.220 --> 02:38:44.900]   And so I'm not going to play that game.
[02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:49.580]   And the good news is we're fortunate because we don't, the bulk of our revenue comes from
[02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:51.580]   sources other than YouTube.
[02:38:51.580 --> 02:38:56.020]   I mean, we take a financial hit, but it's not a huge one.
[02:38:56.020 --> 02:38:57.700]   And I, you know, it's a few thousand bucks.
[02:38:57.700 --> 02:39:04.260]   And I don't, for me, I far prefer not to, not to cowtow to the chilling effects.
[02:39:04.260 --> 02:39:05.260]   We do.
[02:39:05.260 --> 02:39:09.220]   And all of our producers yell at me, you know, everybody yells at me.
[02:39:09.220 --> 02:39:10.420]   They say, don't play that.
[02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:12.220]   You're going to get us taken down.
[02:39:12.220 --> 02:39:18.180]   But that's, I'm not going to bow to that kind of BS.
[02:39:18.180 --> 02:39:20.660]   It's, we have a fair use right to play it.
[02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:21.660]   It's news coverage.
[02:39:21.660 --> 02:39:23.180]   We're covering that story.
[02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:27.260]   And it's fair use, but, you know, that's not how content I see.
[02:39:27.260 --> 02:39:28.900]   Most of the time the appeal works.
[02:39:28.900 --> 02:39:30.180]   Most of the time it does.
[02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:36.940]   And if somebody like this, you know, a studio canal, if they said, no, take it down.
[02:39:36.940 --> 02:39:37.940]   Don't we take it down?
[02:39:37.940 --> 02:39:38.940]   I don't know.
[02:39:38.940 --> 02:39:39.940]   Do we get a strike?
[02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:40.940]   I don't think we got a strike, but I think they did.
[02:39:40.940 --> 02:39:41.940]   No, sir.
[02:39:41.940 --> 02:39:46.700]   But that's the thing that really has a chilling effect because three strikes in your out.
[02:39:46.700 --> 02:39:49.140]   And that would affect not just this show, but all of our shows.
[02:39:49.140 --> 02:39:52.140]   So that would be bad.
[02:39:52.140 --> 02:39:57.660]   Ladies and gentlemen, I want to show you something really awesome that's saving the planet, saving
[02:39:57.660 --> 02:40:01.380]   my wallet and giving me a great product.
[02:40:01.380 --> 02:40:04.380]   I love and I'm talking about blue land.
[02:40:04.380 --> 02:40:08.860]   Did you know that an estimated five billion plastic hands open cleaning bottles are thrown
[02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:10.420]   away every year?
[02:40:10.420 --> 02:40:12.380]   And they live in the landfill forever.
[02:40:12.380 --> 02:40:13.380]   They don't bio degrade.
[02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:15.220]   You can't recycle them.
[02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:21.940]   Wouldn't it be cool if you could order beautiful high quality bottles for your cleaning products
[02:40:21.940 --> 02:40:25.580]   and refill them time after time so you don't throw them out?
[02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:27.380]   Well, that's what blue land does.
[02:40:27.380 --> 02:40:33.820]   Furthermore, blue land helps the planet because in almost every case, these cleaning products
[02:40:33.820 --> 02:40:35.340]   are 90% water.
[02:40:35.340 --> 02:40:43.580]   So we're trucking around water for no reason at all wasting energy, wasting resources.
[02:40:43.580 --> 02:40:49.580]   All blue land does is you buy the beautiful bot, Instagrammable bottles.
[02:40:49.580 --> 02:40:55.900]   This is the multi surface cleaner, nice lightweight plastic bottle, good cleaner bottle, right?
[02:40:55.900 --> 02:40:59.460]   Or for the hands up, they're beautiful, heavy glass because you don't want them to fall
[02:40:59.460 --> 02:41:01.740]   over when you pump them.
[02:41:01.740 --> 02:41:02.740]   You buy the bottles.
[02:41:02.740 --> 02:41:03.900]   You use them forever.
[02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:08.820]   And when you run out, they send you this is the active ingredients, a little tablet.
[02:41:08.820 --> 02:41:10.380]   You fill the bottle with warm water.
[02:41:10.380 --> 02:41:11.620]   You put in the active ingredients.
[02:41:11.620 --> 02:41:12.980]   It fizzes, it dissolves.
[02:41:12.980 --> 02:41:15.300]   Now this is exactly the same.
[02:41:15.300 --> 02:41:19.940]   It is a high quality cleaning product, but you didn't ship all that water all around the
[02:41:19.940 --> 02:41:22.620]   country and you're not throwing out these beautiful bottles.
[02:41:22.620 --> 02:41:28.040]   Blue land was founded on the belief and I'm 100% but with them, the cleaner planet starts
[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:30.740]   by eliminating plastic waste.
[02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:34.180]   We're trying to do that throughout our lifestyle.
[02:41:34.180 --> 02:41:38.580]   And by creating powerful effective cleaners for the entire home, there's really no reason
[02:41:38.580 --> 02:41:39.580]   to do it.
[02:41:39.580 --> 02:41:41.180]   They have toilet bowl tablets you put in there.
[02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:42.540]   They're so good.
[02:41:42.540 --> 02:41:46.780]   We use their laundry detergent, their little tablets for that, no plastic.
[02:41:46.780 --> 02:41:54.860]   We use their their hand soap in every sink in the house and they smells great by the way.
[02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:56.500]   There's some wonderful sense.
[02:41:56.500 --> 02:42:00.060]   Iris agave, lavender, eucalyptus.
[02:42:00.060 --> 02:42:03.540]   They have special sense for seasonal holidays and so forth.
[02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:04.980]   They smell so good.
[02:42:04.980 --> 02:42:06.260]   They do the job.
[02:42:06.260 --> 02:42:09.500]   They have sent free, by the way, we use their sent free laundry soap.
[02:42:09.500 --> 02:42:11.100]   They have dishwasher soap.
[02:42:11.100 --> 02:42:13.900]   They have dish washing detergent.
[02:42:13.900 --> 02:42:17.060]   All of this without the waste.
[02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:21.380]   These beautiful high quality forever bottles started $10 when you buy a kit.
[02:42:21.380 --> 02:42:22.700]   They're meant to be reused forever.
[02:42:22.700 --> 02:42:29.980]   The refills are $2 unless that's all for a whole fresh new bottle.
[02:42:29.980 --> 02:42:33.740]   That's what you pay in the store.
[02:42:33.740 --> 02:42:39.140]   It saves you all the only thing you're going to throw away is your outdated notion that
[02:42:39.140 --> 02:42:42.140]   earth friendly stuff doesn't work.
[02:42:42.140 --> 02:42:43.420]   It works.
[02:42:43.420 --> 02:42:44.740]   It works and it works great.
[02:42:44.740 --> 02:42:46.140]   It saves you money.
[02:42:46.140 --> 02:42:47.300]   I love this.
[02:42:47.300 --> 02:42:48.300]   I love this.
[02:42:48.300 --> 02:42:53.620]   Blue Land, B-L-U-E-L-A-N-D, a great housewarming gift.
[02:42:53.620 --> 02:42:57.020]   You could give it to dad, a late Father's Day gift.
[02:42:57.020 --> 02:43:00.260]   BlueLand.com/Twig.

[02:43:08.340 --> 02:43:10.020]   We'll love this.
[02:43:10.020 --> 02:43:11.020]   We love it.
[02:43:11.020 --> 02:43:13.540]   We use it throughout the LaPorte House.
[02:43:13.540 --> 02:43:15.620]   We even use it in our bathroom here.
[02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:17.020]   BlueLand.com/twig.
[02:43:17.020 --> 02:43:23.100]   I love a Blue Land.
[02:43:23.100 --> 02:43:29.700]   You will too and you will love the feeling that you get from doing the right thing.
[02:43:29.700 --> 02:43:33.220]   Stacey Higginbotham is so excited.
[02:43:33.220 --> 02:43:35.620]   She's so excited about her pick of the week this week.
[02:43:35.620 --> 02:43:36.620]   What is it?
[02:43:36.620 --> 02:43:38.620]   It is not connected.
[02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:39.620]   It's unconnected.
[02:43:39.620 --> 02:43:40.620]   It's my husband.
[02:43:40.620 --> 02:43:42.460]   Yeah, it's unconnected.
[02:43:42.460 --> 02:43:46.380]   But it's my father or it's my husband's Father's Day present.
[02:43:46.380 --> 02:43:47.380]   What did he get?
[02:43:47.380 --> 02:43:49.780]   So I played with this at a friend's office.
[02:43:49.780 --> 02:43:54.380]   I hope you didn't give him a vacuum cleaner or a household cleaners.
[02:43:54.380 --> 02:43:56.380]   So here's the device.
[02:43:56.380 --> 02:43:57.380]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:43:57.380 --> 02:43:59.700]   Okay, don't tell anybody what it is.
[02:43:59.700 --> 02:44:00.700]   Let us guess.
[02:44:00.700 --> 02:44:01.700]   Okay.
[02:44:01.700 --> 02:44:06.380]   Yeah, this one is not going to be this.
[02:44:06.380 --> 02:44:07.580]   You know it?
[02:44:07.580 --> 02:44:13.220]   I actually did plug it in to the thing.
[02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:15.380]   Is it a waffle maker?
[02:44:15.380 --> 02:44:16.380]   It is not.
[02:44:16.380 --> 02:44:17.380]   It is.
[02:44:17.380 --> 02:44:18.380]   Is it a hammer?
[02:44:18.380 --> 02:44:21.420]   Is it a meat grinder?
[02:44:21.420 --> 02:44:23.580]   It looks like it turns sleek.
[02:44:23.580 --> 02:44:27.620]   Oh, it's a shave ice maker.
[02:44:27.620 --> 02:44:29.500]   So you put that in your kitchen aid.
[02:44:29.500 --> 02:44:31.660]   Oh, I have to have this.
[02:44:31.660 --> 02:44:32.660]   That's awesome.
[02:44:32.660 --> 02:44:36.380]   Oh my God.
[02:44:36.380 --> 02:44:39.220]   Because most shaved ice and I'm going to talk about the downsides.
[02:44:39.220 --> 02:44:44.220]   So most shaved ice is real sweet.
[02:44:44.220 --> 02:44:45.220]   Too chippy.
[02:44:45.220 --> 02:44:46.220]   Too chippy.
[02:44:46.220 --> 02:44:47.220]   Yeah.
[02:44:47.220 --> 02:44:48.220]   This is not the right consistency.
[02:44:48.220 --> 02:44:50.420]   No, they do it somehow in Hawaii.
[02:44:50.420 --> 02:44:51.420]   They do it.
[02:44:51.420 --> 02:44:52.420]   It's soft.
[02:44:52.420 --> 02:44:53.420]   It's beautiful.
[02:44:53.420 --> 02:44:54.420]   So yes, it's a five.
[02:44:54.420 --> 02:44:56.860]   They have a blade in here that's just for the fine ground.
[02:44:56.860 --> 02:44:57.860]   It's soft.
[02:44:57.860 --> 02:44:58.860]   It's fluffy.
[02:44:58.860 --> 02:45:01.540]   And it does make it that way.
[02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:05.300]   So that is the best father's gift I've ever heard of.
[02:45:05.300 --> 02:45:07.060]   It is $99.
[02:45:07.060 --> 02:45:10.180]   Did you give him a fun array of father's flavors?
[02:45:10.180 --> 02:45:11.580]   Yes, I do.
[02:45:11.580 --> 02:45:13.580]   Tobacco and leather.
[02:45:13.580 --> 02:45:14.580]   Oh, wait.
[02:45:14.580 --> 02:45:15.580]   No.
[02:45:15.580 --> 02:45:17.580]   No, I don't get the grease.
[02:45:17.580 --> 02:45:19.340]   What flavors did you?
[02:45:19.340 --> 02:45:20.340]   Oh, nice.
[02:45:20.340 --> 02:45:24.980]   You know what I would want though is kind of like, can I use like regular real fruit
[02:45:24.980 --> 02:45:27.580]   and stuff instead of like sugar syrup and things?
[02:45:27.580 --> 02:45:28.580]   I guess I could.
[02:45:28.580 --> 02:45:29.580]   You could.
[02:45:29.580 --> 02:45:30.580]   I mean, it's ice.
[02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:31.580]   It's just ice.
[02:45:31.580 --> 02:45:32.580]   It's ice.
[02:45:32.580 --> 02:45:33.580]   Yeah.
[02:45:33.580 --> 02:45:34.580]   This is so cool.
[02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:36.300]   Stacey, I'm buying this right now because we have it.
[02:45:36.300 --> 02:45:38.300]   So everybody should have a kitchen aid.
[02:45:38.300 --> 02:45:39.300]   Everybody.
[02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:42.020]   Do you want to know the bad, the bad of it?
[02:45:42.020 --> 02:45:43.020]   Yeah.
[02:45:43.020 --> 02:45:45.820]   Okay, the bad is you have to use these.
[02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:47.780]   It comes with four little cups.
[02:45:47.780 --> 02:45:48.780]   These are the special mold.
[02:45:48.780 --> 02:45:50.580]   Oh, they have to go on it.
[02:45:50.580 --> 02:45:51.580]   Yeah.
[02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:55.260]   And you have to freeze it to they have to freeze for like 12 to 24 hours.
[02:45:55.260 --> 02:45:57.500]   And there's only four of them.
[02:45:57.500 --> 02:46:02.660]   And I feel that if you have a large family or want more shaved ice, you're going to need
[02:46:02.660 --> 02:46:03.660]   more than those.
[02:46:03.660 --> 02:46:04.660]   That's a negative.
[02:46:04.660 --> 02:46:05.660]   Yeah.
[02:46:05.660 --> 02:46:08.860]   So that is that is the downside.
[02:46:08.860 --> 02:46:09.940]   Well, that's why they do this.
[02:46:09.940 --> 02:46:11.700]   So there won't melt.
[02:46:11.700 --> 02:46:14.020]   I mean, it's shaped ice.
[02:46:14.020 --> 02:46:15.020]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:17.220]   Here's she's shaving it into a regular bowl.
[02:46:17.220 --> 02:46:18.220]   No, no, no.
[02:46:18.220 --> 02:46:19.220]   It's the ice.
[02:46:19.220 --> 02:46:20.220]   Look, it's saved.
[02:46:20.220 --> 02:46:21.220]   Oh, the ice has to be.
[02:46:21.220 --> 02:46:22.220]   It's pucks.
[02:46:22.220 --> 02:46:23.220]   Oh, I see.
[02:46:23.220 --> 02:46:24.220]   Yeah, because they have to fit in.
[02:46:24.220 --> 02:46:25.220]   I'm sorry.
[02:46:25.220 --> 02:46:26.220]   I thought it was the bowl.
[02:46:26.220 --> 02:46:29.060]   Oh, so you're just going to run out of shave ice when you when you do all of it.
[02:46:29.060 --> 02:46:31.060]   See that, but there's four of those in there.
[02:46:31.060 --> 02:46:33.380]   So you can only make four kind of small.
[02:46:33.380 --> 02:46:35.940]   But could you freeze a bunch of them in advance?
[02:46:35.940 --> 02:46:36.940]   Stacey.
[02:46:36.940 --> 02:46:37.940]   Yeah.
[02:46:37.940 --> 02:46:38.940]   There you go.
[02:46:38.940 --> 02:46:39.940]   Oh, yeah.
[02:46:39.940 --> 02:46:40.940]   Oh, look at you, Jeff.
[02:46:40.940 --> 02:46:41.940]   You're logical.
[02:46:41.940 --> 02:46:42.940]   Oh, it's smart.
[02:46:42.940 --> 02:46:43.940]   Wow.
[02:46:43.940 --> 02:46:49.780]   Shave ice for the whole family.
[02:46:49.780 --> 02:46:50.780]   I love it.
[02:46:50.780 --> 02:46:52.740]   I mean, it's such a funny.
[02:46:52.740 --> 02:46:54.660]   I mean, it does one thing.
[02:46:54.660 --> 02:46:56.820]   And one thing only, it shaves ice.
[02:46:56.820 --> 02:46:57.820]   Yes.
[02:46:57.820 --> 02:46:58.820]   Yeah.
[02:46:58.820 --> 02:47:01.060]   But, okay, but no, the Snoopy.
[02:47:01.060 --> 02:47:04.820]   Okay, this is like a better Snoopy because the Snoopy is too chippy.
[02:47:04.820 --> 02:47:09.500]   Yeah, no, see, somebody's saying, oh, wait a minute, you just get the Snoopy Snowcone
[02:47:09.500 --> 02:47:10.500]   machine.
[02:47:10.500 --> 02:47:11.500]   That's a Snoopy.
[02:47:11.500 --> 02:47:12.500]   That's a Snoopy.
[02:47:12.500 --> 02:47:15.220]   A Snoopy does not equal a shaved ice.
[02:47:15.220 --> 02:47:18.460]   And this will make that, by the way.
[02:47:18.460 --> 02:47:20.020]   What it has a Snoopy setting?
[02:47:20.020 --> 02:47:21.020]   Yeah, it does.
[02:47:21.020 --> 02:47:22.180]   It has two settings.
[02:47:22.180 --> 02:47:25.220]   One is the softer one and one is the other.
[02:47:25.220 --> 02:47:26.820]   Shave ice is a very different beast.
[02:47:26.820 --> 02:47:27.900]   And I love shave ice.
[02:47:27.900 --> 02:47:29.860]   See, that's a Snoopy.
[02:47:29.860 --> 02:47:31.220]   So you can see the ice crystals.
[02:47:31.220 --> 02:47:32.380]   They're larger.
[02:47:32.380 --> 02:47:34.260]   And then the shave ice is more like that.
[02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:35.260]   See that?
[02:47:35.260 --> 02:47:36.940]   Oh, shave ice is like powder.
[02:47:36.940 --> 02:47:40.340]   It's better than it's like sherbet almost, right?
[02:47:40.340 --> 02:47:42.340]   Oh, that's pretty good.
[02:47:42.340 --> 02:47:43.340]   So what do you mix it?
[02:47:43.340 --> 02:47:45.700]   I think last year he got something risky related.
[02:47:45.700 --> 02:47:47.700]   I'm pretty jealous.
[02:47:47.700 --> 02:47:48.700]   He's very distacy.
[02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:50.700]   He's a decent gift gift.
[02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:52.700]   He's the luckiest man in the world.
[02:47:52.700 --> 02:47:53.700]   Are you kidding me?
[02:47:53.700 --> 02:47:54.700]   Yeah.
[02:47:54.700 --> 02:47:57.060]   So you only get four of these for freezing the ice.
[02:47:57.060 --> 02:47:58.060]   That is a little bit of...
[02:47:58.060 --> 02:47:59.820]   But you just freeze them and put them in the ice.
[02:47:59.820 --> 02:48:02.340]   But as Jeff Jarvis pointed out, you can make hundreds.
[02:48:02.340 --> 02:48:03.940]   Jeff, that was brilliant.
[02:48:03.940 --> 02:48:06.780]   I'm definitely like, oh, why did I think of that?
[02:48:06.780 --> 02:48:07.780]   Yeah.
[02:48:07.780 --> 02:48:11.780]   And my recommendations and my ice recommendations cannot be beat.
[02:48:11.780 --> 02:48:12.780]   Good work.
[02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:18.620]   And if you don't have a KitchenAid, you need to get the KitchenAid not included.
[02:48:18.620 --> 02:48:20.820]   So you've got to get the KitchenAid.
[02:48:20.820 --> 02:48:22.860]   This is like 400 bucks.
[02:48:22.860 --> 02:48:24.340]   But okay, never mind.
[02:48:24.340 --> 02:48:27.820]   It's cheaper than a Thermomics and that's what relating counts.
[02:48:27.820 --> 02:48:29.060]   And they never break, by the way.
[02:48:29.060 --> 02:48:31.420]   I've had my KitchenAid for 40...
[02:48:31.420 --> 02:48:32.420]   I'm not kidding.
[02:48:32.420 --> 02:48:33.420]   40 years.
[02:48:33.420 --> 02:48:34.420]   It's sold.
[02:48:34.420 --> 02:48:37.060]   It's avocado colored.
[02:48:37.060 --> 02:48:38.060]   It's an old one.
[02:48:38.060 --> 02:48:39.620]   It's an old one.
[02:48:39.620 --> 02:48:40.820]   That's an old one.
[02:48:40.820 --> 02:48:44.540]   That's how you know you're old when you have burnt orange kitchen.
[02:48:44.540 --> 02:48:47.900]   I'm a god, I won't believe it.
[02:48:47.900 --> 02:48:50.900]   Jeff Jarvis, do you have a number for us?
[02:48:50.900 --> 02:48:52.220]   Oh, yeah.
[02:48:52.220 --> 02:48:55.300]   I got furious things.
[02:48:55.300 --> 02:48:58.620]   I didn't know that there was once a paint made from mummies, but I don't know if I'm
[02:48:58.620 --> 02:48:59.620]   going to do that one.
[02:48:59.620 --> 02:49:00.620]   Ew, but color is.
[02:49:00.620 --> 02:49:06.900]   How long is breaking up is interesting, but I don't think that fits.
[02:49:06.900 --> 02:49:10.100]   Audio book growth by 25% who cares.
[02:49:10.100 --> 02:49:12.420]   I think the TikTok Italian sandwich guy.
[02:49:12.420 --> 02:49:14.380]   I knew you'd get the TikTok.
[02:49:14.380 --> 02:49:15.380]   The winner.
[02:49:15.380 --> 02:49:16.380]   Donato, caprio.
[02:49:16.380 --> 02:49:19.140]   Go to the first three.
[02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:21.540]   Go to one of them where he's just making a sandwich.
[02:49:21.540 --> 02:49:23.220]   He has his hand on bread.
[02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:25.220]   Okay, just go to one.
[02:49:25.220 --> 02:49:26.220]   Just go to one.
[02:49:26.220 --> 02:49:28.060]   Oh, he's Italian.
[02:49:28.060 --> 02:49:29.060]   Oh, yeah.
[02:49:29.060 --> 02:49:30.060]   A little bit.
[02:49:30.060 --> 02:49:31.060]   Yeah.
[02:49:31.060 --> 02:49:32.780]   A little bit.
[02:49:32.780 --> 02:49:33.780]   Ah.
[02:49:33.780 --> 02:49:41.900]   So he's in a shop.
[02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:44.100]   Yeah.
[02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:48.100]   Bring tomato ham.
[02:49:48.100 --> 02:49:51.260]   You know, the trick on this is just a beautiful piece of French bread.
[02:49:51.260 --> 02:49:53.260]   The Wall of Oil.
[02:49:53.260 --> 02:49:55.620]   It's not French bread.
[02:49:55.620 --> 02:49:57.020]   It's got to be Italian bread.
[02:49:57.020 --> 02:49:58.820]   Well, it's Italian, obviously.
[02:49:58.820 --> 02:49:59.820]   Crunchy Italian bread.
[02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:00.820]   That's it.
[02:50:00.820 --> 02:50:03.740]   It's not exactly salt hank, but it's not.
[02:50:03.740 --> 02:50:04.740]   Okay.
[02:50:04.740 --> 02:50:05.740]   Okay.
[02:50:05.740 --> 02:50:06.740]   Yeah, I know.
[02:50:06.740 --> 02:50:07.740]   There's a nice peasant loaf though.
[02:50:07.740 --> 02:50:08.740]   That's a beautiful loaf.
[02:50:08.740 --> 02:50:09.740]   Look at that.
[02:50:09.740 --> 02:50:10.740]   Oh, is that beautiful?
[02:50:10.740 --> 02:50:11.740]   I need that.
[02:50:11.740 --> 02:50:12.740]   Mm-mm.
[02:50:12.740 --> 02:50:13.740]   Oh, this guy.
[02:50:13.740 --> 02:50:15.660]   I don't care what you put on that.
[02:50:15.660 --> 02:50:17.180]   You could put chill leather on it.
[02:50:17.180 --> 02:50:18.180]   It's got to be delicious.
[02:50:18.180 --> 02:50:19.180]   It's got to be delicious.
[02:50:19.180 --> 02:50:20.180]   Oh my God.
[02:50:20.180 --> 02:50:21.180]   What is that?
[02:50:21.180 --> 02:50:22.180]   Or cadella?
[02:50:22.180 --> 02:50:23.180]   Maybe?
[02:50:23.180 --> 02:50:24.180]   I never saw anything like that.
[02:50:24.180 --> 02:50:26.860]   It looks like fish skin.
[02:50:26.860 --> 02:50:30.780]   And then all little burrata mozzarella something like that.
[02:50:30.780 --> 02:50:31.780]   Butcarella.
[02:50:31.780 --> 02:50:32.780]   Butcarella, we see it.
[02:50:32.780 --> 02:50:33.780]   How can I sell it?
[02:50:33.780 --> 02:50:35.380]   Send salt hank over to you.
[02:50:35.380 --> 02:50:36.380]   That's it.
[02:50:36.380 --> 02:50:37.380]   It's not fancy.
[02:50:37.380 --> 02:50:38.380]   That's it.
[02:50:38.380 --> 02:50:39.380]   It's not a fancy sandwich.
[02:50:39.380 --> 02:50:40.380]   Just do one more.
[02:50:40.380 --> 02:50:41.380]   Just stuff.
[02:50:41.380 --> 02:50:42.380]   Stuff on bread.
[02:50:42.380 --> 02:50:43.380]   It's a melon.
[02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:46.380]   That's not bread or squash.
[02:50:46.380 --> 02:50:48.380]   That's a cheese.
[02:50:48.380 --> 02:50:50.180]   Squash is a.
[02:50:50.180 --> 02:50:51.180]   That's a squash.
[02:50:51.180 --> 02:50:52.180]   Cheese.
[02:50:52.180 --> 02:50:53.180]   Cheese.
[02:50:53.180 --> 02:50:55.820]   Oh, it is cheese.
[02:50:55.820 --> 02:51:00.860]   Oh, I'm moving Italy right now.
[02:51:00.860 --> 02:51:01.860]   Right now.
[02:51:01.860 --> 02:51:03.180]   I'm going to go back with you.
[02:51:03.180 --> 02:51:04.780]   Oh, the best food in the world.
[02:51:04.780 --> 02:51:05.780]   Oh my.
[02:51:05.780 --> 02:51:06.940]   I want to go to this guys.
[02:51:06.940 --> 02:51:09.820]   I like how he takes the bread out in the middle.
[02:51:09.820 --> 02:51:10.820]   It's a soft bread.
[02:51:10.820 --> 02:51:11.820]   It's a stasis ice.
[02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:12.820]   Yeah.
[02:51:12.820 --> 02:51:13.820]   Oh, I don't know what that is.
[02:51:13.820 --> 02:51:14.820]   Is that a top of nut?
[02:51:14.820 --> 02:51:15.820]   I don't know.
[02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:16.820]   What the hell am I?
[02:51:16.820 --> 02:51:17.820]   It's onions.
[02:51:17.820 --> 02:51:18.820]   It looks like maybe.
[02:51:18.820 --> 02:51:19.820]   I don't know.
[02:51:19.820 --> 02:51:20.820]   He just throws stuff on.
[02:51:20.820 --> 02:51:22.500]   Even the lay it on.
[02:51:22.500 --> 02:51:24.500]   No, this is not fancy.
[02:51:24.500 --> 02:51:25.340]   This is not prissy.
[02:51:25.340 --> 02:51:26.340]   This is a sandwich.
[02:51:26.340 --> 02:51:27.340]   How do you say?
[02:51:27.340 --> 02:51:29.700]   These are the places you want to go.
[02:51:29.700 --> 02:51:30.700]   Oh, there you go.
[02:51:30.700 --> 02:51:31.700]   Oh, that's perfect.
[02:51:31.700 --> 02:51:32.700]   That's perfection.
[02:51:32.700 --> 02:51:33.700]   Isn't it?
[02:51:33.700 --> 02:51:34.700]   Isn't it?
[02:51:34.700 --> 02:51:35.700]   Okay.
[02:51:35.700 --> 02:51:37.660]   I think it does need a spread of some sort.
[02:51:37.660 --> 02:51:38.660]   That's the elephant.
[02:51:38.660 --> 02:51:39.660]   He has a pesto on one of them.
[02:51:39.660 --> 02:51:41.460]   He has a lot of pesto on one of them.
[02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:42.460]   Oh, okay.
[02:51:42.460 --> 02:51:43.460]   All right.
[02:51:43.460 --> 02:51:47.500]   I'm sending this to Hank because Hank's got twice as many followers, but.
[02:51:47.500 --> 02:51:49.700]   Hank's going to say amateurs.
[02:51:49.700 --> 02:51:50.700]   Amateurs.
[02:51:50.700 --> 02:51:51.700]   Amateurs.
[02:51:51.700 --> 02:51:53.500]   Well, the t-shirt and the accent help.
[02:51:53.500 --> 02:51:54.500]   He doesn't edit.
[02:51:54.500 --> 02:51:56.100]   It's just one shot.
[02:51:56.100 --> 02:51:59.940]   But given that he doesn't really put any work into it, he's got a half a million followers.
[02:51:59.940 --> 02:52:01.420]   I think it's just doing okay.
[02:52:01.420 --> 02:52:03.420]   He doesn't look like a man who edits.
[02:52:03.420 --> 02:52:04.420]   He's not editing.
[02:52:04.420 --> 02:52:05.420]   He's not editing.
[02:52:05.420 --> 02:52:06.420]   I'm not editing.
[02:52:06.420 --> 02:52:08.420]   That's awesome.
[02:52:08.420 --> 02:52:12.900]   Mr. Ant Pruitt, your pick of the week.
[02:52:12.900 --> 02:52:16.180]   All right.
[02:52:16.180 --> 02:52:20.940]   If you're looking at my camera right now, I have what's called a pro mist filter on
[02:52:20.940 --> 02:52:21.940]   the loans.
[02:52:21.940 --> 02:52:28.020]   And what that does is basically soften my image because yes, we want a lot of pretty
[02:52:28.020 --> 02:52:31.580]   pixels and the image to be crispy and so forth.
[02:52:31.580 --> 02:52:34.660]   But some of these cameras, they have you a little too sharp.
[02:52:34.660 --> 02:52:35.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:52:35.660 --> 02:52:41.460]   And this filter will just soften it a little bit and it'll also help the lights bloom such
[02:52:41.460 --> 02:52:43.820]   as that one behind me.
[02:52:43.820 --> 02:52:44.820]   Makes it bloom a little bit.
[02:52:44.820 --> 02:52:46.900]   And it'll look a little bit better.
[02:52:46.900 --> 02:52:48.780]   And you can get this one from Tiffin.
[02:52:48.780 --> 02:52:50.740]   That's the one that I use.
[02:52:50.740 --> 02:52:52.340]   And yeah, they're not cheap.
[02:52:52.340 --> 02:52:54.260]   I recommend the one eighth.
[02:52:54.260 --> 02:53:01.140]   If you go with one fourth or bigger, it starts to get a little too sort of hazy looking.
[02:53:01.140 --> 02:53:05.900]   And for those who say, hey, that thing is too expensive moment as recommended by one
[02:53:05.900 --> 02:53:07.700]   of our club, Twit members.
[02:53:07.700 --> 02:53:13.140]   He recommended the moment Cinebloom, which looks like it does the same thing when it's
[02:53:13.140 --> 02:53:14.740]   just a couple bucks cheaper.
[02:53:14.740 --> 02:53:18.500]   Well, moments are made for camera phones.
[02:53:18.500 --> 02:53:21.140]   They have some DSLR bar.
[02:53:21.140 --> 02:53:22.140]   Oh, they do.
[02:53:22.140 --> 02:53:24.140]   Oh, all right.
[02:53:24.140 --> 02:53:25.140]   Oh, yeah.
[02:53:25.140 --> 02:53:26.140]   Look at that.
[02:53:26.140 --> 02:53:27.620]   So it gets the lights to bloom more.
[02:53:27.620 --> 02:53:32.340]   I find if I just breathe on my lens a little bit, it's going to look like that.
[02:53:32.340 --> 02:53:33.340]   Rub a little.
[02:53:33.340 --> 02:53:34.340]   Sometimes that helps.
[02:53:34.340 --> 02:53:36.340]   The one is 100 degrees outside.
[02:53:36.340 --> 02:53:37.340]   Yeah.
[02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:38.340]   Nice.
[02:53:38.340 --> 02:53:39.340]   Yeah, I think too sharp is not.
[02:53:39.340 --> 02:53:40.340]   I like these Tiffin.
[02:53:40.340 --> 02:53:41.340]   We're getting used to the too sharp though.
[02:53:41.340 --> 02:53:42.860]   I mean, that's kind of the style now.
[02:53:42.860 --> 02:53:43.860]   Everything's.
[02:53:43.860 --> 02:53:45.900]   It's like this camera that I got.
[02:53:45.900 --> 02:53:48.620]   Yeah, it was just you could go really high on sharp.
[02:53:48.620 --> 02:53:49.940]   Yeah, it's too sharp.
[02:53:49.940 --> 02:53:50.940]   Yeah.
[02:53:50.940 --> 02:53:55.060]   Demo, it was one of the Canon cameras last year.
[02:53:55.060 --> 02:53:59.020]   And it hurt me pulling the video up into the editor.
[02:53:59.020 --> 02:54:00.860]   I was like, man, that's just way too crispy.
[02:54:00.860 --> 02:54:01.860]   Isn't that funny?
[02:54:01.860 --> 02:54:06.180]   It's because I didn't have any type of filter on the front of it to cut it back some.
[02:54:06.180 --> 02:54:07.460]   So get a missed filter.
[02:54:07.460 --> 02:54:09.380]   Yeah, missed filters.
[02:54:09.380 --> 02:54:13.180]   They're highly underrated in my opinion.
[02:54:13.180 --> 02:54:19.900]   Next is the folks at Adobe had their summer premiere pro update.
[02:54:19.900 --> 02:54:26.940]   They basically trying to make it easier to do workspaces and create vertical video in
[02:54:26.940 --> 02:54:27.940]   your workspace.
[02:54:27.940 --> 02:54:32.220]   Like right now I had a preset built in because I know I'm going to work on something that's
[02:54:32.220 --> 02:54:35.380]   a square video versus something that say a real.
[02:54:35.380 --> 02:54:37.260]   I just have little presets already built them.
[02:54:37.260 --> 02:54:38.260]   And there's like, you know what?
[02:54:38.260 --> 02:54:39.260]   This is the future.
[02:54:39.260 --> 02:54:42.340]   Let's just go ahead and put these presets in there for everybody.
[02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:43.340]   So that's one thing.
[02:54:43.340 --> 02:54:46.020]   And they had us some performance updates and whatnot.
[02:54:46.020 --> 02:54:47.900]   But I thought that was cool.
[02:54:47.900 --> 02:54:53.300]   And lastly, Capture One is an Adobe Lightroom alternative in the photography space.
[02:54:53.300 --> 02:55:02.580]   They had some updates, including wireless tethering, an iPad app, and a tandem app that allows
[02:55:02.580 --> 02:55:08.580]   you to share your live shoot with the client that's on set or even online so they can see
[02:55:08.580 --> 02:55:15.580]   some of the shots and make suggestions to your frame in and stuff like that.
[02:55:15.580 --> 02:55:17.940]   Very nice.
[02:55:17.940 --> 02:55:19.300]   And prove it.
[02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:21.060]   And prove it on Instagram.
[02:55:21.060 --> 02:55:23.060]   And underscore.
[02:55:23.060 --> 02:55:24.060]   And it's true.
[02:55:24.060 --> 02:55:25.060]   Yep.
[02:55:25.060 --> 02:55:26.460]   Make sure you get the underscore.
[02:55:26.460 --> 02:55:29.900]   And prove it dot com for his NFTs and of course twit.tv/hop.
[02:55:29.900 --> 02:55:32.500]   Why are you laughing?
[02:55:32.500 --> 02:55:34.580]   No, no, no, not the NFTs.
[02:55:34.580 --> 02:55:38.340]   The old school NFTs, and prove it dot com slash prints prints.
[02:55:38.340 --> 02:55:41.300]   Oh, you mean like you could hang them up on your wall?
[02:55:41.300 --> 02:55:42.300]   Old school NFTs.
[02:55:42.300 --> 02:55:44.100]   You actually own something.
[02:55:44.100 --> 02:55:48.940]   That's a guy on Twitter who tweeted, "I have a bunch of NFTs.
[02:55:48.940 --> 02:55:52.500]   Of course I right clicked and downloaded them, but..."
[02:55:52.500 --> 02:55:58.620]   Yeah, well, that's probably just as good.
[02:55:58.620 --> 02:56:01.540]   Sorry to keep you so long.
[02:56:01.540 --> 02:56:02.940]   What a fun show, though, as always.
[02:56:02.940 --> 02:56:04.940]   I hate to end it.
[02:56:04.940 --> 02:56:06.940]   Aunt Pruitt, he did it.
[02:56:06.940 --> 02:56:09.100]   Yeah, let's keep going for another hour.
[02:56:09.100 --> 02:56:10.100]   I could.
[02:56:10.100 --> 02:56:11.100]   Just a torture space.
[02:56:11.100 --> 02:56:14.060]   I love y'all, but I don't mean ending the show.
[02:56:14.060 --> 02:56:16.060]   I had five, twenty in the afternoon.
[02:56:16.060 --> 02:56:17.760]   This is past my dinnertime here.
[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:19.040]   Oh, I'm so sorry guys.
[02:56:19.040 --> 02:56:20.040]   I apologize.
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:21.040]   Alright.
[02:56:21.040 --> 02:56:25.340]   Aunt Pruitt is our club leader at Club Twit.
[02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:30.800]   He hangs out in the clubhouse, sets up things like we got a couple coming up, like our members
[02:56:30.800 --> 02:56:34.580]   fireside chat moved to July 28th, coming up in a couple of weeks.
[02:56:34.580 --> 02:56:36.260]   Alex Lindsey, and asked me anything.
[02:56:36.260 --> 02:56:41.860]   Stacey's book club, The Voting is on now, ends Friday, so get on over there and vote.
[02:56:41.860 --> 02:56:46.500]   Of course, the main benefit of Club Twit is the ad-free versions of all of our shows.
[02:56:46.500 --> 02:56:48.820]   For that, just a mere seven bucks a month.
[02:56:48.820 --> 02:56:53.540]   And then throw in the wonderful Discord channel where great conversations are happening, all
[02:56:53.540 --> 02:57:00.300]   sorts of benefits in there, access to our two Twit Minecraft servers, the Untitled Linux
[02:57:00.300 --> 02:57:01.300]   show.
[02:57:01.300 --> 02:57:04.860]   We've got the Gizfiz.
[02:57:04.860 --> 02:57:08.260]   The shows that we do live in the club will also end up in the Twit Plus feed like Stacey's
[02:57:08.260 --> 02:57:10.500]   book club, and that's another benefit.
[02:57:10.500 --> 02:57:12.740]   So there's a lot for seven bucks a month.
[02:57:12.740 --> 02:57:17.540]   We think it's a good deal, and it is one of the ways we are hedging against inflation
[02:57:17.540 --> 02:57:21.420]   and recession, both of which are headed our way.
[02:57:21.420 --> 02:57:24.580]   We can see the lay at the end of the tunnel, unfortunately, it's the oncoming train of
[02:57:24.580 --> 02:57:25.780]   recession.
[02:57:25.780 --> 02:57:27.460]   So please help us out.
[02:57:27.460 --> 02:57:31.140]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:57:31.140 --> 02:57:35.500]   Jeff Jarvis, thank you for being here, the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial
[02:57:35.500 --> 02:57:40.420]   Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.

[02:57:47.300 --> 02:57:48.300]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:57:48.300 --> 02:57:49.300]   Always a pleasure.
[02:57:49.300 --> 02:57:50.300]   You look good.
[02:57:50.300 --> 02:57:51.300]   I like this camera.
[02:57:51.300 --> 02:57:55.300]   Mommy made me match my M&Ms.
[02:57:55.300 --> 02:57:57.660]   Mommy made me match my... nevermind.
[02:57:57.660 --> 02:57:59.420]   Match or mash?
[02:57:59.420 --> 02:58:02.140]   Uh, you know, I think it's match.
[02:58:02.140 --> 02:58:03.140]   I think if you do it properly...
[02:58:03.140 --> 02:58:04.140]   I'm gonna say mash.
[02:58:04.140 --> 02:58:05.140]   I hadn't heard that.
[02:58:05.140 --> 02:58:06.140]   Mommy made me mash my M&Ms.
[02:58:06.140 --> 02:58:07.140]   Mash my M&Ms.
[02:58:07.140 --> 02:58:08.140]   Mash.
[02:58:08.140 --> 02:58:09.140]   Mash my M&M.
[02:58:09.140 --> 02:58:10.140]   And on that remote.
[02:58:10.140 --> 02:58:11.140]   Just mash that remote.
[02:58:11.140 --> 02:58:12.140]   Mash that remote.
[02:58:12.140 --> 02:58:13.860]   Mash that remote.
[02:58:13.860 --> 02:58:21.380]   And Stacey Higginbotham from StaceyOnIOT.com at GigaStaceyOnTheTwitterBox.
[02:58:21.380 --> 02:58:25.660]   She's also got that great podcast with Kevin Tofel, the IOT podcast.

[02:58:36.740 --> 02:58:38.540]   Go enjoy your waffles, everybody.

[02:58:49.220 --> 02:58:50.220]   Bye-bye.
[02:58:50.220 --> 02:58:55.860]   Mommy made me match my M&Ms.
