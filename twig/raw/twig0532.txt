[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, I'm Jason Halfil and in for Leo, we've got
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.280]   Anne Pruitt, Jeff Jarvis, Stacy Higginbotham talking about all things Google and a few other things
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.360]   as well. We've got Google potentially buying Fitbit. Amazon Fresh is going free. Well, it's
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.840]   probably not free, but Amazon Prime members are going to get it included in their service.
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.040]   Google brings .new to everyone, which is kind of interesting. Facebook News tab is now about to
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.560]   appear in Facebook's app and it includes some interesting selections of trusted news sources.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.760]   We talk about that and a whole lot more up next on this week in Google.

[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.400]   weekend things that we wear on the top of our head because tomorrow is Halloween or at least
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.360]   that's the reason they're telling myself. Really? Oh yeah, okay. I'm Jason Alifilig of Forleo the
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.120]   port to my left and Pruitt. Yes I am. What is your name today? Because this
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.040]   hats combined with your normal look like I feel like you have a different name. I don't know.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.000]   Maybe I could be Baron. Baron. Mmm. Baron. You like that, Mr. Carsten?
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.760]   Baron Von Pruitt. Boom. We got it. That's it. I like it. Baron Von Pruitt. Thank you,
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.400]   Saren. Sorry about that. See, I'm all ready. This is going to be really hard to do. To my right is
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   Stacey Higginbotham or as I like to call her Stacey Wigginbotham. Yes. But she's wearing a wig.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.320]   Fantastic wig. It's like a... Thank you. It's a little messed up. My daughter wore it last,
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.120]   so I'm kind of like, eh, it could be neater, but that's cool. It's cool. It works. It's working.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.560]   It's working. And then to my left is Jeff Jarvis wearing... I handle great hats except this one.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.240]   That is a great hat. That's a great hat. Except that it tickles.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.240]   Yeah, you gotta be careful with that. The hat but tickles.
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.880]   It reminds me of going to commencement when I... Yes, yes. Right, which side do you put it on
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.200]   for the show? I forget. I just look at everybody else and do what they do. You never know.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.280]   Or stash it up on the top. Or actually what I'm doing now is I'm imitating the president and his
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.880]   wife giving myself a treat on Halloween. Don't talk to me. What was that video? I was so confused.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:20.000]   I didn't see that video. There was a kid at a blow-up thing. They put the treats on the top of
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.120]   his costume and they fell off. Or kid. What? Instead of putting it in this freaking bag.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.760]   Everybody knows how Halloween works. Clearly he and she do not. No. Okay.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.600]   All right. Wow. They need some Halloween school. Yeah. Some Halloween education.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.000]   That's not what you do with candy. No, that's not what you do with Halloween. No, it was really
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.600]   awkward. Unless your costume is that you are a Halloween bag? Not even close. That is an idea.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.320]   Actually, I kind of like that idea. That's pretty good. It could be the Halloween bag. You wear a
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.560]   paper bag on your head the other way? Right. The other way. That would have made perfect sense.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   But no. Okay. All right. Well, hey, everybody, you know, if that works for Otis,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.080]   folks. Otis. I got a dreaded email over the week. We were kind of talking about this last week.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.040]   We're talking about storage, our email storage and everything. And I checked.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.480]   So the way my inbox is organized is like important is up top. And that's the stuff I ever
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.400]   actually look at. And then down below is like everything else. And I rarely look down there.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.640]   I'm happy I did though. Because I saw down there, your storage promotion will expire in seven days.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.080]   Oh, there's the email. So apparently I had 100 gigs of promotional storage that's going to go
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.560]   and November 3rd. And like we were talking about last week, you might want to go through that stuff,
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.000]   huh? Well, either that or I pay a buck 99 a month and get back to where I am right now,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.560]   which a buck 99 a month. I don't think that's about. You know what? Here's the thinking.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.120]   If you're never going to look at it anyway, just scroll through the most recent like two months
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:08.560]   and then mast elite. Just do it. You're going to just feel so free. That hurts. It hurts me to think.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.920]   No, how does that hurt? Because you just hurt you. Just let it go. Well, he just said last week
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.000]   that he doesn't even really care. Well, I'd write, you know, so I know it hurt, but it exists.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And then suddenly it won't exist. Jason, does it spark joy?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.480]   Every once in a while, I run across an old email that sparks joy because I go,
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.680]   oh, yeah, I forgot that happened. That's what I was saying. I still keep things.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.400]   You're not going to be upset. It's just going to be gone.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.200]   It's going to be gone. See the problem? The problem is you get older.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:45.280]   Yeah. You're, see, this is your memory. Your memory goes away. You're going to say, oh, yes,
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.680]   sometimes I'm almost that name. Oh, it started with this. Yeah, then you'll search Google for
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.760]   the email for that. You'll find this little piece of lost memory. And now it's gone.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.360]   I'm okay with that. That's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. So $1.99, you say?
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.280]   $1.99 a month. Just do it. That's what I pay. 24 bucks a year.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.760]   That's what I can do with it. I'm wearing my math.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.040]   Now that's been confirmed.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:19.840]   So, okay, apparently I've got some deciding to do because it is true. I mean,
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:26.240]   these are old emails that I probably will rarely, if ever, need, you know, have any need for.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.040]   But there are some really good emails in there. And I don't have the time to pull them out,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.280]   you know, like baby announcement emails with the thread. Are you ever going to have time?
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:38.320]   I mean, really? No, I'm never going to make time for that.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.760]   There's things that I kept from years ago that are, you know, like something legal or what
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:48.640]   have you that I just want to hold onto it just in case you just never know. Something comes back
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.080]   because people are so litigious nowadays. So I'm keeping that email. I don't care if it is
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.520]   eight years old. You know what I'm saying? So that's why I have it.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.960]   To archive those into a file of lawsuits. I have a lawsuit folder.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.960]   Well, something like that. Right. It's some protect my ass folder.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.720]   Yeah, a CYA.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:14.240]   You should everyone should do this, I think. Have a folder for praise. So when your boss
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.080]   praises you, when someone sends you a nice email, because every now and then you're going to get
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.960]   crappy emails and then you can look in and be like, oh, someone thought I explained that
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.240]   concept really well. Right. That's true. Good stuff.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.240]   So that's like Al Franken's character. That's like Stu Smolley.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.920]   Yes, Stu Smolley. Yes. I'm good enough. I'm smart enough.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.840]   Gosh darn it. People like me.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.680]   Now I know when Ricky News, if you care, oh, we do go for it.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.840]   Just now. That's Google Bank, is it?
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.240]   Jack? Well, no, no, no. Yeah. No,
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.800]   Ad Jack announced that Twitter is going to not take political advertising story in November.
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.560]   Oh, that's. Okay, wait. I think that's.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.520]   Oh, well, I guess for the presidential election, I was like,
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.600]   political ads have been a full swing for the, but there's local elections where I met in November.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.200]   Well, there's plenty of political advertising.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.160]   Chrome spent in 200,000 a month on, or maybe a week on Facebook.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:19.520]   So in full disclosure, I had an exchange about that. I was at an event a week ago with
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:25.440]   where Jack was, and I saw him, and I said that I thought it was a mistake to ban political
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:29.600]   advertising. And some executives there asked me why I said that, but obviously I was not convincing
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:36.880]   because they've decided to, to access it. I get the rationale, but my concern, when I said
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:45.360]   that there was my concern was that it only potentially gives more power to big money television.
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:56.240]   And small candidates and movements that want to try to find thanks to the inexpensive and
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:02.720]   targeted abilities of online, you know, may not be able to find their, their people. So does this,
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:09.600]   does this advantage the incumbents? So, but be well, you've got a lot of people yelling at
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.160]   Facebook to take down the ads. I don't know, yelling, they're making money from bad ads.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.080]   Maybe one of Facebook gave all the money away to voter suppression movements, you know,
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.720]   right. If you took the money out of the factory, is it money or is it the political impact? Sorry,
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.920]   Stacy. Well, you don't have to promote them or pay for them. But if you have a good digital
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.360]   social media type team, you can still have an impact online. It's not like you're saying you
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.520]   can't run anything. You just can't pay to do ads, which are those sales.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:43.920]   Go ahead. I mean, if you have a candidate that really works, you know, that really speaks to
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:51.360]   like people in Black Lives Matter, that they will endorse and promote you across,
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.840]   I don't know, people talk about Black Twitter, like it's a monolithic thing, but you could be
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.080]   promoted to people who care about that in a way that's more authentic.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:07.440]   So two things about that. One is there are those who say, especially on Facebook, that if you're
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.200]   a page and you don't pay for promotion, no matter how much people love you, you don't get promoted,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.960]   which is a different issue, but pain gives you control.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.560]   Second, a lot of people argue that well, targeting is the evil thing. It's targeting
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.920]   is bad. We're going to get rid of all this targeting. Well, no, if you want to be efficient,
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.960]   you want to find people who care about this issue. I don't see anything else.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:33.760]   I think you want to target. The problem is that as ever, the technologies aren't bad.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:40.240]   They get misused by bad actors, but then they get taken away from good actors and good movements.
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:47.680]   I'm curious, just by a vote, do you think Twitter and Facebook should refuse political
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.440]   advertising or not? I'm obviously on the notch. I'm with the notch. I think they should.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.120]   I tend to lean more. They should.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.320]   But the question is, what about you're going to be the type of record?
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.680]   I say at this point, the bad guys are better at this than the good guys.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:16.640]   There's more harm being done by lying and in ads than there is good being done by truth.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.200]   Is there evidence of that? Do we have that data, sir?
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:28.560]   It... No, we don't. I don't think we have the exact data of that, but it sure seems to me
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:36.160]   like the truth is losing. There's a show title for you.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.720]   It's losing deep sigh.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.560]   Wow, sad trombone.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.760]   Carsten, always the ray of sunshine.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.840]   Sorry. It's been a week of fire and screaming.
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.640]   Yes, right.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:59.280]   How are you guys? Are there fires at this? Do you know what's the latest with you guys?
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:04.080]   They're at a distance. I mean, they're far enough away and they actually had a really great
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.200]   night last night as far as getting some containment. It still has a ways to go.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.000]   It's up to 30%. They're feeling pretty empowered around that.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.360]   So, Getty Fire, the fire up by you. Sorry. This is the...
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:23.360]   Yes, this is the Kinkade Fire up by us, which is definitely the fire that I'm more clued on.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.920]   That's a tick fire. I think that was the other one.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.000]   Is the Getty Fire done? Is that contained?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.360]   Ew, I don't believe so.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:38.240]   Fire, is that the same fire that's threatening the Reagan Museum?
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.960]   That's the easy fire. There are so many of these fires.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.120]   This is crazy.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.120]   Who names the fires? Is there somebody who names the fires? Is it like the story?
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.640]   Oh, there was a story about that.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.880]   It's usually based on like where like a geographic landmark or something where they are.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:00.000]   And sometimes though they're boring, like the 245th fire, if you don't have a distinguishing
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.640]   landmark, you name it based on the number of fires that have been reported.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.920]   Yeah. Who did that story? Was it the Times?
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:10.560]   I didn't see it.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.880]   Oh, there you go.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.920]   The Times, okay.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.840]   Carsten or someone.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.880]   But I mean, man, what an unfortunate name for a fire.
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.280]   Easy.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.240]   This is the story.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.760]   There you go.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.480]   Yeah, never easy.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:33.680]   Yeah, okay. I was going to say, I agree with Miss Stacy regarding the social media teams because
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:39.280]   if you have a good squad, they understand analytics and
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:44.240]   motive operation to target who to get their message out.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.600]   So it's not necessarily having to pay for ads.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:55.120]   They just do the leg work and work the market inside of it without paying for a particular service.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:02.000]   And there's a lot of people that are doing that successfully that show up in my feeds,
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.720]   but it doesn't show up as sponsored in my feeds.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.280]   Right, right.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.600]   You know, so they know the system.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.120]   They know the timing, you know.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:16.480]   Jack did say in this thread that it's not just candidate ads, but they realize that issue ads
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.840]   present in his words a way to kind of circumvent and get that message through there.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.760]   So they're just stopping those as well.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:29.680]   Yeah, so that's what, you know, it says slippery slope.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.360]   Yeah, it is.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.160]   It is.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:37.360]   You know, what if you want to start a campaign for climate change and now you can't.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.280]   Right.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:39.840]   Still can't.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.920]   I don't think I don't think either is the solution.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.160]   The no, well, no, you can't now on Twitter.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.920]   That's an issue.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.800]   Oh, you.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.680]   Oh, okay.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.240]   You're right.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.120]   So that's the issue.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.240]   So it's an issue and it's gone.
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.280]   I think that's a and what's the what's an issue because the next priority.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.800]   It's just it's just the.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.360]   It's just the.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.560]   It's good education and issue.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.160]   Well, in so that's just the.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.000]   That's just the advertising portion of it.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.840]   You're right, though.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.320]   I see.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.120]   I see your point.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:12.080]   It also feels kind of bad for Twitter because how the heck are they going to make
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:12.560]   money?
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.560]   I mean, they're still worried about, you know, they.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.480]   Get a stock down.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.840]   Yeah, they're not.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.320]   Wait, it's.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:18.640]   Awesome.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:19.040]   Last week.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.560]   Meanwhile, you also had related to this.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:27.040]   You had the letter from, which is fascinating from Facebook staff.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.120]   Can I take the hat off now?
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:29.840]   This feels dull.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.960]   If you if you would like to.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.880]   Go for it.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.400]   We're talking about serious issues.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.920]   He's like, I need my gravitas.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.040]   Quitters never win.
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.440]   I'll say yeah.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.720]   Uncle, I'm going to show.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.000]   Hey, Jeff, I'm going to show you gravitas with purple hair.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.440]   You could pull it off.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.480]   That is the show.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.200]   Yeah, it's the purple hair.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:58.640]   So, so Facebook employees, some unknown number, wrote a letter to Zuckerberg,
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:02.640]   complained about his hands off policy on political ads.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.760]   So you got two extremes here.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.720]   And I don't think that either is 100% right.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:12.960]   I mean, I, you know, I've argued that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth in every
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.680]   political ad.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.200]   That's another slippery slope.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.240]   But there there is some limit, right?
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.840]   If a politician used a racial slur and an ad,
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.600]   surely they would take that down, I would hope.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.120]   So, so, so where is the limit?
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.000]   Where is the line?
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.840]   And in each way, each platform is saying, we don't want to work at this.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:39.600]   And I get that to an extent because we don't want it necessarily to be their job.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.640]   But it is their job to set their standards of behavior.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.400]   And that to me should be the line.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.640]   Well, but if your standard of behavior is something, I mean, the problem is standards of
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:54.000]   behaviors are kind of, you know it when we see it.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.840]   So like, we have a very much on the chat, for example, we have standards of behavior.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.000]   Right.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.040]   And people run a foul of them every now and then because sometimes it's by accident.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.200]   Sometimes they're just arguing maybe how they feel.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.960]   They're like, I was just a little too vehement.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.160]   I shouldn't be kicked out for this.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:18.240]   So the problem is they don't want to have a point of view because points of view
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.480]   alienate people and they don't want to alienate people.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.160]   But unfortunately, if you're going to have standards or if you're going to try to become,
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.880]   I mean, they are a platform for information.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:31.520]   And in that case, you kind of have to have a point of view.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.800]   Well, that's yeah, point of view is a good way to put it.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.320]   Yeah, that's a great way to put it.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.720]   They're all being put in this uncomfortable position of having to having to take
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.280]   take a stand on some sort of side of this.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.600]   And you're just not going to please everybody as much as they just love the please everybody.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.640]   That's just not going to happen.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.280]   Same problem.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.480]   The journal was in.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.360]   Yeah, have a journal.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.080]   Same way.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:54.720]   The same way.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.080]   Well, we're not human.
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:56.880]   We don't have opinions.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.400]   We don't have any point of view.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.600]   But we do.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:04.560]   And that's actually one of the big problems with the way we talk about like politics and
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.680]   government today.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:11.120]   So government rules, the way we structure our laws are designed to incentivize certain
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.640]   behaviors and things.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.480]   But we don't actually talk about it that way.
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:19.840]   So I think we're in this weird place where we think everything can be fair and neutral to
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.240]   everyone.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.200]   But that's stupid.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.640]   That's not the way the world works.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:27.040]   There's always going to be trade-offs in people who are advantaged or disadvantaged by something.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.720]   And we don't actually talk about that.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:37.920]   We just talk about like this side gets this, this side gets that in a way that's very polarizing.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.880]   I just see this and I'm like, look, y'all, we have to talk
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.480]   about the give and take.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.600]   And we don't actually just Americans in general don't do that.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:52.640]   And talking about journalism a little bit, maybe I'm just so confused and overwhelmed by
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:58.160]   where we're at right now and the last however many years that have rewritten my memory on how
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:58.800]   this used to be.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.720]   But how did they used to be?
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   From the perspective of journalism, taking a stance versus not taking a stance,
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.200]   like what's the historical point of view there and how is now different?
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.440]   The first thing, the first word that comes to my mind when you ask how did it used to be,
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.080]   it was slower, slower.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.520]   Well, yeah, that's a really good point.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.080]   Well, there was, I mean, Jeff will speak to this, I'm sure, but there was the history of
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.240]   yellow journalism where you, who was it who created the first or second paper to?
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.160]   First, thank you.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.200]   First computer.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.320]   Pulitzer as well. Pulitzer as well, but Hearst is most famous for it.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:42.800]   And yeah, Hearst is the one who was very, was the Spanish Civil War who was like,
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.640]   yeah, let's do that.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:50.480]   You used to get your papers based on the type of person you thought you were
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.280]   and papers had a point of view.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.080]   They still do.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:59.280]   And even when you're objective, that doesn't mean you don't have a point of view.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:05.840]   It just means that you're trying to understand the issue and report truly both sides,
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.240]   not actual both sides because that's stupid.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:14.000]   But like, my example would be when I was at Giga-ohm reporting about like broadband issues,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.400]   that can be super polarizing.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.080]   But I took the consumer point of view.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.520]   That being said, I did talk to all the carriers to understand their point of view,
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.680]   and I would report why they felt that way.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.040]   And I would get their science and everything right.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:37.120]   So that's to me what objectivity means and what it's kind of not.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.720]   We're moving away from that, I think.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.840]   That's...
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:46.240]   So since you opened the door for me, this is kind of a perennial in a journalism school, obviously,
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.760]   with our objectivity.
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:55.120]   I'm of the school, heretical as usual, that objectivity is a false school.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.200]   It never really existed. It was us trying to separate ourselves from the public and save somehow or not.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.880]   It was a business decision to rate measure.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:05.360]   We want to survey everybody so everybody loves us.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.600]   And it leads to dangerous things like false balance.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:15.120]   And it leads to the myth that we serve everyone all alike when there are many communities
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.920]   in the United States who've never been served by mass media.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.680]   But we say, "Oh no, no, no, we're the objective ones.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.200]   We decide what's important."
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.800]   We just say, because it fits into everything.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.920]   It's our news judgment.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.920]   It's our false balance. It's all of that.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.240]   So I think transparency is needed.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:37.200]   People need to know our worldviews and our experience so that they can judge us accordingly.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:44.240]   We should operate with intellectual honesty and state that which is the uncomfortable truths.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:51.040]   But it also goes to the point you were just making about the platforms and not wanting to
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.800]   have a position to do anything, to take a stand because it's uncomfortable.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:03.440]   I appreciate all of you.
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:09.840]   One thing that I appreciate about you is that even on this show,
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.640]   you put us on the spot on something that's uncomfortable, which on one hand,
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:19.200]   right, taking a position on this and pulling us just a few minutes ago,
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.640]   could be putting me in a position that maybe I don't want to admit how I feel one way or the
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:31.680]   other. And that could be a bad thing. But instead, it kind of forces us to have the conversation,
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.240]   have the conversation. And that is at the point.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:34.960]   You could always play black and say no comment.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:40.880]   It's true. It's true. But yeah, I wasn't fun at that.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:47.760]   I would say there's a lot of people in the chat room talking about factual reporting.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:56.080]   I don't. It is great to have facts. When you are speaking about something that is a contentious
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:02.800]   issue, which most things are beyond the cop shop, right? This happened at this point in time.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:08.640]   But any time you report on something where there are going to be, again, those trade-offs,
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:14.320]   you report the facts. This is the law. This is what it states. But people need more context
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:19.120]   because they don't necessarily have the experience of 10 years writing about the government.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:24.080]   So you need to say, and I think it is objective to say, people on this side of the issue
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:29.920]   feel like the law would do this for them. And people on the other side feel like this law would
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:35.600]   do this against them or would hurt them in this way. And I don't think that's... You can't just
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.920]   report straight facts because it doesn't give people the context and the ability to make up
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:47.760]   their minds. Is it safe to say that you can report in black and white with the facts,
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:53.600]   but that black and white needs a little bit of color to back it up. Or shades of gray. I'm not sure.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:24:00.800]   Well, that's how I'm looking at a lot of the reporting nowadays. And all of the good ones,
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.120]   they do exactly what you just said. They present the facts of the matter,
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:10.720]   and then they give you the context to help you understand the facts of the matter of enhancing it all.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:17.440]   Right. And I would say, and that's where Jeff, your transparency comes in. I was
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:26.240]   never shy about saying, when push comes to shove, I am pro consumer, and I generally air on the side
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:32.560]   of being excited about technology. Those are the two facts that are straight about, my point of view.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:40.160]   Oh, sorry. This wig parts on the other side, so I keep pushing my hair out of my eyes the wrong way.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:51.040]   Habits. Now, this also ties into something else is in the rundown. The leaked video,
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:59.200]   the internal all hands meeting at Google. This time it's Google CEO, Sundar Pichai talking about
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:04.320]   a number of things. But now, you know, this happened, what would Facebook a couple of weeks ago?
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.920]   They're all hands being leaked. Now, we've got Google all hands meetings. This was from, I think,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.760]   late last week where they talked a little bit about the hiring of Miles Taylor,
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.560]   who's the former Department of Homeland Security official. Employees were really pushing back on
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:24.240]   his role in the border camps and defending them in his previous role. And then talking about
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:29.920]   internal community moderation, saying that at the scale that the company is at right now,
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:36.240]   it's really different, difficult to moderate, moderate at the scale, you know, asking for
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:41.680]   employees trust chastising employees, or at least in the words of the Washington Post article,
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:48.000]   chastising employees for leaking information to the press. Sort of like this video, by the way.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:57.200]   The video of the leaking is now leaked. And acknowledging that they are, Pichai said,
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.240]   we are genuinely struggling with some issues, transparency at scale. So being transparent,
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:08.960]   again, taking some sort of a stance, some sort of a side, while at the same time trying to appeal
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:16.320]   to everyone. And that's, I mean, that's just impossible. But yet in his role, he must feel
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.120]   the necessity around that, that that's kind of a part of what he has to do.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.120]   Yeah, comes with territory, right? Yeah.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:31.200]   Is what it is. Yeah. So all right. Well, we've done that one.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:38.400]   And only three of us are wearing something on the top of our heads. We'll see what story I
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.640]   look dumb enough as is a nourishment clue. I'm marshal Mclew into that.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:48.640]   We'll see what story takes another hat off of us or a wig. When it gets really serious,
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:58.080]   that's what happens. Let's see here something a little bit more fun. Any interest in Google buying
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.200]   Fitbit? This seemed to be getting people kind of a little riled up like, that would be great for
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:07.600]   Google or that's not that great for Fitbit. Who the heck knows? Seems like it makes perfect
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:12.000]   sense, right? Just more and more data to mine. Sure.
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.480]   So in Kevin, actually on our site wrote a story about this because Kevin and I am a
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:27.120]   dedicated Fitbit user have been since at launch pre I've always had a Fitbit.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:32.960]   So I would be devastated if Google bought this and messed with it because Google's Wear OS
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:42.400]   platform is not good. And there's that. Yeah. It's laughably bad. So if Google,
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:48.080]   if Google bought it and tried to integrate the Fitbit data into my Google stream but didn't mess
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:54.640]   with the hardware or anything else, then then sure. But as it stands down, I'm like, oh no,
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:59.360]   don't take this away from me. I love it. And I don't have an Apple phone. So I don't have an Apple
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:07.200]   watch, which is could we look at it the way we look at the Waze acquisition and how Google Maps
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:12.160]   has definitely gotten better since then. And I like to assume that it's been some influence
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.640]   from that team of engineers that were formerly with Waze. Guaranteed.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:21.680]   And you can still download the Waze app. Exactly. Waze has not changed. Like it hasn't
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.320]   strayed. They haven't decided, okay, we're getting rid of Waze. Who the heck knows if they
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:31.600]   one day decide to do that? Yeah. And that's always my fear is like, sure, you know, say they buy,
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:36.240]   they say they're going to buy Fitbit and everything. This just is way is going. We're going to let
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.880]   Fitbit operate as its own. It's a successful product, but it's the two to three years down the line.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.320]   We're like, okay, now we're starting to see what we worried about.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.240]   So yeah, five years it took with the Nest acquisition.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.280]   Right. Right. 2014, they acquired it. And then 2019, they went.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:29:00.640]   All right. We control it all now. Nest is absolutely the appropriate comparison in this regard,
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:06.880]   because Nest was a pretty popular brand doing just fine. And now you've got what's going on
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:12.800]   right now. I mean, there are a number of signs that the recognition around Nest,
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:18.400]   they're just like, well, now that Google's in there, I just don't trust it or whatever the case
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:24.240]   may be, it's just not the same brand. I've never used a Fitbit because I just never really
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:30.480]   felt the need to buy a pedometer or anything like that. But I don't want to say this.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:39.760]   I could see Google channeling the data from that and given it as part of my morning routine and
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:44.720]   some analytics and stuff to work towards and things like that. Is that what Fitbit does already?
[00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:50.000]   It just sort of gives you some stats from yesterday to let you know that you were a 20%
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   lax versus what you've done over the last couple of days and you need to pick it up.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.520]   Is that how it works? Because I don't know. They just launched Fitbit Premium,
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:04.000]   which is a subscription that presumably has some of that. I'll let you know at another month.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:11.840]   What they do is they give you steps, they give you a sleep score,
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:20.080]   they give you heart rate information, and you can use it with other apps to track
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:26.160]   if you want to lose weight, calories, that sort of thing. You can do it in a track track activity.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:33.520]   So it's got several items. It knows if I'm biking or swimming or doing things and it tracks that
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:43.040]   automatically. It just logs that as like, "Oh, exercise." But I think where it could really
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:48.720]   make a difference for someone like Google, and ScooterX is pointing out that Alphabet is the one
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:54.720]   trying to buy it. Not cool. Thank you, ScooterX. With that information,
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:00.480]   you could do a lot with medical devices like what Apple's doing with like AFib.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:09.280]   As we start tying our personal wellness into everything else around us and seeking assistance
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:15.600]   helps, assistant help for that, this would be a good deal for it. I know Kevin and I talked about
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:22.400]   like Amazon buying Fitbit. So it's not crazy that you would want this deeply personal data on people.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.480]   Your fear would be your biggest fear would be Google buys this and then decides,
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:35.040]   "Hey, we're going to throw Android Wear OS into that." I don't see them doing that.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:44.400]   I also like Fitbit makes decent products. So I don't want Google to get all fancy and googly
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:52.960]   with it. I know this is coming from a woman who carries a pixel, but we had to get through some
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:58.880]   and I actually like the Nexus, but Google has some weird hardware designs. I'm just going to
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:05.440]   throw it out there. They do some weird stuff. So if they start doing that, I'm like,
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:11.360]   "I don't know Google. The Fitbit's good. Don't mess with it." If you're going to buy it, don't
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:19.120]   mess with it. Yeah, maybe they won't mess with it. Yeah. That would be my guess is that if a
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:25.440]   Google... Sorry, if Alphabet did buy Fitbit, that it would be one of those. Yes, we've got Fitbit,
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.200]   but we're not going to change the thing that you love because people love their Fitbits.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:36.160]   I think it could be a huge negative for a lot of people if suddenly they said,
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:40.160]   "And we're going to make it better. We've got ideas to bring assistant and blah, blah,
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:47.280]   bacon, Android Wear and back and forth." I think they really damaged the perception of the deal
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:52.960]   if they did that. I think the best way they could handle it would be the ways way where they take
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:33:01.920]   it over and have it be its own thing and slowly add functions of Fitbit into WearOS,
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:11.680]   to make WearOS better, to make that an actual platform that can compete with Apple Watch.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.640]   That is true. That would be fine as long as they still have the Fitbit option because I'm very
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:25.360]   skeptical on WearOS. I think part of it is Google strategy because with WearOS, you can buy
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:34.720]   something from Fossil, Misfit, Michael Kors, other brands that sell watches. I don't know all the
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:42.640]   options out there. On one hand, that's very Googly, right? Android on all the phones. But on the
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:49.760]   other hand, it means that they have to keep things kind of basic or they can't optimize things that
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:54.800]   you can necessarily with dedicated hardware, like having a co-processor or something like that.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:34:00.960]   Not the Fitbit is using a co-processor. Maybe if they turn Fitbit into a flagship brand that
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.000]   really rested on the Fitbit functionality, I feel like the two things could become very
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.520]   different if that makes sense. WearOS for generic smartwatches. Then if you wanted to turn Fitbit
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:18.640]   into a true competitor to Apple, maybe. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:25.440]   What about the Android model where Google admits that it's WearOS sucks and they just hand that
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:29.600]   franchise over to Fitbit and say, "You do the wearables."
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:36.080]   That might be... Fitbit bought the IP from Pebble. Do you guys remember how excited we
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:41.440]   are about Pebble? My son still has his Pebble watch. He wears it every day.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:48.240]   All I can see from Pebble, and granted, I'm not a super deep user or person inside Fitbit,
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:52.800]   but what they did is they took some of the Pebble interfaces and they put them on the Fitbit.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.600]   I don't see much else from that acquisition having made it over.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.720]   I don't know, basically. Oh, that's a device. Sorry, y'all.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:09.520]   Is that your Google Home learning how to bark? Yeah, that's what it sounded like.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:17.920]   No, that's an actual dog. I have a secret package. Those new tune speakers on the home,
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:26.560]   meaning. We were talking about this whole Fitbit thing, and then someone in chat just
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:33.920]   posted, reminded me, ScooterX, thank you, that were any of you ever users of the Moto 360?
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:39.440]   I want it to be, but it didn't fit my wrist well. It didn't look right, but I want it to be.
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:43.760]   Okay, I used the first one. It had the flat tire. Either of you, Moto 360.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.880]   Yeah, I did. I did too.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.080]   Yep. Because it was one of the early, early, hand-read.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:53.600]   Yeah, you forgave it a lot of... You did. You did. Because, hey, I'm a merly.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:59.360]   Flat tire was just one of them. Well, apparently, there's going to be a new one in 2019.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:03.040]   Although, I think this time around, it's the kind of thing where Motorola is just kind of,
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:08.400]   it's a branding deal. Someone else is making the watch, and they're giving the Motorola name,
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:12.800]   the Motorola 360 or whatever. I mean, it looks nice.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.160]   It looks nice. I'd wear it. No flat tire, so that's good.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:23.120]   I never really saw the flat tire. The bottom of the screen wasn't fully filled in with heat.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.040]   It was an upside-down notch in a certain way.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.120]   Yeah, thank you. Okay, yes. It was probably a pricing thing, right?
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:36.560]   It had to do with a sensor, I believe. Well, no, the wire. They just had the room for the
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:43.040]   wiring. The watch would have had to have had a big bezel. The way Leo explained it at the time.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.720]   No bezels on your watch.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:52.720]   So, who knows if this will make a splash or not? I mean, it's WearOS, so probably not.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:58.240]   Yeah. Unfortunately, as much as I would love WearOS, I'm seeing...
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:03.840]   I suppose people wear Apple watches. I do see some... A lot of Apple watches.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.000]   You've probably seen Galaxy watches out there, right?
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.680]   I don't see any Galaxy watches. I don't see any Galaxy watches.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.200]   I don't see any Galaxy watches. I don't see any Galaxy watches.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:15.120]   This is just my ridiculous non-scientific view, but I don't think there's a growth pattern here
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:21.120]   on these things. There actually is a slight growth pattern, but you're right. This is not
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.640]   like a smartphone. This is not everyone's going to have one. But there are really compelling use
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.600]   cases that are popping up that I think will drive further adoption. So, like with Apple,
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:38.560]   when it did fall detection on their watch, I mean, I almost walked out and bought an iPhone,
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.800]   so I could get that on my watch because I feint all the time. So, I was like, "Oh,
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:51.680]   use case that works for me." But I didn't. So, and I do think you'll see
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:58.960]   a certain subset of the people who use it, and it's probably fitness freaks,
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.400]   they tend to use it a lot. And then very busy people tend to buy the smart watches so they
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:08.560]   can get notifications and things like that. Well, here's more breaking news.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:15.840]   They're making just your points, Stacy. Apple reported the revenue rose 1.8%.
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:26.240]   On the watch? To 64.5. With a behind a rise in sales of wearables and services such as apps,
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:31.440]   streaming, music, and so on, which offset a 9.2% decline in iPhone sales.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:39.280]   The wearables includes the AirPods. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I imagine so.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.480]   And they just announced a new AirPods. And that's it for 250, right?
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:51.280]   Yeah, so they're not cheap at all. I mean, I spent, I'm trying to think, I think I bought my
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:58.720]   job as for 160, which was, or 175 even. The Microsoft ones are going to be 250, I believe.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:03.840]   Was it a Microsoft or the Googles? Googles, I think are 230, I think. I'm actually waiting.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.240]   I'm probably going to buy those. It's pretty competitive.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:11.760]   Yeah. I'm looking forward to trying to be out. These truly wireless earphones can be pretty pricey.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:19.120]   They just got to work and give me great audio quality. Yeah. That's the thing. Justify those
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:24.160]   on the subway the other day. And, and this woman's just standing there. I had a seat.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.480]   I didn't give a tour because I'm a real old man. And suddenly she's doing this. I'm going to
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.360]   weird dance. She's looking in the hood. She's torn to her little one. No, she lost her thing.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.240]   She's going into the bag. And then Ray Rounders starts doing the same dance. And finally they found her.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:45.440]   Man. Yeah. That's close. That's, that's always a moment of the panic.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:51.040]   There comes $125. All right. All right. All right. Can you buy just one? You can.
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:55.280]   Oh, an apple you can. I don't know about the other side. Yeah.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.920]   On apple. On apple you can. Yeah. On apple you can. You can't like, like I can't like got my
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.800]   little jobbers right here. But yeah, I don't think you can buy just one of these. Yeah.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.160]   That could be definitely depends on the manufacturer. I'm not sure they're all in the,
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:12.480]   in the habit of offering you a single, single pod. I don't have the budget for that.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.000]   There's a right in the left. So you have to, you know, know what you.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:23.920]   She lost. Yeah. My sister got hearing aids. She's my older sister. And of course they're Bluetooth.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.080]   And they do all kinds of neat stuff that the, that the, the, the ear thing is don't do.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:32.160]   Right. The phone rings and she just starts talking. She can listen to the TV.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:38.240]   It's pretty cool how, how integrated that is now. And it's, it's invisible.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:43.200]   Yeah. You're going to start seeing more of that because I think it was last year,
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:49.440]   the year before, but in 2020 we're getting over the, over, over the air, over the counter OTC
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:54.960]   hearing aids, the FDA approved this concept of being able to. So there's companies like Bo's
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:41:00.240]   are getting into this. I assume, you know, we'll see Apple get in there eventually, but it is
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:05.200]   the ability to buy over the counter hearing aids without going to an audio,
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:15.680]   audiologist, audiologist to get fitted in that sort of thing. They won't be a sophisticated,
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:21.600]   but for people like me who used to, who are losing their hearing because they were covering
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:27.360]   concerts when they were in college. That's probably sufficient for now. So you're going to see a
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:31.600]   lot of really cool stuff coming in with these and it's going to be fun. Right. My father,
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:39.840]   who's 93, deaf as a doorknail. And he has the TV, turns it up all the way. So we can hear
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:45.360]   Fox News, right? Well, the apartment upstairs, it's a, you know, it's a continuing care place.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:50.960]   They took out their carpeting. And the guy up there isn't quite as deaf. So he complains all the
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.720]   time and it goes back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. So they came and I got him,
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:42:01.200]   I got my father, a Bluetooth speaker, an amplifier that he can put right next to him on the couch.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.160]   Oh, nice. Right. Right. So the sounds down on the main TV and it comes over there. Even that was
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:13.600]   getting too loud. So to broker piece, the authorities from the complex came in and they drilled a hole
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:18.560]   in the thing and put a screw in it so we can only turn it up so loud. So they could tell the
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.720]   other guy we've stopped it. He can only turn it up so loud. There's no 11 on his thing.
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.200]   That's you.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:31.760]   So there if he had the hearing aids with the Bluetooth, but it's just too complicated to
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.240]   set up for him. I just, I can't imagine him calling and saying, it'll work. And the
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:41.520]   Bluetooth is never perfect. Although, you know, even even just regular Bluetooth headphones,
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.800]   like I was using a pair last night just connected to my TV because I didn't want to wake anybody
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.880]   up put on the headphones. It zaps it right over and that's what you were going to say.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:58.800]   Yeah, no, I don't like the Jetsons. What these new heroes, that's it. These new here at earbuds,
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:05.520]   they actually do they have algorithms that they filter out background noise. They're designed
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:10.800]   for people with hearing plus. They're not hearing aids, but they're designed to help them hear
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:16.160]   certain things better. And one of the things they do is work with your TV. So that might be an
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:21.520]   option. I feel like Kevin bought a pair of either new heroes or something else. But I can't remember
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.920]   the other brand. One of the guys at my father's dinner table downstairs in the home,
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:34.800]   yes, we have a app. He puts his phone down and then the phone adjusts for the sound around and
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:41.680]   and gives him better sound in his hearing aids. Oh, that's cool. That's cool. Never heard
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.040]   that. So it's a concentrate on just the conversation, the table, when it cuts down the around,
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.320]   but it has a larger sense than you have it just from here. Wow. And that's
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:54.400]   that's the kind of stuff we can do with like basically machine learning. And we just start seeing
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:44:00.560]   a lot of it. And I mean, as much as we don't like things like echoes and Google minis or whatever
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:05.840]   for privacy purposes, if you imagine that sort of give and take between your personal devices and
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:11.920]   things around you, that's a really compelling vision of the future for people, especially with
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:17.600]   an aging population. And we've talked before in the show about loss of sight too,
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:26.000]   that if you could really have a map inside your home and you want to go someplace in the home or
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.520]   in a building or an office, and you can be directed there with cues because you can take
[00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:38.880]   sense of that. It's just amazing what's going to happen. Yeah, really cool. Awesome. Well, by the
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.600]   way, by the way, a good use for facial recognition for a blind person.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:54.560]   Oh, well, yes, come on admit it. I got one. Come on. Come on, Stacy. Okay, so the processing power
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:45:01.440]   to recognize individual places faces on a smartphone type device isn't there yet. Now,
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:07.440]   if you had, but if you had like six people and it ran a model just to recognize six people,
[00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:14.080]   which totally is interesting, then it could be like, oh, that's Stacy. So you would have the
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.080]   ability to select 10 of your closest friends that you could recognize, for example.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:26.880]   And it could give you a subtle cue. But you could also do that with some sort of app to app
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.480]   communication on your device. It doesn't actually have to be facial recognition.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.320]   Oh, it's not like your camera's got a standard.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:40.880]   Everybody that you also realize about privacy for the other person. I don't want to broadcast
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:48.560]   my presence. Anybody but right. That's complicated. Yeah, facial recognition would be the way to go.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:54.000]   Sounds like. Anyway, all right, we solved other problems. Great.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:01.040]   We've created a lot of solutions for people. You're welcome. Let's take a break and thank the
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:06.080]   sponsor and then we will get back to more with this week in Google this episode of this week
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:11.440]   in Google has brought to you by Zapier. If you're, you know, if you have a business,
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.960]   you already know the growing business is hard. You don't want to be wasting, you know, your time,
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:23.600]   your hours every day, just kind of moving data from emails to spreadsheets to your CRM to wherever
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.400]   you need it to go doing that all manually. It's kind of unnecessary when you have the right tools
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:35.760]   in place to do it for you. And that's exactly what Zapier is all about. Zapier has over 1,500

[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:19.840]   you know could be automated because that's exactly what Zapier was built to do. You just go to zapier.com/twig,
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:24.720]   connect the apps that you use most. You know, really think about what are these apps that I'm
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:31.920]   using regularly? And what are the what are these movements that I'm making these manual movements
[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:36.560]   between these apps? Once you figure those things out, it becomes really easy to define them within
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:42.000]   Zapier. You can let Zapier take it from there. Best of all, it's easy to build the exact solution
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.480]   that you need in minutes without writing code or asking a developer for help. You can join more

[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:02.880]   it here to do all sorts of creative things, you know, talked in the past about putting the dock
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:09.520]   that like the the dock into the teleprompter when we need to go to Showtime with Tech News Weekly,
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:15.600]   Mikea set up this cool zap that like basically eliminates the 10 steps that I had to do prior.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:21.280]   It's really neat that it's easy because I spent a couple of years doing it a very long-handed
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:26.800]   sort of way. So it's nice to not have to do that anymore. Make more time to grow your business

[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:49.280]   Zapier for their support of this week in Google.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:59.680]   All right. Was there anything interesting from this earnings report? Earnings and interesting in
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:06.880]   the same sentences? Maybe they're wrong way to put it. But it's everybody has a panic about it.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:12.320]   Their profit is down. There's still making plenty of money, Google. Apple bet.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:16.400]   Google, they're investing and investing is not a bad thing.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:21.920]   Bezos did it for years and years and years, not trying to profit. That's true. I'm not worried
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:26.400]   about Google. I'm not going to go take it out of tin cup for them. And Alphabet blames their
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:32.880]   increase in R&D spending for a decline in profits, advertising no surprise represented
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:39.760]   85% of total revenue for the company. Which is down considerably. It used to be like 98%.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:46.800]   Okay. And then they're filling in with other revenues, $6.4 billion in other revenues,
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:52.560]   which does include things like the Pixel phone, a Play Store cloud products. That accounts for
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:50:00.880]   around 15% of total revenue. So I got to beef with this. If it's so much money being spent on
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:07.120]   research and development, why in the heck are we getting brand new phones out the box that
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:12.320]   allows you to unlock it with your eyes closed? You're not spending enough money. Spend more.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:18.720]   Well, there's been a lot of money on different problems. I'm just being a smart aleck.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:28.400]   Fix that. Other bets you wouldn't be surprised to hear is let's see here.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:35.040]   Losing more money. Yes, losing more money. That's right. Operating losses rose from $727 million
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:41.360]   last year to $941 million this year. Revenue of $155 million. That's things like Waymo,
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:46.160]   Fiverr, Verily, that sort of stuff. Verily. I mean, they're spending a lot right now for,
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:50.960]   you know, contact lenses that detect your blood sugar. They're going through FDA approvals on
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:58.240]   stuff. There's Waymo. So that's yeah, those are, I'm surprised to lose more money. But
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:08.160]   I guess it's almost a billion a quarter. Huh? Hold up. Let me just process that for a minute.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:12.960]   All right, we're good. Billion a quarter. But it's Google, right?
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:18.000]   Doesn't matter. You know, that's a couple of steak dinners for them. That's all.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:26.720]   Their Q3 revenue was, I mean, 40 billion. Right. Yeah. I mean, that's, that's not, yeah.
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.760]   Looking at the numbers on these companies, it's really. And again, if it's almost hard to even
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:36.240]   really make sense of it. Yeah, or feel sorry for them. Or feel sorry. Absolutely that.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:41.360]   Never. Never. But again, even if they're putting all their money in their R&D,
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:48.320]   it's, it's about the long game. We talked about this with Amazon on this. We can text just recently
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:54.400]   with the amount of money that Amazon is spending to work out with logistics and, you know, help
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:52:01.840]   reduce the carbon footprint and, and give an extra one day, well, one day shipping for people
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:06.320]   out there on prime. And it's a big investment and it's probably going to pay off pretty
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:13.280]   day. I got nicely voted in the long run. So why not Google? Put the money where they need to put it
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:21.040]   far as research goes and play the long game. Yeah. Yep. Indeed. You brought up Amazon. So I'll go
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:26.640]   ahead and throw this out real quick. Amazon is removing the 1499 fee for Amazon Fresh. And,
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:34.000]   and now we'll include it into the grab bag. That is the Amazon Prime benefit. When you pay for your
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.320]   yearly membership to Amazon Prime, you get all these things. Now you get Amazon Fresh included.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:44.960]   That's free delivery of groceries. Also one in two hour delivery options. And really just kind of
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:52.240]   tying up the, you know, if you have a local Whole Foods, that inventory is being looped into the
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:53:01.360]   Amazon app. That's really cake. That thing right there. That. I know Mr. Sergeant uses this service
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:07.520]   pretty regularly. I've never been inclined to do so, but I got to try it now. Since this is part
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:12.880]   of my just benefits is just sitting there. I got to, you know, hey, can you send me a case of beer?
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:18.480]   Please and thank you. Oh, no, it's wonderful. Like we used to use these services like I had a
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:23.200]   party. So you don't have to, so you can deliver stuff to you right beforehand. So you don't have to
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:30.080]   send out your spouse for like even things like ice. I don't know if Amazon Fresh does ice, but it's
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:36.240]   that would be a little difficult. Yeah. We we well, you'd be surprised at which. I mean,
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:42.080]   we would have Instacart go out and get it for us. It's it's truly a handy thing. And it's really
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:47.680]   handy for people, one, who have disposable income who can afford it. But now they're cutting that
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:54.960]   down. But it's really handy for people who are busy. So like, like going to the grocery store
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:54:03.600]   after you pick up your kid from daycare. Yes, it does. Preach, preach. So being able to order
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:08.240]   everything and then have it arrive, you know, while you're cooking dinner or whenever, that's
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.040]   awesome or better yet. If you've got, you know, the garage delivery and a fridge and your garage,
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:16.800]   just have them shove everything in there. And then you're like, like, I've accomplished.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:20.800]   Whatever happened to Amazon's thing where you were going to give them a code to get in the house
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:25.440]   and put them away for you. And Wal-Mart is now doing it too. Yes. Amazon G.
[00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:29.840]   We really haven't. Yeah. Walmart just actually, I think it was last week announced that they've
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:36.000]   started their trial in like three cities and their weird cities like Kalamazoo and maybe Louisville.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.160]   I don't know. What was the company? Oh, geez. What was the huge company or a huge
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:44.160]   evaluation, not in revenue that had the special refrigerators in your garage?
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:48.640]   Oh boy, I don't know what you're talking about. I don't remember that. I have no idea. Oh, yeah.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.920]   Oh, oh, yeah. That was the big one. It was the original one that was doing all this grocery
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:55:00.160]   delivery. Chai Room help. And part of the shtick was they had a special unit, your garage. You'd
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:06.880]   like me in the garage. Okay. Put things there. They could stay fresh. I mean, the capital expenditure
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:13.920]   was ungodly. I'm doing trying my Google food and I'm just coming back with Wal-Mart.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:21.600]   It's not Viking. It was the original. I think if F company were still alive. Web fan. Was it
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:26.640]   what we talked about? You mentioned it. You a fridge. Web fan just brought it. It was like
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:32.400]   Cosmo wasn't her pee pod. Cosmo. Did they really give you a fridge? Never heard of Cosmo. Okay. You
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:40.320]   are not old. That's okay. I'm old. I'm old. I'm old. It's old. Yeah. Web fan was dropping your
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:44.960]   groceries on your front porch. Right. Yeah. They were from my memory, they were just straight
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:49.920]   up grocery delivery. I don't remember a special fridge. One of their competitors came in and they
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.200]   were going to beat Web fan because Web fan, of course, was going to take over the world. Okay.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:56:00.800]   Yeah. Web fan was a big deal. Yeah. It was. There was a peep pod. No, they were.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:07.360]   People. It was safe. Peepod was safe way. Safe way. Yeah. Okay. Home grocer. Home grocer.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:15.840]   Yeah. I got nothing else. Okay. But okay. Well, I like your, I like your potentially imaginary
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:24.560]   fridge though. I'm loving this idea. I think you made it up. Now, if they could put a, you're one of
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:31.680]   these fancy fridges in our garage that the groceries can like zap over to some sort of magic.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:37.760]   Teleportation. Teleporting the quantum computing. Your groceries are in the fridge. A grocery
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:44.880]   printer. I want to be clear here that I am not old enough to remember this, but I'm told that
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:50.160]   the old ice box had a door to the outside so that they could come and deliver the ice to your
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:55.520]   ice box without coming into your home. This is true. This is true. My heart is old. I heard that
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:03.680]   myself actually. Yeah. So just to just cutting off any old man jokes. He's hitting it off at the
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:08.800]   pass. Cut it off at the pass. We should get that in there.
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:16.240]   I forgot about Cosmo. Yeah. Where did we, how do we get there? I think it was Amazon fresh.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:20.400]   Yeah. It was all that. Yeah. So you're getting so old. You can't remember what we were talking
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:26.800]   about two minutes ago. You make fun of me. I never really, it's, I guess it was part of the whole
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:33.600]   $15 extra that discouraged me from using it. Because we had it. Right. Because we had it
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:40.160]   offered in Charlotte years ago. And it surprised me because I was online looking for something
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:44.000]   else that I needed to order. And it just gave me this little banner. It's like, hey, you know,
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.080]   you can order lunch right now. And I'm like, oh, I can. I didn't know that. And it'll be here in an
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:55.200]   hour. And it was, I thought it was really cool. And actually, I thought it was, you know, spyware
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:59.760]   or something. And, but then when I looked it up, it was legit that, you know, it made the news there
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:04.880]   in Charlotte that, hey, Amazon is rolling this service out for people to shop at Whole Foods or
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:09.440]   what have you. But it's going to cause you an extra fee in addition to whatever you're already
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:16.160]   expensive Whole Food prices are. Yeah. You know, so I never really considered doing it, you know.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:22.720]   You should do it if only to order the Chantilly Cake from Whole Foods. I love that stuff.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:28.720]   Say no more. It is delicious. And you, I mean, if you like cake, if you don't like cake, this is
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:37.680]   not going to be your bag. Well, pie is greater than cake, but I still eat cake. Here we go. Oh,
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:47.840]   I went there. Is it a Barry Chantilly Cake? Is that what I'm looking up?
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:53.040]   Barry. I think you could get berries on it, but there's just a plain Chantilly Cake.
[00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:57.920]   But berries would be a delicious add on it. Okay. Well, I did my search and I came up with that.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:03.120]   That's it. That's okay. That looks good. That's not what it is. But, that also looks good. I need
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:08.560]   that. Maybe almond and mascarpone, Shencoides frosting. Yes, that is the cake. Okay. Then that is the cake.
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:11.920]   That's what they just put berries on it. So it's fancy. Looks good to me.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.560]   Like a charge of 10 bucks more for it. That's right. They do. They charge you a little bit more,
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:20.960]   although it's a little bit larger of a cake when you put berries on it according to this bad web page.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:29.760]   Oh, they're home foods. They're not about web pages. Well, no, they're Amazon. They are about web pages.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:40.240]   T-Shae, sir. T-Shae. They are now anyways. This service, I didn't realize or I forgot, used to cost
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:48.320]   $299 a year. Oh, and remember the Amazon dash? Because it came out out around the time the Amazon
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:54.400]   dash thing that you stuck on your refrigerator. Oh, yeah, the little buttons. Yeah, I still have
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:58.640]   one somewhere. Oh, no, maybe I dumped it. Did they do that? They canceled that, right? Rest in peace.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:05.360]   Now you have your assistant to do it for you anyways. Why would you need a button? Yeah, that
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:09.760]   makes sense. Well, it did have the cool scanner. You could see your groceries with it. You'd be like,
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:15.840]   boop. And it made the satisfied boop noise switch. That's worth it.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:24.400]   Ah, let's see here. What else do we have here? You know, oh, oh, yeah. Can we talk about the
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.800]   the Burt algorithm because that's important for people and beyond? I want to display it to me.
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:35.600]   Yes, that is important. Explain this. Okay, so they basically have an algorithm and I'm trying
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:40.320]   to remember what Burt stands for. I'm going to scroll down. Oh, there it is. Okay. Burt is there
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:46.240]   bi-directional encoder representations from transformers algorithm. But basically, yeah,
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.640]   don't worry about what that means. It's part of natural language processing and it's a way to
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:57.600]   improve the algorithm that figures out what people are saying, right? And so they've made it
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:03.680]   better and they've now allowed it to. Now it's running. Do they say 10% of searches?
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.840]   Yes. Well, I'm proving it by 10%.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:12.000]   One of the other. I was, yeah, I saw two different expressions about it.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:19.600]   Do you have the bite? I saw that it would affect one in 10, one in 10. Yes, it would affect one
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:26.480]   in 10 searches. Yes. And it just, it makes it better. It makes it understand things and put
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:33.520]   more context around your inquiries, which the way that it's described in like machine learning
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:40.080]   world is this is like an image net type of function for natural language processing.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:46.720]   And what image net was was the, that was the test for computer vision that the GPUs really
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:50.560]   came along and they like blew it out of the water in about, I think it was 2012 that we started
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.560]   seeing huge improvements there. And then they got slightly more gradual, but there was like a
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:59.680]   sea change. So they're describing what they've done here with Burt is kind of that level of sea
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.480]   change for natural language processing, which is great for all of us because that means it's
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:07.360]   going to be easier and better for computers to understand them when we talk to them.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:14.640]   Yay. Did that make sense? Yeah. Good. They posted an example saying a search query of someone
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:21.120]   typing in, "Parking on a hill with no curb before the results were simply about parking on a hill."
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:26.640]   Because it was just bag of words, like you said, afterwards the results are actually
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:33.760]   specific to parking on a hill with no curb, like the words imply. So just understanding the words
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:39.280]   and from a more contextual perspective than just, I don't get that example because I think
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:44.240]   that's the kind of search that Google's always, or for years, has done well. If you put in enough
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:50.480]   words, it gets narrower. But most people don't understand putting in a proper string. It's just
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:54.720]   vomit in gibberish into a search box. You don't want to mean that's a bit,
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.600]   it just gets better and better at your word vomit, basically.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.760]   Remember? I still remember-- It's never got the title of a show, please.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:12.000]   Doing, when Google launched way back in 2002, you'd be like, "I'd search New York plus
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.400]   Bond issue plus," and then I do someone's name in quotes. And I don't remember when I had to stop
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:23.440]   using--are those Bayesian? I don't know what kind of--what's the word for that Bayesian search?
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:27.200]   I don't remember when I had to stop using that Bayesian.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:31.680]   Boolean. That's it. Bayesian is something different math.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:34.960]   But yeah. You should question. You could explain that.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:41.440]   Oh, go ahead. I cannot. Okay, this time. It is Boolean.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.640]   It is Boolean. Yes, Boolean. Yes. Bayesian is a probability.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.560]   Bayesian is a probability. Yeah, that's one's the topic.
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:50.480]   Bayesian is probability Boolean is plus and minus and stuff.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:54.880]   Yes. But I can't explain it. You did it. You did it. You did it.
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.800]   There you go. This episode of Stump the Carston is still gone.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.000]   [laughter]
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.960]   Dang it. You still need to stump him. Undefeated.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:11.520]   Man, I remember when search--that was a regular part of my search arsenal was having to do the
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:15.600]   parentheses or the quotes. And you were like, how is it still?
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.640]   Right, only so many people understood that.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.000]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:28.800]   Even Pandu, is it Pandunayak? The VP of Search said this is the single biggest,
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:32.880]   most positive change we've had in the last five years and perhaps one of the biggest since the
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:36.480]   beginning of Google Search. Yeah, it's going to make--
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.920]   Pandu is really good.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:42.320]   --make a very significant impact to the quality of search results.
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.880]   Well, in the people who talked about it being like the ImageNet example,
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:53.200]   they weren't even Google workers. So this was like, whoa, it's not just Google marketing.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.800]   It's actually legit breakthrough.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:05:06.160]   Nice. Good work. What about this? What about this cross-carrier messaging initiative?
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:09.360]   Shall we cut this one? Google finally got to get messaging.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.080]   Well, no, this is--this is-- this is--
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.240]   This is ever a bug Google, isn't it?
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.760]   Yeah. Well, yeah, so it's all four US carriers,
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:23.760]   AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint have banded together to create their own joint initiative,
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.040]   CCM-ally. I hate them all!
[01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:31.520]   Google, I think Google really hoped when it put out-- go away Google--
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:38.320]   when it put out its own RCS flavor last year, I believe, I think they had hoped that the carriers
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.800]   would get onto it. They're standard. Right.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:44.720]   Instead, the carriers said, "No, we want control." So we have our own creators.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:47.600]   We have our own standard. And you have to play ball with us.
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:53.520]   I don't know what playing ball with them actually means, but it is known that
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:59.360]   support for this is going to be baked into things like Android messages and Samsung's
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:07.360]   messaging app. But the carriers are going to launch their own messaging app that's going to
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:13.520]   be brought to their carrier phones, Android phones, next year, starting next year.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.200]   Do you consider that bloke-wears her?
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.720]   What?
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:19.920]   I don't know. Kind of. Fun-line, right?
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:27.920]   I mean, it is a fine line. I mean, if it's literally the only app on the phone that supports this,
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.440]   maybe it's not--
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:30.640]   It's required.
[01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.560]   --it's required, but it's not going to be.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.400]   Someone has to do this.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:38.080]   Google has proven that they are bad at this.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:38.560]   Totally.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:39.840]   Totally.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:49.120]   If Verizon and AT&T and Sprint and T-Mobile can come up with a good messaging system,
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:52.400]   comparable to iMessage, go for it.
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.200]   Go for it.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:53.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:59.360]   Comparable, not identical. There is no end-end encryption. There won't be end-end encryption on
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:04.720]   this the way there is an iMessage. Apple has been pretty absent through all this, but this
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:11.440]   this week on security now, Steve Gibson, you know, made the point that Apple would have to play
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:16.320]   ball because if this is truly an SMS replacement, Apple's not going to keep their
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.720]   their phones from supporting whatever replaces that.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.440]   But then don't you get the green or the blue bubbles, which is it?
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.720]   Maybe that will still--
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:26.960]   Yeah, maybe that'll still exist, but at least for all the Android users out there,
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:32.240]   if this truly replaces SMS, then we'll be happy that we get most of the features that
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.240]   Apple users have enjoyed with iMessage.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:36.800]   However, we get there.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.400]   Apparently, we're getting there through the carriers and not Google.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:45.120]   In addition to these folks banding together and saying, you know, we want our own standard
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:50.720]   and this is it, you need to jump on board, have you found it curious that Verizon is now
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:55.120]   essentially giving away Pixel 4s a week later?
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.240]   I've missed that they're giving them away.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.320]   You buy one and you'll get one free.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.640]   Already?
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:03.920]   They've done that promotion before.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.440]   Early on.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.320]   But do they do that that early with iPhones as well?
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:08.800]   Right.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:09.120]   Let's wait.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:09.760]   They gave you one.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:10.320]   Exactly.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:15.040]   My point is, actually, a thousand dollar phone, four thousand dollar phone,
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:18.240]   and yet they're doing BOGO for one of them and not the other.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:22.960]   A lot of faith in those sounds like, uh, yeah.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.000]   Yes, I said BOGO.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.120]   I know.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.200]   I was like, oh, he just said BOGO.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.560]   He's got a payless shoes flashback right there.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.840]   [laughter]
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:34.240]   I don't know.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.240]   Maybe there isn't a whole lot of faith in it.
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.200]   Don't sell like it.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:43.920]   You know, even though this is the first year that the Pixel phones are like in all
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.720]   carrier stores.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:45.280]   Right.
[01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:45.760]   Right.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.280]   But normally they get those sales.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:53.520]   I used to tell people give it about three months and then they drop it down about almost
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.080]   four or five hundred bucks like without a problem.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:56.560]   Right.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:58.880]   You know, but man, it's been, what, two weeks?
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:00.880]   If not even.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:01.360]   Right.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.040]   So it's been a week, not even a week.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:06.400]   It officially released a week ago tomorrow.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.960]   So now we've gotten yours or we're going to see yours later?
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.760]   Oh, I have my eyes.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:10.160]   His.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.160]   Yeah, I have mine, actually.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:13.520]   Oh, it's not last week.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.320]   So we were all.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.120]   Yeah, he is an on-the-story.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.480]   I'm dating it in the prospect of seeing it.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:21.280]   I have the Pixel 4 right here.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:23.920]   This is the 4XL.
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.400]   It's not as cool as the orange one, but it's so cool.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:26.640]   Yeah, I know.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.000]   Why didn't you get orange?
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.800]   I didn't really care for the color of the orange.
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:33.120]   Is it their world or is it a good orange?
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:33.600]   Or is it a good orange?
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.080]   Or not for ant?
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:36.480]   Yeah, yeah, you're going to get yours.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.840]   I actually got your delivery notification today that it's shipped.
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:40.240]   Sweet.
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.000]   So sometimes next week you'll get it.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.840]   Oh, I won't be here.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:44.160]   Right.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.000]   Oh, all next week?
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:46.720]   Yeah, no.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.240]   I'm going to do a doby mix.
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:49.360]   That's right.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:50.960]   Okay, well, I'll use your phone for it.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.680]   I bet you will.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:54.800]   Yeah, I mean, so far, so good.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.920]   I mean, I'm liking it.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:58.560]   I'm not experiencing a huge battery hit.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:00.960]   This is the XL size, so it's the larger one.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.160]   It has the larger battery.
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.800]   And I feel like battery for me has been fine.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.600]   Nice.
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.040]   You know, I'm getting through the day.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:12.640]   I'm not finding myself having to charge at some point, random point.
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:13.120]   Nice.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.160]   I'm also not ending the day with a large surplus
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.840]   like I'm used to with some phones.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:18.160]   Okay.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:21.280]   Where like I hit the charger and there's still like 45% battery.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.440]   I'm like, all right, I'm never blasting through this.
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:26.480]   This one's more closer to like 20, 15%.
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:27.600]   So it's pushing it down.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.880]   So your 3A is better.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:32.960]   Says the owner of a 3A.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.680]   I liked the design.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.880]   I like my tongue on that one.
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.440]   I like the design on the back.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.640]   It's a pretty phone.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.280]   Yeah, it is.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.880]   I like I like the white on black and I like the the cubiness and.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:49.360]   Yeah, it's got the, you know, the color splash on the on the power button,
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.960]   which does have the orange color.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.560]   And that is the orange.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.720]   Is that the same orange that's on the pixel?
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:55.360]   I believe so.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.120]   Yeah, I think it's the same color.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.720]   Yeah, that's not an awesome orange.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.480]   It's a little too faded for me.
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.840]   It is a little bit faded.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:04.240]   I mean, I probably would have been a presidential one.
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:04.480]   So.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:09.200]   I like to think of it as Halloween because Halloween is tomorrow.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:14.080]   So although it's not really a total Halloween orange, but no, the design is really nice.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.600]   It feels really nice.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.200]   This whole glass back is kind of a frosted.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.160]   It's really hard to show on the camera, especially with light phone.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.840]   But it just has a really nice feel.
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.880]   And what they did back here with this frosting means that you really don't see any fingerprints
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.520]   whatsoever.
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.840]   So the edges, the edges is what feels great to me.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.480]   It's a little more grippy around the edge.
[01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.040]   Definitely.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.560]   You could use it without a case without feeling like it's going to slide right out of your hand.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:43.600]   I was just going to say like it definitely feels a little more grippy,
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.640]   but it's still glass.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.520]   It's still a phone.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.760]   Every day that I'm waiting for the case, I thought the case was going to get here before the phone.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:50.800]   It's still not here.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.760]   Every day I'm worried that I'm going to drop this thing and it's going to die.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:55.440]   You have a history, right?
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.160]   I have a history.
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.800]   You can borrow to want to sell my desk.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.160]   Oh, that's right.
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:01.680]   You got one from Pepcom.
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:02.080]   Pepcom.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:02.800]   All right.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:05.120]   Maybe I'll use that as my interim.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:13.040]   But I will say camera wise, on Twitter, a few days ago, I was downtown Petaluma.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:18.960]   And I was like, I'm going to try out the Zoom on this because this has a 2x telephoto versus five
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.320]   that most people were supposedly.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.560]   I think a lot more phones are doing the five.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:31.040]   But they do is this super res, Google does a super res AI assisted Zoom functionality.
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:39.680]   And so I took a picture of this building really far away at 1x, 2x, 4x, and then 8x.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:41.920]   8x is like super zoomed in.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.440]   I'm telling you, considering that it's software, it looks really good.
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:45.680]   Really?
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:46.480]   Even at 8x.
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:47.360]   Even at 8x.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.160]   I mean, you can tell--
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.520]   The demo looks good.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.800]   But I wanted to see real world experience.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.880]   Yeah, I mean, I was pretty impressed.
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.760]   And I was like, OK, and this looks good on the phone display.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:02.160]   I want to take it home and kind of look at it closer.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.440]   And we'll see if maybe I can get that link for you, Carson.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:06.480]   It's on my Twitter feed.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:11.840]   But I was pretty impressed by what they're doing.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:12.560]   Here we go.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.320]   OK, I'm going to paste this in 2.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:20.080]   Are you putting it?
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.400]   Field 50 underneath the carrier stuff.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:22.720]   OK.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.760]   There you go.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.400]   E50.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.280]   That's right down there.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:32.800]   But yeah, so camera wise, it's still doing really doing great things.
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.640]   That's the far off shot.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:36.560]   So if you click on that and then just through.
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:36.640]   Oh, dude.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.800]   That does look good.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:39.840]   So that's 2x.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:43.200]   And then the next one, I think, is 4x.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.240]   So this is digital.
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:46.080]   This is 2x.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:46.880]   And this is 8x.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:48.880]   And that does look good.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.840]   I mean, there's some good detail in there,
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.800]   considering this building was far away from me.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.800]   And most of that is digital.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.040]   You know, it's AI compensation.
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:03.280]   So they're doing really crazy things with a camera.
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.960]   But I need to get you to fix--
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.720]   That pedal is a slogan, "Shop daily."
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.880]   What's that?
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.920]   Oh.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:12.720]   That pedal is a slogan, "Shop daily."
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:13.600]   It really is.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:14.800]   It really is.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.600]   "Shop daily."
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.800]   No, really.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.360]   Seriously?
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:18.960]   I thought it was something about chickens.
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:19.440]   Come back.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:20.960]   Every single day at shop.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.400]   Every day.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.800]   Were you going to criticize my picture taking--
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:29.440]   Yeah, we got to get you to straighten out that horizon line, man.
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:29.680]   All right.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.960]   That wide shot.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.640]   I was leaning over an edge.
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.320]   I don't want to get the shot.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.480]   You can rotate it in post, that got it.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.400]   That takes too much time.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.720]   I don't have that kind of time.
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.240]   I was like, "Oh, no."
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:49.920]   I think ants volunteering to take all of the pictures from now on to show in the show.
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.200]   Is that what you're hearing here?
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.160]   Oh, I didn't--
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:52.560]   I didn't--
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.760]   I didn't volunteer anything.
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:56.160]   Are you giving me another volunteer to hold?
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:59.520]   I'm not just saying if you're going to critique his--
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.240]   his snap photos and samples,
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:04.160]   you may end up finding yourself taking them.
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.120]   Oh, it just--
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.600]   It was a little bit of an OCD moment for me.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.880]   I'm sorry, Mr. Al.
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.640]   Look, photos are your thing.
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:14.560]   You have a couple of shows on the Twit Network all about this stuff.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.840]   It's like how the desk is still not right.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:21.840]   It should be parallel with the lower third and it's not.
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.960]   And so, yeah, I agree.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.280]   Same thing.
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:26.400]   You've got a horizon problem here in general with this show.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.120]   There it is.
[01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:28.960]   Oh, perfect.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:32.400]   Yeah.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.120]   No more.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:33.440]   No more.
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:33.920]   No more.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.040]   Oh my gosh.
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:35.520]   Right there.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.000]   Right there.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:36.640]   Right there is good.
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.000]   Now that--
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.120]   Nice work, Mr. Bondi.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.000]   It is raw.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.200]   You move it down.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.160]   You move the camera up.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.880]   Nice all-ins distortion, I'm sure.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.800]   It could be because my screen is higher than Jeff's.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:53.040]   Like if we took Jeff's highest dollar?
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:53.280]   No?
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.840]   No, it ain't that.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.080]   It's just--
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.520]   I think it's a lens distortion.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.400]   It's just angled.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.240]   It's not shooting straight.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.120]   It's not shooting straight.
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:01.200]   It's not shooting straight.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:02.480]   Usually not.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.280]   Right.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.520]   Everyone lean into your right.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:08.320]   Cheaters.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.560]   There we go.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.680]   This is normal, right?
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.440]   Something.
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.560]   You're gonna lean.
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:17.760]   All right.
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:19.440]   Let's see here.
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:20.160]   What else?
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.200]   I totally dig that.
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.200]   That's 8X with that quality.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.160]   Yeah, pretty good.
[01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.040]   That is strong.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.120]   That's not something you're going to frame and put up on your wall.
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:32.720]   But considering how bad digital zoom usually is,
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:33.360]   it gets all saw.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.640]   That's really impressive to me.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:35.760]   Everything gets--
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.440]   Especially with that crooked horizon line.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.600]   I mean, I really am at a wall.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:42.240]   You don't really get the crooked horizon line on this shot, do you?
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:42.480]   Right.
[01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:44.640]   Which is why I looked at it immediately.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.520]   You're like, first one.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.480]   You're like, this is the good one.
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.360]   Meanwhile, that was the one with the most digital zoom on it.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.000]   And look at that picture like this.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.400]   That's what I know I'm taking a bad picture.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.520]   I look over and he's--
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:58.080]   So true.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.960]   All right.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:03.360]   I'll work on my efforts.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:04.480]   Please and thank you.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:05.680]   I'll work on my abilities.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:11.440]   Apparently, .new was a neat thing that Google rolled out that totally--
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.160]   This is very nice.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:14.960]   That's pretty cool.
[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:15.520]   It's so open.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:18.160]   Yeah, so I guess a while back they did this.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.560]   They rolled out this .new approach.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:21.760]   Which I use all the time.
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:22.240]   Do you?
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.720]   I never even know about it until this is into this week.
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.440]   Okay, I keep doing new .doc and I get very upset.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.200]   No, you're backwards.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:29.760]   Wrong.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:30.960]   My brain doesn't work.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:31.760]   I was like, wrong.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:35.760]   .new spreadsheet sheet.new.
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.200]   At the end.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:44.000]   So entering into a new browser or search doc.new would create a new Google Doc, for example.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.160]   And because you're always logged into your Google account or you probably are,
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:52.480]   that would take you right to your Google Docs account, open up a new doc and you can jump right in.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:53.200]   It saves you time.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:58.560]   Well, now Google is allowing others to play the .new game with their own web apps.
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.960]   So Microsoft, for example, has Word.new.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:02.240]   Although that's not working yet.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.920]   But Spotify has one.
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:08.320]   Playlist.new will take you right to Spotify and create a playlist.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.280]   If you want pizza.new.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:13.040]   Oh, who would that?
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.320]   Who would that?
[01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.120]   Domino's.
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.160]   Domino's is going to lose.
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.560]   I would also buy pizza.new.
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.360]   Well, I mean, does it.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:20.240]   Pizza.now.
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.280]   Pizza.now.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.400]   Oh, not now.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.840]   No, not reached.
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.160]   Yes.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.200]   Jason just tried.
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:28.080]   I tried.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:28.800]   I'm curious.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:29.360]   I tried too.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:30.400]   I was like, let's do it.
[01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:31.840]   How awesome would that be?
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:32.880]   Guaranteed.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:33.600]   That's going to happen.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:39.040]   If you aren't already signed into a service, it could be a little less seamless.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:39.520]   Right.
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:40.320]   And that makes it.
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:40.720]   Right.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.520]   Yeah, totally.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:42.720]   I did.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.320]   I just created a new playlist.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.600]   Oh, there you go.
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.280]   I'm so excited.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.360]   Now, were you signed into Spotify or were you not?
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:51.280]   I am always signed into Spotify.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:51.760]   Oh, you are.
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:52.400]   OK.
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.840]   Because I don't think that I am.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:54.320]   And so.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:56.320]   You go to your phone or on your laptop.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:56.960]   Playlist.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:58.080]   Oh, I went on my laptop.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:02.240]   So when I decided to Spotify on your laptop.
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:02.880]   Or it's for me.
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.560]   So what's interesting about this is I'm not signed into Spotify,
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.280]   but it still takes me to the create a new playlist thing.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.680]   So if I start and create.
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:12.320]   So it doesn't.
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:12.960]   Oh, I see.
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:15.040]   And then at that point, it's like, all right, you need to log in.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.560]   That's what it is for me too.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.200]   OK.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:17.520]   All right.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:17.760]   That makes sense.
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.840]   Well, here, like I can try it on my phone.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:22.320]   Would it work?
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.160]   I think it would be the same on a phone.
[01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:24.960]   Maybe?
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:26.240]   Or is this just for desktop?
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:27.520]   No, it's playlist.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:28.080]   I did it again.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.200]   I was like, you got a playlist.
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:31.680]   Reprogram.
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:32.480]   Reprogram.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:36.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.040]   I mean, I would assume it would work on the phone.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:39.520]   Hang tight.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.840]   Spinning.
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:42.320]   Spinning.
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:45.200]   It does not.
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:46.640]   It just took me to Spotify.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.800]   Just take you to your app or to the browser.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.560]   And the last song I listened to was Whitney Houston.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.480]   I want to dance with somebody as part of my workout.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:58.800]   Do it from the box at the bottom or from Chrome browser?
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:01.840]   I thought I-- oh, I did it for the box at the bottom.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:02.320]   Good call.
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:02.960]   I did it for the box at the bottom.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:02.960]   Ooh.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:02.960]   Ooh.
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:05.600]   Oh, good call.
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.160]   This guy.
[01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:07.760]   Yeah, I get stuck on that all the time.
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.600]   I'm like, I hope I'm open in Chrome.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.080]   What kills me is when I use the box at the bottom,
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.760]   I can't ever go back to those results.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:14.800]   Yes.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:19.360]   Oh, he's asking me if I want to add Spotify to my home screen.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.080]   I'm going to say no.
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:23.200]   No, it just goes up to the recently played stuff.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.160]   So this must be desktop.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.280]   So it just goes back.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:25.920]   Oh, that's the phone?
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.800]   Yeah, this must be desktop.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:27.600]   That's won't be.
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:28.720]   So it's-- yeah.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:31.040]   Still a progression, though.
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.880]   By the way, Jeff, so when you use the box at the bottom
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.520]   and you do a search, so I'll do a search for Twit--
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:38.720]   Well, you're going to teach me how to do this now.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:39.280]   Yeah, OK.
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:39.840]   Oh, my God.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:40.320]   I'm here.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.440]   I'm here for this.
[01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:41.680]   OK.
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:42.880]   It's really not that--
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:43.760]   Isn't that all right?
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:44.240]   Amazing.
[01:20:44.240 --> 01:20:46.240]   Thanks a lot, guys.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:46.560]   So--
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:50.400]   So, you know, I get to my results.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.120]   So Twit.tv, I don't know if you could see it in the overhead--
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:53.760]   overhead shot.
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.600]   What you get is this like limited time Chrome.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.280]   So just open up in Chrome.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.080]   Open in Chrome now.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:00.720]   Oh, that's what I do.
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:01.120]   I know.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:01.280]   But--
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.840]   I don't think it has anything cool.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:05.760]   That would presume I'm thinking ahead, Jason.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.240]   OK.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:06.720]   All right.
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:07.280]   All right.
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:07.760]   All right.
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.120]   I'm going on to something else.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.880]   I said, oh, yeah, I searched for that a few minutes ago.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:11.760]   And then it's cool.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.360]   Sometimes you hit the little multitask option
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.040]   and it still sits there.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.160]   Your query result.
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:18.720]   Sometimes.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.560]   Sometimes it doesn't.
[01:21:20.560 --> 01:21:21.120]   Yes.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.440]   It's so frustrating when it doesn't.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.200]   Are you listening, Google?
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:28.240]   We're giving you lots of really great ideas today.
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:33.120]   Build a refrigerator for our garage to deliver.
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.800]   We're talking about our great ideas.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.120]   Come on.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:35.120]   OK.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.280]   Jason, I thought you were going to give me
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:42.400]   another life-changing moment like with the copy paste software.
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:42.400]   Which--
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:43.600]   Yeah, I'm very disappointed.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:44.160]   Thank you, guys.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:44.960]   Oh, sorry.
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.920]   Oh, of course, the word.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.800]   I just gave you what I do.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:50.000]   But apparently you do that too.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   I actually--
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.800]   I just thought the risk could be so better.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.120]   I wish there was something better than that now.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.480]   I don't have anything better than that.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.480]   eBay--
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:02.080]   Yeah, that services rolled out to more people.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:05.120]   Chat room is mentioning eBay and open tables as well.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:05.600]   Oh, OK.
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:19.000]   Google.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.200]   Remember, second 2019.
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:23.640]   So whoever's first to pizza.new--
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:24.720]   Rocket, please.
[01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:25.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:27.040]   You're going to make some money.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:27.640]   That's awesome.
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:31.000]   Music.new is one that I tried.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.520]   And it's like a single label, Ovo Sound--
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.400]   How did I drink?
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:36.920]   Grabbed it.
[01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:37.440]   Yes.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.960]   Yes.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:39.920]   Grabbed that one.
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:40.420]   Yep.
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:42.120]   They're waiting for a nice payday.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:44.360]   They won that game, apparently.
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.560]   They're waiting for a nice payday.
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.560]   Yeah.
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:49.560]   What else?
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.160]   Oh, man, it's a shame that WebEx got this instead of something
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:55.520]   like Zoom, something usable like Zoom.
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:57.960]   Oh, and Medium got story.new.
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:59.400]   Interesting.
[01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.560]   Oh, yep.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:05.160]   Word pressure jumped on that.
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:06.760]   I guess they could do blog.new.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:11.320]   Yeah, that would make more sense to me than Medium would.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.800]   So then--
[01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:16.800]   Yeah, how does Google Media get like media between--
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:17.800]   Right.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:18.800]   And if there's multiple--
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.640]   I think you know who would answer this.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:21.640]   Andrew--
[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:24.840]   It really seems like one anointed winner.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:25.480]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:25.980]   Yeah.
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:27.440]   So who wins the game, right?
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:28.560]   And so--
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:29.320]   So what is it like--
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:31.440]   I can go and get a cup of coffee and ask Andrew,
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.640]   and he will explain it to me, and I can come back and tell you
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.360]   if we really want to know.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:36.720]   This is literally his job.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:38.240]   But again, if his registration--
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.520]   He's going to take at the same time.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.400]   Is that what you're--
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.360]   Hey, live for here.
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.520]   Is it just like any other domain name?
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.480]   Is this first come first serve?
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.760]   That's-- I mean, they say registered.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.280]   They didn't say much of anything else.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:49.760]   That's true.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:50.260]   That's true.
[01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:53.080]   So we're going to see like musicnow.new.
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.280]   Or music2.new.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.760]   And underscore proot.new.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.480]   Because somebody took that pro.
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.640]   This totally is one of those things.
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.200]   Get in earlier.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.080]   OK, do you-- literally--
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.520]   I am in with him right now.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:10.240]   I can make him come up and answer literally all your questions.
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.400]   OK.
[01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:11.920]   OK.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.840]   Survey says--
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:14.680]   I'm old enough to--
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.000]   Well, I have to see if he's ready.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   Talk about the name--
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000]   How about this?
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.360]   How about you work on that?
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.240]   I'm going to thank the sponsor.
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:23.680]   Then when we come back, we might have an update.
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.680]   Such a pro.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:27.320]   Then I can get my cake and coffee.
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:30.160]   And if you can eat and drink that too.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:32.720]   Oh, and Andrew, right.
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.240]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:35.120]   Thank the sponsor.
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:38.200]   And then we will get back and check in with Andrew.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.400]   This episode of This Week in Google
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.760]   is brought to you by World Wide Technology.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:47.360]   WWT began building their advanced technology center
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:48.560]   10 years ago.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.800]   And it's grown exponentially ever since.
[01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.400]   It's like no other testing and research lab.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.800]   The lab contains more than a half billion dollars
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:58.640]   in equipment from hundreds of OEMs and key partners
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.560]   ranging from heavyweights like NetApp, Cisco, and VMware
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:06.200]   to emerging disruptors like TANium, Equinix, and Expanse.
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.800]   WWT is a trusted partner who stays with you over the years.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:12.080]   Many of their customers have been with them
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.520]   for over a decade because they know the WWT is where they
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.720]   can go to get the answers they need
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:19.600]   to make sure their business runs right.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:24.600]   Their ATC is an incubator for IT innovation and offers
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:28.520]   on demand and schedulable labs like NetApp Cloud Volumes
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:32.360]   on tap, on tap on Flash, NetApp Disaster Recovery
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.240]   as a service along with hundreds of other labs
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:38.320]   representing newest advances in flash storage,
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.120]   multi-cloud, hyper-converged infrastructure,
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:43.440]   cloud data management, and more.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:46.480]   You can learn about products before you launch.
[01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:49.360]   WWT's engineers use these environments
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:52.480]   to quickly spin up proofs of concept and pilots using
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.920]   the sandbox so customers can confidently select
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:56.120]   the best solutions.
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:59.800]   In many cases, this reduces concept time for months
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.000]   to weeks which increases speed to market.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.520]   And they offer lab as a service, which
[01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.200]   is a dedicated lab space within the ATC.
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.640]   And this is where customers can perform
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.840]   programmatic testing using the vast technology ecosystem
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:16.480]   that WWT has already built.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:19.640]   It's virtual so you can take full advantage of ATC's unique
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:23.280]   benefits anywhere in the world 24/7.
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:25.760]   And WWT engineers work in these labs.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.000]   They're working there every day, beta testing, new equipment,
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.400]   building reference architectures and custom integrations
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:36.200]   to help their customers make decisions and see results faster
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:38.880]   and with much less investment.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:40.560]   And the time is finally here.
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:43.480]   WWT has launched their new digital platform
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.760]   encompassing the ATC ecosystem.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.280]   This ecosystem creates a multiplier effect
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:53.280]   of knowledge, speed, and agility, any time, anywhere
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.120]   around the world for their customers
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.280]   so you can get access to articles, case studies, hands-on
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:01.400]   labs, and other tools that make the difference in today's
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.160]   fast-paced world.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:07.480]   To learn more about WWT, the ATC and sign up
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:11.360]   for access to their new on-demand lab platform,
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:14.880]   go to www.com/twit.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:17.280]   WWT simplifies the complex.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:19.840]   That's www.t.com/twit.
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:24.080]   WWT is delivering business and technology outcomes
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:24.880]   around the world.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:27.440]   And we thank them for their support.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.560]   Joining us but not wearing a hat.
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:32.440]   Welcome to the show.
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:32.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:35.760]   You're not Stacey.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.160]   I mean, you've already gotten bonus points.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.400]   You've been put on her wig.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:43.240]   She startled me when she came out of the office wearing that.
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:45.240]   So it's not lovely, though.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:47.200]   It's a fantastic wig.
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:50.240]   So yes, Stacey brought you in because we were talking about,
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:51.320]   well, you probably already know this,
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.760]   but we were talking about the .new domains.
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:57.080]   And there's a little bit of a curiosity
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:27:58.240]   around how this works.
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:01.440]   What can you tell us about what you know about .new domains?
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.680]   Yeah, it's kind of interesting.
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:07.760]   So Google, about a year ago, decided to use this .new domain
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:10.480]   that they had acquired in a kind of a unique way, which
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.120]   was to have it do an action when you typed it in.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:16.800]   So if you typed in doc.new, it would open a new Google Doc.
[01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:19.160]   It would start a new Google Doc.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.280]   And so what they've done now is they're opening it up
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:22.640]   to other companies.
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:23.680]   They can do the same thing.
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:27.960]   They can register domains in .new as long as it's
[01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.400]   used for an action.
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:33.520]   So sell .new can start a new eBay listing.
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:38.760]   Playlist.new will start a new Spotify playlist.
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:42.120]   And so it's kind of a unique way of using a domain name.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.520]   I don't think, obviously, there won't be-- well,
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.240]   there could be thousands of these eventually.
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:48.680]   But it's really something that's created for power users
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.760]   that do something over and over.
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:54.280]   And instead of going to opening up Google Drive,
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:57.280]   clicking the button to do new and then doc,
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.240]   it's just something you can type into your browser.
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:01.840]   So it should be faster.
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:07.200]   Do you envision this to be kind of like a gold rush sort of thing?
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:10.680]   As a lot of other kinds of things on the web
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:13.080]   end up being in the long run, this seems
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:14.760]   like an opportunity for some companies
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:17.600]   to get in there early with something like music.new,
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.320]   which as we just saw a few minutes ago is basically
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:21.440]   just a record label.
[01:29:21.440 --> 01:29:23.480]   It's like, yeah, OK, we got music.new.
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.360]   That seems like a pretty valuable get.
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.160]   But no one else will have it that easy.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.920]   Well, that's true.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:32.600]   But what Google is doing here is they're saying within 100 days
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:36.000]   you have to do something with it that causes an action
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:36.920]   or a new workflow.
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:39.520]   So it's not like someone can just register and stockpile
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:39.840]   these.
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.320]   They have to do something with it.
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.320]   And they have to do something fairly specific with it.
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:45.680]   That's how you regulate.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:47.480]   That's important.
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:48.720]   Right.
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.320]   That keeps some control over it.
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:51.000]   OK.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:54.720]   And they didn't do that with .app, which is another one
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:55.880]   at Google's top level domain.
[01:29:55.880 --> 01:30:00.680]   So they launched that you can use it pretty much any way you want.
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:02.360]   You can park it.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.840]   You can use it for an app.
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:05.760]   You can use it however you want.
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:08.240]   And so there are hundreds of thousands as I was registered.
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:10.480]   But that was a little bit like one of those things like,
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:14.160]   oh, I should be the first to register music.app or game.app
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:14.960]   and that sort of thing.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:17.720]   So .new is different.
[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:19.720]   I believe I haven't looked it up,
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:22.360]   but I believe they're charging hundreds of dollars as well for it.
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:25.840]   So that should keep some people from going after and trying
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.200]   to stockpile them.
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:31.120]   But it's very much a niche top level domain.
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:32.240]   I like what they're doing.
[01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:35.440]   I mean, I don't think that new otherwise would be that interesting
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:36.960]   of a top level domain.
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:39.400]   The only thing that's kind of confusing about it
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.800]   is it's a little bit backwards.
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:41.120]   Right.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:43.960]   So if I think about starting a news.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:44.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:45.120]   It's confused.
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:45.880]   Your wife it is.
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:46.840]   She gets to get a confused.
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:47.960]   She said.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:51.600]   So she types in--
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:53.200]   That's why we're married.
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:58.120]   You see the world the same way.
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:03.360]   Stacy, you and I should register argue.new.
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.960]   Just said that you and he should register argue.new.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:09.160]   Oh, thank you.
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:15.920]   And I could see a world down the line where once.new is not the big thing.
[01:31:15.920 --> 01:31:19.080]   Then it's like .open to jump right.
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:19.600]   All right.
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:20.120]   You know what I mean?
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.360]   How deep do you want this to go?
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.320]   Pick out any tool in your toolbar
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:26.080]   and make that an action as--
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.360]   Chatroom was saying $550 for the domain.
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:30.120]   $50.
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:31.360]   That was Patrick Del Hainty.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.560]   He was saying $550.
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.360]   That's not an expensive--
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:36.640]   Quite a bit of money there.
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:38.960]   You definitely want to use it if you pay that much for it.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:39.360]   For sure.
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.480]   And you've got a time limit with which to do that.
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:43.000]   I find that really interesting.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:43.880]   That's a lot.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:47.080]   So then in that regard, so music.new is an interesting example.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:50.280]   Because literally when you go there, all you have there
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:56.840]   is a music out like an album cover generator.
[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.320]   OK, so maybe that is it.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:02.680]   Maybe that's the service that they're providing is, hey, we took this album
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:05.360]   that's on our label and you can create your own version of it.
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.920]   Inter-rate your own cover.
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:07.440]   Right.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:08.960]   I mean, I guess I would qualify.
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:10.240]   So that would qualify.
[01:32:10.240 --> 01:32:11.600]   It's actually pretty smart.
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:12.440]   OK.
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.320]   All right.
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:16.520]   Ovo Sound, one.
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:17.480]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:18.080]   That's what it is.
[01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:21.280]   Bye, music is awesome.
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:22.920]   Whoa, you just created an album art.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:24.160]   And it was so easy to do with that.
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.160]   Wow.
[01:32:25.160 --> 01:32:27.720]   That's all that did and gave me a little PNG file.
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:29.200]   It's been gone from 1998.
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:30.400]   There you go.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:31.560]   Right on.
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.680]   Cool.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:33.240]   Thank you.
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.800]   I'll hand it back over to Stacey.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:35.240]   Right on.
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:35.760]   Thank you.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:36.280]   Thank you.
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:37.160]   Really nice talking with you.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:38.200]   Appreciate it.
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:38.720]   How's it over?
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:41.320]   How cool is that?
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.560]   Very awesome.
[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:45.760]   Mr. Leo couldn't make that happen.
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.120]   I know.
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:47.800]   Kudos to you, Mr. Howell.
[01:32:47.800 --> 01:32:48.680]   I did nothing.
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.200]   That was all Stacey.
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.320]   What happened?
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.640]   You got Andrew to come into the room and talk to us.
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:55.200]   That was awesome.
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:55.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:57.320]   He's my domain ringer.
[01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:02.840]   I should bring something up here now, because as I was
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:06.000]   scrolling through the doc, I realized we didn't keep to our
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.720]   promises from last week, at least one of them.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:09.720]   Oh, shoot.
[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:10.720]   Oh, shoot.
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:11.240]   Oh.
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:12.400]   At the top of the top.
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.160]   I almost gated my.
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:16.960]   Well, I did it as well, B-time.
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:18.960]   I meant to do it at the beginning of the show and I
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:19.480]   forgot.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:21.960]   I tried to open it, but I didn't have a permission.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:23.200]   Oh, really?
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:23.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:24.600]   You need permission.
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.040]   So these are working.
[01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.840]   Oh, I thought I had to sit.
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:30.840]   Oh, isn't that convenient?
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:32.120]   I thought I had to sit.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:32.600]   Wait a minute.
[01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:34.200]   Mr. Carson has it, though.
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.040]   So this is you.
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.440]   I have all the permissions.
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:39.200]   So this is you as a model.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:39.720]   Wow.
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:41.120]   That is you and your modeling days.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:43.640]   That's when it first started right there at the school.
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:44.640]   This is pencil.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:46.120]   Oh, wow.
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.920]   I told you it was one of those holes sitting there like this
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:50.160]   with my--
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:52.280]   I told you that was the first shot to come to my mind.
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:55.520]   But yeah, that was, man, about 20 something years ago
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:58.120]   and about 20 pounds lighter.
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.520]   That shirt is too big on you.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:00.120]   Yes, it is.
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.120]   Very.
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.880]   Why would they do that to you if you were--
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:05.880]   is that your actual thing you were modeling or is that just
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:06.160]   a texture?
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.280]   No, that was just part of the test shot.
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:09.040]   So what have you--
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:09.800]   Oh, OK.
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:11.880]   And that was in my closet.
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:13.840]   I mean, you look good, but that shirt is like--
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:14.160]   I'm like--
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:15.360]   Yeah, it was definitely way too big.
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:16.560]   I'm like, "Make shirt on you."
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:17.800]   Definitely way too big.
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:19.720]   Build into it.
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:21.960]   Yeah, and then there's that one.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:23.120]   So they got rid of the shirt.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:23.720]   What's the--
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:28.640]   They're like, "You should take the house."
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:30.280]   Those were the days.
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:31.200]   I saw--
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:32.280]   Those were the days.
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:35.080]   I tried to find my other one because I had to do a business
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:38.600]   attire suit shoot to in--
[01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.200]   couldn't find that one.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:42.720]   We looked last night and couldn't find it.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:43.240]   Yeah.
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:44.200]   Thank you for keeping your promise.
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:45.400]   I kept my promises.
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:46.520]   I'm off to hope for a week.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:46.920]   No.
[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.680]   There were other promises from last week.
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:49.040]   Well, we're--
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:49.960]   We had the week.
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:50.480]   She's got the week.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:51.480]   We had the week.
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:52.000]   We had the week.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.120]   John had none.
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:55.120]   I was going to share my colonoscopy report with you.
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:55.600]   No.
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.240]   We denied that.
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:34:57.840]   That's what it was.
[01:34:57.840 --> 01:34:58.600]   We denied that.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:34:59.000]   That's what it was.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.160]   He squashed.
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:03.240]   He showed us his pictures with hair
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.520]   looking like a serial killer slash.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:06.520]   Steve Jobs.
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:08.520]   Hey.
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.520]   Hey.
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:11.200]   It's the '70s hair thing.
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:13.360]   You know, you see the '70s glasses or the '70s hair.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:14.360]   Oh, there's a serial killer.
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:16.760]   Everybody looks like they could have been a serial killer
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:17.440]   on the '70s.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:18.360]   It was just the decade.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.800]   It was just the decade.
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:20.680]   Totally.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.120]   I can't remember if I had a promise.
[01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:24.200]   If anyone in the chat room remembers, let me know.
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:25.720]   I can't even forget my promise.
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:27.680]   You were just sort of instigating it all.
[01:35:27.680 --> 01:35:28.160]   Oh, OK.
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:28.520]   All right.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:28.760]   All right.
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:29.120]   Good.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:29.480]   Phew.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.600]   We made a good host.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:33.480]   Dodge the bullet there.
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:34.680]   What else do we have?
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:37.920]   Is Google successfully mappening your fire?
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:38.120]   There are--
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:38.320]   There are--
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:38.760]   There are--
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:39.320]   I'm copying--
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:41.040]   --opdated updated maps of the fires.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.880]   You know, I didn't know that they were doing this.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:43.380]   I didn't know.
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:44.400]   I read this article.
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:47.760]   But Google is apparently integrating their mapping
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:51.680]   prowess with access to two US satellites
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:55.200]   to hopefully provide more up-to-date coverage
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:56.760]   of where the fires are at.
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:00.560]   Specifically, the Kinkade Fire, which is not very far from us,
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.640]   but thankfully far enough.
[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:01.840]   Yeah.
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:02.880]   About 30 miles.
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.240]   And they're integrating this in a way
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.480]   that they're updating every five to 20 minutes.
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:11.000]   So that's just faster than a lot of other systems, I guess.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:14.000]   They're pulling from near infrared and visible spectrum
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.080]   images in order to do this.
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:18.680]   And yeah, they've got-- kind of like--
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:22.040]   if you go on to Google and you do a search for Kinkade Fire,
[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:26.240]   it pulls up a special kind of like results page that
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:30.000]   has a lot of information that you might need if you were
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.560]   in the area, like emergency information, emergency numbers,
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:35.560]   some of the latest news.
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:39.160]   And then it has this map that's kind of dialed into it
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:40.600]   that is really up to base.
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:41.960]   It's a car car car showing what road closures--
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:43.320]   But you don't have to go there.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:48.240]   Looks like-- looks better than it did yesterday.
[01:36:48.240 --> 01:36:50.520]   I think yesterday there were-- that whole area
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:54.360]   was a road closure and it was different.
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:55.880]   But yeah.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:58.160]   Very useful tool.
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:36:59.240]   Incredibly useful.
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:02.480]   Kudos to them for, again, trying to help out.
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:03.480]   Yeah?
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.200]   Absolutely.
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:07.440]   Oh, Google's finally going to stop indexing and ranking
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:08.840]   anything flash on the web.
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:09.680]   So that's good.
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:10.720]   Hallelujah.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:11.480]   Hallelujah.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:13.400]   Hallelujah.
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:18.520]   I've watched MSNBC when I'm not at home through my machine
[01:37:18.520 --> 01:37:21.320]   and because I sign into Verizon and do all that.
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:25.040]   It's just torture because it's flash.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:26.000]   Oh, really?
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.040]   Still I've got--
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:27.560]   I re-tied.
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.560]   We'll never let me say, OK, forever.
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:30.480]   Just change this.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:32.760]   It forgets my changes.
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.520]   I've got to go through like four steps.
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:35.760]   I was saying, yes, yes, yes.
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:37.080]   I mean it really honest to God.
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:38.240]   Yes, please.
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.360]   And then reloads and all this.
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:40.800]   And I finally get it.
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:42.680]   It's awful.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:45.880]   I know you hate flash, but--
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:49.520]   Well, if Google does this, then hopefully people
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:50.560]   will switch from flash.
[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:51.640]   And that would be amazing.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:53.600]   I hope so.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.800]   They're going to be ignoring flash content.
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:38:00.800]   They're going to stop indexing standalone SWF files.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:06.640]   Apple, of course, quit its relationship with flash years
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:07.320]   and years ago.
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:10.640]   Google hung on and is still hanging on.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:13.440]   So many security flaws in it, right?
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:18.720]   Why would we still consider it being a usable mode
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:20.680]   of sharing content?
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:24.080]   Well, an HTML5 is awesome.
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.920]   Light comparison, lightweight.
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:30.760]   So yep, not everybody's moved over, I guess.
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:31.920]   So there's that.
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:34.000]   Well, now you start hitting people in the wallet
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:35.440]   and we'll see what happens.
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:41.360]   So we should talk about a thing on Facebook.
[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:42.840]   And full disclosure, as I raised my name
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:44.240]   from the school from Facebook, I've been
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.760]   in the Facebook or seen from the person
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:48.960]   from Facebook or any of the platforms.
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:50.880]   Where they announced their news tab last week.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:52.520]   And I went to the-- I went to two events last week.
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:57.440]   I went to Twitter's News Summit, which I can tell you about.
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:01.000]   And then I also went to Facebook's event
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.720]   announcing the News tab with Mark Zuckerberg and Robert
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:08.560]   Thompson, the CEO of News Corp.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:11.920]   And Thompson has been highly, highly critical of the platform.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.320]   And we now know his price.
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:14.160]   Just give him some money.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:18.440]   And he's all kind of slathering all over Zuckerberg.
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:19.840]   And so the News tab is there.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.200]   They're paying a bunch of publishers.
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:21.680]   Not all.
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:23.200]   They're paying a bunch of publishers.
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:25.680]   A substantial amount of money, long-term contract,
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:26.960]   for a separate News tab.
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:27.720]   I don't have it yet.
[01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:29.600]   I don't think anybody does have it yet major.
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:32.080]   The controversy, however, is this.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.280]   And it's bothering me too.
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:37.960]   They included Breitbart.
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:42.480]   And there are issues there.
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:46.800]   And so folks in my world were fairly scandalized
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.360]   that they considered that a news source next to the New
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.480]   York Times and the Washington Post and such.
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:56.680]   Now, others were argued Zuckerberg was asked about it.
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:00.160]   And it's a fairly standard perspective.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.520]   We want multiple perspectives.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.720]   And there is a problem that we don't have enough conservative
[01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:04.520]   media in the country.
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:07.240]   We only have basically one outlet.
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:09.400]   And so when you go below that one,
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:12.480]   you end up pretty quickly at a Breitbart.
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:15.560]   So I don't know what you guys think of this.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:19.120]   Whether they should or should not have included Breitbart.
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:22.480]   Breitbart's done some pretty awful stuff.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:25.520]   What do you guys think?
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:26.640]   That's my view, I mean.
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:27.160]   Miss Stacy.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:28.280]   Miss Charles, I'm nearly too--
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:29.520]   No, I'm like, oh, I'm losing you.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:31.040]   Category.
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:34.920]   But the truth is losing categories.
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.360]   The truth is losing categories.
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:40.920]   I mean, Breitbart is not what I would consider a legitimate
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:42.040]   news site.
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:46.760]   Sometimes they run actual news stories.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.760]   I mean, they definitely have a point of view in "Artshye"
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:49.560]   about expressing it.
[01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:51.320]   But some of their--
[01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:54.000]   And this is an issue.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.600]   Can you be a news site if you also run things that are not
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:57.960]   news, right?
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:00.520]   And that's what I feel like they can--
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.960]   OK.
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:02.640]   So--
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:03.800]   Pidion, news ones.
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:07.000]   Things that people have imagined happen but haven't actually
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:07.480]   happened already.
[01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:08.840]   That's the other question.
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:09.360]   Yeah.
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:11.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.840]   I'm like, there are things I've heard--
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:14.520]   Imaginary news.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:18.640]   Yeah, so yeah, I say no.
[01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:22.800]   And I don't like it because I would like there to be true--
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:29.720]   I mean, the way this is is conservative.
[01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:33.640]   If you're a conservative, basically your choices are--
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.600]   the Wall Street Journal, is the national review still out there?
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.720]   I don't know.
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:40.280]   Or white nationalists.
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:44.040]   And that really sucks if you're a conservative because--
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:44.800]   Right.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:46.280]   There are other shades of gray in there.
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:49.840]   And I don't think everybody's a white nationalist who
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.760]   is physically conservative.
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:52.560]   I could be wrong.
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.080]   Right.
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:54.320]   Right.
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:54.640]   Yeah.
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:56.400]   Well, certainly, if there are perspectives out there,
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.360]   we've got to serve it.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:00.440]   What do we expect if we serve that half of America only?
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:01.400]   That kind of stuff.
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:02.240]   And I argue it's right.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:03.240]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:04.240]   I'm as liberal as they come.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:05.680]   We've got to invest in conservative media.
[01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.440]   And so I'm sympathetic to that part
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.520]   is if you want to have any appearance of balance,
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:12.040]   you can't say, here's 200 sites on this side.
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:13.440]   Let's have 200 sites on that side.
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:17.560]   When five sites in, you end up in infill wars.
[01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:20.680]   There's an asymmetry here, which is hard to deal with.
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:22.280]   But this goes back to the discussion
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:24.720]   about the political ads, too.
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:26.760]   Is there unwilling to make any judgment?
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:30.240]   And they've got to start making judgments.
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:35.600]   Well, and I think that conservative movement overall
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:38.680]   is actually where the Democrats were probably eight years ago,
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:41.160]   which was kind of bankrupt in terms
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:43.640]   of having actual policy ideas.
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:52.080]   Like, there wasn't a lot of movement behind any big policies.
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:55.480]   Whereas right now, if you talk to Democrats,
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:58.760]   there's a lot around equal pay.
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:01.280]   There's a lot about environmental action.
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:05.560]   There's lots about paying off student debt.
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.040]   Healthcare, all of these things,
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:09.400]   have become true policies that you can debate
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:11.160]   and have a reasoned argument over.
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:14.720]   Whereas the conservative party is right now
[01:43:14.720 --> 01:43:17.560]   not putting up anything beyond lowering taxes.
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:20.920]   And again, I'll go with white nationalism.
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:23.960]   And that's tough.
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:28.320]   I mean, that's alienating for anybody who doesn't want
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:33.480]   to be thought of as a jerk, which is a lot of--
[01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:34.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:37.600]   I don't like that Breitbart is part of this.
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:42.280]   I think Breitbart has done enough to show where they stand
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:43.960]   in this whole dialogue.
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:51.760]   And when Facebook calls these publishers, trusted publishers,
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:56.240]   I think that in and of itself feels incorrectly applied to me.
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:59.880]   Because I don't consider Breitbart a trusted publishing.
[01:43:59.880 --> 01:44:01.600]   Maybe they just trusted in the sense
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:04.840]   that it's going to deliver a certain type of opinion.
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:05.360]   OK.
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:06.960]   It's not trusted like you would leave it at home
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:10.360]   with your children, but maybe it's trusted that it's consistent.
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:11.360]   I don't--
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:11.920]   Right.
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:13.920]   Right.
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:17.160]   Maybe I'm indifferent on it all, but first and foremost,
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:23.120]   I just don't see the use of a news tab inside of Facebook.
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:26.480]   I get-- as a business, it's a good idea for them
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:28.720]   to come up with this additional platform.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:34.040]   But I just stay away from all of it in all of this Breitbart
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:34.600]   stuff.
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:38.560]   And now I'm seeing hashtags about Photoshop
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.400]   and things of that nature.
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:43.080]   None of this makes me want to consume more news.
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:46.600]   So half the time, I guess you could say, I'm not woke
[01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:49.760]   or in foreign because I stay away from the news.
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:52.880]   But it's definitely helped my mental health
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:56.600]   compared to other people that are so entrenched in all of this stuff.
[01:44:56.600 --> 01:44:57.600]   Yeah, sure.
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:58.280]   I get--
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:01.880]   I'm not sure it's a business decision so much as it is a PR decision.
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:02.680]   OK.
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:04.960]   And the amount of money they're paying to, like,
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:06.960]   reportedly $3 million a year of the Wall Street Journal,
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:08.280]   they're not going to make that back.
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:09.080]   You don't think so?
[01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:09.760]   They get to this.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:10.960]   No.
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:12.920]   No, it's not kind of referred to that.
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:14.480]   He said, well, maybe in some years,
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:17.440]   we could get to 10% or maybe even 20% of the Facebook audience
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:19.200]   could be looking at news this way.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:21.040]   That's not terribly ambitious.
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:21.600]   OK.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.840]   That does sound more like PR.
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:29.760]   Well, by PR, I don't mean kind of policy call of that.
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:32.400]   One person at Facebook said to me some time ago,
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.240]   I can't control your uncle in the news feed,
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:38.120]   but I can create a space to a controlled space for news
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:39.560]   where the environment is good.
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.800]   They know not everybody's going to go to it.
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:41.960]   They say that out loud.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:48.360]   But there's a place for news there that wasn't going to be
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:50.360]   divisive, but there's probably parts there.
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:53.360]   So who knows?
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:56.200]   Well, it's not divisive these days.
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:59.640]   And so this is going to roll out sometime in the coming weeks.
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:01.520]   It's supposed to hit any time, is that right?
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:03.720]   They're dog fooding with, I think,
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:05.560]   a very small number of people now.
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:06.840]   And so it's going to be a roll out.
[01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:08.520]   Yeah, that's going to be a long roll out.
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:09.520]   The US only.
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:12.320]   Or are they dog whistling?
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.960]   Oh, I am just not.
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:16.600]   Yeah, just ignore me.
[01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:18.600]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:22.000]   Another thing that's dog fooding, maybe, or at least beta
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:25.200]   testing is Netflix.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:28.520]   Testing variable playback of video content.
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:29.920]   That's just the right thing for me.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:30.680]   I really like that idea.
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:32.280]   I can't wait for watching this.
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.640]   I hope I watch all my shows that way.
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:34.360]   That'd be very great.
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:35.960]   This is to podcast list books that way.
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:37.400]   And listen to me really fast.
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:37.960]   He said.
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:39.080]   He's an unusual experience, huh?
[01:46:39.080 --> 01:46:41.960]   He sounded like that two weeks ago, right?
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:43.160]   I'm just excited.
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:44.680]   That's what happens.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:46.880]   What I love about that is there are people who
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:49.000]   listen to this show sped up.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:49.960]   So that part--
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:50.440]   Oh, man.
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.080]   That's going to be a great word to be said.
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:54.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:56.320]   I was asking in the chat, I mean,
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.400]   I wonder how many people do listen to the show sped up.
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:00.040]   I would love to have those stats.
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:01.040]   I think a lot of people do.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:01.560]   I think a lot of people do.
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:02.760]   I think a lot of people do.
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:04.640]   And they might not speed it up one and a half,
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:06.640]   because, I mean, have you tried to do that?
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.480]   At least for me, it's really hard for me to keep up
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:09.360]   at one and a half.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:10.680]   But I can do one point two.
[01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:12.680]   Yeah, normally if anything, one point two.
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:14.040]   Yeah, that's about as much.
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.760]   I hit my show sometimes at one and a half.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:20.200]   Because I tend to speak slower because I'm thinking.
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:21.920]   And sometimes I have to--
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:23.960]   Can you hear me in something there?
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:24.560]   No, no.
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:26.480]   I'm a slow talker.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.240]   Stand down.
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:28.240]   Stand down.
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:29.200]   Sorry.
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:30.880]   I'm a slow talker.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:33.040]   Here's your gloves, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:35.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:39.600]   But is there a difference between listening to a podcast
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:44.200]   that's sped up and watching a movie that's sped up?
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:45.400]   I would agree.
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:47.480]   It's visual and also--
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:51.160]   Yeah, I wonder what are you doing to the art itself?
[01:47:51.160 --> 01:47:52.480]   Yeah, podcasts.
[01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:54.400]   Do we think of ourselves as art?
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:54.920]   Or we are.
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:56.080]   No, that I consider it all.
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:57.240]   Of course we do.
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.760]   Some components of it could be--
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.200]   It's my move.
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:01.200]   No.
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:03.200]   Our whole audience know I'm full of curves.
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:04.680]   I'm not going to try.
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:05.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:08.000]   You can adjust the timbre or the voice.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.320]   So the first time you go to high speed on voice,
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:12.040]   it sounds a little weird, but then you get really used to it.
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.200]   You get used to it, right?
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:15.440]   I do the same with the audio books.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:17.400]   But with visuals, I don't know.
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:20.880]   It'll look-- can they adjust it so it still
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.680]   feels the eyes of its normal?
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:23.200]   No.
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:25.320]   Yeah, and directors make these conscious decisions
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:27.560]   about the frame rates they're going to use and things like that.
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:30.240]   I mean, that's part of what they're doing.
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:34.200]   And basically what this is is you must consume content faster
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:36.080]   because we're making so much damn content.
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:36.600]   Right.
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:36.600]   It's true.
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:38.920]   I can't keep up with the content that they're making.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:41.320]   This is too much, but I don't watch a whole lot either.
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:43.880]   But I saw that when I was a TV critic,
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:46.280]   because as we know in the show, I used to be a TV critic.
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:50.080]   Former former TV guy critic and people.
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:56.920]   I did that in the days, my children, of really long mini-series.
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:00.080]   The mini-series AD was torture.
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:04.480]   But I was-- I believe that I should not fast forward,
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:06.880]   past things.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:08.640]   If you're a critic, why would you?
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:09.080]   Why would you?
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:09.600]   Why a critic?
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.560]   Whole effing thing.
[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:12.920]   600 minutes.
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:15.000]   600-- is that what it was?
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:16.520]   That's what Wikipedia says.
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:17.680]   600 minutes running.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:20.160]   Divided by-- that's 10 hours.
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:21.720]   What have you got?
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:22.720]   So it's like a season.
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:24.720]   It felt like 24.
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:25.720]   It was just awesome.
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:30.040]   And I would hit a week where I would get four mini-series.
[01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:31.040]   And I had to watch them.
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:31.960]   So I would have loved--
[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:32.960]   Drew had this then.
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:37.960]   Well, Netflix pointed out that not too long ago,
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:40.240]   we were all consuming on DVD.
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:42.640]   And a lot of DVD players had the ability
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.720]   to have variable speed playback.
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:46.120]   But who used that?
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:46.800]   Well, that's true.
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.240]   Who used it?
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:48.920]   You could.
[01:49:48.920 --> 01:49:51.440]   And so their argument is, well, you could then.
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:52.400]   So now you can.
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:53.400]   Now you can.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:54.880]   Why not?
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:57.160]   I mean, yes, they're not forcing it upon people.
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:00.040]   So I get it.
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:04.080]   But I will also say that anything that makes directors less
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.760]   satisfied-- and sometimes it's boring for you.
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:08.160]   And you're like, god, this is slow.
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:09.920]   But then there's a payoff.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:12.480]   If you watch "Boyhood," for example, I'm going to be honest.
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:13.200]   I watched it.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.520]   I was like pacing.
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:18.720]   And like, oh my god, stop, stop, make something happen.
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:22.000]   But at the-- afterwards, I was like, oh, that was actually
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000]   well worth my time.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:24.960]   I don't know.
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:25.720]   I need to see that.
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:27.120]   I haven't seen any of it.
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.320]   It's leaving Netflix.
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.080]   Oh, tomorrow, or like the day after that or something.
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:32.080]   So get on it.
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:33.640]   Yeah, the hell--
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:36.000]   He's going to miss that one, folks.
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.960]   Sorry, can't trick or treat tonight.
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:39.480]   I'm watching "Boyhood."
[01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:41.040]   That's how I prioritize all the time.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:42.560]   I'm going, what is leaving Netflix?
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:44.000]   OK, I'll find the question.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:53.840]   I mean, I know we haven't done the change log.
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:55.520]   Is there anything before the change log?
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:56.600]   Because we could do the change log,
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:50:58.760]   and then do some tips.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:50:59.960]   Anything that you guys want to get in there?
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:02.120]   Mail political reporters retweet other dudes
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:04.080]   three times more than their female colleagues,
[01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:05.680]   but that's no surprise.
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:06.680]   OK.
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:08.840]   Do you just retweet dudes?
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:17.280]   No, I think-- well, we could be doing Helvetica for Halloween.
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:21.120]   Helvetica is evil twin Helvetica.
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:23.240]   As the article on Fast Company says,
[01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:25.120]   we'll haunt your nightmares.
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:26.240]   Ooh.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:28.200]   It was badly curd.
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:29.200]   Yes.
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:30.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:31.360]   It's like, what did you do?
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:33.120]   And then I'm like, oh, that is terrible curd.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:34.240]   Son of a woman.
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:36.120]   I hope you all know what curding is.
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:38.440]   It's the space between letters.
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:43.000]   And sometimes you can curd an F over an E to make it look good.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.120]   They went to awful curding.
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:47.960]   Just grading curding.
[01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:50.560]   However, I was just writing about something.
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:51.240]   Did you know?
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:52.480]   I didn't really fully realize this.
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:56.680]   I just read a book called Space Between Words.
[01:51:56.680 --> 01:51:58.360]   I don't think I've done this before.
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:01.480]   That from the first century AD, till the seventh to 12th century
[01:52:01.480 --> 01:52:05.880]   AD, there was no space between words.
[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:06.960]   Oh, wow.
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:07.440]   What?
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:09.880]   Scribes didn't use spaces between words.
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:11.040]   They didn't use punctuation.
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:13.000]   They didn't use capitalization.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.680]   It was just a continuous sounds insane.
[01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:18.040]   Scriptura continue on.
[01:52:18.040 --> 01:52:19.840]   Sounds completely insane.
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:26.760]   But it was meant to record and prompt recitation and memorization.
[01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:31.480]   And as the author of the book, Paul Sanger says,
[01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:35.480]   when children learn to write, they tend to write continuously.
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:37.840]   Continue with sound.
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:38.840]   Right?
[01:52:38.840 --> 01:52:41.720]   When I listened to someone before I started taking Spanish lessons
[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:43.720]   to no good end because I'm so stupid.
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:45.680]   But I would listen to someone speaking Spanish.
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:48.640]   And it sounded like one complete sound without breaker breath,
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:49.140]   right?
[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:52.840]   Because I couldn't recognize the words in it.
[01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:55.440]   So yeah, it is kind of interesting.
[01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:56.640]   It's like I just wrote that.
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:58.920]   And that's actually-- so my daughter,
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:02.040]   that explains my daughter when she learned to write,
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:03.840]   she actually learned cursive first.
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:07.520]   And the reason behind it was that exact same reasoning.
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:10.880]   So she didn't-- well, it was kind of painful.
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:11.440]   But--
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:12.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:13.440]   --really--
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:14.440]   I don't know.
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:15.000]   But it did.
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.040]   I mean, so-- and that was their logic.
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:18.600]   So Jeff?
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:19.100]   You're--
[01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:20.280]   I'll back you up on this.
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:21.320]   I'm not going to argue with you.
[01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:22.720]   Back to "White of the Day."
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:28.840]   I've not seen that since roughly 1996 or so with Outcast.
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:33.480]   And there's Southern Play-O-Listic Cadillac music track.
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:35.600]   And they wrote it all out in one word.
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:36.600]   Outcast.
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:37.120]   Mm-hmm.
[01:53:37.120 --> 01:53:41.320]   Southern Play-O-Listic Cadillac music by Outcast.
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:42.880]   It's a song.
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:43.720]   Yes.
[01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:44.520]   One with his plays--
[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:45.440]   Long word, you are.
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:46.280]   It's like German.
[01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:47.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:48.440]   Yes.
[01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:49.440]   It kind of is.
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:51.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:53.120]   All right, that's fascinating.
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:54.040]   But it's so true.
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:57.560]   Like, you know, the kids, when they first start writing,
[01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:58.920]   it all blends together.
[01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:01.000]   And then that e-mail should be at the end of the sentence
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:01.960]   is on the next line.
[01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:03.120]   On the next line, yeah.
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:03.960]   It's continuing to count.
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:04.460]   Yeah.
[01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:06.520]   So when they started putting spaces back,
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:11.800]   it was inspired by Arabic and Hebrew.
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:12.560]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:14.240]   Let's put spaces there.
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:18.320]   Also, the problem was words written without vowels.
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:19.520]   And that's when they had to have spaces,
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:20.680]   because you had to figure out what the word was.
[01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:21.760]   They had to add your own vowels.
[01:54:21.760 --> 01:54:23.600]   When vowels got added into writing,
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:26.360]   the spaces became superfluous in the sounds.
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.280]   So that's when it became all crammed together.
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:31.760]   And then they moved it back apart again, which meant that people
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:33.920]   started being able to read themselves,
[01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:35.280]   because it wasn't so hard.
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.640]   They were able to read a lot faster,
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:39.120]   because you recognized the shapes of the word.
[01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:42.760]   And then that created demand for more things to read.
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:44.000]   And that led to authorship.
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:44.960]   And that led to Gutenberg.
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:45.960]   You knew what ended up there.
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:46.760]   Of course.
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:47.120]   Wow.
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:49.160]   So moving from an oral to moving culture,
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:50.320]   you just took us all the way through.
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:51.320]   Thanks, Chef.
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:52.640]   Six degrees of Gutenberg.
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:55.360]   One thing more for you, for you, Stacey,
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:57.920]   is breakthrough in fast charging for electric cars.
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:01.200]   I thought this was potentially a very big deal,
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:04.040]   being able to get 200 miles in 10 minutes
[01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:07.560]   by heating up your battery.
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:09.560]   Well, it would heat up your battery
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:11.320]   if you would just accept all that.
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:13.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:15.120]   Wow.
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:17.200]   But is the idea that you would warm up the battery,
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:19.560]   and it would accept the power for easily?
[01:55:19.560 --> 01:55:23.200]   This was some research that was done.
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:24.680]   Bring me the link.
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:26.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:29.840]   It's one of these pages that has video on top for no reason.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:31.320]   Oh.
[01:55:31.320 --> 01:55:32.120]   Yeah, it doesn't work.
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:32.320]   Money, Jeff.
[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:33.320]   That's the reason.
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:55:33.840 --> 01:55:35.520]   I know the head of this company.
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:37.120]   Yeah.
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:39.400]   They developed lithium-ion iron battery capable of adding
[01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:42.680]   200 to 300 miles in 10 minutes.
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:45.120]   Wow.
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:46.680]   By elevating the--
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:47.200]   OK.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:49.320]   Without it, you've got to get up there super fast
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:51.480]   and then bring it down.
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:52.880]   Oh, I like it.
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:53.840]   Oh.
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:54.920]   That'd be very cool.
[01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:58.120]   Battery only lasts three months.
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:00.440]   Well, they actually say that it extends the life of the battery, too.
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:00.960]   OK.
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:01.480]   All right.
[01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:02.840]   Well, it's not too long.
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:04.520]   No, that is a win-win.
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:06.560]   Believe it or want to see it.
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:10.720]   There's all-- I mean, when I'm driving the Tesla, like, cross country,
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:14.280]   but long, long distances, it is kind of like the first stop.
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:15.760]   You're like, yeah, I'll get something to eat.
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:16.480]   I'll get lunch.
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.000]   And you charge all the way up.
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:21.800]   And then two hours later, you're like, I'm still kind of full
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:23.080]   from the last charge up.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:25.480]   What am I going to do for 30 minutes here?
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:29.280]   You plan your motel by the ones that have a charging?
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:31.040]   Sometimes.
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:34.200]   I don't do a lot of super road trips.
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:38.280]   So for me, I plan by hiking.
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:41.000]   So I go up near a place where there's two superchargers
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000]   on the Olympic peninsula.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:47.040]   So I can't go any further without planning.
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:51.000]   Did you drive the Tesla from Austin to Seattle?
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:51.960]   Oh, no.
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:55.520]   We went with the Russian mafia, which is the--
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:58.240]   all car transport is handled by the Russian mafia.
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:00.560]   So we used one of them.
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:02.080]   Got it.
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:02.360]   All right.
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:02.920]   That's my list.
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:03.920]   That's what I want to do.
[01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:04.420]   Awesome.
[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:04.960]   I like it.
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:05.360]   Love it.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:07.800]   You can now warn Karsten.
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:08.480]   All right.
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:09.840]   Let's hear some horns.
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:13.000]   But Google changed log.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.800]   Some things changed.
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:20.040]   There weren't a whole lot of changes this week.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:22.200]   I just scrambled a little bit to find a few extras.
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:25.000]   So we actually had a decent amount to read here.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.880]   Google homes and minis have been breaking, apparently,
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:31.440]   due to a firmware update gone awry.
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:34.000]   Particularly, this has been happening since September.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.280]   But Google told 9 to 5 Google that it
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.520]   plans to replace affected devices.
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:40.000]   Because it comes to--
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:40.840]   Oh, gee.
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:42.080]   Are you alive?
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:42.720]   Oh, no.
[01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:44.200]   You know, Apple did an update.
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:45.200]   Some of you are clear.
[01:57:45.200 --> 01:57:46.520]   The great simple pods this week too.
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:48.640]   So Google's not alone.
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:49.440]   OK.
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:51.920]   It's hard to keep these things alive.
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:54.960]   I think I may have mentioned it on last episode or not.
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:56.440]   But I think it's worth repeating,
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:57:58.600]   because I think it was probably a passing comment.
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:00.800]   That they're also putting out an update for Google Homes
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:03.680]   that you can do independent stereo.
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:04.040]   So--
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:04.520]   Right.
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:04.880]   Right.
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:05.640]   You didn't mention it.
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:06.520]   You have two of them.
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:08.160]   And I just think that's neat.
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:09.280]   I like that they're doing that.
[01:58:09.280 --> 01:58:11.040]   Home-filling sound.
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:13.040]   How many years did it take to go back to stereo?
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:14.000]   Yes, exactly.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.400]   Here we are again.
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:16.880]   I have that in the '70s for God's sake.
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:18.120]   Totally, totally.
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:20.080]   Here we go again.
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:22.480]   There's a new Google Home app update
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:25.480]   that's rolling out to Android right now, to iOS
[01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:26.800]   in the coming days.
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:29.520]   It has a new, simpler, cleaner design.
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:30.360]   And they've redesigned--
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:31.240]   Do you like this?
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:32.320]   Kind of the approach of it.
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:32.840]   Oh, God.
[01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:33.360]   Have you seen it yet?
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:34.680]   I do.
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:36.520]   No, Kevin and I talked about it on our show,
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:38.880]   and I tried to download it to see if I had it yet.
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:39.880]   But neither of us do.
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:41.120]   But I like the way it looks.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:42.040]   I'm very excited.
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.360]   Yeah, I don't have it either.
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:45.400]   Two main tabs-- home and media, home,
[01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:47.600]   of course, for controlling the devices in your home.
[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:49.880]   Much the same has already been done in the app.
[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:53.880]   Media highlights any apps for media that are in use
[01:58:53.880 --> 01:58:58.440]   with controls and playback, artwork, that sort of stuff,
[01:58:58.440 --> 01:58:59.200]   embedded in there.
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:00.240]   So it's easy to find.
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:03.600]   And then apparently, there's a new feed tab that acts as a home
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:06.720]   recap with things like highlights, important events,
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:10.280]   notification security alerts, audio video clips.
[01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:12.400]   I don't know if that's like clips from your devices
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:16.120]   or what it is, but priority events, that sort of stuff.
[01:59:16.120 --> 01:59:17.880]   Yeah, what was the--
[01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:21.080]   Well, because if you go in the Google Home app,
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:23.560]   you can see your last utterances and things like that.
[01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:25.520]   So I'm like, is that going to be kind of like that?
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:27.400]   Or is it going to be something totally different?
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:28.920]   And then I still have to go to the Google Home app,
[01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:31.880]   because I thought we were stepping away from all that.
[01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:33.320]   I don't know what Google's doing.
[01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:35.840]   Or maybe if someone rang your doorbell
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:38.480]   and there was video for it, maybe it shows like, oh,
[01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:40.240]   that's who I missed.
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:41.320]   Steve came by.
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:44.640]   You're like, which apps should I go with the doorbell app?
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:46.920]   Should I go with this app?
[01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:49.000]   You've got options, at least there's that.
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.200]   And confusion.
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:54.800]   TensorBoard.dev preview launch was announced today.
[01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:57.040]   I wish I understood this more than I do,
[01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:00.240]   but I'll just say that you can host a track machine learning
[02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:03.040]   experiments and share them publicly with no setup required.
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:04.400]   So that's got to be good, right?
[02:00:04.400 --> 02:00:06.960]   We'll hear more about this at I/O next year.
[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:08.320]   Yeah, probably so.
[02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:10.960]   And it's supposedly support for Google Cloud.
[02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:14.360]   That's all I really understood from that announcement.
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:15.160]   A little bit more--
[02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:16.040]   You have more for us?
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:17.000]   Yeah, just there.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.320]   Right, right.
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:19.560]   I don't know with this announcement,
[02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:22.320]   but is it just it's giving you access
[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:26.720]   to run your own machine learning algorithms
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:32.040]   and problems on a TensorFlow cloud instance?
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:33.280]   Yes, something?
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:33.760]   Maybe?
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:35.640]   That sounds really like me.
[02:00:35.640 --> 02:00:37.600]   Like, I think it's a--
[02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:39.080]   Yeah, we're all in, maybe.
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:41.000]   It's a fur, maybe.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.040]   I didn't read this one.
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:44.640]   I went back and forth on whether to include this one,
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:46.440]   because I was like, god, I really don't understand this.
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:49.480]   So now I'll be able to host and track your ML experiments
[02:00:49.480 --> 02:00:52.560]   and share them publicly, no setup required.
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:55.080]   Yeah, well, so like, you know how we were talking about IBM
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:57.360]   letting people play around with their quantum thing
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:58.960]   when we showed that last week?
[02:00:58.960 --> 02:00:59.400]   Right.
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:02.640]   This might just be the same thing for--
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:04.600]   I'm looking-- yeah, so it's the same thing.
[02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:08.200]   It's basically TensorFlow available for you
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:11.480]   to play with without having to know how to run with TensorFlow.
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:13.160]   So yes, and it does all--
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:15.640]   it's like a PaaS, a platform as a service.
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.040]   So you don't have to worry about setting up
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:18.640]   your underlying infrastructure.
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:21.680]   It just-- you just give it--
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:23.960]   I don't know if you give it your data.
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:26.240]   I'm like, I don't understand where--
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:30.280]   I think you give it your data, and then you
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:33.320]   can run your algorithms against it.
[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:34.720]   But I'm not 100% sure there.
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:35.200]   OK.
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:36.240]   But yes.
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:37.880]   That's-- did that help?
[02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:39.080]   Yeah, that's helpful.
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:41.880]   I actually understand it a little bit more, though.
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:45.040]   I should have had you read that one, clearly.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:45.640]   She knows.
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:47.280]   I didn't see this one on there.
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:48.800]   So otherwise, I would have read it automatically,
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:50.200]   because I'm like, oh, machine learning.
[02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:52.640]   Oh, I should throw this-- this is not in the doc,
[02:01:52.640 --> 02:01:53.720]   but I'm happy about this scooter
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:54.560]   ex post in the chat.
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:57.080]   SiriusXM coming to Google Assistant, finally.
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:58.600]   SiriusXM still exists.
[02:01:58.600 --> 02:01:59.560]   It still exists.
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:00.120]   Yeah.
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:01.360]   Evan is thrilled to be here.
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:03.240]   He can get rid of the echoes, because he can listen
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:05.800]   to his Beatles channel.
[02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:06.000]   Wow.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:07.240]   This is the Howard Stern.
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:07.840]   Of course you do.
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:09.800]   Oh, that's right.
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:10.280]   Yeah.
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:10.840]   I was thinking--
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:11.440]   I've got-- I've got--
[02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:13.400]   there was another satellite service.
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:14.760]   It was serious, and it was something else.
[02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:15.680]   Maybe I'm thinking of the other--
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:16.480]   No, it was serious.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:17.240]   And it was XM.
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:19.680]   Because what happened was that there was one inventor,
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:23.560]   and then they decided that was kind of automatic antitrust,
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:24.680]   because you couldn't have one company.
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:26.600]   So they assisted us, putting up the companies.
[02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:27.080]   OK.
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:29.200]   But neither was sufficient to be a business,
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:31.440]   and it also meant the technology wasn't as good.
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:33.160]   But by then, the satellites were up above,
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:34.440]   and they couldn't do anything about it.
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:37.440]   But anyway, so then they merged, and got bought.
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:41.120]   And so the technology is not what it could be
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:44.200]   if they were together, but the two companies are together.
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:46.600]   OK, yeah.
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:47.040]   Yeah.
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:48.600]   So I'm happy about that.
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:51.520]   Any time I've wanted to play it, I've had to Bluetooth in,
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:52.720]   and it's not the end of the world.
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:55.160]   But this is a little bit easier.
[02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:56.280]   So I'm looking forward to that.
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:59.760]   Also YouTube Music, Love It or Not, now has a progressive web
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:03.840]   app, a Windows desktop or Mac OS Doc icon.
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:05.480]   I'll take you directly to the web app.
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:07.200]   It's identical to the website, but allows you
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:10.160]   to use keyboard shortcuts to play, pause, skip.
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:15.600]   Also, YouTube Music rolled out an Android widget last week.
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:16.280]   Yay.
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:19.920]   So I mean, this is just like the further development
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:23.240]   of YouTube Music as Google marches towards that being
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:25.120]   their primary music service.
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:27.200]   And I don't have a problem with them
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:30.240]   bringing this and promoting it a little bit more,
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:33.800]   because they're going to kill off Google Play Music.
[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:35.960]   I just wish they'd make it a better experience,
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:38.880]   because the five minutes I jumped into that app,
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:44.000]   it was painful to try to navigate through YouTube Music
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:47.000]   and find some tracks and had to discuss it with the family
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.320]   and let them know, hey, we're probably
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:50.000]   going to lose Google Music.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.920]   So let's go ahead and take a look at YouTube Music.
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:56.840]   And we all yelled out pretty much at the same time.
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:59.600]   It was like, what is this?
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:00.600]   And yeah, I understand that there's
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:02.760]   times you're going to have to get used to an interface,
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:06.920]   but I don't know, man, that's a stretch.
[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:08.680]   I'm still not going back to Gmail.
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:10.000]   I know what you mean.
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:10.600]   Yes.
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:11.040]   Yeah.
[02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:14.200]   I'm right there with you, still not comfortable.
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:15.560]   All right, because you were in-box.
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:16.520]   Yes.
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:17.400]   You bet.
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:18.080]   And I miss it every day.
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:19.920]   I got hip notized.
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:21.400]   Yeah, I miss it every day.
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:22.840]   And they said the same thing there, too.
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:25.200]   Oh, we're going to bring all the big features from in-box.
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:29.120]   They still haven't brought the best features from in-box.
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:31.840]   And with every passing day, I'm less and less confident
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:33.160]   that they will.
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:35.160]   We'll see.
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:37.720]   If you go into your Photos app and search Halloween,
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:39.720]   you'll see a rolling pumpkin.
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:40.400]   That's it.
[02:04:40.400 --> 02:04:41.400]   That's an outstanding change.
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:42.400]   That's so exciting.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:43.400]   Isn't that amazing?
[02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:45.320]   Ken barely changed.
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:48.880]   I would like little AR ghosts next to me in all of my pictures.
[02:04:48.880 --> 02:04:49.800]   That would be fun.
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:50.320]   Wait a minute.
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:53.240]   Didn't they do that years back where they replaced people
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:55.960]   in your photo with zombie people?
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:57.120]   Yeah.
[02:04:57.120 --> 02:04:57.800]   That was cool.
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:00.360]   That added them behind you.
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:01.960]   I thought they'd like replaced like--
[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:02.840]   Maybe they'd like camera.
[02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:03.840]   --the camera.
[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:05.560]   They turned my dead girl.
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:06.400]   I was all over.
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.840]   No, I remember them zombifying your face.
[02:05:08.840 --> 02:05:09.640]   Zombifying.
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:10.640]   I remember.
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:11.640]   Zomb because I want to see you.
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:12.640]   Some were talking about episodes.
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:14.800]   One of your avatars is that for a long time.
[02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:17.560]   Yeah, that's true, Aunt.
[02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:19.840]   Or that was just Jason on a bad day.
[02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:24.640]   Yes, it was a cool photo thing if I remember.
[02:05:24.640 --> 02:05:27.360]   Carsten wishes you could do it to us or especially me.
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:28.360]   But--
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:31.600]   Yeah, the rest of us are in the Halloween spirit, Jeff.
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:32.200]   But you--
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:33.200]   Here we go.
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:34.200]   I think it was Zombifying.
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:35.720]   Before the photo link, there we go.
[02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:38.560]   I found a story related to it, a droid life photo,
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:42.960]   where it would take the photo and it would kind of make whoever
[02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:44.640]   happened to be in it a zombie.
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:46.280]   It was a Google+ feature.
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:47.640]   It was going on.
[02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:48.080]   Right.
[02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:49.080]   Yes.
[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:49.600]   Right.
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:50.600]   Oh, Google+.
[02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:51.100]   Yeah.
[02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:54.520]   Everybody on Google+ is sure there's zombie photos.
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:56.680]   Now everybody still there looks like that.
[02:05:56.680 --> 02:05:57.680]   Yeah.
[02:05:57.680 --> 02:06:00.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:03.360]   And that is the Google Change Log.
[02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:09.120]   All right.
[02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:13.960]   Now we've reached the picks section.
[02:06:13.960 --> 02:06:16.320]   So Stacy, why don't you go first?
[02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:17.560]   What you got?
[02:06:17.560 --> 02:06:18.560]   Yay!
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:21.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:23.880]   I know it's Halloween, you guys.
[02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:27.560]   But let's start thinking about holiday lights.
[02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:28.560]   Oh, come on.
[02:06:28.560 --> 02:06:29.560]   Oh, come on.
[02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:30.560]   Don't do it it.
[02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:34.320]   So these are my new favorite toy.
[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:36.560]   These are the Twinkly smart lights.
[02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:39.560]   They-- and it's not dark here yet,
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:41.000]   so I can't really show you.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:42.440]   But I can take you downstairs and show you.
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:43.600]   So what these are?
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:44.120]   Are these--
[02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:46.440]   Your Halloween is just a tree up with the lights?
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:48.920]   No, I strung them on--
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:51.120]   I outlined my window and then took the excess
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:52.360]   and shoved it into a pumpkin.
[02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:55.880]   So it looks like Halloween.
[02:06:55.880 --> 02:06:57.680]   There's the scary new lady in the neighborhood.
[02:06:57.680 --> 02:06:58.400]   Yeah.
[02:06:58.400 --> 02:06:59.240]   That's me.
[02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:01.200]   And mine are the Halloween setting.
[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:04.080]   So that is orange and purple.
[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:06.240]   So the range of colors on these is good.
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:10.200]   What it does is you can download these patterns.
[02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:11.760]   They were just showing you a couple of them.
[02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:13.560]   So when you put it around your tree,
[02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:16.240]   it can-- like, you can do patterns that come up and down
[02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:16.680]   the tree.
[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:18.120]   They can go to the side to the side.
[02:07:18.120 --> 02:07:19.120]   It's all fancy.
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:22.360]   But it also gives you a mapping feature in your phone
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:25.480]   so you can map out to build your own designs
[02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:27.600]   and have the lights work the way you want.
[02:07:27.600 --> 02:07:28.000]   Oh, neat.
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000]   So yeah, it's super neat.
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.960]   But there are super expensive.
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:34.920]   Of course they are.
[02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:37.240]   I, but the string I have is what is it?
[02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:41.040]   225 RGB LEDs.
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:41.840]   Oh, I don't know.
[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:42.840]   And this is the cost of it.
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:43.160]   Hold on.
[02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:44.400]   I haven't said the cost yet.
[02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:45.840]   It was 168.
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:47.000]   Oh, so it's still--
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:47.520]   Still yeah.
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:48.040]   Still yeah.
[02:07:48.040 --> 02:07:49.480]   Wow.
[02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:51.000]   But-- oh, look.
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:55.120]   You could do a-- you could do a spyly face on your tree.
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:07:56.480]   OK.
[02:07:56.480 --> 02:07:56.960]   I know.
[02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:58.200]   I'm inordinately excited.
[02:07:58.200 --> 02:07:59.840]   So they do really well in the tree,
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:02.400]   because like the strings--
[02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:04.360]   basically, I've got my strings chasing each other
[02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:06.960]   in a Halloween pattern, which is fine.
[02:08:06.960 --> 02:08:09.440]   But I'm going to leave them up all year round,
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:12.400]   because I can do like UT Orange, which kind of looks
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:14.560]   like Clemson Orange, but we're going to call it UT Orange.
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:14.960]   No, no.
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:16.240]   It's not like Clemson Orange.
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:18.320]   I know there's a difference.
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:18.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:19.520]   Well, I know.
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:22.280]   But there's this actually closer to Clemson Orange.
[02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:22.800]   Oh, it is?
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:22.800]   OK.
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:23.440]   Sorry.
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:25.720]   Yeah, I'm going to just say it's UT Orange for me.
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:27.120]   Got you.
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:29.720]   But yes, it's so fun.
[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:32.040]   They're kind of like-- they're the level of utility
[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:34.200]   and probably expense that the nano leaf
[02:08:34.200 --> 02:08:36.240]   lights that I like so much are.
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:38.280]   So do with that what you will.
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:40.800]   But I'm having a grandal time.
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:45.760]   And I'm very happy that I've purchased them.
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:46.280]   Nice.
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:47.400]   Questions, comments.
[02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:48.400]   So yeah, I have one question.
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:50.080]   So if you have a big tree or a little tree,
[02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:51.760]   it looks like you can do patterns on the tree.
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:52.560]   Like it's my only face.
[02:08:52.560 --> 02:08:55.320]   But don't they be kind of aware of where they are?
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:56.320]   That's the mapping.
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:59.200]   So you hold up your smartphone, and you use that.
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:00.040]   Oh, that's how you do it.
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:01.840]   So map the location of the lights.
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:02.600]   And then they're like--
[02:09:02.600 --> 02:09:03.520]   Oh, that's so neat.
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:05.360]   Then you design the pattern.
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:06.120]   That's neat.
[02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:08.360]   Oh, that's fascinating.
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:10.280]   Because I haven't put them on a tree yet,
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:14.400]   I haven't experienced that feature in 3D.
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:15.840]   I've only experienced it on a tree.
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:18.440]   As you say, she's sneaking into a park somewhere
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:21.040]   and cutting out a tree since you can't buy one now,
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:22.760]   just so she can do this.
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:23.960]   I live in Washington.
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:25.400]   There's like a tree in my front yard.
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:26.800]   There's a tree in Washington.
[02:09:26.800 --> 02:09:29.320]   Oh, it's like, I'm looking at like six Christmas trees right
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:30.320]   now.
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:31.720]   They're just alive in my front yard.
[02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:34.040]   [LAUGHING]
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:34.960]   That's cool.
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:36.280]   But dang, that's expensive.
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:38.280]   You can buy different lights.
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:41.160]   So they have-- I just saw that they have a wall setting.
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:43.320]   So you could like-- oh my gosh.
[02:09:43.320 --> 02:09:45.200]   OK, I'm done.
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:46.200]   I love the wall setting.
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:47.760]   And you group them.
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:50.160]   Like, so you can buy basically a wall of lights
[02:09:50.160 --> 02:09:52.200]   if you want it to hang down your house.
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:55.560]   And you can tie them into your other lights
[02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:58.560]   using a grouping scene in the app.
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:01.560]   And many of these lights, these are Wi-Fi enabled.
[02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:04.080]   I have had smart lights actually previously
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:05.160]   that were Bluetooth enabled.
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:08.840]   And they sucked because you had to get close to them
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:10.840]   to be in Bluetooth range to control them.
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:13.040]   So they were too far out on your lawn.
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:13.880]   Of course.
[02:10:13.880 --> 02:10:15.880]   You'd be like, I need to go out to my lawn.
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:17.360]   And it's cold.
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:21.520]   So I know my life is hard.
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:24.120]   Those are called the Twinkly lights.
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:24.640]   Twinkly.
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:26.200]   These are the-- yes, the Twinkly's.
[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:28.440]   So I'm really excited by them, hopefully.
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:32.320]   And they seem sturdy. They are indoor and outdoor.
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:33.080]   And I don't know.
[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:34.040]   What else do you want to know?
[02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.520]   I don't know what else I need to tell them.
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:36.160]   They are neat.
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:39.240]   But my goodness, that's expensive for LED lights.
[02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:41.720]   Yeah, for that tree right there, how many strings
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:42.360]   did you need?
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:47.680]   So this 225 strands, so the 170 bucks I spent,
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:51.400]   that was going to get me a six foot tree, theoretically.
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:51.880]   Really?
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:52.880]   OK, fair enough.
[02:10:52.880 --> 02:10:54.320]   OK.
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:55.680]   I, however, feel that--
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:56.480]   Still expensive.
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:59.080]   There's never too many lights on the tree,
[02:10:59.080 --> 02:11:00.120]   so I don't really know.
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:01.320]   Oh, boy.
[02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:06.400]   Yeah, because how densely is it filled with a civil one?
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:08.600]   Like, I imagine you could get it around the tree,
[02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:10.080]   but it's still going to be pretty sparse.
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:10.600]   Sparse?
[02:11:10.600 --> 02:11:12.400]   You're going to want to put a couple of those on there
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:14.000]   to really feel like we should bring in new bricks
[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:14.920]   and we can award them.
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:15.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:19.200]   Well, so this is 73.8 feet.
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:22.200]   Is the 225 light strand?
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:23.080]   OK.
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:25.800]   And they're LEDs, so they are actually super bright.
[02:11:25.800 --> 02:11:26.840]   Yeah.
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:28.400]   They do some colors better than them.
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:30.320]   You want an up density for the pattern.
[02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:30.960]   Right.
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:31.720]   Yeah, you do.
[02:11:31.720 --> 02:11:32.240]   Just right now.
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:34.680]   I think this would give you enough density for the pattern.
[02:11:34.680 --> 02:11:36.960]   You're going to have a tree with pixel density, Stacy.
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:38.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:41.320]   It does work on shapes that aren't a Christmas tree,
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:43.520]   although I have not-- because of the mapping,
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:45.760]   it theoretically works on shapes that are not a Christmas
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:48.480]   tree, our robot.
[02:11:48.480 --> 02:11:52.320]   But I do not know, because I don't know how easy or hard
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:53.840]   it would be to map another shape,
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:55.440]   because I've only mapped it on a string.
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:58.040]   I don't know what other shape you would.
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:01.200]   I have mine in a window right now.
[02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:02.120]   Yeah.
[02:12:02.120 --> 02:12:03.600]   So cool.
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:05.840]   Twinkly.com.
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:07.000]   Super fun.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.440]   Very fun and very expensive.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:12.360]   Jeff, what's your number?
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:14.120]   Well, I have a few, but I'll be quick.
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:16.960]   One is we have to pay attention to this.
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:20.840]   The internet has as many birthdays as it has parents.
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:24.280]   But 50 years ago, I believe yesterday the first message
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:26.520]   was sent on what became the internet.
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:28.520]   And so we should say happy birthday.
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:29.720]   Happy birthday internet.
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:30.220]   Yep.
[02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:31.080]   Yep, yeah, P.P.D.
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:32.520]   October 29.
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:35.400]   And then number two-- so I was at this event
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:40.480]   called the Twitter News Summit, where I was on a panel
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:41.480]   about disinformation.
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:45.280]   And Jack was there, being interviewed by BuzzFeed editor
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:46.320]   Ben Smith.
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:48.160]   One little number that came out of it
[02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:51.200]   was that Jack said that he sets his phone to limit his
[02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:54.200]   Twitter to two hours a day.
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:55.200]   Good, great.
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:57.320]   However, what I really wanted to talk about--
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:00.680]   this is going to get very nerdy, but I'll make it very fast--
[02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:05.080]   is a paper, an academic paper, about the precautionary
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:06.440]   principle.
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:09.120]   That is to say the, oh, something bad could happen.
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:09.520]   There we go.
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:11.400]   We've got to stop and do it.
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:17.240]   So they did a specific study of the Fukushima nuclear accident.
[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:19.360]   And right after that, because everybody freaked out
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:21.200]   for reasons, and they said, we're going
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:24.080]   to get rid of nuclear energy right off the bat overnight.
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:25.800]   Boom, we're out of here.
[02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:30.560]   And so all nuclear power stations ceased operation,
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:33.360]   and the power was replaced by fossil fuels, which
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:37.840]   caused an exogenous increase in electricity prices, going up
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:40.320]   as much as 38% on the average.
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:43.840]   The increase led to a reduction in energy consumption, which
[02:13:43.840 --> 02:13:49.000]   caused an increase in mortality during cold temperatures.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:58.120]   And so in the end, that caused more deaths than Fukushima.
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:01.840]   So there it is the law of unintended consequences.
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:05.240]   And when you operate on the precautionary principle,
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:07.040]   we have to be cautious about this,
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:09.080]   and thinking what bad could happen,
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:12.600]   you could end up causing something worse.
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:14.560]   Oh my gosh, that's like my total argument
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:16.280]   for thinking about and limiting things
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:18.360]   like facial recognition, Jeff.
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:20.440]   That's my argument for not doing it,
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:24.120]   because maybe you don't know how many young children
[02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:28.360]   couldn't be found by the police, and how many criminals could
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:31.320]   kill more people because they couldn't be found by the police.
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:33.600]   And only through time are you going to know.
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:34.560]   So this is where I can--
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:38.160]   It's really hard to map things that don't happen, though.
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:41.400]   Well, it's hard to regulate thinking
[02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:42.800]   that you say things find not happening.
[02:14:42.800 --> 02:14:43.960]   But we're not going to get to this,
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:46.360]   because at the end of the show, people are hungry.
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:47.200]   But--
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:48.200]   That is fun.
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:51.760]   Yes, I'm going to call on this again.
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:54.280]   If you get mad at me for saying moral panic and technopanic,
[02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:58.320]   I'm going to say precautionary principle.
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:00.720]   And I'm going to look at you like this.
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:01.240]   What?
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:02.640]   Yeah, I know.
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:03.680]   Are you going to do?
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:06.080]   It's going to take a while of you saying that for us
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:08.920]   to automatically go, oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:11.160]   It's going to take a little while.
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:12.280]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:13.720]   And what you got?
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:14.800]   I have two things.
[02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:18.120]   I hope you all don't mind, but I'll be quick.
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:19.640]   First and foremost, I know that we've
[02:15:19.640 --> 02:15:22.720]   been talking about this Halloween coming up tomorrow,
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:23.360]   and all of that.
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:25.880]   And we've got our awesome hats on and looking good.
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:28.360]   At least some of us are looking good.
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:31.960]   But October is also Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:37.720]   So be sure to check out the national breastcancer.org website.
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:41.280]   And if you feel the need to donate, send a dollar or two
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:44.160]   to help out with the research.
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:50.080]   Breast cancer is deep in the family here.
[02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:53.120]   Not on my side, but on Queen Pruitt's side.
[02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:56.400]   It's run pretty deep in his effect
[02:15:56.400 --> 02:15:57.360]   that a lot of people there.
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:01.240]   So we take that quite dear to our hearts.
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:07.080]   I've been wearing this band for many years now
[02:16:07.080 --> 02:16:10.840]   out of respect for them and them dealing with it
[02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:12.000]   and fighting through it.
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.160]   So that's out of the way.
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:17.520]   If you can donate a dollar, please go do so now.
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:18.880]   Please and thank you.
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:21.040]   Next up is Nothing But the Arts.
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:26.440]   Last year, North Carolina Central University, historically
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:30.240]   Black College and university there in New York Winston
[02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:31.640]   Salem, North Carolina, I believe.
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:35.000]   They invited me out to sit down and talk with the group
[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.560]   of students about being a content creator.
[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:39.960]   They invited me and a couple of other people.
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:41.880]   And they started this little organization
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:44.320]   to help encourage the students there
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:46.960]   to get into the arts where there's photography, video,
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:49.880]   acting, writing, so on and so forth.
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:51.520]   And it went pretty well.
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:55.360]   And it was nice to see these kids just get inspired
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:57.000]   and go out and start creating content
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.920]   and start collaborating with other artists
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:04.640]   and just trying to build a community there at the school.
[02:17:04.640 --> 02:17:06.280]   So this is their second year and they're
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:09.680]   having their event today, I believe, or maybe it's tomorrow.
[02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:11.640]   But they're having their second annual event.
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:12.960]   Of course, I'm not going to be there
[02:17:12.960 --> 02:17:14.760]   because I'm on the other side of the country.
[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:16.360]   But I wanted to show them some love
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:18.840]   and just give them a shout out because they're
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:19.880]   trying to grow this.
[02:17:19.880 --> 02:17:22.480]   And their website is still a little bit of a work
[02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:24.400]   in progress right now.
[02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:26.280]   But they're trying.
[02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:28.000]   These are little college kids.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.600]   And they're trying really hard.
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:32.000]   And it was great to see the interest
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.280]   that these kids had in the arts, especially
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:36.600]   in the Black community.
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:38.240]   So that's my two things.
[02:17:38.240 --> 02:17:39.920]   Right on.
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:41.440]   Excellent two picks.
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:42.680]   I thought that was a good trick.
[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:44.960]   I just--
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:48.360]   Thank you, Mr. Jarvis.
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:49.720]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:51.600]   And thank you, Am.
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:55.040]   My pick or my tool, whatever you want to call it,
[02:17:55.040 --> 02:17:56.720]   it's more like a trick.
[02:17:56.720 --> 02:17:57.880]   Oh boy.
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:17:58.720]   Google messages.
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:01.640]   So we were talking a little bit earlier about the carriers,
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:04.200]   implementing their own RCS and how
[02:18:04.200 --> 02:18:10.080]   Google's version of RCS in the US has going Google.
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:12.120]   I fire off this thing all the time.
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:14.280]   I don't mean to.
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:16.680]   Anyways, in the US, there isn't a whole lot of support,
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:20.400]   outward support from the carriers, or in fact, none,
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:21.400]   I believe.
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:24.720]   But 9-5 Google posted a walkthrough
[02:18:24.720 --> 02:18:30.280]   on how you can actually activate RCS on your Android
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:33.280]   messages app for these carriers,
[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:36.960]   whether they allow for it or not.
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:40.040]   And it's a very-- it's like a 10-step process.
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:41.560]   It does not take very long.
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:42.960]   It's like a two-minute process.
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:45.640]   You have to download the app off the Play Store,
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:49.720]   and run it, and then delete the storage in the app info
[02:18:49.720 --> 02:18:52.480]   on Android messages.
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:54.200]   You basically have to jump through just a couple
[02:18:54.200 --> 02:18:55.600]   of small hoops in order to do it.
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:58.240]   But at some point, before you do this,
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:01.720]   if you try and go into the chat settings in Android messages,
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:02.960]   it won't even let you go in there.
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:04.600]   Because it's unsupported.
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:06.720]   And after you do this, you're allowed to go in there.
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:09.800]   It says that it's set up as complete, and it's all working.
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:12.000]   So then it's just a matter of connecting with someone else
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:15.720]   that is also using RCS.
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:17.760]   It was really easy.
[02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:20.920]   I know some people that have done it that are not technically
[02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:22.800]   savvy or what have you.
[02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:25.320]   They watched a video from XDA.
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:28.760]   Is it the same video that 9-5 Google is sharing?
[02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:30.800]   Because the one that I saw was from XDA.
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:31.320]   OK.
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:33.200]   And I'm surprised that they would have this as well.
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:34.880]   And it was so straightforward.
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:36.320]   And it didn't take any time.
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:39.840]   Like you said, in these non-tech savvy people that I know,
[02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:41.640]   they did it with the ease.
[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:43.400]   So yeah, anybody can do it.
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:44.760]   If you're interested in that.
[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:45.280]   Yeah.
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:47.480]   So if you want a little flavor of RCS--
[02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:49.040]   and like I said, then the challenge
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:53.120]   is actually messaging with someone who also has RCS.
[02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:55.280]   Because otherwise you're not going to see any differences.
[02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:57.280]   But then once you do that, you're going to see all the--
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:19:57.840]   You'll notice the little--
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:02.480]   --hier as image sharing between people
[02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:04.480]   and like a typing indicator.
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:07.600]   If you're typing the other person will see like the little
[02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:10.520]   dot, dot, dot, to see who you're acting to be typing.
[02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:11.360]   Things like that.
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:13.360]   So cool little walkthrough.
[02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:14.280]   Very easy to do.
[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:18.120]   And you can kind of get on the RCS chat train right now,
[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:20.600]   even though maybe you're not supposed to.
[02:20:20.600 --> 02:20:21.360]   Maybe not.
[02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:23.680]   And maybe Google will like undo this at some point
[02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:24.600]   with the capability.
[02:20:24.600 --> 02:20:25.880]   But for right now, you can do it.
[02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:28.640]   And it's neat that you can.
[02:20:28.640 --> 02:20:30.040]   There you go.
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:34.040]   And with that, we've reached the end of this episode of This Week
[02:20:34.040 --> 02:20:37.080]   in Google, Hats and Wigs Edition.
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:39.440]   This is a lot of fun.
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:41.000]   We'll start with you, Jeff.
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.440]   Anything you want people to know?
[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:43.280]   We're wearing a new bag.
[02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:45.360]   Oh, this is a bag.
[02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:46.360]   All right.
[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:47.840]   At least you're wearing your hat again.
[02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:51.560]   Yeah, this is the shot we need to promote the show.
[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:52.640]   You need to turn it around.
[02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:54.320]   That's what that's for.
[02:20:54.320 --> 02:20:57.120]   So I got two people this week on Facebook.
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:58.720]   Said, what kind of media?
[02:20:58.720 --> 02:21:00.000]   What kind of icebreakers do you like?
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:01.000]   And I told them both.
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:04.000]   I'm the guy who sits in the corner and bonds with everybody
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.400]   else who's growling about freaking icebreakers.
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:16.000]   Jeff Jarvis, the scowl-niest buzzmachine.com.
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000]   See, I think that hat looks good on you.
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:18.560]   It does.
[02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:20.400]   You'd wear it more often.
[02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:21.880]   There you go.
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:24.480]   It just needed to be complimented.
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:26.640]   And Stacey, you can bop him.
[02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:29.560]   It's so easy to do that.
[02:21:29.560 --> 02:21:30.920]   Stacey, thank you so much.
[02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:33.360]   And thank you for being Wigginbotham today.
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:34.200]   Really appreciate it.
[02:21:34.200 --> 02:21:38.480]   Stacey.ioT.com, of course.
[02:21:38.480 --> 02:21:39.480]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:42.280]   And then, of course, you, sir, you brought style to this show
[02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:43.640]   today, and I appreciate it.
[02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:44.320]   I try.
[02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:45.960]   I try.
[02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:47.840]   Thing is, I don't think you do try it.
[02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:48.800]   You can just do.
[02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:49.880]   No.
[02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:50.720]   It just means that--
[02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:51.920]   It just comes naturally for you.
[02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:53.200]   It's definitely an effort.
[02:21:53.200 --> 02:21:55.880]   I usually look like Hank Hill or something,
[02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:59.600]   most of the time, just T-shirt and jeans.
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:02.200]   Well, it works for you, especially when I say dad gum.
[02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:03.840]   Yes.
[02:22:03.840 --> 02:22:06.800]   Dad gum does, yeah.
[02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:09.720]   I'm waiting for that to start proliferating around here
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:11.760]   for others to start taking it to.
[02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:14.160]   Because I can tell you no one said it before you got here.
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:14.600]   Oh, man.
[02:22:14.600 --> 02:22:16.320]   And I've caught myself a couple of times
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:17.000]   wanting to say it.
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:17.520]   Oh, man.
[02:22:17.520 --> 02:22:18.120]   Oh, man.
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:19.960]   I'm leaving my mark there.
[02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:23.080]   Do you say dad gum, not dad--
[02:22:23.080 --> 02:22:24.240]   dad nabbit?
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:26.360]   Don't say dad nabbit.
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:28.480]   Dag nub.
[02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:29.000]   That's it.
[02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:29.640]   Dag nub?
[02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:30.760]   No, dad gum, sorry.
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:32.280]   Dag nub, go ahead, yeah.
[02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:34.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:22:34.240 --> 02:22:35.480]   New show recorded.
[02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:35.980]   Yes.
[02:22:35.980 --> 02:22:36.320]   Yes.
[02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:40.040]   We have focus on photography.
[02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:42.040]   Actually, what was recorded today
[02:22:42.040 --> 02:22:44.000]   was recorded in the future.
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:49.160]   We will be recording again tomorrow, October 31st,
[02:22:49.160 --> 02:22:51.760]   at 9 AM for focus on photography.
[02:22:51.760 --> 02:22:56.760]   Me and my co-host, Mr. Michael Woolsey, also known as Wools.
[02:22:56.760 --> 02:22:58.520]   He's a great photographer here in the area.
[02:22:58.520 --> 02:23:01.680]   We're going to talk a little bit about some photography
[02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:04.600]   related news and just chit chat and have
[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:06.600]   a good time on the mics.
[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:07.960]   Right on.
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:10.120]   Awesome stuff that you're doing there.
[02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:11.200]   Thank you, man.
[02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:12.080]   Thank you, sir.
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:15.720]   And I'm just going to be doing other shows on the network
[02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:17.120]   while Leo is out on Twitter.
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:18.960]   Swiss Army knife howl.
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:19.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:20.840]   That's one nickname.
[02:23:20.840 --> 02:23:23.360]   Hey, that's my Halloween costume.
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:25.600]   That would be a cool Halloween costume.
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:27.360]   Yeah, Tech News Weekly tomorrow.

[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:24.440]   Good luck with the haunted house.
[02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:24.960]   What's Carson?
[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:25.560]   The audience.
[02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:25.840]   Yep.
[02:24:25.840 --> 02:24:26.680]   That's the big thing.
[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:27.160]   How's it going?
[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:29.560]   The haunted house went really, really well.
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:35.160]   We had, in fact, a twit listener came up from San Leandro.
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:37.040]   Oh, nice.
[02:24:37.040 --> 02:24:38.320]   So the haunted house happened.
[02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:38.920]   It's not happening.
[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:40.200]   It happened in Halloween.
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:41.720]   The haunted house happened.
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:42.200]   OK.
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:44.440]   And then Halloween will happen.
[02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:45.000]   OK, cool.
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:45.960]   All right.
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:46.460]   Good.
[02:24:46.460 --> 02:24:48.480]   It's good that you get Halloween off.
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:50.880]   They are working on Halloween.
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:51.920]   Anyways, that's it for this week.
