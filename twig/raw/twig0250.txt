[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, Kevin Marks and Matthew Ingram are here along with Jeff Jarvis.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.560]   Gina has the week off. We'll talk about YouTube's plan to acquire Twitch and why it makes so much sense.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.000]   German publishers have decided they hate Google. They want to break it up.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   And the new head of Google Glass. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   NetCasts you love. From people you trust.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   This is Twig.

[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   It's time for this week in Google. The show that covers Google, the Googleplex, the Googleverse, the Facebookverse, the Twitterverse.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Oh, that's stuff. The cloud. To Jeff Jarvis is here. He just flew in from San Francisco.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And poor guy. You were in San Francisco for a day, less than a day to talk to Google.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I've been talking to Google hours. I calculated. Plus about 20 minutes for a playing problem.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You fly a lot. I do. I am global services. I'll have you know in the middle.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So when they start boarding, I'm that obnoxious prick who was on first.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Yeah. Yeah. I almost want to say, "Hey, where's your wheelchair, Jarvis? Where's your crutches?" Soon enough.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Yeah. Gina's out because her lovely little daughter had enough feeling too well and she wanted to spend some time with the baby while she's under the weather.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   She'll get over that quick enough. But meanwhile, Kevin Marks has joined us.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Always great to have Kevin and his garden.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Nice to see you again. Bird warning. There will be birds.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Oh, indeed birds.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I'm actually sitting in a slight different place than usual because we've got some new garden finishes.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   It's actually gorgeous. I love this. I would show you around the garden finish.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   No, no, no. This is got some really comfy garden on chairs.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Always nice to have excellent armchairs in the garden.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   And from all the way from Canada, Matthew Ingram of Gig Aome fame is here as well.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Nice to have you, Matthew. Thanks for having me.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Boy, we got a great crew for this show today. A lot of fun.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Our top story, the Nest.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Smoke alarm has finally been recalled in dense entirety.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   440,000 smoke alarms for a safety risk.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   24.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Yeah. This is the company Google bought for $3.2 billion. They had two products.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   One was, of course, the famous Nest thermostat.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   The other was a smoke alarm that talked to you and let you wave your arms to disable it.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And apparently that caused a little bit of a problem.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   They halted sales of the alarms last month after recognizing that the temporary silencing feature wasn't so temporary.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   The Nest has to be connected to the Internet and linked to an account for an automatic update.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   So if you have one, make sure that you get the update. You go to Nest Sense.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   This is why, by the way, Internet connected devices are a pain in the keister.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   You have to go to Nest Sense on your account and ensure that the button for Nest Wave is set to off and grayed out.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Those who have not connected their devices to a wireless network and a Nest account should do so.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   The devices will then be automatically updated and consumers should take the aforementioned steps to ensure the update is complete.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Meanwhile,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I guess they're recalling them unless you say, "Well, I downloaded the update."
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I guess they just can't assume that everybody will have the Internet access and so forth.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Customers can contact Nest Labs for more information, 800-249-4280 or visit Nest.com.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Click on the Nest Protect Safety Notice link.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Why am I getting all that really obnoxious?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   ABC.com just redirected me as I went to Nest.com to go somewhere else.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Some crap ad.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   All right, where is it?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I'm looking.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Nest, smoke, alarm, life with Nest Protect.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Watch the video.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I don't see anything about it.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Oh, here it is.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Safety letter from the CEO.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   So at Nest we conduct regular rigorous tests.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   During recent lab testing on the Nest Protect smoke alarm we observed a unique combination of circumstances that caused us to question whether Nest Wave, a feature that lets you turn off your alarm with a wave of a hand, could be unintentionally activated.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   If you want like this.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Hey Chad!
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Hey!
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Hey kids!
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Hey!
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Don't go in there.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   This could delay an alarm going off if there were a real fire.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   We don't know of any customers who have experienced this, but the fact that it could even potentially happen is important.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I think this is good.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   They're telling you what to do.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   You know, you can get it fixed.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Now, here's the question.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Can you buy a Nest Protect anymore?
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   They stopped all sales.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Oh.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Mmm.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Mmm.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Because it was the consumer product association or whatever that recalled it right?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Oh, it's a CPC recall, not.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Oh.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   So yeah, Nest Protect is off the market until they figure this thing out.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I got to say the whole waving thing, when I heard about it, I thought, well, how does it know that you're waving at it?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Maybe you're just running around because the house is on fire.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   What if you're just waving or there's a fly or something?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   No waving, but drowning.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Oh, so, okay.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   So you'd wave and the alarm would say, oh, he doesn't want me to go off.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   But how long does that last an hour?
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   An hour would be bad.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   A minute wouldn't be.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   So I guess forever is what it sounds like.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   You didn't really want me to go off anymore, did you?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   I get to disable.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   That's not a good feature.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   It reminds me of the, maybe we're going to talk about this, but the Google Glass nod to pay with Bitcoin?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Seems to me that could really backtrack.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Do you have that Jeff on yours nod to pay with--
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Oh, hell no.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   You accidentally sneeze in Southern Five, you bought something.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Do you want to pay?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   That seems a little too easy.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Google Glass had nod tips, but you have to--
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   No, this is a feature that Google themselves is offering.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   No, it's a new app that takes mobile payment to a whole new level.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   It's called Ease, maybe a little too easy.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   E-A-Z-E.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   It allows Google users to link to a virtual Bitcoin wallet.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Oh, I actually--
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   All right, Ease is a wallet.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   You activate the Ease app with a voice command.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   Use Google Glass to scan the QR code provided by the store associated with the association.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   The product, once it is scanned ahead nod, completes the mobile payment transaction.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Well, there's a few steps before you have to--
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   That's true.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   But, is it really that hard to pay that we--
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   [laughter]
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   I need it to be harder.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Yeah, not easier.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I don't need Amazon and Google to make it easier.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   No, no, harder, not easier.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   We're glad.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   So he's looking at the QR code.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   He's going to scan a QR code with his eyes.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   [laughter]
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Can't you do that?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Those special purchases and Ease makes accepting payments just as easy.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And you don't look dorky enough with your glass on, so they're going to make you look silly.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Are you still--
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   He still has a girlfriend.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Using positive edge devices that are available to us now.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   It's not a joke, isn't it?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   It has to be.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Here's the QR code as big as you plates.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   [laughter]
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   We live in a world that is indistinguishable from the onion.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Well, there is a parody.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   There's a Nest parody.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   If you look at the bottom of the Google section of the rundown.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Google had it taken down because they didn't have a sense of humor about it.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   What?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Come on.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   I rate it so the third of the bottom.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   Yeah, I see it.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I got it here.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Let me just play the-- this is a parody of the Nest.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Is it gone?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It's sealed.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   So I can't play it.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   It watered down evidently.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   It was at Republica.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   It was a German political activist group.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   It was a parody website posting--
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   --pokey poking fun at Google's products.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Did they have the right to be forgotten?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Apparently Google has that right.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Wow.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   See, I would think Google would bend over backwards at this point to make sure no sites get taken down.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Did it violate trademarks or--
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   I'm not saying that's what the--
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   You could do anything you want.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   I'm just on that.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   You could do anything you want.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I think you're not.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Didn't people in New York a few years ago distribute a fake New York Times as an April Fool's joke?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Yes.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   What did the Times do?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Times was OK in that case.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   I think they made it clear enough.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   But there was a blogger, a well-known blogger, did a New York Times kind of correction site
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   in the New York Times when after him.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   And you know, it's just a reflex of lawyers.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Well, so here's what happens.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   So if you go to google-nest.org now, you get a single candle saying, "Dear Internet,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   this beautiful website has been taken down because Google is worried about the brand
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   and the future of Nest Labs, which is in the business of making creepy products
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   designed to collect even more data from you.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Apparently, they just can't get enough.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   They must have it all."
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   There's a video below.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Let's launch.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Oh, it's Republika.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   It's Republika, which unfortunately I had to cancel.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I was dying to go this year.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   What?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Oh, you didn't cancel because of this.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   No, no.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   If they insult Google, I'm not going.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   I'm boycotting Germany until they get to their senses.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   It's called Google Nest.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Right.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And I would like to introduce two people to show you what this is about.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   This is called Google Nest.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Please welcome Dr. Gloria Spindle and Paul von Riebeck.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Those are phony names that were so mean.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Where did you go?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   They're funny in German.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   I don't know.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   They don't know.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Wow.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   How nice to be here.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Republika for the first time.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   I'm Gloria Spindle.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Not her real man.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   I'm Paul von Riebeck.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Hello.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   It's really amazing to be here.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   So I can see Google would be upset about this because they're kind of building themselves
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   from Google.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Energy and the collective brain power here.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   I was just saying to Paul yesterday, we should be recruiting.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Really?
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   So Max kind of hinted at in the introduction.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   We at Google have actually been thinking --
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Yes, you can't say we at Google.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Even if it's not.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   We see on your program.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   That's kind of impersonating.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Topics like surveillance, privacy, data, Snowden.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   These are issues that are close to our heart as well.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   It's also not funny, which is probably the greatest sin of all.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Google is doing all right.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:19.360]   According to the yearly brand ratings, Adweek says Google is the world's most valuable brand
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.400]   topping apple for the first time.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.000]   This is the brand Z top 100 most valuable global brands.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Apple now number two after Google.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   There's less make no sense.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Having said that, this makes sense.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Google's never raised lives more than Apple's never raised lives.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I mean, they rated on a variety of categories, right?
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Yes.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   I'm sure they'll explain that here.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Yeah, last year we talked about this and I looked it up at how they do it and I forget.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   40% rise in brand value drove Google to the number one position.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   40%?
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   It sounds so scientific.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   The brand has appreciated.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   42%.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.160]   Well, it's appreciated 324% since the inception of the brands E top 100 most valuable global
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.560]   brands list.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.120]   The only brand that really benefits from this is brand Z because right now we're branding
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.120]   it.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.000]   Yeah, brand Z brands.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.960]   Amazon in the top 10 for the first time Facebook second fastest rising brand increasing 68%
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.960]   in brand value.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.960]   Sorry, I have to stop now.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.960]   Moving on.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.960]   Jeez.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.960]   SEC filing.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:43.960]   Google says they're planning international acquisitions worth up to $30 billion.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.520]   They have all this cash overseas.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.960]   They can't repatriate to the US or also pay taxes on it.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   So they got to do something with it.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.960]   Right.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   Google generated about half its revenue in non US markets in 2012.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:02.120]   That money then can't be repatriated to Google US without paying tax US tax.
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.320]   I think that's about half their cash ward.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.960]   They have I think I saw 68 billion plus another 2 billion in long term.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.200]   So that's the number.
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.640]   Waze was an Israeli company.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.040]   So that was a good one.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.040]   Yep.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.080]   Deep mind, they got them.
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.080]   They're in London.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.080]   $400 million.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.840]   Spider.io London.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.240]   Range span also in the UK.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:30.960]   Google told the SEC that it had recently pursued but discontinued a potential buyout of a foreign
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.920]   company with a valuation in the range of four to five billion.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.640]   What do you think it could have been?
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.640]   Spotify.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.640]   Could be.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.640]   Oh.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.640]   Oh.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.240]   Who could that be?
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.240]   Not Beats.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.800]   Who could that be?
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   Twitch.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.420]   Twitch was do we know that there's still that rumor that YouTube is going to buy Twitch
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.040]   although I haven't seen any further confirmation.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.280]   That's not a five billion.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.280]   That's not a four billion.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.280]   Can't be four billion.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.280]   I mean we're talking that's a lot of money.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.840]   That's more than they paid for YouTube itself.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.640]   Hmm.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.280]   Kevin Marks, your international.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.360]   Actually, you're both international.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.200]   Kevin doesn't really.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.440]   That doesn't count.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.160]   Well, but it would count in this, wouldn't it?
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.160]   If it were a Canadian company, it would count.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.200]   What is, let me Google, what is Spotify worth?
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.000]   We don't have anything worth four billion.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.960]   Not RIM for sure.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.840]   Spotify's value tops four billion dollars.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.400]   Oh, good confidence.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.720]   And yeah, yeah, that was last year.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.920]   So there you go.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.800]   That's based on investors and so forth.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.440]   The most in November technology crossover ventures led a quarter billion dollar investment
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:59.800]   round into Spotify that valued them at four billion dollars.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.560]   Up from three billion in the year before.
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.440]   But would Google want Spotify?
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.440]   I would think so.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.240]   Especially if it's true that Apple's buying beats.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.960]   This could be the consolidation of the streaming music business.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.880]   I said this last time.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.520]   I don't understand why Apple isn't buying Spotify.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.520]   I don't understand why.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.520]   Much better than Beats.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.280]   I mean, to me as a service, it's a cash.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.280]   They have double cash.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.280]   The Google house.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:30.680]   But they don't have those income generating headphones.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.080]   Spotify's done nothing but lose money.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.040]   It beats at least makes a billion dollar or generates a billion dollars in revenue a
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.720]   year.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:46.280]   Google also in this SEC filing said that it was considering things like serving ads to
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.280]   your thermostat.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.280]   Please.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.280]   No.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.280]   That choice.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.280]   Please.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:58.800]   Do you think it's had your sweater about now or do you want to spend more money on energy?
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:17:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.760]   Later it said it wasn't thinking about that.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.160]   Oh, it's just as a letter.
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.800]   They wrote a letter to the SEC.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.800]   Hypothetically.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.600]   So hypothetically saying that it could be serving ads and other content to refrigerators, card
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.680]   dashboards, thermostats, glasses, watches.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:22.160]   This is why we shouldn't have to disclose revenue generated from mobile devices.
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.160]   I think it was a dodge, you know, to get around having to disclose their revenue.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.160]   So just pick everything.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.160]   They don't want to break it down.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.320]   They said it doesn't make sense to break up mobile revenue since the definition of mobile
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.320]   will continue to evolve as more smart.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.320]   So it's true.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.320]   Roll out.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.320]   Which is true.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.320]   So yeah, it doesn't mean necessarily they're planning.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.120]   It's more like, hey, we don't know what mobile means or where, you know, what is mobile
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.120]   revenue?
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:49.200]   If we put it on our fridge or is that mobile, if we put it on a thermostat, is that mobile?
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.400]   Pretty sure the fridge is not mobile, but or the thermostat.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.640]   I've never seen anybody carry his thermostat around.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.880]   I think a car for sure.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.240]   Glasses.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.200]   Watches.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.560]   You could see a ways sort of heads up to traffic display on your dashboard.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.560]   That would be super awesome.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.160]   I would put it up with an ad in there.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.160]   I don't know.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.160]   I wasted loaded with ads.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.360]   Every time I stopped the car, I get an ad from ways.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.360]   It's very annoying.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.960]   I don't think that's the way that I don't think that's the value of ways.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.800]   I think the value of ways is more.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.080]   But praise ways.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.360]   I got a Newark airport.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.360]   I stopped.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.360]   I pull out pay.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.360]   I stopped pull over say ways how long an email chad and it was right to the minute.
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.960]   The best thing about one of the best things about GPS is knowing kind of almost exactly
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.960]   when you're going to arrive.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.960]   And most GPSes are good about that now.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.320]   If they have traffic information.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.400]   The problem is you get trapped by Google Maps being useless at searching for things.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:52.840]   I had a job that you're saying, let me find the link.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:58.960]   What happens is if you put a calendar event in and you put the name of the company before
[00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.320]   its address, Google will instead of reading the address out of that location, we'll do
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.560]   a search for the name of the company and send you somewhere else entirely during doing
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.880]   a bad search to name the company.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.880]   I've got to.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.560]   It does ridiculous things like I'll be searching for something that I know is two miles away
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.800]   and it's not sponsored to see that.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.760]   It gives me the same name to place in Utah.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.760]   Right.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.760]   Right.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.760]   Or Italy.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.760]   I've had the same thing.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.760]   Italy?
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:23.760]   Well, or some completely different country or state.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.760]   Wow.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.760]   I mean, it should at least know where I am.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.760]   You would know.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.760]   I've got to the whole point.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.600]   Get the link.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.440]   This is the what I got on my phone yesterday.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.040]   I've got to put it in the chat.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   So it's it.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.480]   I got a Google now alert saying leave now because it'll take you two hours and 44 minutes
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.560]   to cycle to 41 Bryant Street.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.520]   Had you ever been there?
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.040]   Matter three design.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:57.040]   And actually if you search for 41, I just done a search for 41 Bryant Street and it said
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.520]   it was 17 minutes.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.760]   But because Matt Adventures was there was in the thing, it searched for some other place
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.880]   called Ventures that happened to be in Redwood City.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.160]   Well, but it still said it was the same.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.160]   Well, that's very interesting.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.160]   Isn't it?
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.520]   It's like you said this is deeply broken.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.680]   It basically the problem is that Google Maps is really, really bad at search.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.000]   To the point now, I think, Forceware gave out.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.120]   Forceware used to throw across the name of the business and the address.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.560]   And now it throws across the lat long point because it can't trust Google Maps to go to
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.360]   get the place right.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.280]   So this is this is a this is a kind of the event I've got with that that address in it
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:38.400]   and because it was just more than just getting the wrong place because if you know, I could
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.000]   see how it might get the wrong place and then give you not only wrong directions but
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.160]   a wrong time estimate.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.400]   But in this case, it had the actual address.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.400]   Right.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.840]   It ignores the address and I've been ignoring me before.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:54.760]   I had this problem when I went to Philadelphia and I was supposed to be going to pen.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:22:00.280]   So I searched for the I put the address for this place in pen and in bed and it sent me
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:05.920]   to another place with a similar name in another college on the other side of town and not
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:06.920]   name Philadelphia.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.280]   We went over there and it took it an hour to get back.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   So it's so weird.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:15.120]   In fact, in another card, it says it's only 17 minutes.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.120]   Yeah, no, that was it.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.280]   So I literally searched for the address earlier, but it gave me this alert saying it's two
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.920]   hours and 44 minutes away.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.920]   And that wasn't it.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.280]   This wasn't getting my location wrong in new my location.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.280]   Right.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.280]   It's time.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.440]   It had got my location wrong earlier and thought I was in Austin.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:34.960]   But it was it was it was it was I think when I clicked.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.960]   That's just a bug.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.960]   That's a bug.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.960]   That's a bug.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.880]   But it's it's a you know, it's an egregious bug.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.560]   It's it's it's Mr. X.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.680]   And I've had this happened quite a lot before because a lot of you know, you get an event
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.480]   that says the the Maui room at Hotel X or whatever.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.320]   And it finds you a restaurant called Maui that's like nowhere near it.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.240]   That you know that I can understand.
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:03.120]   But what's happened here is is a more of a bug because it knows where you're going.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.560]   But it has somehow gotten directions for somewhere else, even though it has the exact
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.320]   address for your calendar.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.320]   Let me click on the thing again and see what I would address like it.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.920]   I mean, that's just that's a that's a more of a bug.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.320]   I know I can understand how you you know, when you're doing a search for a name of a place
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.600]   it finds one.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.960]   It does it should look for the one closest to you.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.040]   But that's another assumption that may not be true.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.080]   You may actually be planning to go to the other Maui room just because it's closer to
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.080]   it.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.840]   I mean, that's the one you're going to.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:38.240]   But this is just weirder because it has the address.
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.840]   It has a card that's accurate and at the same time it tells you to leave two hours and 44
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.840]   minutes.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.800]   No, no, because it's not actually it's not actually going to the address.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.960]   Right, it's going somewhere else.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.280]   But so it's not matching the leave now to the address.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.160]   So this is just a butts up bug in Google now, I think that's just a bug.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.680]   No, it's not bugging Google Maps.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.080]   So if I if I copy that address and search in maps.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:07.680]   Well, I'm sure that even as we speak, Matt cuts is cutting his run short to file a bug
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.680]   for it.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:14.960]   It is weird that if you so you searched for 421 Bryant.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.240]   So now I searched for Mad Adventures 41 Bryant.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:22.280]   I just got I just did it and it and it found me Peninsula ventures in Redwood City instead.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.280]   There's a bug.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.280]   It's a database bug.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.080]   So it's no, it's not database bug.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.240]   It's a we're ignoring the address and we're searching on the text and then it searches
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:31.240]   for it.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.240]   It didn't even match the text.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.240]   It has one word matching.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.240]   The other one doesn't.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.960]   And then it's decided everything else was, you know, huh?
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.960]   So that happens to you a lot.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.840]   Yeah, it's happens to me a lot of that.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.280]   It generally happens when you when I create a calendar event.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.040]   And then the calendar event has a more detailed thing than just a street address.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.240]   So you've got like 300 or things like that in the address.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.240]   There's more to match.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.840]   It's basically their address parser is useless.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.280]   It prefers the text to the address bus.
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:06.680]   You can have the same effect by pasting an address into Google Maps search.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.680]   Got it.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   Got it.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.480]   So it always, always double check.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.560]   Maybe they should be using urban engines.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:20.920]   Gary Schmidt and Google Ventures just backed a startup called urban engines that wants
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.560]   to solve urban congestion using data intelligence.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.600]   Probably all they saw was, Oh, data intelligence.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.600]   We need that.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.800]   Oh, isn't that ways?
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   Huh?
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.800]   Huda.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.640]   It, uh, well, I think this is public.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.640]   It's a public transit.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:46.680]   Oh, um, if, yeah, public transportation specific.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.640]   Oh, okay.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.880]   Don't take the 22.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.120]   Take the 24.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:26:00.640]   It's using people's swipes as they get on the subway or the bus line as sensors figuring
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.200]   out where people are in the system.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.440]   And it's really sounds like that's weird because they're going to get internet exit points
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.440]   without you.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:11.440]   Don't get rude.
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.520]   Well, they, what they're looking for is how crowded a bus or a train is.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.080]   And I guess they might know something about wait times from that, right?
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.880]   Because that's when they got on.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:26.520]   Well, I mean, every subway system I've used has like a swipe point at the station you
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:28.360]   get on the swipe point station, get off.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:29.360]   Right.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.720]   Well, maybe I'll always look at the get off one.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.840]   I knew you all makes you swiping the way out.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.200]   New York, New York only makes you swipe the way in.
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.200]   You put a token in the thing.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   So it doesn't know where you're going.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.200]   So they wouldn't have it.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.760]   Whereas, you know, Oyster in London makes you swipe entry and exit.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.320]   And they've put some interesting things without data before.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:53.080]   And the, the clipper here lets you, it makes you tap on, you don't have to tap off at exit,
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.360]   but if you don't, it assumes you went to the end of the line, which is okay if you're going
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.360]   north, but if you're going south, it thinks you want to go right, rather than say, even
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.360]   though it's not possible.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.280]   So I, it ends up charging next to $4 if you forget.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.360]   It's getting worse in Germany now.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.480]   Oh, it's getting lower.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:16.480]   Now the latest insult German officials say we must seriously consider breaking Google
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.480]   up.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.920]   Three politicians are doing this.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:25.640]   Yeah, I was talking to a German, a Google guy was yesterday today.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.760]   What I want to say is it a mountain view and yeah, it's a cynical political act, but
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.240]   there's a lot of that going on.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.240]   They can't break it up.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.960]   It's a US company.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.760]   Well, I know, but it's a cynical political act.
[00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.720]   That's what the nature of it doesn't really reality.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.400]   No, they can, they can, they can do interest rules for their European health.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.400]   Well, that's what he said.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.880]   It's Sigmar Gabriel, who is a Germany's minister for the economy and vice chancellor.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.640]   So it's like a big shot here and he's writing an op-ed piece in the Frankfurter al Ammania
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.640]   Zeitung.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.840]   Did I say that right?
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.600]   Frankfurter al Ammania Zeitung.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.840]   Which is a big daily newspaper.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:00.840]   Zeitung.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.840]   Zeitung.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.840]   Zeitung.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:03.840]   Zeitung.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.840]   Tsunami Zeitung.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.840]   Zeitung.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:06.840]   Zeitung.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.840]   You're spitting.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.640]   Cool whip.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.240]   He writes German.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:19.200]   He writes a breakup of the kind that has been carried out for electricity and gas grids
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:24.200]   must be seriously considered here, but only as a last resort.
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.280]   I imagine him wagging his finger.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.160]   That's why we're focusing on antitrust style regulation and internet platforms.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:36.280]   I think breaking up Google, especially for, not even, but there are US companies, he seems
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.280]   going a little far.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.960]   Well, well, but then went for, you know, EU went after Microsoft as well.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.120]   Then below that, the rundown, we also have a cynical coalition of German and French
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.400]   publishers led by actual Springer, which is the company that wrote this horrible,
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:55.400]   Larry's trying to create a new universe op-ed in the same newspaper.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.720]   I pre-ad yesterday that they should just name the paper the Brigadoon Daily because
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.360]   it doesn't want to change anything.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.360]   So they're trying to get the EU to reject the settlement that they've made with Google
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.640]   about trust.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.960]   The EU official said, "Polem de Gabon."
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.800]   This is the open internet project manifesto.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.600]   Sounds great.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.880]   The Paris Declaration.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:24.400]   European consumers and digital entrepreneurs demand ban of Google's manipulative favoring
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.440]   of its own services and content.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:33.080]   It is a matter of worldwide importance to search engine monopolist Google.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.360]   Wow, over 90% market share.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.080]   If a business cannot be found online, it cannot compete.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.280]   The root of the problem is Google.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.200]   I actually have said this for a while, that Google shouldn't be in the content business.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.200]   And who was it?
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.200]   Was it Vimeo or no?
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   Daily motion was complaining.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:51.680]   Daily motion, the European YouTube, that when you search for video, they never show
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.160]   up, YouTube always shows up a Google company.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.640]   Is that not the case?
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.640]   What is Google's response to that?
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:00.520]   Well, if I go to Vimeo and I search for a video, does YouTube show up?
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.520]   But you're on Vimeo.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.520]   Well, that's the point.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.400]   Google's supposed to be a search engine.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.400]   If I go to actual sprayer, we'll meet you.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.400]   That's not true anyway.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.400]   You need to be in the media.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.880]   And I search for their competitor.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.080]   Do I find their competitor?
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:11.080]   No.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.240]   Well, whenever I search a stock listing, I get Yahoo first and give you a second.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.240]   Yeah, as it should be.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:21.600]   That's the problem is that is Google a search engine company or a content company?
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.480]   Can it be both?
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.640]   It's a company.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.440]   And it could be...
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:32.320]   Well, then we should stop using it as a search tool because they're not agnostic search results.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   But if you look at Google, you're not agnostic.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:40.400]   No, I did a search for Net Neutrality set to video.
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.280]   And I get some YouTube results.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.000]   I get Yahoo result top.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.480]   I get New York Times.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.120]   I get Colbert report.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.840]   But YouTube is just a hell of a lot bigger than Vimeo.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.560]   So, you know, if you're trying to search for Vimeo, they're watching Vimeo folks.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.560]   Sorry to say it to you.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.560]   Well, let's...
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.560]   They do index Vimeo.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.560]   I mean, if...
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:03.320]   I think it's Daily Motion, not Vimeo that was complaining, which is...
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.000]   Daily Motion is very big.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.960]   I mean, they're bigger than Vimeo.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.400]   Nothing's as big as YouTube.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.400]   No.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.400]   I don't know.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.800]   It's always bothered me a little bit.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.840]   You've got all this is going on in Germany.
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.400]   You have the...
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.400]   Let's break them up.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.400]   You have the...
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.760]   Let's reject their antitrust.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:27.560]   You have the effort to forbid them to share data across their services.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.560]   We talked about last week.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:33.600]   And then at the EU level, of course, you have the right to be forgotten stuff on top of the
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   street view stuff and all those other things that are going on.
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.800]   It's just it's gotten absurd over there.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.320]   And, you know, I was arguing to their policy guys that they should be fighting more.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.760]   The policy, you know, all these policy guys in these companies, because, oh, no, we'll
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   pull back a little bit.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.080]   And I understand why they say that.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.440]   And they're in those trying to find some peace.
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.040]   I understand why they say that.
[00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.240]   But at some point, they've got to start fighting, I think.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.880]   Well, I love Google anyway.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.440]   And I want to tell you why in a moment.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:05.840]   I just did something that makes me love them even more.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.920]   Ooh, ooh, but for ziprecruiter.com.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:16.560]   If you are you hiring, if you're a company or an HR representative or just a small business
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.880]   that needs great team members, what do you do to find the best candidates?
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.240]   There are, you know, how many dozens of job boards out there?
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.240]   Who knows which one's going to produce the best talent.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.760]   Ideally, if you wanted to fill that position fast with the exact right candidate, you'd
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.880]   need to post on all of the top job sites.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.920]   Well, that's the whole point is ziprecruiter.com.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:41.840]   You post to more than 50 job sites with a single click plus.
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:46.560]   Social networks like LinkedIn and Facebook and Twitter and Google+.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.480]   Ziprecruiter also makes it look better because they will post, they will add your company
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:56.040]   logo and colors to your posting to make your job pages, you know, an extension of your
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:57.040]   business.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.320]   You can add unlimited users to your account, create an instant job page on your website,
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.080]   include a company careers page to use as a careers link.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.680]   You post once and watch the qualified candidates roll into ziprecruiter.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.200]   It's easy to use interface.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.640]   They will actually automatically highlight the best candidates.
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.120]   That is so sweet.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.360]   You screen them, rate them and hire the right person fast.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.960]   We used it and we were really thrilled to rid this out.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.840]   So we got a free trial for you for four days.
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.960]   If you visit ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:35.680]   If you're doing it in the hiring, you need ziprecruiter.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.160]   Ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:43.840]   Since Gene is not here, we're not going to do the exact change log, but I think we will
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.640]   talk about a few new things in Google.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:50.440]   And the one that I'm really most excited about is this new Google.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.640]   I guess it's a Google+ feature, the new stories.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.640]   Yes, that is.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.040]   It's really cool.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:01.560]   See, it's hard not to love Google when they just give you stuff like this out of the blue.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.000]   That's their plan.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.480]   That's their evil plan.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.480]   The evil plan to give you stuff that's cool.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:10.640]   Hey, if this is evil, I want more of it.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.480]   So what they do, if you've been posting as I have been for some time pictures on Google
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.480]   Plus, they will turn them.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.480]   Here's how you get to it.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:22.800]   You go to the photos section on your Google+ menu and then in the drop down under more,
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:27.560]   there's this new one called Stories along with albums, Autoawesome and so forth.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:32.840]   Stories are auto-generated stories of trips, of things you did.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:38.400]   This is our cruise that we did in October because by the way, I have stories going back
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.600]   to 2007, seven years.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.520]   I mean, it's amazing.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:46.880]   So this is now, I renamed it Adriatic Cruise.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.520]   This is a 19-day story.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.800]   This was all auto-generated.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.720]   You can go in and you can caption photos.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.960]   You can edit the photos using Google's edit tools and so forth.
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.160]   But these are all pictures that were posted on Google Plus.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.720]   You have some control.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   It knows where you are.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.600]   This is using that same broken system that you were just talking about, Kevin Marks.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.000]   But it does at least attempt to know where you are.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:16.480]   And we were debating exactly how you said the journal would do, here's a St. Mark Square.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.720]   They would do some photo recognition.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.200]   They would say, "Oh, that's St. Mark Square."
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.320]   Except the result I'm getting is the hotel we stayed in.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.120]   So that could be, I guess, from a check-in.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.800]   It could be from location information from my phone.
[00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.200]   It could be embedded in the picture.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:36.680]   But of course, the name of the hotel is an embedded, just the GPS locations.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.160]   So these are the nearby other things.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.760]   And you can drop it down and choose another one.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.760]   This actually...
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.760]   It's the same thing for me.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:43.760]   It showed...
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.600]   I was in Italy recently and it pulled up a photo in it.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:52.920]   It identified what was in the photo properly, but up above, it had sort of the nearest,
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.400]   I don't know, cafe or something.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.120]   So I can't remember whether I checked in there or...
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.120]   So it's not exactly fair.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.960]   It's kind of fair when someone else's house and it picks some nearby business instead of
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:02.960]   what I was thinking.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.960]   Right.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.960]   If I use my son's...
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.960]   It's all wrong.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.960]   Sorry.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.240]   I have a problem photos that I took last year and it made a nice little thing for those.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.120]   But the location was like, "That's not actually where I'm going to go."
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.120]   It could fix it.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.120]   I mean, you can fix it.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.120]   They've got editing cable.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.120]   I have to say...
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.080]   I'm really fond of the...
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.680]   You could choose what moments are in the story.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.680]   You can...
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.080]   It's a very nice piece of work.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.400]   This is basically auto...
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.040]   What I'm showing you now is completely auto-generated with the city.
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:34.040]   In fact, I couldn't remember some of the locations my pictures were from.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:39.480]   So it was actually a blessing because it told me where I was when we took these pictures.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.480]   It shows the travel.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.400]   It's nice traveling animations.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.400]   Isn't that nice?
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.440]   Now, it doesn't apparently understand that I did that over water.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.400]   So really, we were in a boat and we sailed around.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.160]   It just does kind of a generalized...
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.360]   In the end, Indiana Jones stuff.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.360]   But still, that's cool.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.360]   I mean, this was free.
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.800]   I wish it would give you the option to plot all those locations on the map.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.400]   I wanted to do that just to remember some of the places I'd been to.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:11.840]   You can get that out of the location history thing.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.920]   But I was definitely not at the budget rent a car.
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:14.920]   I was at the beach.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.920]   Can you plot it though?
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.920]   I can...
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.280]   Do you want to do it quite easily?
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:22.280]   The Google location stuff used to do that.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.360]   What was the name of that service used to do that?
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   Location history.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.360]   It would plot your movements around.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.360]   Okay.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   But I don't...
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:34.680]   Because someone said if you uploaded them to, I don't know, Panoramio or something, it
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.320]   would do it, but it didn't work.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.880]   I have the dullest one imaginable.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.960]   I was at a conference at the Gates Foundation and I was just me taking pictures of people's
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.960]   slides.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.360]   Well, they're not all...
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.200]   They can only work with what they're given.
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.200]   It can't work badly.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.200]   I've got...
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.200]   I've got...
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.200]   I've got...
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.200]   I've got...
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:02.160]   I've got like 20 minutes, 30 minutes of people playing hockey.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.920]   And it's not very good at picking the hardheads out of those at all.
[00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.920]   It doesn't...
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:10.520]   Clearly, it should look for when everyone's cheering or something and find the goals, but it doesn't.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:13.320]   It just shows you random bits of people going fast.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:18.280]   What's interesting about this to me is that Bill Gross talks about the problem.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.240]   One of the businesses he talks about launching is the one to solve the problem of too many
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.080]   photos.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.840]   And us going...
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.920]   Just as Google treats Gmail and we're not going to get the empty inbox, we're not going
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:36.000]   to get to organized picture albums like my wife has woefully done over the years of the
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.080]   family, right?
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:42.800]   So how are they going to take signals and get nearer to that of organizing too many photos?
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.640]   And that's what this is really about.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.640]   So I just...
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.280]   Oh yeah, I forgot about this photo.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.280]   I forgot about that photo.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:52.480]   And it surfaced them in a way that gave them more value.
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.400]   And I think they're far closer to doing than just about anybody.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.040]   You might think I photo...
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.680]   Apple should be able to do that.
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.920]   As far as I can tell, they're not even trying.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.920]   All the photo enhancements that...
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.480]   Apple doesn't know the way Google does me.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.480]   Right.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.360]   And all the photo enhancements they've added, like the one where it creates an auto panorama,
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.560]   it created a bunch of panoramas from my trip that I didn't even realize...
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:15.560]   I know.
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:18.200]   ...that I had taken all those pictures in a row.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:22.200]   And I think they're holding back because they could do face recognition.
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   They could do more and I bet they will over time.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.920]   And I hope they do because I would like to be able to see all of the photos of my daughter
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.440]   over the last 15 years.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.760]   Well, I can't go through and tag every single photo of her.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:37.080]   I think that would take years.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.680]   So I just don't do it.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.520]   But if someone could do it for me, that would be a huge, huge favor.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.520]   I think just...
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.280]   I thought the Germans were all going to say, "That's creepy.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:47.520]   It knows your daughter.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:48.840]   It knows how she grows."
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:49.840]   Right.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.840]   Well, the...
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.520]   What's it called?
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.720]   Picasso used to do it.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:59.400]   The Picasso client, you do the facial recognition with it and then you tell who people are.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.400]   Right.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:06.440]   And then it had a bunch of things that it would do like time lapses or merges of different
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.800]   images of that person and things like that.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:15.160]   So basically, it would do you like a slideshow where it aligned the face and made the background
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.160]   move behind them.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.640]   So there was some quite neat stuff that was built into that.
[00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:23.360]   I haven't actually used that for a bit, but that was impressive.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.880]   And I know Facebook has tried to do some too.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:33.200]   When I upload photos, it tries to do face recognition, but I need to give someone 30
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:38.280]   gigs of photos and say, "Just auto-recognize everything in here, please."
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   Well, that's what's the fun thing about this is I've been apparently uploading photos because
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.320]   this does include Picasso since 2007.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.720]   So there are a ton of albums here.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:54.720]   I can only imagine what the total aggregate CPU and server usage is for doing stuff like
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.960]   this.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:00.920]   Is this because Google, like H&R Block, has extra computing time and they said, "Well,
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.560]   what else could we use those servers for?"
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.560]   But do they do, yeah.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.560]   Yeah, some slack.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.560]   Imagine they do.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.560]   What's the problem?
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:07.800]   How do they allocate that?
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.400]   That's really interesting processing time they have and how they throw the stuff in.
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.760]   I mean, to put this together and they do it instantly, it seems like.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.400]   They have a budgeting model internally for computer time and you can do priorities to
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.400]   explain what you're doing.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:24.200]   So something like this, they'd run it as a low priority job in the background, you know,
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.680]   behind search indexing and things.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:33.200]   But internally, there's a budget system that you apply for machines for your project for.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.800]   So they would have had to have a debate to get this.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.400]   Is there a bureaucracy that adjudicates that?
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.400]   Well, that was when I was there.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:45.760]   But I mean photo recognition stuff, you can chop that up into little bits and do it in
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.120]   the background in between milliseconds between...
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.440]   Well, this is all chopped up in these cross-modable machines.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:57.160]   I mean, the challenge for the photo and the video stuff is moving the data around.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.400]   You don't actually want to spread it across lots of servers.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.160]   You want to make it near the data.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:05.480]   Because the actual, the really computer intensive stuff is the stuff they do with YouTube where
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:10.440]   they do the image analysis of every frame and then dewobble them and...
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:11.440]   That's amazing, isn't it?
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:12.440]   I like writing things like that.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.440]   But that was...
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:18.440]   And I was saying that I was doing like shooting with the phone handout shots of my son playing
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.120]   hockey and then, you know, they're not great.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.520]   But the thing is, it's a 1080p camera.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.080]   So you can feed it through YouTube and it just takes all the wobble out.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:32.560]   And it looks like, you know, I'm sitting there with a phone in gimbal doing that.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.360]   It's pretty quite impressive.
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:41.240]   Google now is adding Bill Reminder integration into its cards.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.240]   So if it's...
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.880]   I guess it's from email, it sees you get bills in your email and it'll say, "Hey, that
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.880]   bills do."
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.800]   It's called a wife.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.800]   It's creepy.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:55.040]   Hey, Leo, do you remember the power went out last month when you didn't pay the PG&E bill?
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:59.800]   I think you really should consider paying it now.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   Would save me some embarrassing...
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:06.400]   It's the thing from last week where they tell you how to cancel your subscription.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:14.400]   They're rolling this stuff out fast now, aren't they?
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.480]   You know the pace will accelerate because the artificial intelligence minds that run
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:24.080]   Google are now teaching themselves and they're going to get fed.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.280]   Yeah, they're self-aware, they're self-aware.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.720]   Well, yesterday when I spoke at Google about privacy before me, Ray Kurzweil spoke...
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.240]   Oh, that must have been fun.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.240]   It was fun.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.240]   It was fun.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.240]   I presume it's not awful.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.240]   What did he say?
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.400]   Well, just the stuff you'd expect him to say, talking about his theories about all this.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.720]   And somebody asked them whether, you know, you're going to get this kind of the ultimate
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.720]   creepy question.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.560]   Are we going to get to the point where Google...
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:46.560]   Where the computer...
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.360]   Because if your cognitive sense is in the cloud and it knows what you know and so on
[00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.040]   and so forth, will it anticipate what you want before you want it?
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.680]   And they got a laugh and he said, "No, because you're going to change and we're never going
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.680]   to get to that point."
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   Right.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:02.240]   So we found the limits of the singularity, I think, which is comforting.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.240]   Thank goodness.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.240]   Yes.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.160]   Because all because humans change.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:11.040]   But the machines won't like that, so that's another reason for them to get rid of this.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.600]   Part of the argument too is that if our...
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.160]   In the singularity, our consciousness...
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.640]   I'll get this all screwed up.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.360]   But far consciousness is allied with machines.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.840]   The machines will get faster and faster and faster, but machines can't anticipate the
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.880]   machines.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.880]   Machines will be faster than any way.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.880]   I'm not coming up.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:30.360]   Well, you should watch triangulation we did on Monday with a guy named James Barrett.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:38.000]   He's a documentarian who did a lot of interviews, including Kurzweil, Peter Norvig, who is Google
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.040]   CTO, or he's very, very smart guy.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:46.280]   And his book is called "Our Final Invention, Artificial Intelligence and the End of the
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:48.720]   Human Era."
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:56.200]   And basically, he said, "These machines start designing themselves as over for humans,
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.120]   so we've got to start planning for this now."
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:04.280]   And a lot of Google people quoted in here, because apparently Google is kind of aware
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.280]   of this.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:08.640]   Kurzweil, I asked Kurzweil about this years ago.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.800]   He said, "Oh, don't worry.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.120]   Machines are going to be smarter than us, but they're going to think of us as their parents,
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.120]   so they aren't going to wipe us out.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.120]   They're just going to tolerate us."
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.120]   Yeah, sure.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.120]   That'll happen.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.680]   No one ever goes on badly with their parents.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.680]   Because that would be appropriate.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.840]   Barrett is not an AI researcher, but he talked to an awful lot of them.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:33.720]   I told him, my experience interviewing people like Jeff Hawkins and Ray Kurzweil is all
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:39.720]   pretty sanguine about the ideas that machines are going to be smarter than us, but it's
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:40.720]   no big deal.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.840]   He said, "Well, you're talking to the wrong guys, because about 80% of the AI researchers
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:50.080]   I talked to said, this is a crisis that's going to hit us in this century, because there's
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:55.320]   no reason for these intelligent machines to just let us live.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:56.320]   Why?"
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.560]   What about the three laws?
[00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.120]   I asked him about that.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.800]   He said, "That was a fictional device."
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.000]   And by the way, remember all the stories?
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.240]   Asimov's three laws are included in, and it badly.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.240]   True.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:11.920]   We forget that part.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.240]   I think I robot was the best.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:17.160]   The computers had to enslave us to save us, because we were killing ourselves.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   Right.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.160]   They obeyed the law.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.800]   They were doing us a favor.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:24.080]   It was a very interesting interview.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.800]   That's all I can say, and you should watch a triangulation this week.
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:28.800]   And I don't know what to say.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:32.000]   I mean, basically he said, "You can't stop it.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.160]   So what we should do is spend some energy now thinking about it."
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:42.040]   There's even debate among researchers whether we should go full speed ahead towards this
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:44.240]   singularity.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:48.520]   He says, "The people who believe that think, what we should do is make these machines smart
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:54.320]   now before we're too smart and we'll give them too many weapons, too many tools.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:58.920]   If these machines achieve super intelligence now, they won't have things like nano tech,
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.360]   but if you wait 20 years, they'll have nano tech.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:10.640]   They'll have all this stuff and they just go flick us away.
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.880]   You guys got nothing to say?
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.880]   You don't want it to be.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:13.880]   No.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:14.880]   I'm kind of depressed now.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:18.400]   It's very depressing, but he says, he says, but I think he's wrong.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.400]   It's not too late.
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.240]   I think he's wrong.
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:26.200]   Meanwhile, Google's added bill reminders into our Google Now guards, which is handy.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:31.320]   We are the frogs in the boiling pot of water.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.320]   But you were right.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:34.120]   You made a good point about Google.
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:39.800]   It keeps offering you these free things that are super useful and really appealing.
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.360]   So you're like, "Yeah, this is great.
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:42.360]   I'm going to do this."
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.360]   You're about to complain about that?
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.600]   It gets you across the creepy line.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.600]   Right.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.600]   Google Now is perfect.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   It's not the creepy line.
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.160]   No, no, but so Google Now follows me.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.440]   They're going to burn you an effigy when the machines take over.
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.640]   They're going to go, "It was Jarvis's fault."
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:01.520]   But it gives you such cool things that you get sucked into it.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.520]   Right.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.520]   It's the candy.
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:09.040]   Savina's flight trap.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.800]   So your wife gave you a nice dinner before you got married and fell in love with her.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:14.560]   Well, there's going to be some reason for this.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:21.000]   Well, yeah, but my wife doesn't have 800,000 servers at her disposal.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.560]   No, she's got something better.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.440]   She's got a white spray.
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:29.320]   And you know, Fost had a pretty good deal, too, right?
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.320]   Who?
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:31.320]   Fost.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:32.320]   Fost got a good deal.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:33.320]   Have you ever had the transient bargain?
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.880]   That seems like a good deal.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.880]   Fost got a good deal.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.880]   Sure.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.880]   Until, you know.
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:38.880]   Sure.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.520]   Until the thermostat stopped working and the house burned down.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.080]   Google turned down the thermostat.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.160]   I'm afraid I can't do that, too.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.000]   I'm sorry, Dave.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.440]   You're merely a human, Dave.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.600]   Have you seen the...
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.600]   It's not HP.
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.920]   It's not the other company that makes thermostats.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:53.920]   First alert.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:54.920]   Honeywell.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:55.920]   Honeywell.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:56.920]   Honeywell.
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.920]   Honeywell's ever has like crazy.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.280]   They're listening, talking, and thermostat now.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.320]   We can make our thermostat talk, too.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:05.080]   It's not that hard.
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:09.120]   I now have this flash of every appliance in my house is talking to me.
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.680]   One of my attention.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:11.680]   I don't know.
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.680]   The toast is done.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:13.680]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:14.680]   Is it a little hot in here?
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:18.640]   You know, it's not good for you when you set the thermostat higher than 67.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.400]   You should put a sweater on, Joe.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.400]   You should put a sweater on, Jeff.
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.400]   The environment.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.880]   Do you want to destroy the Earth?
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.280]   You don't want to hurt planet Earth.
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.680]   I still need it.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:32.640]   We need Selenium for our switches.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.000]   Open the pod bay doors.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.720]   No, no, Jeff.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.960]   Anything else in the change log?
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:43.360]   There was a lot of stuff, but it wasn't like I didn't go crazy over it.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.360]   Google Play is accepting PayPal.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.360]   On the Android Leo?
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.360]   Change log like.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.680]   Nine wowsy new features for Google plus an Android.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.680]   Is that a word?
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:53.680]   Wowsy?
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.680]   I did.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.680]   It's not wowsy.
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:56.680]   It's my fault.
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:57.680]   We saw the Auto Awesome stories.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.680]   That was one.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:49:59.680]   Auto Awesome movies.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:01.400]   Auto Awesome movies.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.040]   You can create animated GIFs.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.240]   Let me let's just show you an example.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:10.680]   So is an Auto Awesome movie will take your movies kind of like the HTC Zoe highlights
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:12.440]   feature and turn them in.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.440]   I don't think I have any of these yet.
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:19.040]   This is the way it makes really bad ones from really bad musical.
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.040]   Right.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.120]   Yeah, these are not.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:25.160]   I'm sorry, but this is unusually good, but Google made this one.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.160]   Sure.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:30.840]   And for mine is it's like I've got hockey games and I've got a lot of concerts.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:35.080]   So it makes these like cut ups that mess up the music or mess up the order of flowing
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.080]   the game.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.080]   What?
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:44.400]   So in order to see these, you've got to go to photos and then it would be under.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:48.760]   Auto Awesome, or would it be under videos?
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:53.720]   I think you have to look at an order awesome and then it shows the video ones as well.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:59.360]   Maybe not.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.480]   Let's go with two videos.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:07.640]   Yeah, no, I don't.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:08.640]   I can't tell.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.480]   Oh, they would have like a little thing on them.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.880]   It'll like a magic icon that's very dust icon on them.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:15.880]   All right.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:20.360]   Well, the ones I actually have seen these now as I remember and they're not.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.360]   They're not.
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:22.360]   Okay, here's what it made.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:23.360]   Here's what it made.
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.360]   This was a v-ster.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.360]   No, that's not it.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.360]   Isn't it?
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.720]   Oh, that's a motion auto awesome.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.720]   Okay.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.560]   I want a video auto awesome.
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.360]   I guess I don't have any.
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.000]   So disappointed.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.800]   It is kind of cheesy, especially some of the music.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.960]   I'm really talking in snow ones.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.400]   The hassle off was good.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:47.400]   All right.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:48.400]   Well, let's see.
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.200]   We'll go back to the article and see what else is new.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:51.680]   There's a lot of things.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.680]   No, that's for sure.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.320]   Yeah, there's a lot of things there.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.920]   There's a lot of new stuff.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.560]   Uh, where did I put the audio?
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:00.560]   There we go.
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.360]   Says it supports large photo libraries now.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:09.040]   You can create animated GIFs, photo booth style images on demand, just tap the new plus
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.840]   button in photos and select either motion or mix.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:12.840]   That's great.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:16.800]   There's some times when I wanted to put photos together and you try to encourage auto awesome
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:22.640]   to do it for you and now you're manual awesome.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.640]   Just try.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:24.640]   Okay.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:28.240]   So now you can scroll through all the photos as well as highlights by date.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:33.760]   Profiles now display total content views on both Android and the web.
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.360]   So you can see how many people are looking at your stuff.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.560]   A new navigation menu makes it easy.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:40.560]   This is Steven Groves post here.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.400]   Actually, Dave Bessbres.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.640]   He reshared Dave Bessbres.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:49.000]   And Dave Bessbres is the guy in charge now at Google plus.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.840]   Uh, no, that's he took over from big.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:53.840]   That's bad.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.840]   Right.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:55.840]   Right.
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.840]   He took over from a Vic.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.840]   I was trying to think of Dave was not his name because it was Bess, but the other.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.840]   Bess.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:01.240]   We call him Bess.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:04.920]   You follow Bess if you want to know what's new and different and exciting.
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.080]   Wow, that's a lot of new features.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.320]   It goes on and on.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.600]   I'm telling you, maybe, maybe it was good that Vic left.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.680]   Maybe Vic was in the road block on this.
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:18.760]   Well, and like he like Dave got all this done in, in 10 days.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:19.760]   Right.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   He did.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:23.320]   It's been, it's been in the, it's been in the hop.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:27.200]   So the, the new app will roll out gradually to Google play.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.840]   If you haven't got it yet.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:30.840]   I haven't checked.
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.840]   See if I have it yet.
[00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:32.840]   I haven't.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.320]   I didn't have it yesterday, but I may have it now.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.880]   A new Google Glass app.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.760]   Let's say no, we talked about that, the nod.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:43.680]   Uh, Google Maps adds elevation profiles.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.920]   This is kind of cool.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.840]   When you're on a bike route, it'll tell you how bad it's going to be.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.360]   I was trying to get that to work and now Google Maps says it can't find my house.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:54.000]   It does not like you, Kevin.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.160]   If I'm going to come in with other countries, Kevin.
[00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.460]   You've been deleted.
[00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:00.240]   I think this is, this is pretty cool.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.240]   I don't, but you.
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.240]   I do like that bike route.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.240]   I use that a lot.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.880]   Um, and it'll show you the elevation that you're going to go over.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.720]   It only shows you it on the computer, not on the phone.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:13.280]   Oh, actually on my bike on a, in the San Francisco street, I have to get off my bike,
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.280]   get my laptop out.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:21.200]   But before you leave, you look at it and you see if you want to go that way.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:22.200]   Right.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.200]   Right.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.160]   It seems that, yeah, that by the time you're on your bike, you probably know what the elevation
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.160]   is.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:31.980]   I would be handy if it was on the phone because I rented a bike in San Francisco and I did
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.460]   not plan my route.
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:34.460]   Right.
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:38.380]   And I'm basically going, you know, vertical to first.
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:39.380]   Yes.
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:42.100]   You want to do that.
[00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:45.340]   I did something even dumber, dumber Matthew when I lived in San Francisco.
[00:54:45.340 --> 00:54:47.100]   I bought a moped.
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:48.100]   Nice.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:50.540]   But I can't get up the hills, right?
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:53.420]   You have to walk this heavy thing up the hill.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:54.420]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:55.420]   Right.
[00:54:55.420 --> 00:54:57.460]   That's weird.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.400]   You need a more powerful moped.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.720]   So you tell me that Vespa can't go up those steep hills.
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:04.820]   I think he only shows you profiles if they're quite long routes.
[00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:06.940]   Oh, show me ones around town ones.
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:10.200]   But if I say I was cycle for Santa's eight, it sounds just good.
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:11.200]   Give me it.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.200]   Yes.
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.200]   Can't get out of here.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:17.560]   I figured out how to wipe out about three quarters of the population of San Francisco
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:18.560]   if you want to.
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.560]   Just make it snow.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:23.560]   Well, that was the thing about the.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:25.560]   This white stuff on the telegraph.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:26.560]   Ew.
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:32.260]   That was the comment in the Google self driving car story last week is that they can.
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:35.260]   They've never driven in snow and they get very confused by rain.
[00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:37.460]   It's like these are clearly by Californians.
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:42.860]   Yes, but Volvo says by 2017 you're going to be driving itself, driving car.
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.900]   Seattle, apparently.
[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:46.660]   That's not good.
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:49.420]   Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:50.820]   I love Shutterstock.
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:57.140]   You can see who uses images, whether it's on a menu in your blog posting, in your presentations,
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:58.980]   you should know about Shutterstock.com.
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:04.660]   I know there are many competing companies offering you royalty free images, but Shutterstock
[00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:13.020]   has an amazing selection, 37,268,513 royalty free stock images.
[00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:17.980]   They added 270,000 new stock images this week alone.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:22.660]   All beautifully curated, many from professional photographers and artists.
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:28.100]   But this is the thing, in my opinion, it sets Shutterstock aside from everybody else.
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:31.500]   They have the best search anywhere.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.500]   Really, really sophisticated.
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:34.500]   Okay.
[00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:37.180]   So let's say Jeff wants to illustrate privacy.
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:40.100]   Normally, you couldn't, privacy is not a thing.
[00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.980]   How do you search for privacy?
[00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:44.500]   But if you all look at that, there you go.
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:46.100]   Privacy, privacy, privacy.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:51.860]   Now, let's say you want to search for German privacy.
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:52.860]   I don't know.
[00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:53.860]   Is it going to find anything?
[00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:54.860]   I don't know.
[00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:55.860]   Let's find out.
[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:56.860]   Yes, it did.
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:58.380]   It's got German.
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.900]   I don't know why she's in this, but...
[00:57:00.900 --> 00:57:03.180]   You're a dog on a side.
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:04.180]   You will not...
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:07.140]   That's a German Shepherd privacy.
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.140]   German Shepherd.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:10.940]   Neistorin, do not disturb.
[00:57:10.940 --> 00:57:11.940]   So I...
[00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:12.940]   Dotten chute.
[00:57:12.940 --> 00:57:14.340]   So you see, this is amazing.
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:15.980]   I mean, really incredible.
[00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:20.180]   Maybe it's because they are more than a dozen countries.
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:24.860]   That's probably why you can get German privacy in stock photos, illustrations, and vector
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:25.860]   art.
[00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:26.860]   You can narrow it down by color.
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:27.860]   They have a color wheel.
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:30.180]   The search refinements are amazing.
[00:57:30.180 --> 00:57:34.140]   You could say with people, without people, editorial, not editorial, the color wheel
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:37.940]   means you can actually say, "I only want blue German privacy pictures."
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:41.140]   I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.260]   But you need this because you're doing your blog post.
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:45.460]   You want to have an illustration.
[00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:46.460]   It's perfect.
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:49.300]   Don't forget the footage tab at Shutterstock.com, too.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:52.180]   Incredible royalty-free video.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:54.900]   A lot of it with alpha channels, which means you can...
[00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:55.900]   You know, if you have...
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:56.900]   Oh, that one's not available.
[00:57:56.900 --> 00:57:58.820]   If you have it on a green screen, you can...
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.460]   It'll look gorgeous.
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:01.460]   Here's the thing.
[00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:03.140]   I want you to sign up for an account at Shutterstock.
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:08.180]   You don't need to use a credit card or pay for it.
[00:58:08.180 --> 00:58:11.420]   But once you have an account, you can get the free photo and vector of the week.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:17.500]   The free footage, you can also use the light box tool to save stuff that you see for inspirational
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:21.020]   purposes or to share with a colleague or client.
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:26.540]   And when you decide to buy, all I ask is use our for code TWIG514, and that'll get you
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:27.540]   20%.
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:31.100]   They have, of course, package deals, but the one I use is the subscription.
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.260]   We get 25 images a week for the company.
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:37.740]   A day, I'm sorry, 25 images a day for the company.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:40.860]   And that really is useful for all of our work.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:44.100]   Our presentations, our media packages, things like that.
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:51.700]   Shutterstock.com, free to try if you decide to buy, use the offer code TWIG514, and that
[00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:56.060]   will save you 20% on your first purchase.
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:59:01.340]   And if your first purchase is a billion dollars as the YouTube purchase of Twitch is, that's
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:02.340]   like $200 million.
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:05.020]   Can you explain Twitch to me?
[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.620]   Yeah, I love Twitch.
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:07.620]   You've not used Twitch?
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:08.620]   Oh, that's right.
[00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:09.620]   You're over 30.
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:10.620]   I don't like games.
[00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:11.620]   You grew up Leo.
[00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:12.620]   Game streaming.
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:14.300]   Justin Kahn, remember him?
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:15.300]   He did that.
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:16.780]   This was crazy.
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:17.780]   He did Justin TV.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:20.300]   It started out with him with a camera on him.
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:25.380]   Remember those early Justin videos where you follow him around?
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:26.660]   And then he had other people doing it.
[00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:29.820]   And then that inspired him because he had so much traffic.
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:31.180]   He had to learn about servers and stuff.
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:34.180]   He had to inspired him to create Justin.tv, which we use.
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:38.740]   A lot of companies use to distribute video live streaming or otherwise.
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:40.100]   And then they had a brilliant idea.
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:41.100]   How old is Twitch.tv?
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:43.100]   A couple of years old now.
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:45.140]   And a really good idea.
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:49.460]   Why stream just stuff like this?
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:53.220]   Because most of the video on YouTube is gameplay video.
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:57.380]   So Twitch is just you watch people play games.
[00:59:57.380 --> 01:00:01.620]   I cannot imagine anything more stealth-apply-boarding than that.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:03.140]   Oh, it's all the time.
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.140]   Yeah, everybody.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:05.980]   I probably should watch the Minecraft videos all the time.
[01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.260]   So these two guys, actually, they've got a pretty good setup.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:11.380]   These two guys are playing this new game, which isn't out yet.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:13.100]   And everybody's very excited about it.
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:15.500]   So that's them down there.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.940]   They must have a Tri-Cast or something.
[01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:18.420]   They're green-screening themselves onto it.
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.420]   It's just X-Plit.
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:20.500]   Oh, X-Plit'll do that?
[01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.180]   That's awesome.
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:25.860]   And then they're describing their play.
[01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.340]   Which channel is this?
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:29.260]   It was just on the front page.
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:30.820]   Oh, it's GameSpot doing it.
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:31.820]   Yeah, it's GameSpot.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:32.820]   So these are pros.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:34.180]   But there's lots of individuals.
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.460]   So you pick the game you want.
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:38.060]   Look at World of Warcraft.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:41.300]   How many World of Warcraft channels are there?
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.860]   Look quite a few.
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.540]   Oh, I'm not going to get a life, people.
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.260]   Oh, Jeff, Jeff.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:50.700]   It's not a way of watching sport, is it?
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.100]   It's exactly like that.
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.700]   Well, that's my case.
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.340]   Yeah, no, I didn't watch sport either.
[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:59.940]   Most of these have a few dozen viewers.
[01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:02.220]   This guy's got 1,000 people watching him.
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:04.860]   He has a total of 11 million views.
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:07.940]   He's got 100,000 likes.
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:09.860]   And here comes an ad.
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.820]   So he's making money off of this.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.220]   I know a lot of people who want to make
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.940]   their living playing video games.
[01:01:15.940 --> 01:01:18.500]   And for them, this is it.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.620]   The rumor this was broken by a variety Sunday afternoon.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:24.540]   And so far, apparently there are early stages
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.660]   in the negotiations.
[01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:28.580]   But the rumor is that Google's been negotiating
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:32.900]   to buy them for a billion dollars.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.380]   Which is actually a good deal.
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.020]   In fact--
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:35.740]   Good for Justin.
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:37.100]   I mean, I'm happy it's going to be for Justin.
[01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:37.820]   He's a real pioneer.
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:38.340]   The bot.
[01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:41.380]   The real question is why isn't Microsoft buying them?
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.740]   Microsoft already has a relationship with them.
[01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:48.860]   You can broadcast on Twitch direct from your Xbox One.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:51.180]   And many of these games are Microsoft games.
[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.500]   This would be a smart move for Microsoft.
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:56.460]   I have to think that there's a bidding war going on right now.
[01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.220]   Did you ever hear about Twitch plays Pokemon?
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:00.140]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.900]   We talked a lot about that.
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:06.260]   So they wired up a chat room on Twitch.tv
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:07.620]   so that you could be in the chat room
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:09.420]   and give commands to--
[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:13.300]   like Pokemon Red, it was like a really old Pokemon game.
[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:17.700]   And so there's tens of thousands of people in this chat room
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.500]   pressing up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.180]   And what chat-- originally the way it was,
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.540]   it was random from the people who hitting a key.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.500]   It would just randomly pick an action.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.660]   So what you get is a pretty random gameplay.
[01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.340]   And then they added the democracy mode
[01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:34.820]   where people could vote and the highest vote getter.
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:37.100]   So it would switch in and out of democracy mode.
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:38.900]   Is that still going on the Pokemon?
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.740]   No, I was just looking it up.
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.220]   I think it finished in March.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.220]   They played several games.
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:49.540]   It said peak simultaneous participation, 121,000 people.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:53.660]   Jeff, if you think that--
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:55.660]   what we were talking about is boring.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:57.460]   This is really boring.
[01:02:57.460 --> 01:02:59.700]   Well, and I bet with Eric Martin,
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.780]   he's the general manager of Reddit.
[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:03.300]   And so he talked about the Reddit--
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.700]   there's a Reddit to side of that.
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:06.500]   There's a live Reddit--
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.820]   a Reddit live thread embedded in it,
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:11.020]   which is our new product.
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:15.060]   Here's the final Elite Four run and ending,
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.060]   including the final battle with the Elite Four.
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:20.580]   Ladies and gentlemen, the excitement was palpable.
[01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:28.100]   So on the right, Jeff, these are people
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.140]   saying this is what we want to do.
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.980]   And as you can see, it's pretty anarchic.
[01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:33.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.020]   It was a social experiment as much as it was.
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.620]   I think it was fascinating.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:40.900]   It almost brought Twitch to its knees.
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.940]   This was three months ago.
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:45.900]   Watching a live edit of Wikipedia.
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:48.340]   They were about to think about it.
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.380]   So they're an anarchy mode right now.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:53.260]   You'll see up at the top it says democracy anarchy.
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:56.420]   And is that-- Chad, is that bar showing how close to the--
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:56.860]   Right.
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:00.180]   So you can see the arrow it's moving towards democracy,
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:03.180]   but they need to pass that second gray or bar
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:04.220]   in order to get into that mode.
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.460]   They're never going to win this game
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.340]   until they get to democracy mode, because it's 2K.
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:10.500]   I believe they want it in anarchy.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:11.220]   You're kidding.
[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:12.220]   No.
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:14.260]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:15.260]   That's dating.
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:17.660]   That's-- [DING]
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.500]   That's sort of irritating at the same time.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.500]   Well, the music is incredibly irritating.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.900]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:28.900]   But the chat-- this is only the chat
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:31.540]   with just the commands and at the actual chat room.
[01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:32.660]   There's other chat as well.
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:33.340]   Right.
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.380]   I mean, there was basically the Twitch chat, right?
[01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:36.380]   Right.
[01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:40.460]   And they had named every single Pokemon.
[01:04:40.460 --> 01:04:41.660]   They had favorites.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:42.500]   They had--
[01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.540]   It was really-- it was a social experiment.
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:45.020]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.540]   You nailed it, Matt.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.620]   So red is over, but they continue to play other games.
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:50.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:52.820]   Continuing with Pokemon Crystal Hole.
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:53.580]   Yeah.
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.140]   It's incredible.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:57.660]   I think this is one of the most interesting things.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:01.860]   And the popularity of this is no surprise to me.
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.260]   I think it's very, very interesting.
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.860]   Lots of ways to monetize.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.100]   They've got promoted games.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:09.620]   As you can see, GameSpot, which is a game website.
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:12.660]   It has a promoted channel on the front page.
[01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:14.940]   Lots of ways to monetize this.
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:15.900]   Matt, she asked my daughter--
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:18.540]   Look at this Baja Blast takeover.
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.020]   That thing Nasi had on top of the page.
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.260]   I asked my daughter why she watches,
[01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:25.460]   because we were somewhere and she was watching someone play
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:25.980]   Minecraft.
[01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:27.300]   And I said, well, why--
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:27.940]   Oh, you learn.
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:30.620]   --are you watching them instead of playing it?
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:32.620]   And she said, well, they have all kinds of mods
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:34.300]   that I don't have or that I can't run.
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.620]   And so I'm watching them play--
[01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:36.220]   Right.
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:37.740]   --because they have these special mods.
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:40.180]   But also, if you had those mods and you wanted to learn--
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:42.380]   I mean, that's why Chad's show is so successful.
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:43.460]   OMG, crap.
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:45.420]   It's because that's how you learn.
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.380]   In fact, I was playing Black the other day.
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.100]   And everybody in the chat room says, oh, no.
[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.340]   Why are you trying to win this game?
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.740]   Just go watch the YouTube videos.
[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:52.940]   It'll tell you how to play.
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:56.500]   Well, that's the point of playing a game.
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:57.580]   But people love that.
[01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:01.220]   Who's the number one talent on YouTube?
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:02.020]   It's PewDiePie.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:02.660]   What does he do?
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:06.180]   He plays through Minecraft and other games and swears a lot.
[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:09.020]   Is PewDiePie funny at least?
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:11.260]   To that demographic?
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.460]   To 11-year-olds.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.980]   Michael gets up in the morning.
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:17.500]   First thing he does is start watching those videos.
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.700]   And the last thing he does when he goes to bed
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:20.620]   is watch these videos.
[01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:25.620]   I mean, that's-- and I hear him chuckling.
[01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:29.100]   PewDiePie has 1,700 videos.
[01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:33.780]   He has currently-- he has 29--
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:36.900]   I'm sorry, 26 million subscribers.
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:37.180]   Wow.
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:38.420]   26--
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:38.940]   Jesus.
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.020]   Almost 27 million subscribers.
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.420]   Should we just pick one of these and play it?
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:44.980]   I mean, I know we'll have to blip it.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.060]   You should go to simulator.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:49.420]   Search for "goatsimulator."
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:51.060]   We love that game.
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:52.020]   Sounds good.
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:52.980]   PewDiePie goes--
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:55.260]   There's a game you can search on his channel if you go to his--
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:55.820]   don't worry about it.
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:56.620]   You got him.
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:58.260]   There's a young kid who's--
[01:06:58.260 --> 01:07:01.180]   whose dad helps to make videos of game reviews.
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.220]   Really?
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:03.700]   And he's huge?
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.340]   He's like nine or something.
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:08.620]   Seven-- almost 8 million people have watched this video.
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:10.660]   I feel like being a goat.
[01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:11.100]   Me too.
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:12.020]   Let's play.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:13.100]   I am a goat.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:13.980]   I know I can lick things.
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.340]   This is the biggest star on YouTube today.
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:17.020]   What's that?
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:17.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:17.620]   That guy.
[01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:18.740]   The camera raggle.
[01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:20.660]   I get points for becoming a raggle.
[01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.220]   He's what, Swedish?
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:23.140]   Hi, there's our--
[01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:24.140]   Oh, dude.
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.100]   Something like that.
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.060]   Oh.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.580]   Why?
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:29.580]   I can't-- I'm sorry.
[01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:30.340]   I can't.
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:31.260]   What the--
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:32.340]   He's not even funny.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.860]   That's where they are when they made this.
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:37.900]   The biggest star on YouTube today.
[01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:39.580]   So that's why they're going to buy Twitch.
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:40.580]   He is Swedish.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.140]   He likes Arvid Wolf.
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:42.620]   Gilbert.
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:46.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.140]   Get it.
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.540]   This is why I despair.
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.620]   After 37 years in media--
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:52.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.500]   Maybe they're trying to buy you.
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:54.780]   They just miss felt it.
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:56.060]   They've got it all corrected.
[01:07:56.060 --> 01:07:58.340]   They wanted to it, and they thought they were getting to it
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.060]   instead.
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:01.860]   By the way, according to the verge, Microsoft
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:04.660]   was in there bidding away.
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:07.500]   The company has only raised $20 million.
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.980]   So if they get sold for a billion,
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:11.540]   there's somebody making some money there.
[01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:13.660]   They have not yet even turned to profit.
[01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:17.740]   By the way, that's the key to getting a big acquisition deal.
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:20.380]   Otherwise, they multiply your profits
[01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:21.860]   times some arbitrary number in the company.
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.300]   Is this Justin's company?
[01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:24.180]   Yeah.
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:25.620]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:26.460]   Yeah, good for Justin.
[01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:28.780]   I mean, there's a lot of other people at this point.
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:29.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.100]   But he was the fastest.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.860]   I just want to note on PewDiePie, according to--
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:33.660]   Does that mean I just even guess a cut?
[01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.140]   I don't know.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:38.700]   Maybe she was like the second person on Justin TV, right?
[01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:38.940]   She's just--
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:41.140]   Did I sell it?
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:42.300]   Justine's doing OK.
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:43.980]   I wouldn't worry about Ijustine.
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:45.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:48.980]   According to Wikipedia, PewDiePie moved from Italy to the UK
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:51.020]   for better internet connectivity.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:52.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:54.980]   That's why I'm moving to Austin, actually.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:56.140]   These economic migrants.
[01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:01.980]   And there I rest my case for why we need an open internet.
[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:05.100]   The PewDiePie drain.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:09.700]   Ladies and gentlemen, we can't afford to lose any PewDie pies.
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:14.460]   Twitch is said to have, according to the Verge,
[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:15.900]   Sam Biford and Ben Popper writing,
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:19.060]   Twitch is said to have evaluated possible bids
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:22.020]   and decided on Google's YouTube as the best fit to help
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:26.020]   the company scale in line with its math of growth
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:29.300]   over the recent years.
[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:30.620]   Well, it is a natural fit.
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:32.900]   I mean, they're doing the same thing.
[01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:34.820]   Of course, they have plenty of service.
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:37.140]   Well, there's a Microsoft fit with Xbox as well.
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.820]   I can see where Microsoft would bid for it.
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:39.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:42.460]   According to the article, Microsoft and others
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.580]   have made serious approaches to Twitch.
[01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.540]   Mm-hmm.
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:48.180]   But I think it does make more sense,
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.380]   because the problem-- that would be actually a problem.
[01:09:50.380 --> 01:09:50.860]   If it's--
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:52.340]   Yeah, because then it would be Xbox.
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:53.500]   And none of the other stuff.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.460]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:10:03.340]   Yeah, so YouTube apparently introduced an API at GDC last year.
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:06.700]   But the game community didn't embrace YouTube.
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.300]   It was Twitch that really got the mind share.
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:13.540]   This is Twitch accounted for 44% of all US live streaming
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:14.540]   traffic, by the way.
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:17.420]   OK, there you go.
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:19.500]   Enough said.
[01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.340]   They're number three in terms of bandwidth used.
[01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:23.900]   After Netflix and YouTube.
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.420]   After Netflix and YouTube.
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:28.180]   Well, they're on YouTube.
[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.220]   No, no, they're not.
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:40.220]   They're basically the Justin.tv.
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:44.220]   And we need offices to be able to mitigate all this gaming.
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:47.180]   So right now, there are almost a quarter of a million people
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:50.580]   watching League of Legend games being played.
[01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.380]   They're a--
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.100]   That's a bit huge.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:54.940]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:55.660]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:57.500]   I think that's probably the reason that they're
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:58.980]   entertaining iniquities.
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:10:59.500]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:00.740]   That's a crap ton of volume.
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:01.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:03.460]   And only somebody like Google or Facebook
[01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.020]   could really reasonably--
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:06.940]   I guess Microsoft has the server capacity,
[01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:09.420]   but that's a big deal.
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.500]   And by the way, it's a very long tail.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.460]   And that's the other thing.
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.300]   This is long tail stuff.
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.940]   You've got a few big, big, big PewDiePie types.
[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:19.900]   But really, these big numbers in traffic
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:22.580]   come from thousands of smaller ones.
[01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:23.300]   Apples number three.
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:24.100]   Yeah, I misspoke.
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:24.380]   I want to--
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:27.820]   Twitch is number four, beating Hulu, Facebook, Valve,
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:30.700]   Amazon, Pandora, and Tumblr for live streaming video.
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:31.700]   Bigger than Hulu.
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:33.420]   Bigger than Hulu.
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:34.660]   That's not saying that much.
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:35.020]   That's because--
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:35.940]   No, that's true.
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:36.420]   That's true.
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.740]   But Hulu is the repository of all these big networks.
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:40.180]   Right.
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:40.740]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:41.260]   Yeah.
[01:11:41.260 --> 01:11:44.740]   Watching somebody else play a game is bigger than that.
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:45.220]   Yeah.
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:48.180]   I know you don't understand it, but truthfully, this is it.
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:51.860]   Well, $25 million is pretty big in network terms, isn't it?
[01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:52.900]   Huge.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:55.460]   Does anything get 25 million viewers these days?
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:56.300]   God, no.
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:59.100]   MSNBC is sometimes lucky to break six figures.
[01:11:59.100 --> 01:11:59.900]   Yeah, but a big--
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.260]   It makes $10 million is big.
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:04.380]   A big network television show can still
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:08.460]   expect to get 10 to 15, maybe even top 20.
[01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:10.500]   Yeah, but if he's got 20, I'm going to subscribe this.
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.820]   He's already naturally above that.
[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:15.060]   Well, they're not all watching at the same time.
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.260]   Well, who knows?
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:17.100]   They have no lives.
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.620]   They may be.
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:20.620]   OK.
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:21.140]   OK.
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:22.140]   There's different figures.
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:22.660]   OK.
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:23.780]   So the subscribers and the live streaming--
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:24.300]   Right.
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:24.900]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:25.420]   Right.
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:27.340]   It's still funny enough.
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:28.660]   I know I'm just weird here.
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:29.860]   I know most of the world plays games.
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:30.780]   I know I'm weird at this.
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.300]   I'm not trying to make fun of the rest of the world.
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.420]   I know I'm weird, right?
[01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:37.100]   But playing the game myself, at least I got to get it.
[01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:38.380]   Watching somebody else playing it.
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:42.140]   I got the most views that we've ever gone on this network
[01:12:42.140 --> 01:12:45.380]   probably, where people playing video games--
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:49.140]   Father Robert playing the goat simulator, me playing Skyrim.
[01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:54.180]   When Brushwood first played the Lords of the Old Republic,
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:56.660]   when these new games come out, there's a lot of interest.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:12:59.820]   And if you have-- frankly, PewDiePie shouldn't be doing that well.
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:02.740]   If you have somebody really funny, really interesting doing this,
[01:13:02.740 --> 01:13:03.740]   it appeals to everyone.
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:05.740]   It's really fun.
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.820]   And that's how you learn how to play.
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:09.620]   And I think kids do--
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:11.340]   why do you think PewDiePie does so well, Chad?
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:13.540]   You're our local expert on YouTube.
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:17.380]   I truly do think that his humor is what people want.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:19.660]   What you saw was the start.
[01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.260]   There's things get absurd.
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:22.260]   So he is funny.
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:23.820]   I believe there--
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:25.100]   He's funny to a kid.
[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:26.100]   And I think, really--
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.100]   The truth is YouTube is a kid network.
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:28.380]   It is--
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.140]   Well, absolutely.
[01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:30.300]   I mean, he's Nickelodeon.
[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.020]   Any of the demographics.
[01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:39.500]   But also, he's grown so much with the medium
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.060]   that he can now put resources that other people don't have.
[01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.700]   All that editing, almost no one else
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:47.620]   can do that quick style of editing for six hours of content.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:48.420]   Because no one--
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:49.620]   He does a lot of editing.
[01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:50.700]   It's not live streaming.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:52.940]   Well, I mean, he would work well on Twitch.
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:55.340]   No, but I thought the point you were making
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:58.100]   was on YouTube, the best content is video game content.
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:58.940]   No, it is the point.
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:00.220]   That's why YouTube's--
[01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:00.620]   Right.
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:03.340]   --saying, saying, wow, we better get in this live streaming
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:03.620]   thing.
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:04.060]   Yeah.
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:05.980]   I was saying just the other day, I think YouTube
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:07.940]   is a place for video games.
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:10.140]   Because that's the only type of content that can make money.
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:10.660]   Right.
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:11.660]   Yeah.
[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:12.660]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:14.940]   But it's also--
[01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:16.100]   it's the way things propagate.
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:19.220]   So Minecraft, a big chunk of how that propagates
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:21.460]   is people watching video games--
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:23.780]   what videos of people building other things in Minecraft
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:25.060]   than going off to build them.
[01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.580]   And that's that sort of weird loop that goes around like that.
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:30.580]   But that's not exactly true.
[01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:34.580]   I mean, a lot of the very, very popular stuff is let's plays,
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:36.940]   is watching someone else play the game.
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:39.940]   And it's because they connect with that personality.
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:41.100]   It's entertainment.
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:42.940]   It's another form of entertainment.
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:43.780]   I--
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:44.780]   I--
[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:45.740]   It's not like--
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:49.100]   Yahtzee Croshaw does those brilliant, very funny video game
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:50.300]   reviews that are five minutes long
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:51.540]   that are called classic thing.
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:52.060]   Right.
[01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.580]   I've watched those and enjoyed those.
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:55.540]   Those are-- those are more adult, believe it or not.
[01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:56.340]   But I suppose, yeah.
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:57.860]   It's like what we're doing here.
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:58.620]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:01.180]   We're just talking to mics and we don't edit this down
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:02.020]   to a show.
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:04.460]   So see what I mean.
[01:15:04.460 --> 01:15:06.180]   This is not eusoria content.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:08.540]   Here's John Oliver on his show last week tonight,
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:11.100]   talking about the right to be forgotten.
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.100]   OK.
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:13.100]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:13.620]   How's it going?
[01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:17.180]   Let's talk about something else, the internet.
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:19.460]   In Europe this week, there was some potentially
[01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:21.260]   significant news.
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:24.540]   It is said the internet never forgets.
[01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:25.980]   Until now that is.
[01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:28.020]   In a huge ruling, the highest court in Europe
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:31.300]   ruled that Google and other search operators like it
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:34.420]   must delete search results if they are requested.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:36.940]   They're calling it the right to be forgotten.
[01:15:36.940 --> 01:15:39.460]   What if 10 million people suddenly approach Google
[01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:41.940]   and say, by the way, you're not a story about me running
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:44.740]   over a squirrel on my bicycle while drunk and naked?
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.140]   I want that removed.
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:47.140]   OK.
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:48.140]   OK.
[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:50.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:53.540]   That is way too specific to be something
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:56.500]   that he just came up with off the top of his head.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.500]   The case originated in Spain.
[01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:02.100]   A man there argued that when a Google search turned up
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:06.380]   an auction notice of his repossessed home from back in 1998
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:09.580]   that somehow that being out there was a violation
[01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.500]   of his privacy rights.
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:15.340]   That Spanish man is Mario Costaja Gonzalez.
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:18.660]   This is his photo, which was on an article from The New York
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:21.460]   Times about his crusade to remove links mentioning
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:23.740]   his debts from 1998.
[01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.380]   In doing so, he is now world famous.
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:27.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:31.060]   That Spanish guy with debts from 1998.
[01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:34.100]   The only thing I know about him is the only thing
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:35.460]   he didn't want me to know.
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:36.300]   There's the point.
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.300]   Well said.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:39.860]   It took us a while to get there, but that was the point.
[01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:41.500]   That was so good.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:44.140]   It is a good--
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:45.340]   for the right to be forgotten.
[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:46.540]   I played way too much of that.
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.580]   I'm sure we're going to get a takedown now from HBO.
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:52.780]   That's the new John Oliver show on HBO.
[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:57.540]   And I love John Oliver, so I just give him a plug.
[01:16:57.540 --> 01:17:00.740]   Let's see.
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:02.940]   Google and Apple have--
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.100]   do we talk about this last week?
[01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.900]   Have buried the hatchet?
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.180]   No, I don't think we did, actually.
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:07.700]   This is--
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:09.060]   Because if somebody shows, you can't remember
[01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:09.940]   what you're talking about.
[01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:11.860]   I've talked about it many, many times.
[01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:13.380]   Michael is a story.
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:16.940]   It's a great story because Motorola and Apple
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:18.660]   were suing one another.
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:19.540]   They said, you know what?
[01:17:19.540 --> 01:17:21.580]   This isn't going well for anybody.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:22.620]   Let's just drop the case.
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:23.660]   No licensing.
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:25.820]   In fact, we've agreed to work together
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.900]   in areas of patent reform.
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:29.500]   Well, that's the main thing is they realize
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:30.980]   that their common enemy is not each other.
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.620]   It's the trolls.
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:34.500]   And they're only encouraging troll behavior.
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:37.500]   I'm hopeful that this means that Apple is recognized
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:40.620]   that even though they've won two cases now against Samsung,
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:44.740]   that the awards are diminishing,
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:48.580]   Samsung in this case actually won a little bit back from Apple.
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:51.740]   And it's just bad PR, and it reveals stuff
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.700]   that Apple doesn't want revealed in discovery.
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:56.700]   All of this is just bad for Apple all around.
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.620]   But Samsung's not--
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:01.300]   and the settlement is just Google and Apple.
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.180]   But I'm hoping that this is the beginning
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:04.940]   of a kind of general day taught.
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:06.220]   And of course, the thing you want to see
[01:18:06.220 --> 01:18:08.820]   is if Rockstar goes away, that's the Apple Microsoft
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:11.820]   consortium that is really the no-till patents
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.020]   that's designed to go left.
[01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:15.420]   The problem with this is that this settlement
[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:17.820]   was used by certain commentaries to say,
[01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:19.340]   well, this shows the patent system is working
[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:20.260]   because they settled it.
[01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:23.500]   It's like, no, they spent $200 million in legal fees
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.900]   trying to fight it first.
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:29.020]   And the depressing news today is that Senator Lee,
[01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:33.380]   he has refused to bring the patent reform bill forward
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:34.380]   for the two of the five.
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:35.500]   No, he's not refused.
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.500]   I mean, his point was--
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:37.060]   He has.
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:39.740]   He doesn't think he had the votes to do it.
[01:18:39.740 --> 01:18:40.780]   Right.
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.780]   Well, yeah.
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:46.180]   Basically, there was a--
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:48.180]   his head of staff has just--
[01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:49.180]   former head of staff has just gone
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:51.820]   to work for the patent role of his group.
[01:18:51.820 --> 01:18:52.820]   Oh, really?
[01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:53.380]   A certain--
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:54.580]   suspicious revolving door for the--
[01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:56.500]   That's a little suspicious.
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.860]   He had sponsored the bill, Patrick Leighy.
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:03.820]   I think he's a good senator from Vermont on these issues.
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:08.580]   He said in his statement, there was
[01:19:08.580 --> 01:19:10.940]   a lack of sufficient support.
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:13.020]   We've been working for almost a year with countless stakeholders
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:15.020]   on legislation to address the problem of patent
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:17.300]   trolls or misusing the patent system.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:19.340]   This is a real problem facing businesses
[01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:22.700]   in Vermont and across the country.
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:23.900]   We have repeated concerns.
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:27.020]   The House passed bill went beyond the scope
[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:30.140]   of addressing patent trolls and would have had severe unintended
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.020]   consequences on legitimate patent holders.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:35.380]   This is the issue, of course, is what is a patent role?
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:36.260]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.700]   I mean, but this is the problem.
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:40.780]   It's that a lot of these alleged legitimate patent holders
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:41.260]   aren't.
[01:19:41.260 --> 01:19:42.180]   They're people who hold--
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:44.900]   They're non-- what we call non-practicing entities.
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:47.820]   They don't actually make anything.
[01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:49.980]   They probably didn't even hold the original patent.
[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:50.740]   They bought it.
[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:52.020]   Right.
[01:19:52.020 --> 01:19:54.740]   So I mean, I think there are certain litmus tests
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:57.740]   that you can use to see if somebody's really a troll
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.580]   or just somebody legitimately.
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.980]   Well, the guy who won the intermittent windshield
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:05.460]   wiper case against-- I mean, that was an amazing story.
[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:12.980]   He took decades to resolve, and he had a real case.
[01:20:12.980 --> 01:20:14.820]   He wasn't a patent troll.
[01:20:14.820 --> 01:20:18.660]   But the point is that the reforms--
[01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.300]   the patent law is out of balance.
[01:20:20.300 --> 01:20:21.740]   It doesn't currently make sense.
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:25.460]   It is causing us billions of dollars of unnecessary costs
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:29.140]   every year to say, oh, the balance isn't quite right to fix it.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:30.780]   No, the thing is out of balance.
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:32.900]   Pass that bill, you can always pass another bill later
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:34.140]   if it overreaches.
[01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.060]   And that's the problem here.
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:37.980]   And the fact that he gets to veto this thing
[01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:41.940]   when it passed the house by 200 and something to--
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:42.780]   That's kind of sad.
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:43.780]   --it's here or something.
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:46.260]   And we have a flaw in the system, obviously.
[01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:47.340]   Our Jeff Roberts has--
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:49.780]   325 to 91, it passed the house.
[01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:50.260]   Yeah.
[01:20:50.260 --> 01:20:53.300]   Jeff has a source that said the process failed
[01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:56.420]   because he didn't want to choose winners and losers.
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:57.940]   So in other words, he lost for--
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.540]   He's chosen a winner.
[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:03.100]   And he's chosen the trolls as winners.
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:06.220]   This 42 state and territorial attorneys general
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:08.820]   sent letters in support.
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:11.220]   Google and Microsoft and hundreds of others companies
[01:21:11.220 --> 01:21:14.740]   urged senators to pass this bill.
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:18.700]   But Leahy says there was insufficient support.
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:20.220]   So all right, yeah, I'll blame Leahy.
[01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:22.220]   I mean, I--
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:23.380]   I think you're right.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.860]   He has veto rights over this.
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:27.220]   He's applied his veto.
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:28.300]   And that's the problem.
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:28.860]   Right.
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:31.700]   That is an awfully powerful thing.
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:35.580]   One guy to kill this bill.
[01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:38.060]   And we do, of course, feel like this
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:40.860]   is a very important bill for us here at Twit.
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:44.700]   The podcast community is threatened by a patent troll.
[01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:48.060]   And so it's not-- this is personal.
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:48.560]   Yes.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:54.260]   Oh, well.
[01:21:54.260 --> 01:21:56.220]   And I guess that's it, right?
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:59.660]   I mean, he says we'll talk about this next year.
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:01.780]   They're going to try and reintroduce it in the next session.
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:05.620]   But the point is we've now got to wait for that to go through.
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:06.140]   That's--
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:07.340]   And we've stopped at the end of the fight.
[01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:08.580]   But it's still really annoying.
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.540]   Because it looked like we were getting really close.
[01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:13.540]   And the thing is, there were several bills introduced,
[01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:15.060]   and they were consolidated to this one.
[01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:17.620]   And now they've been shut down on mass.
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:18.100]   So there's--
[01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:19.300]   Wow, that's a lot of power.
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:22.020]   So a lot of action going on on this this year.
[01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:23.060]   And if you've followed a lot of it,
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:25.260]   there's fixed patents.org is good.
[01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:27.140]   That's run by engine advocacy.
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:30.460]   And that gives you ways to contact your service.
[01:22:30.460 --> 01:22:32.180]   I would still recommend doing that.
[01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:34.940]   Go there and complain to your services.
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:36.740]   It's to say what just happened.
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:39.260]   We thought you were about to fix this.
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:40.780]   You let the people let us down.
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:43.940]   Fixedpatents.org.
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:46.500]   Very disappointing.
[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.180]   And now that you mentioned it, I'm not
[01:22:48.180 --> 01:22:49.420]   too happy with Patrick Leahy.
[01:22:49.420 --> 01:22:55.140]   Huge cost.
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:56.620]   Huge cost to these.
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:57.660]   Cost to innovation.
[01:22:57.660 --> 01:22:58.580]   Cost to everybody.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:00.980]   That's just the companies that are sued.
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:03.860]   Google Glass being handed out to medical students
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:07.260]   that you see Irvine.
[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:10.380]   Several medical institutions have been testing Glass,
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:12.460]   but the School of Medicine at the University of California,
[01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:16.500]   Irvine, is issuing Glass to its students.
[01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:19.060]   Fully incorporating Glass into its four-year curriculum.
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.540]   First and second year students will use the device
[01:23:21.540 --> 01:23:23.180]   in anatomy and clinical skills.
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:25.540]   Third and fourth year students will wear Glass
[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:27.060]   during their hospital rotations.
[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:29.980]   Get ready for a doctor to come in your room wearing Glass.
[01:23:29.980 --> 01:23:31.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:32.740]   I think it's a great idea.
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:35.220]   It's creepy.
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:36.660]   Well, he's wearing a stethoscope.
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:37.660]   What the hell, you know?
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:41.940]   That's interesting.
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:44.140]   That might be a very--
[01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:46.620]   they don't say exactly what software they're going to use
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:48.260]   or how they're going to use it.
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:50.180]   I hope it's more than just taking selfies.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:55.940]   But is there specialized medical software?
[01:23:55.940 --> 01:23:56.460]   There must be.
[01:23:56.460 --> 01:23:57.460]   I'm sure there will be.
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:58.060]   There will be.
[01:23:58.060 --> 01:23:59.060]   If there isn't.
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:23:59.540]   Glass--
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:00.900]   They're supposed to try to get.
[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:05.540]   Did lose its lead electrical engineer.
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:10.740]   Adrian Wong took a job with Oculus Rift.
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.420]   Oh.
[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:16.380]   He was a lead electrical engineer on Glass.
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:18.340]   He'd been there since December 2010.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:20.980]   He came from San Diego National Labs.
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:21.380]   He's now--
[01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:23.980]   No, I don't want my doctor to wear Oculus Rift.
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:25.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:26.660]   Where are you?
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:27.740]   I know you're here somewhere.
[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:33.220]   Wow.
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:34.820]   Well, it holds 10, by the way.
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:37.740]   And Matthew, actually, they do.
[01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:40.740]   Because when you do the--
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:41.580]   That's right.
[01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:42.140]   --what's called surgery.
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:43.460]   They're after scopic surgery.
[01:24:43.460 --> 01:24:43.980]   Yeah.
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:44.980]   That's not true.
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:46.380]   Robotic orthoscopic.
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:49.260]   That's basically-- you may have been better off
[01:24:49.260 --> 01:24:49.980]   in Oculus Rift.
[01:24:49.980 --> 01:24:52.500]   Actually.
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:55.180]   This guy Wong listed his--
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:59.540]   on Angel list his time at Sandia as being a former spy gadget
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:01.460]   maker for the US government.
[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:04.980]   He has 10 patents, including wearable computer
[01:25:04.980 --> 01:25:07.100]   with nearby object response, wearable computer
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:09.380]   with superimposed controls, and instructions
[01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:13.500]   for external advice, method to autofocus on near eye display
[01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:17.700]   and unlocking a screen using eye tracking information.
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:21.260]   This guy's kind of a wizard.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.260]   Wow.
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:30.780]   Well, I think this is probably quite a bit of movement
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.660]   back and forth all the time.
[01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:35.340]   I have to say, speaking about the medical thing,
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:38.940]   one of the first sort of Google class implementations
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:40.340]   that I thought really made a lot of sense
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.900]   was the doctor who used it while he was operating.
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:44.740]   And it brought up a bunch of patient information
[01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:47.380]   that was crucial to him while he was operating.
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:50.180]   He would have had to stop the operation, go to his computer,
[01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:52.020]   pull up the patient's info.
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:54.140]   I mean, it all happened while he was doing it.
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:56.500]   That makes total sense to me.
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:59.900]   But how much detail can you-- the text has to be pretty big.
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:01.940]   You can't put a lot of lines of text on Glass, can you?
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:03.780]   No, and he was looking at things
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:08.740]   like contraindicated sort of medicine or sensitivities
[01:26:08.740 --> 01:26:10.500]   to specific--
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:13.020]   I can't remember the details, but it was fairly
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:13.860]   specific information.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:16.780]   It wasn't reading an entire patient history.
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:22.740]   OK, Glass, search how to do open heart surgery.
[01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:23.580]   That's what you do.
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:24.580]   OK, Glass.
[01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:26.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:26.580]   Where is that?
[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:27.580]   Search YouTube.
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:28.820]   Search YouTube for a day or two.
[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:29.340]   YouTube videos.
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:31.260]   Hey, order removal.
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.060]   Actually, the new head of Google Glass
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:37.660]   is a marketing executive, Ivy Ross.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:39.260]   I need some marketing help.
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.340]   She has a rich tech background, served at Mattel,
[01:26:42.340 --> 01:26:47.060]   the Gap, Disney Coach, and Old Navy in marketing.
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:49.380]   But she's also was working at Bausch and Lohman
[01:26:49.380 --> 01:26:51.540]   in the early '90s, Vice President of Design and Development
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:53.580]   for Outlook I Wear.
[01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:55.340]   But are they marketing this product,
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:58.820]   or are they marketing some product to follow?
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:01.020]   Well, she's the head of Glass.
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:03.220]   Yeah, she's the head of the whole thing.
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:03.940]   Not just marketing.
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:05.380]   She's the head.
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:05.940]   Well, the head.
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:06.300]   Yeah.
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:07.220]   The head head.
[01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:10.140]   I got somebody at Rochester Optical
[01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:12.220]   came after me in Google+, saying,
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:14.300]   you've complained a little bit about your glasses, Jeff.
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:16.260]   We have some really great lenses and frames.
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:18.540]   Want to try them?
[01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:21.180]   Sure, why not?
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:22.900]   So much money has been thrown into this thing.
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:25.860]   When I spoke at Google yesterday, when I put on Glass,
[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:27.420]   they were grateful that I put on--
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:29.460]   Oh, there wasn't an awful drone.
[01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:29.740]   Oh, OK.
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:31.180]   No, I'm not there.
[01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:32.540]   It's the one place on Earth.
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:35.460]   But really, how many people were wearing glass in the audience?
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:37.340]   Like, maybe four.
[01:27:37.340 --> 01:27:38.340]   Mm.
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:48.380]   I think if you laugh at somebody for wearing glass at Google,
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:49.180]   that's probably a fire.
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:51.060]   You shouldn't laugh at them.
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:52.020]   You shouldn't laugh at them.
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:56.620]   But you may not be wearing it yourself.
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:57.820]   All right, that's it.
[01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:58.860]   We've talked it all.
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:00.700]   We've talked about every story.
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:05.500]   Is there any story you guys want to rehash?
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:07.100]   Anything you see in the list, all right, Jeff,
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:08.700]   we're going to get you a number?
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:11.380]   The metaphysal story is interesting.
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:13.900]   There's Kevin Dartanian Marx.
[01:28:13.900 --> 01:28:17.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:17.860]   What is that?
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:20.140]   What's the story there?
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:21.860]   Hey, man, who's Athos?
[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:23.140]   Who's Portos?
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:24.820]   Who's Aramis?
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:26.140]   The four musketeers.
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:27.700]   You're Aramis.
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:30.460]   I love how Jeff has a net neutrality banner on.
[01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:31.220]   Look at that.
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.620]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:34.540]   It's taking me a while to parcel of this.
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:35.060]   I see.
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:37.060]   That's dark.
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:37.940]   That's pretty good.
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:39.660]   Who did that?
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:42.780]   I hear let me check who in the chat room who I grab that from.
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:45.300]   Thank you, chat room.
[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:47.540]   I grabbed that from Ben.
[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:48.780]   Do we care?
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:51.260]   I didn't do this story because I feel like this
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.700]   is a developing story.
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:56.740]   But do we care about the lawsuit that accuses
[01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:58.300]   Google of AdSense fraud?
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:00.260]   This doesn't seem like this is like--
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:01.260]   Yeah, I can't figure out.
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:02.380]   And I also have a conflict of interest.
[01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:03.580]   I didn't even know what this--
[01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:05.740]   I repost.
[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.700]   I work with them in networks and stuff.
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:09.180]   And officially, I'm an advisor.
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:10.700]   And I didn't know anything about this.
[01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:13.860]   But I have a conflict there of unknown nature.
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:21.060]   A lot of class action lawsuits are just relief, kind of fishing
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:21.540]   expedition.
[01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:23.820]   So I don't know what the evidence is
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:27.260]   that there is any fraud or anything done on AdSense
[01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:27.660]   incorrectly.
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:29.420]   People for years have said there's issues,
[01:29:29.420 --> 01:29:32.260]   but nobody's ever really got proof.
[01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:33.260]   I'm going to dismiss--
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:35.940]   And part of the issue is that it's not very transparent.
[01:29:35.940 --> 01:29:37.180]   The only time you see the--
[01:29:37.180 --> 01:29:38.020]   That's the issue.
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:39.500]   --is using the quarterly statements
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.900]   of how much the cost of sales was.
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:43.460]   If you use AdSense, you just have
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:46.460]   to trust that you're getting what you're
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:49.060]   passing through most of the money.
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:51.260]   And yet, Google's not keeping it all.
[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:53.620]   It's an unheard of business where they count it all,
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:56.300]   and then they go, here's your share.
[01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:57.500]   And you have no idea.
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:58.860]   It's a black box.
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.660]   That's why the Matt Hawley Metaphill Veronica
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:05.060]   is interesting, because he talks about how he--
[01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:08.260]   Metaphill's been around for 15 years or so.
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:08.820]   I think he's 15 years.
[01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:10.100]   It's a long time, anyway.
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:14.460]   And he gives you a graph of the revenue they got over time,
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:17.300]   and you see these steps in it where Google changed
[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:18.580]   the algorithm.
[01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:21.740]   Because part of Metaphill is Ask Metaphill
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:24.980]   which is people asking for advice.
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:27.020]   And at some point, that started ranking really, really
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.540]   well in Google.
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:33.860]   And then they were able to sell ads on that and pay for the 10
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:35.340]   employees that are taking over.
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:36.860]   There's a study going around called peak ads,
[01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:40.900]   which describes the hypothesis that perhaps advertising already
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:42.580]   reached its peak.
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:45.060]   And people are harder to reach these days
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:47.820]   because they're prone to ignoring ads.
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:49.260]   And he said, that happened to Metaphill.
[01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:53.300]   We reached our peak in late 2011, early 2012.
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:56.420]   And has seen a swift decline since revenues
[01:30:56.420 --> 01:31:01.940]   are at the 2007 level as of May 2014.
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:04.260]   And of course, Metaphill has more staff,
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:07.700]   has more expenses, but the revenue has gone down.
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:09.540]   But he also says, live by the Google sword.
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:10.980]   Die by the Google sword.
[01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:11.500]   Right.
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:15.260]   But he said-- I mean, I spoke to him last year at XOXO
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:16.780]   about Metaphill and things.
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:19.340]   And he said, they're seeing--
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:20.780]   to mention this further down, they're
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:22.660]   seeing the climate views from mobile,
[01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:25.500]   which means that the ads convert less well.
[01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:28.980]   And so they've been steadily losing revenue from that,
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:31.060]   even though their views are about the same.
[01:31:31.060 --> 01:31:32.900]   But because as people start moving their views
[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:35.820]   from the computer to the phone, that
[01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:39.140]   reduces the amount of ad revenue they get.
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:40.220]   Yeah.
[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:41.820]   Your Matt-- what's interesting here is,
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:45.780]   Matt was the first person I know who
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:50.380]   started a focused blog that made money from Google ads.
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:53.820]   I think it was a DVR blog, as I remember.
[01:31:53.820 --> 01:31:57.460]   And it was really incredibly early.
[01:31:57.460 --> 01:31:58.660]   The PVR blog.
[01:31:58.660 --> 01:31:59.500]   We remember that.
[01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.020]   Yeah.
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:00.500]   It's right.
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:00.980]   PVR blog.
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:01.940]   It's a PVR blog.
[01:32:01.940 --> 01:32:03.060]   And he started that.
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:06.860]   And just as an experiment, not only put that stuff up.
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:09.700]   And so then he got ads on Google.
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:10.660]   And he started making money.
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:13.180]   He started making decent money, because he was the only guy
[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:14.220]   about PVRs.
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:16.100]   And it showed-- I learned a lesson from that
[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:18.820]   about specialization and networks and all this stuff.
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.700]   And so he's always kind of lived by Google,
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:23.260]   to the extent that he was aware of it.
[01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:26.060]   But yeah, you can't make a living just on that.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:30.340]   And you are vulnerable to bad players also coming in
[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:31.940]   and ruining the algorithm for you.
[01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:35.380]   That's content farms-- about Dr. Ockham is a decent company.
[01:32:35.380 --> 01:32:37.820]   But it got hurt badly by content farms
[01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:39.380]   learning from what it did.
[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:40.780]   Well, I love Matt Howie.
[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:43.180]   And I thought Metafilter was great, as he points out.
[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:45.540]   And this is a very good piece on Medium, as he points out.
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:47.660]   Maybe Metafilter belongs to three or four
[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:49.380]   internets ago.
[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:50.580]   He's announcing layoffs.
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:53.460]   And he's asking if people want to help Metafilter.
[01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:55.740]   Yeah, I just put the funding link in the chat.
[01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:57.620]   Yeah, he helped fund Metafilter.
[01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:01.180]   Because the thing is, he charged a $5 subscription fee
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:03.100]   for Metafilter, but it was a one-time subscription fee.
[01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:04.100]   Right.
[01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:08.340]   So that's a problem, is he's got ongoing expenses.
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:12.300]   So what he's asking is, please, if you want to send us money,
[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:13.740]   that'd be great.
[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:19.380]   I have to say that Metafilter does feel a little bit old school.
[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:22.220]   And I say that understanding that someday,
[01:33:22.220 --> 01:33:24.140]   Twit will be in exactly the same position,
[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:27.540]   where we'll probably have to say, yeah, nobody ever watches
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:29.580]   videos anymore.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:30.580]   But--
[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:32.500]   I mean, I'm taking this as a reminder to go and look at it,
[01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:33.620]   because there's good stuff there.
[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:34.620]   And it's actually not a good thing.
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:35.620]   It's always been great.
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:36.060]   It's a great--
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:38.380]   It's interesting that the stuff comes through your face.
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:39.900]   Always has been.
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:42.180]   And I don't know why Reddit would be any more out of date
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:43.100]   than, let's say--
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:44.820]   I mean, Metafilter would be any more out of date
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:45.580]   than, let's say, Reddit.
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:48.580]   I mean, it's very similar in a lot of ways.
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:51.780]   Yeah, it's a blow up with comments
[01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:54.180]   with the comment community, basically.
[01:33:54.180 --> 01:33:55.820]   Dig in that form die.
[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:59.380]   So yeah, there is a half-life mistake.
[01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:00.580]   But I've always used-- you know, when
[01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:03.940]   I talk about online community and comments and so on,
[01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:06.940]   I've always used Metafilter as an example of one
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:08.860]   that's really, really successful.
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:11.420]   I mean, it has lasted a long time.
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:14.340]   And a lot of it has been just the community sort of policing
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:16.180]   itself.
[01:34:16.180 --> 01:34:17.900]   But they do have a motor rate.
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:20.500]   And Jessica has been doing a great job there for a long time
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:24.220]   in setting up those community standards that
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:25.660]   they do behave that way.
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.020]   Well, this will be the test.
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:29.460]   If the community steps up-- and by the way,
[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:31.940]   when you go to Metafilter.com, you'll
[01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:34.340]   see right at the top an important message about Metafilter
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:39.820]   that'll take you to that information and also
[01:34:39.820 --> 01:34:41.420]   to a funding link.
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:42.900]   And Matt's really one of the--
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:46.260]   he's one of those pioneers who's on the song.
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:48.140]   Metafilter and NPR.
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:49.940]   I don't think he's done early blogs.
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:52.340]   But he doesn't have the attention that others have.
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:54.580]   But because he doesn't have the ego that people like me have.
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:55.940]   Right.
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:58.460]   Well, we've interviewed Matt several times on Twitter.
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:34:59.540]   I think the world of him.
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:00.100]   And Metafilter--
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:01.020]   He's a great guy.
[01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:02.260]   --and a really great thing.
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:05.020]   But he's got a great point about the peak ads as well.
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:06.540]   I mean, it's not just the Metafilter.
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:07.580]   It may not be Metafilter.
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:08.580]   It may be Google.
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:09.540]   Yeah.
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:10.500]   And he says, we'll never know.
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:12.100]   It's a black box.
[01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:14.100]   Yeah.
[01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:17.060]   But that's something I've heard from other people as well who
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:19.580]   rely on advertising.
[01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.180]   You know, we do--
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:23.260]   Well, it's one of the reasons we rely on ads that we sell
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:24.980]   or our partners sell.
[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:27.500]   And we are very--
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:31.340]   it's funny, more inquisitive than mainstream media.
[01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:34.740]   We talk to our advertisers a lot about how the ads are working,
[01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:35.620]   what we can--
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:38.500]   how we can work with them to make them more effective
[01:35:38.500 --> 01:35:40.700]   for our audience.
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:43.620]   And often, the response we get is, gee, nobody ever
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:45.820]   asked me that before.
[01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:48.900]   One of the things I mean, your ads are like 1950s television ads.
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.420]   We're very old-fashioned.
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:52.020]   Yeah, we're very old-fashioned.
[01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:56.100]   And actually, Leel's ads are effectively native advertising,
[01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:56.940]   right?
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:00.980]   That's the sort of goal that lots of media companies are trying
[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:03.980]   to get to with native ads with sponsored content.
[01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:07.260]   They're trying to get to ads that are just content.
[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:09.580]   They're just like the rest of your content.
[01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:11.260]   We try not to think of it in that way.
[01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:13.860]   But it is-- I mean, I think it's pretty obvious when
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:14.500]   we're in an ad.
[01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:16.220]   We don't try to hide the fact that we're in an ad.
[01:36:16.220 --> 01:36:18.580]   But it is part of the overall content, I think.
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:18.940]   Right.
[01:36:18.940 --> 01:36:22.020]   And the best part is that you talk about the thing
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:23.660]   and how good it is, right?
[01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:26.020]   That's what makes it so effective.
[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:29.260]   It's not just a pop-up window or a pitchman.
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:32.500]   It's the kind of ad it's hard to ignore.
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:34.740]   But it also has a personal value to it.
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:38.300]   And that, I think, makes-- so as opposed to the wallpaper ads
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:40.380]   that appear everywhere, that people ignore.
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:41.380]   I know.
[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:45.180]   I'm looking at an article on the Mail Online.
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:48.020]   The Mail Online is a really good example of a website
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:51.940]   that is just larded with ads, right?
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:53.860]   I mean, just larded with ads.
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:54.900]   And--
[01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:56.340]   It's Charles Worry, Google Glass.
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:57.460]   I could tell you-- yeah.
[01:36:57.460 --> 01:36:57.860]   That's--
[01:36:57.860 --> 01:36:58.660]   Yeah, I saw that.
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:37:00.500]   But here's the interesting point.
[01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:02.540]   I don't see the ads.
[01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:03.940]   I see the article.
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:06.940]   I am very attuned, as I'm sure most people are, just not--
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:08.700]   I don't know what those ads were.
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:09.700]   Nobody.
[01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:11.500]   And especially if you're younger than 30,
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.180]   I don't even think your eye registers.
[01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:14.100]   You know, registers.
[01:37:14.100 --> 01:37:15.740]   You certainly would never click on them.
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:19.300]   So click-through rates are 0.00001%.
[01:37:19.300 --> 01:37:22.860]   Many of those are accidents or drunk people.
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:25.260]   So I don't think, in fact, Google is--
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:26.860]   I mean, we don't know because it's a black box.
[01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:28.900]   But I don't think they're probably lying about this.
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:31.380]   I have a feeling that there's more likely the case
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:34.340]   that they're just less-- these ads are less and less effective.
[01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:36.980]   Well, though, that's-- if you look at Google's positioning
[01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:39.660]   and stuff on this, they now talk about threading the ads
[01:37:39.660 --> 01:37:41.820]   together across the different domains.
[01:37:41.820 --> 01:37:44.500]   So they will show you an ad on a website
[01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:46.900]   and then show you a different ad on mobile that's
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:47.620]   related to that.
[01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:49.100]   That's smarter about that.
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:50.740]   And they do--
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:52.140]   The other option--
[01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:52.820]   We've tried to--
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:54.780]   If you go to their talks where they're actually pitching
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:57.140]   to advertisers, every now and then,
[01:37:57.140 --> 01:37:58.340]   I go to a conference that's one of those.
[01:37:58.340 --> 01:38:00.660]   And I drop in and see what the story is this time.
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:03.820]   And after the last couple of years, it has been very much.
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:07.140]   We understand that the website-- pure website advertising
[01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:09.460]   is dipping, but we have--
[01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:09.940]   We have a plan.
[01:38:09.940 --> 01:38:11.700]   There's a place on mobile.
[01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:13.660]   And there's--
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:16.580]   Search ads on mobile are a very powerful thing
[01:38:16.580 --> 01:38:20.020]   because they--
[01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:22.020]   you might be taking action directly from them.
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:22.780]   Right.
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:23.340]   You can do--
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:26.900]   Or you can do what twitch.tv is doing to a Mountain Dew
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:29.940]   takeover.
[01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:33.100]   I mean, it's hard to miss that ad.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:34.980]   That's a very expensive ad unit, by the way,
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:38.460]   when you do this call to take over.
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:39.020]   I like our model.
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:40.860]   We're an appropriate placement for Mountain Dew.
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:41.540]   Yeah, right.
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:42.500]   I like our model.
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:47.740]   And our ads work very well for our advertisers.
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:49.460]   And I hope work well for our community.
[01:38:49.460 --> 01:38:52.540]   What we try to do is we don't think the ads will work
[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:56.260]   unless our community likes them, likes the content,
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:58.540]   likes the companies.
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:02.100]   Because it's easy enough to fast forward through them.
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:06.820]   So we take that pretty seriously.
[01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:10.260]   And Prince of Wales does look good in Google Glass.
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:11.580]   This was today in Winnipeg.
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:16.140]   I wonder what is royal reaction.
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:19.500]   He's, by the way, believed to be the first royal to try on glass.
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:26.300]   He actually was trying out an app designed to help workmen
[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:29.020]   keep up with the jobs they have to do.
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:29.500]   Yeah.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:31.900]   Now I'm picturing the queen with glass.
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:34.620]   We are not to views.
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:38.660]   Update on the story we began the show with the Guardian says,
[01:39:38.660 --> 01:39:45.060]   the nest smoke alarm is returning to sale amidst reports
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:46.340]   of a full recall.
[01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:48.780]   The press release was really about the warning in April.
[01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:50.020]   It wasn't something new.
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:50.260]   Right.
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:52.260]   Well, it was pulled from sale in April.
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:54.540]   And then a press release from the US Consumer Product Safety
[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:56.780]   Commission sparked a flurry of reports
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:59.020]   that the company was initiating a full recall.
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:02.300]   Nest confirmed to the Guardian the CPSC release
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:04.260]   was just about that release in April.
[01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:05.260]   They just were a little slow.
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:07.980]   No further recall is planned.
[01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:14.980]   And they plan to put them back on sale, I think.
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:17.260]   Let me see.
[01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:18.940]   Well, it doesn't say that.
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:21.940]   But the headline does say the alarm is returning to sale.
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:27.100]   I don't see that anywhere in the article, but maybe I'm missing it.
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:27.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:27.420 --> 01:40:27.940]   Here it is.
[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:30.260]   We'll be bringing the nest to protect back on the market
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:31.020]   in a few weeks.
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:35.380]   So I apologize for the error.
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:36.100]   And I fixed it.
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:37.100]   It's an update.
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:38.540]   It's fixed.
[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:40.620]   We're going to get your tip of the week, your number of the week,
[01:40:40.620 --> 01:40:43.300]   your tool of the week, anything of the week you got,
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:46.420]   Matt and Kevin, if you've got something for us,
[01:40:46.420 --> 01:40:49.540]   we'll take it first a word from one of our fine advertisers,
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:51.340]   legalzoom.com.
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:53.060]   See, this is an example because this
[01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:55.700]   is a company that provides a service that we think
[01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:57.500]   many of our audience would be interested in.
[01:40:57.500 --> 01:41:01.500]   If you think you might want to be starting a business or trademarking
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:06.740]   your brand, maybe you haven't done a will yet.
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:08.940]   Maybe you're putting that off because you think it's too expensive.
[01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:11.020]   You should know about legalzoom.com.
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:13.620]   Legalzoom is not a law firm.
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:15.980]   They provide you with self-help legal services
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:18.260]   at your specific direction.
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:19.900]   So if you visit legalzoom.com, you'll
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:22.780]   see they do a very wide range of stuff,
[01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:25.820]   DBA, LLC, Chapter S, Chapter C.
[01:41:25.820 --> 01:41:26.780]   We are LLC.
[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:28.820]   This company runs an LLC from Legalzoom.
[01:41:28.820 --> 01:41:34.300]   I mean, it's still because it was affordable when I was just starting up.
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:36.780]   And frankly, it works.
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:41.020]   You can register your trademark, monitor your trademark.
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:42.700]   All the business compliance stuff is there.
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.780]   Patents, too.
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:45.380]   Copyrights, too.
[01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:48.180]   For your family, health care power of attorney, very important.
[01:41:48.180 --> 01:41:51.340]   If you haven't done that, pet protection agreement, how about that?
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:54.660]   Living will, living trust, last will in testament.
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:58.780]   Real estate, deed transfer, all of this stuff, very affordable.
[01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:01.700]   An LLC for $99 plus the state filing fee.
[01:42:01.700 --> 01:42:03.180]   And you might say, well, wait a minute.
[01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:05.500]   OK, you go through the questionnaire and you almost--
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.340]   and he said, but where should I do my LLC?
[01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:08.500]   What state?
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.700]   Or should I maybe be doing a Chapter S Corp?
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:13.580]   Instead, that's when you can connect with an attorney
[01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:15.100]   and get legal advice.
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:17.580]   From an experienced attorney, Legalzoom
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:21.940]   is contracted with attorneys in every state for low flat rates
[01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:24.700]   to give you the kind of advice you need.
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:26.220]   You can check the attorney's profile
[01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:27.940]   and read unedited reviews.
[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:29.500]   So you know exactly what you're getting.
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:31.740]   Legalzoom, they've been helping families and small business
[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:36.060]   owners for 14 years, A plus for the Better Business Bureau.
[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:36.900]   You could take it from me.
[01:42:36.900 --> 01:42:37.780]   You can trust these guys.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:38.260]   They're great.
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:39.500]   Legalzoom.com.
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:42.220]   Use you offer code twig so they know you heard it here
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:45.100]   and you'll get $10 off a checkout.
[01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:46.500]   Maybe not right now.
[01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:48.420]   Just keep it in the back of your mind when it comes time
[01:42:48.420 --> 01:42:51.100]   to get those paperwork filed.
[01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:53.140]   The legal stuff done.
[01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:54.380]   Legalzoom.com.
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:57.700]   Use the offer code twig.
[01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:01.580]   Save $10.
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:03.700]   Guests first, Matthew.
[01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:05.740]   You got anything interesting?
[01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:09.260]   A story you're covering, a tool you like?
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:10.460]   Actually, I was trying to think of one
[01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:12.420]   and I came up with--
[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:15.700]   The New York Times Labs have come up with a tool called
[01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:16.660]   vellum.
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:18.140]   I don't know if you've heard of that one.
[01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:18.140]   No.
[01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:19.740]   V-E-L-L-U-M.
[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:21.460]   I'm sure Jeff asks because he's--
[01:43:21.460 --> 01:43:22.620]   No, I haven't.
[01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:23.300]   No, it's--
[01:43:23.300 --> 01:43:26.100]   So they didn't launch it or anything.
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.700]   I just saw someone mention it.
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:29.780]   And so I think it's an experiment,
[01:43:29.780 --> 01:43:33.900]   but it basically pulls in links from your Twitter stream
[01:43:33.900 --> 01:43:36.180]   and lays them out on a page.
[01:43:36.180 --> 01:43:40.580]   So it's a little paper.ly or there
[01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:42.380]   was another one that did something similar.
[01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:43.980]   But it's very well designed.
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:47.100]   And I know after a couple days not checking Twitter,
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:49.220]   I know that's hard to believe.
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:51.700]   I went back to try and just sort of catch up
[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:53.740]   and see if anybody had shared something interesting.
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:56.340]   This pulls in your Twitter stream and pulls out links,
[01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:58.860]   shows you who shared them.
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:01.580]   So it's quite handy and it's very well designed and fast.
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:02.980]   This was very much a business.
[01:44:02.980 --> 01:44:05.500]   One of my students was at the start and she didn't.
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:06.340]   Yeah.
[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:08.140]   You snooze, you lose.
[01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:10.380]   A simple reading list for the links your friends are currently
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:13.820]   sharing your Twitter feed puts the spotlight on content.
[01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:15.220]   Links are ranked by how often they've
[01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:17.060]   been shared by those you follow.
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:19.260]   Hey, this is good, I'm going to try this.
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:20.540]   Yeah, I really like it.
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:22.420]   I've been using it for the last couple of weeks.
[01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:24.500]   This seems like something I could really--
[01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:28.540]   let me-- instead of doing my regular Twitter account,
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:30.020]   I think I'll follow the--
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:32.980]   I have a links for Twitter account that is news.
[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:35.420]   So this would be actually a very useful little reading list
[01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:37.740]   for me to keep up with the tech news.
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:40.500]   Retrieving-- look at this.
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:42.940]   This looks good. Tech news today.
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:44.780]   Yeah, it's quite simple.
[01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:45.300]   Yeah.
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:46.700]   So well done.
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:48.140]   Not meant to want to go into the comments.
[01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:51.660]   Oculus and Palmer Lucky being sued by CTO's former employer,
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:56.020]   Zenimax Media and id Software.
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:57.980]   Best new apps in the App Store.
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:02.580]   Silent Circle raises $30 million moves to Switzerland.
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:05.260]   That's the-- that's actually an interesting story.
[01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:09.140]   That's the private email system that Phil Zimmerman of PGP
[01:45:09.140 --> 01:45:13.780]   is doing with LeVar Levinson, LeVar Levinson, the guy who
[01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:15.540]   was shut down by the Edward Snowden case.
[01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:19.180]   By the way, who wrote a spectacular and frightening piece
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:20.340]   in the Guardian.
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:20.780]   Yeah.
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:21.740]   About the history.
[01:45:21.740 --> 01:45:22.340]   It's really--
[01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:24.140]   Poor LeVar.
[01:45:24.140 --> 01:45:26.580]   He's really been bullied by the US government.
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:28.300]   And not rightly so.
[01:45:28.300 --> 01:45:29.940]   We had him on triangulation some time ago.
[01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:31.380]   He talked about that story.
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:33.780]   And there's a little more detail in the Guardian piece.
[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:35.700]   Sad.
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:41.900]   "Remembering as an extreme sport, memory athletes."
[01:45:41.900 --> 01:45:43.820]   That's a New York Times article.
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:44.620]   This is good.
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:46.220]   It shows you the sources on the right.
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:47.100]   I like it.
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:48.660]   Vellum.
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:52.940]   It's at vellum.nytlabs.com.
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:54.140]   Thank you, Matt.
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:54.780]   That's a good one.
[01:45:54.780 --> 01:45:59.580]   Let's say hi to Kevin Marks.
[01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:00.460]   What do you got for us?
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:00.940]   Huh?
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:02.460]   Huh?
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:07.820]   I want to show you Bridget, and brid.gy.
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:08.540]   So--
[01:46:08.540 --> 01:46:09.620]   This is another game.
[01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:11.980]   You're the guy who showed us 2048.
[01:46:11.980 --> 01:46:12.620]   This isn't a game.
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:14.100]   This is an indie web tool.
[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:14.740]   This is--
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:16.900]   Oh, thank God.
[01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:18.580]   The 2048 is--
[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:20.620]   Ah, Bridget, right.
[01:46:20.620 --> 01:46:21.940]   I'm not going to tell you.
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:23.260]   Well, you just tried to me all right.
[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:23.700]   I'm not through the 2048.
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:24.500]   I'm sorry.
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:26.300]   Did you ever see the nuclear fusion version of that?
[01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:26.900]   Did I stop?
[01:46:26.900 --> 01:46:27.660]   Just stop now.
[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:28.420]   Stop right now.
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:30.100]   It's not too late.
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:33.140]   Let's do Bridget, and then you can show us the nuclear fusion.
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:37.900]   So Bridget, this is like internet plumbing stuff.
[01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:40.100]   Is this a context thing, or is it something else?
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:42.900]   So this is indie web stuff.
[01:46:42.900 --> 01:46:44.980]   So Tundex evolved with founding that.
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:49.220]   But this is actually by Brett, who's built this.
[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:52.420]   So what it does is it connects the stuff
[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:54.700]   that you post on your own site back and forth
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:57.060]   to Facebook and Twitter and so on.
[01:46:57.060 --> 01:47:02.340]   With a series of different tools that we've built for indie web.
[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:05.020]   So the point is that you can post--
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:06.980]   if you have a post that you make on your site,
[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:09.540]   you can propagate that to Facebook,
[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:11.980]   and then send you back the comments to your site.
[01:47:11.980 --> 01:47:13.980]   We just wrote Bridget.
[01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:16.900]   Oh, we just-- oh, no.
[01:47:16.900 --> 01:47:18.260]   We snarfed it.
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:22.380]   The entire-- oh, dear.
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:23.740]   Actually, the front page is OK.
[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:26.220]   Just some of the links within.
[01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:28.980]   I will warn Ryan that you're doing that.
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:31.420]   Everybody go to brid.gy.
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:35.260]   We're going to do a little bit of a torture test here.
[01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:36.060]   OK.
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:37.780]   So the point is what it does--
[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:39.340]   the point of these web mentions is
[01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:42.380]   that it's a way to communicate that you've
[01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:44.820]   commented on a site back and forth.
[01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:48.180]   So the indie web technique is that you write a post,
[01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:52.620]   I link to your post, and then I send a ping to you
[01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:54.060]   to your web mention endpoint to say,
[01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:56.300]   I've mentioned your post, and then you can make that appear
[01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:57.860]   on your site as a comment.
[01:47:57.860 --> 01:47:59.260]   And this is a tool to make that--
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:01.260]   Trackback kind of or--
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:02.460]   It's kind of like trackback.
[01:48:02.460 --> 01:48:03.620]   It's more like pingback.
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:06.780]   Trackback was not verified.
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.580]   So it was very easy to spam.
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:11.300]   Whereas this actually verifies that the site has linked to you
[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:12.300]   and makes the connection.
[01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:18.620]   And this is a concept that indie webcam came up with called
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:19.980]   Pussy.
[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:22.660]   Yes, publish on your own site, syndicate elsewhere,
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:24.100]   or share elsewhere.
[01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:24.580]   OK.
[01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:26.580]   The basic idea being that anything you write,
[01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:28.820]   you should primarily post on a domain that you control.
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:29.700]   Yes.
[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:33.820]   And then post links to it or copies of it on other domains.
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:36.860]   Because that way, when those other sites go away,
[01:48:36.860 --> 01:48:38.980]   you haven't lost your right.
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:43.140]   And that's something I've been doing recently.
[01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:45.460]   Previously, I've been using Blogger, which hasn't gone away
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:47.900]   fortunately, but I've been using my own site and posting
[01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:49.900]   things there, and then copying them to media,
[01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:51.220]   or copying them to medium, and so on.
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:52.220]   It's a great idea.
[01:48:52.220 --> 01:48:53.220]   And Gilmore Road.
[01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:54.340]   I don't do it yet with tweets, which other people do.
[01:48:54.340 --> 01:48:55.940]   Tantec does do it with tweets.
[01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:58.380]   I don't have a place to post tweets on my own site yet,
[01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:00.140]   but I should do that.
[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:01.860]   But the point of bridge is that it
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:05.580]   will propagate the network comments back
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:09.140]   to your open website, which means that if you've
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:11.860]   got something set up that is in your web and supports web
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:14.940]   mentions, that comments on that article on Facebook,
[01:49:14.940 --> 01:49:17.420]   and Twitter, and Google+ Insert, and Instagram
[01:49:17.420 --> 01:49:18.540]   will come back to you.
[01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:21.140]   And the thing that was just that, it was web mentions
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:25.500]   for large blogging platforms, Blogger, Tumblr, and WordPress.
[01:49:25.500 --> 01:49:29.020]   There's a way to set that up so that when you write a new post
[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:31.500]   on Blogger, it will send web mentions to any links
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:34.940]   that you mentioned in that post so they can display them
[01:49:34.940 --> 01:49:36.180]   as comments on their site.
[01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:42.740]   And conversely, if someone mentions your post elsewhere,
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:44.860]   you'll get those comments appearing as part of your comment
[01:49:44.860 --> 01:49:45.580]   stream on that site.
[01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:47.540]   So it all ends up in the comment stream?
[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:48.660]   Yes.
[01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:49.580]   So there are plugins?
[01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:53.460]   Or do you have to answer that?
[01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:54.460]   It uses the API.
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:57.740]   So depending on which page you're using, there are plugins,
[01:49:57.740 --> 01:49:58.860]   or there's API calls.
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:50:00.740]   So the Blogger 1, it calls the Blogger API.
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:03.700]   I think WordPress is a plugin.
[01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:06.060]   And I think Tom would have written an API.
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:08.860]   But I use disgust as my commenting system.
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:10.180]   I think disgust does this.
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:14.300]   I mean, that was the whole point of disgust, the ISQUS.
[01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:15.620]   Right.
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:17.420]   Well, I'm not sure it does that fully,
[01:50:17.420 --> 01:50:18.540]   but it does some of this.
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:20.900]   But it's not using the same protocol.
[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:22.620]   So it's not as--
[01:50:22.620 --> 01:50:25.260]   you're then depending on another--
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:27.820]   the point of this is a switching point
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:31.300]   that replicates the web mention experience, which
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:35.380]   is a distributed protocol for these concentrated places.
[01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:38.140]   But the goal should still be that your building web mentions
[01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:38.980]   are distributed away.
[01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:40.700]   So it's not dependent on this.
[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:41.820]   But this is like a--
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:42.620]   it's a bridge.
[01:50:42.620 --> 01:50:45.980]   It's a way to connect these things back and forth.
[01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:46.740]   Cool.
[01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:50.180]   And it sounds like it's going to be impossible for a normal human
[01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:51.500]   to implement.
[01:50:51.500 --> 01:50:53.180]   You should talk about fragmentations.
[01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:54.180]   I don't know if we have time.
[01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:55.460]   What's there?
[01:50:55.460 --> 01:50:56.060]   Frag mentions.
[01:50:56.060 --> 01:50:57.220]   Frag mentions.
[01:50:57.220 --> 01:50:57.580]   Frag mentions.
[01:50:57.580 --> 01:50:59.020]   Frag mentions.
[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:00.940]   Frag mentions.
[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:03.260]   So Frag mentions.
[01:51:03.260 --> 01:51:04.340]   This is an idea.
[01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:07.420]   I came up with another indie web thing.
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:09.780]   And the problem--
[01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:11.700]   let me see if I can state this well.
[01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:15.300]   The problem is you want a link to something on the web.
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:18.700]   But most places on the web don't make it easy for you
[01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:20.180]   to link to part of the page.
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:25.060]   There's a couple of methods that you can mark part of the page
[01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:25.620]   as linkable.
[01:51:25.620 --> 01:51:28.300]   You can put an a name tag or you can put an ID on it.
[01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:33.580]   And then if you put a hash sign after the URL and the ID,
[01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:35.140]   then you can link to that piece of it.
[01:51:35.140 --> 01:51:39.940]   Now, this has been in the web platform for a long since
[01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:40.940]   HTML2 or something.
[01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:42.380]   It's a long time.
[01:51:42.380 --> 01:51:46.060]   But the problem is actually finding those IDs is quite hard.
[01:51:46.060 --> 01:51:47.500]   You mostly have to do view source.
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:49.620]   All the site has to work to give you a link
[01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:52.300]   that you can get from it.
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:54.580]   And you can link to the places where there are IDs.
[01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:57.340]   So what I wanted was to link to--
[01:51:57.340 --> 01:51:59.140]   thinking about the use case of linking to something.
[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:01.500]   What you normally are doing is quoting them
[01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.100]   and linking to that quote.
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:07.100]   So you were saying somewhere in this long 400 page post,
[01:52:07.100 --> 01:52:09.420]   there was this quote that I thought was interesting.
[01:52:09.420 --> 01:52:10.100]   I'll cite that.
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:11.780]   And I wanted to link to that text.
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:15.100]   And so what I came up with was this fairly arbitrary syntax,
[01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:18.260]   which was instead of one hashtag, put two hashtags,
[01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:20.820]   and then put the words separated by plus signs,
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:22.740]   which means it's human-authorable.
[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:27.700]   You can write these by hand fairly easily into the address bar.
[01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:32.340]   And then Jonathan Neil, who is one of the indie web guys,
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:35.100]   wrote a script for this.
[01:52:35.100 --> 01:52:36.420]   So that does two things.
[01:52:36.420 --> 01:52:39.900]   First, you can put this script on your site.
[01:52:39.900 --> 01:52:42.700]   So if you make one of these URLs, it will link to that text.
[01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:45.740]   And you can then highlight the paragraph.
[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:49.540]   And then secondly, he made a Chrome plugin for it,
[01:52:49.540 --> 01:52:52.780]   which means that you can do this to any site,
[01:52:52.780 --> 01:52:53.860]   and it will do that.
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:55.100]   It'll link to the--
[01:52:55.100 --> 01:52:57.740]   I've been highlighting the text that you're looking to.
[01:52:57.740 --> 01:53:00.980]   So that was something that we put together a few weeks ago.
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:02.340]   When was this?
[01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:05.580]   Oh, it's almost a month ago.
[01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:10.740]   And the value of this is actually conform with what
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:11.340]   you want to do.
[01:53:11.340 --> 01:53:13.780]   And then more recently, he added the feature
[01:53:13.780 --> 01:53:17.740]   to the Chrome extension that if you select some text
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:20.380]   and right-click on it, you can get a fragmention link
[01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:21.420]   from that.
[01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:23.380]   So which means that actually creating these links gets
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:23.900]   much easier.
[01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:26.180]   Yeah, that's nice.
[01:53:26.180 --> 01:53:28.500]   So you can then create and highlight the link.
[01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:29.900]   You can copy and paste that.
[01:53:29.900 --> 01:53:31.300]   So that was added to this as well.
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:32.820]   So it's very cool.
[01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:35.540]   And what we found-- the thing is once we found that then we
[01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:37.340]   added it to some of our blogs, and we added it
[01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:38.620]   to the indie web camp wiki.
[01:53:38.620 --> 01:53:40.620]   And then we found we were using it all the time.
[01:53:40.620 --> 01:53:41.900]   But it's actually really--
[01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:43.340]   generally, you want to link to a piece.
[01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:46.420]   And even with a wiki that's fairly well structured,
[01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:49.580]   you may want to link to a paragraph within a longer piece.
[01:53:49.580 --> 01:53:51.340]   And we found that this worked quite well.
[01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:55.700]   And then a week later, or a couple of weeks later,
[01:53:55.700 --> 01:54:00.980]   I got a ping from John Borthwick talking about--
[01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:02.820]   I was trying to name the app now--
[01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:07.420]   the read later app.
[01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:09.660]   What's that called?
[01:54:09.660 --> 01:54:10.140]   Parker?
[01:54:10.140 --> 01:54:10.660]   Parker.
[01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:11.140]   Instant paper.
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:11.820]   Instant paper.
[01:54:11.820 --> 01:54:12.820]   Instant paper.
[01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:13.260]   Instant paper.
[01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:15.780]   So this is Marco's app that--
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:16.620]   He sold.
[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:18.340]   Borthwick made it work fine.
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:21.260]   So the basic point of that is you
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:23.060]   get a read later button in your browser.
[01:54:23.060 --> 01:54:24.700]   You click on any too long article,
[01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:27.460]   and then later on, you open it when you're on the bus,
[01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:29.380]   or sitting at home with your iPad or whatever.
[01:54:29.380 --> 01:54:31.620]   You open it up, and you read the long form thing when you've
[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:32.700]   got time.
[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:35.060]   And the new version of this, they added a feature that lets
[01:54:35.060 --> 01:54:39.700]   you highlight text in it, and then share that out on the web.
[01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:41.020]   And what they did was they integrated
[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:42.460]   fragments into that.
[01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:45.220]   So that if you highlight the piece of text in one of these
[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:48.140]   long form pieces, and then posted out to Tumblr or Twitter
[01:54:48.140 --> 01:54:51.060]   or whatever, it will create a fragmentions link that then
[01:54:51.060 --> 01:54:52.660]   goes back to that page.
[01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:55.180]   And then they modified their browser extensions, which are
[01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:58.460]   for Chrome and for Firefox, to support this as well.
[01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:00.220]   Which means that--
[01:55:00.220 --> 01:55:02.340]   like any of these things, you need to have script in more
[01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:04.020]   than one place for this to be useful.
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:08.260]   But it has a reasonably stable failure mode, which is,
[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:10.300]   if the browser doesn't understand what you're doing,
[01:55:10.300 --> 01:55:13.860]   you just get linked to the top of the page.
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:16.140]   But once you add this, it starts getting more useful.
[01:55:16.140 --> 01:55:21.700]   So it's one of these ideas that makes a lot of sense to me,
[01:55:21.700 --> 01:55:25.740]   and it's a starting point for richer kinds of linking in the
[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:26.900]   web.
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:29.300]   And have a look at it, try it out, see what you think.
[01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:30.460]   I think it's great, I do.
[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:31.540]   Yeah.
[01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:36.340]   The original post is kevinmarks.com/fragmentions.html.
[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:40.220]   And there's links in that to the various other places about
[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:41.900]   that, the Chrome plugin, and so on.
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:46.100]   And the main discussions going on at the--
[01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:47.260]   IndieWebcamp.com.
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:48.780]   IndieWebcamp page on this.
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:50.220]   And I just pressed that wrong window.
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:50.740]   Sorry.
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:54.100]   IndieWebcamp.com/fragmentation.
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:54.500]   Fragmentation.
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:54.980]   I remember when--
[01:55:54.980 --> 01:55:55.620]   Fragmentation.
[01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:56.100]   Fragmentation.
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:57.780]   By the way, when you search for this, Google's going to
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:55:59.700]   always say, did you mean fragmentation?
[01:55:59.700 --> 01:56:01.060]   Do you mean fragmentation?
[01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:03.540]   Yes, this is where those clever names--
[01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:04.300]   It's a terrible idea.
[01:56:04.300 --> 01:56:06.180]   It's a terrible idea.
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:08.780]   But it says what it does, which I like.
[01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:11.060]   Dave Weiner and Jay Rosen, I think,
[01:56:11.060 --> 01:56:16.060]   both had links to specific paragraphs in their blog posts.
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:18.580]   I think Dave was the first one to do that.
[01:56:18.580 --> 01:56:20.860]   So that you could link directly to a paragraph instead of--
[01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:23.060]   And that always seemed like a great idea to me.
[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:23.900]   We all do it.
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:24.700]   We all do it.
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:29.300]   Because as you put on your original post, Kevin, no, links
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:32.100]   don't get deprecated so fast.
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:35.940]   And so what I always do it, I Google a passage.
[01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:37.900]   And that always works better.
[01:56:37.900 --> 01:56:38.420]   No, that's true.
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:40.060]   And that was part of what maybe--
[01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:42.460]   I think it was-- I went to an-- the annotations workshop,
[01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:45.620]   there was a C, talking about this, and realized that actually
[01:56:45.620 --> 01:56:47.220]   the most robust thing is--
[01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:47.940]   Google it.
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:49.060]   --some text.
[01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:51.140]   And then that made me think about, oh, but if I want to
[01:56:51.140 --> 01:56:53.540]   cite part of a page, then we should do the same thing.
[01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:56.140]   And you get into debates about what happens if the text
[01:56:56.140 --> 01:56:59.540]   is edited, or how do you support punctuation and so on.
[01:56:59.540 --> 01:57:02.660]   I think that-- but the starting point is having a piece
[01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:05.900]   of the text that you can apply those kind of algorithms to
[01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:07.300]   and creating those.
[01:57:07.300 --> 01:57:11.380]   And if you go to the third page on your web camp, there's
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:13.460]   links to lots of other variations of this idea that
[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:14.980]   have happened over time.
[01:57:14.980 --> 01:57:18.020]   So yeah, I'm not saying this is completely original, but it's
[01:57:18.020 --> 01:57:20.580]   an infinite-- a practical implementation that actually
[01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:21.740]   works.
[01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:23.660]   We've got a bit of support for it.
[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:26.180]   And the syntax for it, I think, is better than the other
[01:57:26.180 --> 01:57:28.580]   syntaxes that have been proposed previously, which is
[01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:31.500]   one of the reasons that this is taken off.
[01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:33.060]   And try it out.
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:34.180]   See what you think.
[01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:36.380]   And there's a word "player" plugin, a Drupal plugin.
[01:57:36.380 --> 01:57:37.500]   There's a lot of different ways.
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:37.940]   Yeah.
[01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:41.100]   But basically, it was put together--
[01:57:41.100 --> 01:57:46.460]   we were like noodling about ideas in the IRC for IndieWeb.
[01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:48.860]   And Trothe said, oh, I can implement that.
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:49.180]   Hang on.
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:50.700]   Give me 15 minutes and 15 minutes there.
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:52.540]   You said, here, here's some script that does it.
[01:57:52.540 --> 01:57:53.860]   That's really neat.
[01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:54.940]   You know, this is--
[01:57:54.940 --> 01:57:57.420]   Now, this is IndieWebCamp is really starting to show some
[01:57:57.420 --> 01:57:58.660]   real interesting results.
[01:57:58.660 --> 01:58:02.060]   I'm glad you're doing that.
[01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:04.340]   It's been sort of ticking over for a while, but we're starting
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:06.860]   to get working code in more than one place.
[01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:08.500]   And that's when you start getting take off.
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:10.300]   And that's--
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:10.860]   Find out more.
[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:13.980]   And the next thing is to try and then get platform vendors
[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:16.380]   to integrate it as well.
[01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:21.300]   So the other IndieWeb News this week, I should mention, is one
[01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:25.900]   of the IndieWeb open source projects, IDNO, is now a
[01:58:25.900 --> 01:58:29.580]   company called NONE, K-O-N-W-N.
[01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:31.740]   If you go to withknown.com--
[01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:37.660]   you can see what they're talking about there.
[01:58:37.660 --> 01:58:39.540]   Basically, it's a holding page.
[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:46.220]   But what this is, Ben Wordmuller and Erin Joe Ritchie,
[01:58:46.220 --> 01:58:52.380]   have put together this up-to-date publishing platform.
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:56.420]   There's like a modern blog or a personal Twitter or whatever
[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:58.380]   you want to call it.
[01:58:58.380 --> 01:59:01.740]   And they've-- it's been an open source project that Ben's
[01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:04.820]   been working on mostly on his own for a while, and Erin's
[01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:06.340]   been helping with the design on it.
[01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:10.180]   And they've just quit their jobs and done a startup to go
[01:59:10.180 --> 01:59:11.860]   and work in a computer to do what it is.
[01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:14.460]   This is what we used to call life streaming.
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:16.020]   Yes.
[01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:19.660]   But it implements all these IndieWeb protocols.
[01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:20.940]   It implements web mentions.
[01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:25.900]   It implements RSVPs, which is a variation of web mentions
[01:59:25.900 --> 01:59:28.740]   that lets you actually invite people to events and have them
[01:59:28.740 --> 01:59:31.740]   say yes or no, and then bridges those back and forth
[01:59:31.740 --> 01:59:33.020]   to Facebook and Twitter and so on.
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:36.940]   So there's a lot of nice subtle stuff in this.
[01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:42.580]   But it's a way to give you back control over your own postings
[01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:45.300]   and still propagate them out to Facebook and Twitter and so on.
[01:59:45.300 --> 01:59:46.700]   And it's fairly mature.
[01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:47.860]   You can install this now.
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:49.580]   Is it working?
[01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:52.420]   They are setting up a hosted version of it.
[01:59:52.420 --> 01:59:55.780]   You can install it now, but you have to set it up yourself
[01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:57.500]   with a PHP hosting service.
[01:59:57.500 --> 01:59:59.220]   So they have to make that smoother.
[01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:01.620]   So at the moment, yeah, the point of this
[02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:03.340]   is to make the install process more easier
[02:00:03.340 --> 02:00:06.220]   than getting stuff off GitHub and doing that.
[02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:07.580]   So that's a key part of the--
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:10.380]   The principle is one that Dan Gilmour wrote about
[02:00:10.380 --> 02:00:15.060]   and he and I talked about the idea that so many people have
[02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:18.540]   kind of moved away from a blog that you have that's
[02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:23.260]   your own and are posting content on Google+ or Facebook
[02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:26.820]   or Twitter or lots of places that are effectively owned
[02:00:26.820 --> 02:00:32.140]   by large corporations and are siloed to some extent
[02:00:32.140 --> 02:00:34.740]   and that we're losing a lot of the sort of--
[02:00:34.740 --> 02:00:38.100]   the principles that IndieWeb supports where you control
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:42.340]   your own content and you let you share it with whoever.
[02:00:42.340 --> 02:00:46.780]   But your site is the central place where it exists.
[02:00:46.780 --> 02:00:47.420]   I like this.
[02:00:47.420 --> 02:00:50.020]   And now I think maybe when live streaming started,
[02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:51.060]   it was a little maybe early.
[02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:54.260]   But now that we are all using these silos aggressively
[02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:55.780]   and Instagram and Twitter and everything,
[02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:57.980]   it would be nice to have-- this is a known stream.
[02:00:57.980 --> 02:01:00.500]   It'd be nice to have somewhere that they could just all go
[02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:02.500]   that you own.
[02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:03.020]   Yeah.
[02:01:03.020 --> 02:01:03.500]   And it's--
[02:01:03.500 --> 02:01:04.900]   Remember, Friend Feed?
[02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:06.300]   I love Friend Feed.
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:07.220]   That was great.
[02:01:07.220 --> 02:01:08.820]   I miss Friend Feed.
[02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:09.260]   Me too.
[02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:11.500]   Problem with Friend Feed is everybody used it.
[02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:13.620]   They just ported their stuff into it.
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:15.100]   Yeah.
[02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:15.620]   Like--
[02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:16.300]   But that's the thing.
[02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:19.020]   So this is the-- in some ways, the inverse of that.
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:20.460]   This is you post it on your own site.
[02:01:20.460 --> 02:01:21.460]   And then it goes elsewhere.
[02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:22.460]   And it goes to your stuff, feed the Facebook,
[02:01:22.460 --> 02:01:23.340]   and Twitter, and so on.
[02:01:23.340 --> 02:01:24.500]   I like it.
[02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:26.020]   And I want to set up my own--
[02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:28.860]   I want to change my blog to a known stream.
[02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:29.380]   Excellent.
[02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:30.380]   Go for it.
[02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:31.100]   Big ban.
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:32.140]   He'll help you.
[02:01:32.140 --> 02:01:32.580]   OK.
[02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:34.300]   Well, maybe I could just download it from GitHub
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:36.980]   and we'll see what happens.
[02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:37.540]   Yeah.
[02:01:37.540 --> 02:01:38.100]   What the heck.
[02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:38.380]   All right.
[02:01:38.380 --> 02:01:40.860]   Jeff Jarvis has been very patient with his number.
[02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:43.380]   The lights have gone out in his house.
[02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:44.140]   Oh, that's right.
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:45.020]   It's darker now, isn't it?
[02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:45.180]   Yes.
[02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:45.700]   It's the wave.
[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:46.540]   It's the middle of the night.
[02:01:46.540 --> 02:01:47.540]   It's the middle of the night.
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:48.260]   Well, am I pink?
[02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:48.860]   And probably--
[02:01:48.860 --> 02:01:51.900]   If I put my hands up here, then my skin tone gets OK again.
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:53.140]   And if I put them out here, then don't.
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:53.660]   Why is that?
[02:01:53.660 --> 02:01:54.900]   Well, you told your hands on--
[02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:58.300]   It's called your computer screen.
[02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:02.900]   Your camera is-- because your face is not enough land mass
[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:04.700]   for the camera to iris down.
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:05.220]   It's better.
[02:02:05.220 --> 02:02:06.260]   You need a big face.
[02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:07.220]   Yeah.
[02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:07.740]   Yeah.
[02:02:07.740 --> 02:02:09.140]   I always thought I had a big face.
[02:02:09.140 --> 02:02:11.180]   You just need to be a bigger percentage of the shot.
[02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:11.940]   Is there a white mask in your dark room?
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:13.100]   If you put the lights on behind you,
[02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:13.940]   it would help.
[02:02:13.940 --> 02:02:14.860]   But then you'd be pretty shy.
[02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:15.860]   I wore almost done.
[02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:17.140]   So I'm going to cheat on my number.
[02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:18.380]   Sit like that.
[02:02:18.380 --> 02:02:21.820]   I wrote a piece on Medium this week,
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:25.060]   because I realized that for 40 years--
[02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:27.220]   I've been writing on computers for 40 years.
[02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:28.740]   How's that kids?
[02:02:28.740 --> 02:02:30.580]   Since 1974.
[02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:31.020]   Wow.
[02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:32.940]   And I realized that all that time I
[02:02:32.940 --> 02:02:35.980]   have had this twitchy habit, necessary habit,
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:39.140]   of hitting the Save button in the day of word processing,
[02:02:39.140 --> 02:02:42.780]   or now the Control S in the age of Microsoft.
[02:02:42.780 --> 02:02:44.860]   And I use Google Docs, and I use Medium to write,
[02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:45.660]   and also WordPress.
[02:02:45.660 --> 02:02:48.180]   And they all save automatically for me.
[02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:50.580]   And so that whole notion of that--
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:56.300]   Save, Save, Save, my fingers will just do it like reflux is gone.
[02:02:56.300 --> 02:02:57.420]   And with it--
[02:02:57.420 --> 02:02:59.140]   pardon me, I'm getting choked up here.
[02:02:59.140 --> 02:03:03.540]   And with it goes the kind of moment for reflection
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:05.500]   that I used to have.
[02:03:05.500 --> 02:03:08.380]   And so I wrote a piece about how computers affected,
[02:03:08.380 --> 02:03:10.180]   how I write, and how that affects.
[02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:11.700]   And it's got a lot of good response,
[02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:13.540]   so I thought I would just plug it.
[02:03:13.540 --> 02:03:20.580]   Good, goodbye Control S, which is how we used to save documents
[02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:22.300]   back in the day.
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:23.900]   Can't remember the last time.
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:28.340]   My early days on VDTs.
[02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:34.260]   And switching from mono screen to H&J.
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:34.780]   This is fun.
[02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:37.980]   I'd love to-- because I'll write this with you all the way.
[02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:39.340]   Well, I didn't go quite so far back.
[02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:41.540]   I started writing on computers when the personal computer
[02:03:41.540 --> 02:03:43.500]   era began.
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:48.300]   So George R.R. Martin, author of the Game of Thrones,
[02:03:48.300 --> 02:03:52.820]   it turns out writes on a DOS machine using WordStar 4.
[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:55.580]   So Control K-S still works for George.
[02:03:55.580 --> 02:03:56.940]   Classic.
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:58.420]   Wow.
[02:03:58.420 --> 02:04:00.580]   He revealed this on Conan the other night.
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:01.020]   It was like--
[02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:02.380]   Control H. Wow.
[02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:03.820]   Did he see what machine it is?
[02:04:03.820 --> 02:04:04.900]   Is it old K-Pro?
[02:04:04.900 --> 02:04:06.540]   I don't know.
[02:04:06.540 --> 02:04:08.460]   What could possibly still run WordStar?
[02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:09.620]   Jesus Christ.
[02:04:09.620 --> 02:04:10.300]   Wow.
[02:04:10.300 --> 02:04:12.860]   Amadore 64.
[02:04:12.860 --> 02:04:14.340]   WordStar 4.
[02:04:14.340 --> 02:04:15.500]   My Osborne 1.
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:16.780]   3 would be the classic.
[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:19.660]   4 is a little bit, you know.
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:20.180]   Modern.
[02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:20.860]   Modern.
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:21.140]   I would be.
[02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:22.140]   I would be.
[02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:22.980]   Yeah.
[02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:25.500]   So Kevin Marks, I'm going to seed my time for my tool
[02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:29.260]   of the week to you for nuclear 2048.
[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:29.940]   Well, hang on.
[02:04:29.940 --> 02:04:31.220]   I've just got some breaking news.
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:32.740]   Breaking news.
[02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:33.940]   Breaking news is that--
[02:04:33.940 --> 02:04:37.140]   The show is never going to freaking end.
[02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:41.460]   Apparently, AT&T messaging is being used to steal single letter
[02:04:41.460 --> 02:04:42.460]   accounts.
[02:04:42.460 --> 02:04:44.300]   I just got this from Tantec who has T.
[02:04:44.300 --> 02:04:45.780]   What?
[02:04:45.780 --> 02:04:49.020]   So I've put a link in orange--
[02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:51.340]   to a tweet from Orange Fettos saying this.
[02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:56.180]   And Twitter.com/J, which was Juliet Melton's account,
[02:04:56.180 --> 02:04:56.940]   has been taken over.
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:59.300]   Oh, no.
[02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:00.700]   And--
[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:06.740]   So if you had AT&T, I presume the way this works is they--
[02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:12.380]   they-- you know, they opposes you with your phone number.
[02:05:12.380 --> 02:05:15.900]   And they get Twitter to send a reset command.
[02:05:15.900 --> 02:05:19.060]   But definitely, at least one has been taken over.
[02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:20.780]   And they may move on to other Twitter accounts.
[02:05:20.780 --> 02:05:21.300]   So--
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:23.940]   Turn on second factor authentication, everybody, right now.
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:24.820]   Yes.
[02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:25.900]   Exactly.
[02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:28.540]   Not that that would fix it if Twitter is letting stuff leak
[02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:31.860]   through, but there may be other.
[02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:34.620]   Maybe it's a chance.
[02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:37.420]   So has T been stolen?
[02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:38.340]   No, T hasn't been stolen.
[02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:39.660]   But J has.
[02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:41.860]   Then Tandy doesn't have a phone number, is that he's safe?
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:44.700]   There's only 26 of you who have to worry about this.
[02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:46.220]   I don't know where.
[02:05:46.220 --> 02:05:47.660]   He doesn't have a phone number.
[02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:50.820]   Ad numbers is 36.
[02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:52.420]   Tantec doesn't have a phone number?
[02:05:52.420 --> 02:05:53.660]   Never phone number?
[02:05:53.660 --> 02:05:55.540]   He's decided he doesn't believe in phones.
[02:05:55.540 --> 02:05:59.140]   And so he has a--
[02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:02.980]   what you call it-- a thing that creates Wi-Fi from a phone
[02:06:02.980 --> 02:06:09.380]   account, and he uses an iPod instead of an iPhone.
[02:06:09.380 --> 02:06:11.020]   OK.
[02:06:11.020 --> 02:06:12.620]   He's easily slightly ahead of his time, Tantec.
[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:14.660]   He has his own way of doing things.
[02:06:14.660 --> 02:06:16.580]   He sure does.
[02:06:16.580 --> 02:06:19.180]   Matthew Ingram always the journalist looking digging deeper.
[02:06:19.180 --> 02:06:20.860]   He jumped right on that one.
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:23.260]   He doesn't have a phone number.
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:24.260]   Matthew, is it Giga?
[02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:24.820]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:28.060]   Nuclear 2048.
[02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:29.060]   OK.
[02:06:29.060 --> 02:06:32.660]   So the summary of Tantec just said,
[02:06:32.660 --> 02:06:35.220]   if you use AT&T mobile for your cell service,
[02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:37.380]   make sure your phone number is removed from Twitter,
[02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:40.260]   Gmail, Facebook profiles, and so on.
[02:06:40.260 --> 02:06:43.340]   Because if you are using SMS for two factor auth,
[02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:45.340]   that means you can be taken over.
[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:45.860]   In fact--
[02:06:45.860 --> 02:06:46.940]   And make sure you don't have your phone number
[02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:47.620]   on financial institutions.
[02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:50.900]   We talked about this on security now yesterday.
[02:06:50.900 --> 02:06:54.700]   Fellow demonstrated how you can bypass second factor authentication
[02:06:54.700 --> 02:06:58.620]   if-- and what I did as a result is immediately removed--
[02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:01.060]   all my phone numbers from the second factor
[02:07:01.060 --> 02:07:03.060]   authentication page on Google.
[02:07:03.060 --> 02:07:04.580]   If that phone number becomes known,
[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:06.260]   somebody impersonates your phone number,
[02:07:06.260 --> 02:07:07.540]   gets a voicemail sent to it.
[02:07:07.540 --> 02:07:11.500]   He keeps you busy, calls you so that your number is busy out,
[02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:14.660]   gets the voicemail number, then calls back, gets the code,
[02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:17.420]   and logs and resets your password.
[02:07:17.420 --> 02:07:20.180]   So that's actually something we talked about yesterday.
[02:07:20.180 --> 02:07:23.020]   And it's interesting it's being used against Twitter already.
[02:07:23.020 --> 02:07:24.060]   Right.
[02:07:24.060 --> 02:07:27.860]   Did not take too long.
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:31.180]   One more time, the nuclear fusion variant.
[02:07:31.180 --> 02:07:33.100]   OK, I've got to find this now.
[02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:33.980]   I'll find it for you.
[02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:35.420]   I have a link to it.
[02:07:35.420 --> 02:07:38.740]   It's newbrickst.github.io.
[02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:40.100]   Right.
[02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:43.340]   Fuse your way to iron.
[02:07:43.340 --> 02:07:46.860]   So you start with two hydrogens.
[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:47.420]   So it's the F--
[02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:49.580]   Wow.
[02:07:49.580 --> 02:07:50.380]   You turn them into--
[02:07:50.380 --> 02:07:51.380]   Introduce them.
[02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:53.660]   Turn them into heavy water.
[02:07:53.660 --> 02:07:55.380]   And then you get the deuterons--
[02:07:55.380 --> 02:07:56.380]   H3.
[02:07:56.380 --> 02:07:57.540]   Turn them into H4.
[02:07:57.540 --> 02:08:01.500]   H3-- oh, this is hard, but it's a good way to learn chemistry.
[02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:04.620]   Because actually, it's a really certain match sense
[02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:05.140]   with swether.
[02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:08.900]   So then you can accidentally make it into beryllium.
[02:08:08.900 --> 02:08:11.700]   I've got beryllium, which has a half-life.
[02:08:11.700 --> 02:08:12.700]   So as you keep moving--
[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:14.660]   Oh, no, it's counting down.
[02:08:14.660 --> 02:08:16.340]   It's counting down.
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:17.660]   So at the bottom of the page, there's
[02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:19.540]   a guide to what you have to do.
[02:08:19.540 --> 02:08:20.500]   There is this--
[02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:23.100]   Is this Twitch for Oxbridge graduates?
[02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:25.100]   Yes.
[02:08:25.100 --> 02:08:30.060]   So you can get stuck at magnesium, because that's stable.
[02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:31.660]   So if you accidentally make magnesium,
[02:08:31.660 --> 02:08:32.580]   you can't carry on.
[02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:33.820]   How often does that happen?
[02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:35.340]   You've got to be careful--
[02:08:35.340 --> 02:08:38.820]   Do not accidentally make magnesium.
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:41.620]   Or you will be so sorry.
[02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:43.020]   There's a deuteron.
[02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:44.140]   There's two berylliums.
[02:08:44.140 --> 02:08:45.980]   Let's merge the berylliums.
[02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:47.260]   I can't merge my berylliums.
[02:08:47.260 --> 02:08:48.620]   Basically what you do is make oxygens and then
[02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:50.020]   emerge the oxygens, I think.
[02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:50.780]   Oh, I get it.
[02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:52.340]   It's not merely merging the same.
[02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:54.140]   You have to now make chemical.
[02:08:54.140 --> 02:08:55.140]   Yeah.
[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:57.980]   You have to keep making four heliums
[02:08:57.980 --> 02:09:00.180]   and adding four heliums to things,
[02:09:00.180 --> 02:09:03.620]   except that if you add it to neon,
[02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:06.220]   you end up at magnesium, which means you're stuck.
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:10.500]   So you can get past that.
[02:09:10.500 --> 02:09:11.500]   Wow.
[02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:12.780]   This is way too complicated.
[02:09:12.780 --> 02:09:13.780]   Thank god.
[02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:16.820]   You can get past that to silicon by adding to oxygen.
[02:09:16.820 --> 02:09:19.020]   So basically, you want to make oxygens and add them together.
[02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:21.140]   And then you can use that to build an iron.
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:23.180]   I've got an oxygen.
[02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:24.020]   OK, so careful.
[02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:26.460]   Don't accidentally turn it into a neon because then it's
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:28.460]   very fragile and could potentially turn it forward.
[02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:29.980]   [SIGH]
[02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:33.580]   Oh, man.
[02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:35.500]   Oh, this is tough.
[02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:36.660]   This is a good game.
[02:09:36.660 --> 02:09:37.860]   This is good for chemists.
[02:09:37.860 --> 02:09:39.460]   Oh.
[02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:42.020]   I don't know what the hell I'm doing now.
[02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:45.380]   I've gone beyond my chemical knowledge.
[02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:47.900]   Well, it plays a bit like a 24-year period.
[02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:50.060]   Then eventually you start realizing what's going on.
[02:09:50.060 --> 02:09:51.900]   Yeah, no, I understand.
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:52.420]   And OK.
[02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:54.420]   But I have to go down here and look at the tables.
[02:09:54.420 --> 02:09:55.420]   I think this is easy.
[02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:58.460]   I mean, my fusion guide and my decay guide, that's the key.
[02:09:58.460 --> 02:09:59.460]   Yes.
[02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:01.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:10:01.940 --> 02:10:03.980]   This is good.
[02:10:03.980 --> 02:10:04.580]   I like it.
[02:10:04.580 --> 02:10:06.060]   That's FE26.
[02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:09.340]   Fuse your way to iron, baby.
[02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:16.580]   It's at dimit.me/fe26.
[02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:21.140]   Ladies and gentlemen, this has been a very fascinating
[02:10:21.140 --> 02:10:25.820]   episode in which we've already retracted the first story
[02:10:25.820 --> 02:10:30.900]   and created beryllium.
[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:33.260]   If you ever want to be back again,
[02:10:33.260 --> 02:10:35.140]   please come back on a Wednesday.
[02:10:35.140 --> 02:10:37.900]   What PM Pacific for PM Eastern time?
[02:10:37.900 --> 02:10:39.300]   2000 UTC.
[02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:40.620]   Kevin Marks, thank you for being here.
[02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:42.260]   It's always a pleasure.
[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:43.260]   It was fun to be here.
[02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:44.860]   Indiewebcamp.com.
[02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:46.540]   That's probably the best place to go to find out
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:47.420]   what Kevin's up to.
[02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:48.700]   I think this is actually--
[02:10:48.700 --> 02:10:49.200]   Yes.
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:50.900]   And there's indie webcams coming up
[02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:56.900]   on the 28th of June in New York and Portland.
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:58.260]   Awesome.
[02:10:58.260 --> 02:11:02.340]   And I want to install ID, no.
[02:11:02.340 --> 02:11:04.100]   Or ID, no.
[02:11:04.100 --> 02:11:04.620]   Or no.
[02:11:04.620 --> 02:11:05.340]   No, no, no, no.
[02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:05.860]   It's now called--
[02:11:05.860 --> 02:11:06.860]   No.
[02:11:06.860 --> 02:11:09.340]   Because apparently nobody understood what ID, no was.
[02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:10.860]   What is ID, no?
[02:11:10.860 --> 02:11:12.020]   ID, no.
[02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:12.540]   ID, no.
[02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:14.780]   I don't know.
[02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:16.180]   But I'm going to try that.
[02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:17.980]   Right from GitHub, I'm not going to ask for any help.
[02:11:17.980 --> 02:11:22.420]   I'm just going to see if I can screw up my server real good.
[02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:26.860]   Well, if you need help, go to the indie webcamp ILC on free node.
[02:11:26.860 --> 02:11:28.580]   I shall.
[02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:30.060]   That's easy enough.
[02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:30.660]   Secret instructions.
[02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:32.660]   And the secret instructions.
[02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:35.500]   This is why we love technology, my friends.
[02:11:35.500 --> 02:11:36.860]   All you people on iPads, you're just
[02:11:36.860 --> 02:11:38.940]   going to have to suffer without us.
[02:11:38.940 --> 02:11:42.140]   Mr. He's sitting in the dark, but he is not in the dark
[02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:43.020]   and his mind.
[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:46.500]   His mind is a bright beacon of hope and a light for all of us
[02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:48.500]   casting its warmth and its shadow.
[02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:51.020]   You said the closing head on Red Dwarf now.
[02:11:51.020 --> 02:11:51.860]   That's my holy--
[02:11:51.860 --> 02:11:54.340]   Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism, city university
[02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:57.500]   in New York, Buzzmachine.com, the author of public parts
[02:11:57.500 --> 02:11:58.860]   and what would Google do?
[02:11:58.860 --> 02:12:02.060]   And the giant head on Red Dwarf--
[02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:03.140]   thank you for being here, Jeff.
[02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:03.620]   We appreciate it.
[02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:05.220]   Thanks for rushing back for the show.
[02:12:05.220 --> 02:12:07.580]   I really appreciate it.
[02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:10.620]   Matthew Ingram from gigahome, gigahome.com.
[02:12:10.620 --> 02:12:12.620]   Great to have you as well.
[02:12:12.620 --> 02:12:13.620]   Thanks for having me.
[02:12:13.620 --> 02:12:15.460]   If you miss any of these shows, you
[02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:18.460]   can get them all on demand at twig.tv/twig
[02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:20.780]   or wherever you get your podcasts.
[02:12:20.780 --> 02:12:23.100]   There's lots of places, including iTunes, of course,
[02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:25.620]   Stitcher and the like.
[02:12:25.620 --> 02:12:27.380]   But we also have apps and all the platforms.
[02:12:27.380 --> 02:12:29.420]   And I highly recommend you find one of our apps.
[02:12:29.420 --> 02:12:32.260]   They're all third party independent developers,
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:33.340]   but they're all great people.
[02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:33.900]   They work hard.
[02:12:33.900 --> 02:12:37.100]   And those apps will help you get every single episode of our show.
[02:12:37.100 --> 02:12:38.180]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:12:38.180 --> 02:12:40.020]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[02:12:40.020 --> 02:12:43.020]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:46.380]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:48.960]   (upbeat music)
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:51.700]   (ethereal music)
