[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And this week we've got some stuff to talk about.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Jeff Jarvis is recovering from his emergency appendectomy in laparoscopy.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And he'll be back next week. He also has some other personal issues to take care of.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Like that hair. If you could just get a little haircut.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   No, I'm just kidding. But instead we've got some great people.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And we've got him in studio because Google I/O is going on right now joining us.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Kevin Marks, who is playing Leo Laporte at Google I/O. He's even got a badge that says Leo Laporte.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I like it. I couldn't go down because we decided to do the coverage here.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   There he is, Leo Laporte. He's a chief to it.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   But we okayed that, right? She got the... Yes, okay, good.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   It's alright with me.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And so actually he's thanks to Kevin for missing a little bit of Google I/O
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   and coming up here to our broadcast studios.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And also to Gina Trapani, who's here in studio, which is so nice.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   My first time in the brick house.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   What?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   First time in the brick house.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   You never came here before?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I've been in the conference.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   You've been in the conference?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Yeah, but I haven't been here. It's so nice not to be just like a floating head.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's very cool.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Although you're in exactly the same spot.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   So from my point of view this is no different.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Same thing, same thing.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   No difference.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   But aren't I kind of over there? Like are you looking at this right there?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Oh, okay, right there.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   You're right there.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Okay, right there.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Okay, so same thing.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Same thing.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Like I'm used to Kevin being right there.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   So, except usually Kevin's outside. So that's a little strange.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I can elbow you now though.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   So you guys both were at Google I/O.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   We saw the keynote today. There will be another keynote tomorrow.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   We will do live coverage of that at 930 Pacific, 1230 Eastern at time.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Today they announced Jelly Bean, ice cream sandwiches,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   successor Android 4.1 they decided right now.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Right, 4.1.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   They also showed the Nexus 7, a 7 inch tablet.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   We'll talk about that.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   The Q updates to Google Play and Google Plus and Sergey Brin,
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   did not jump out of an airplane, but some people did on his behalf wearing Google Glass.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Google Glass, right?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Wow.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So it was a very interesting keynote.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Now the event is, Google I/O is all week is for developers.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   So you guys are going to go to the developer events.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   You're skipping some today.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   So thank you later on.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   What are you excited about Kevin? Anything you want to particularly look at in the developer events?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I want to see if they've got an API for G+ yet.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   I am going to predict they do not.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And I think that was one of the big things missing when Vic Gundotra took the stage and talked about Google Plus.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   He got Taylor Swifted. He concued, Sergey Kanyeed him.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   But he came back, finished his talk and at no point mentioned an API,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   but merely showed new Google Plus apps, showed Hangouts on tablets, showed Google events.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And it tells me, here's me reading the tea leaves.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   You guys tell me if I'm wrong, but it tells me they don't plan to do a right API that they learned from the lessons of Twitter that they want to control all input.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   And that's why they're updating the apps and updating events and adding features and they control it.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I'm still holding on hope. It's only day one.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I'm hoping that either today during one of the developer sessions,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   they'll be an announcement about the Google Plus API or that tomorrow,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   or at some point in the next few days, even if it's not full right access,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   that there will be at least a few more features that will make it a little less useless.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   There is an API, right?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   There is an API. It's read only and it's pretty limited.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   You know, you can't get the number of circles that you're in.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You can get comments, you can get posts, that kind of thing.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Not enough for you to do think up. I presume that that's the kind of thing you'd like to do with the process.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Right, I mean, right now think up is pretty limited because it only acts as the current API.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   So it just gets your posts in the comments to those posts and I think maybe plus ones as well.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   But that's it. So you can't post to it.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   You can't get, you know, the people who have circled you, the circles that you're in, that kind of thing.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   You can't see.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   What was wrong with the protocols limited very limited per day as well, aren't they?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Oh, you don't have the firehose.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   You can.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Right, yeah. They throttle you.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   But that's common. I mean Twitter, same thing.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   There's only a few hundred per hour and I think it's a similar thing with Google+.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   So you're used to that.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   I forgot what I was going to ask you.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I was going to ask you something exciting about Google+ and the API.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Oh, I know what I was going to say.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Maybe Google learned from buzz because people were able to write to buzz and buzz ended up being just a place you would dump your tweets.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   I think they're afraid of.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   That was certainly what when Vic talked about it at South by, he said, "I'm worried about polluting the stream."
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Right.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   That's a management problem. That's a deciding, you know, if they're already deciding which ones to show you, they can decide which ones to show you based on origin as well.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   So you could say only native posts are visible in your circles unless you accept them or, you know, they could, they're dynamically winnowing them for most people.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   So there's programmatically there's a way to handle this problem?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   That's part of the piece that they've been working on for a while.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Originally, the first iteration of Plus for a lot like bars in that every time you posted, that would fill your feed up for two days.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   My feed up for two days is horrible.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Because these people were responding to it.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   They did fix that.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And that has got better and they were better at that ordering problem such that the stuff you see there is less.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Facebook does a lot of that.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Facebook is doing a huge amount of that as well.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And I think people don't re- maybe they realize it, but I think they generally don't notice it.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   They just say, "Oh, it's good.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   The stuff's serious."
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Facebook recently just added in the tweet so you can see who are your real friends, who do you want to see more from?
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Right.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   And then you check them and they appear.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So you control it now a little bit.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   So there's a bit more control of that in Facebook.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Unless, yeah, Twitter doesn't have really have that sense.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Twitter is no everyone you follow you will see.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   So do you agree with Gina?
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   There'll be a right API?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I hope they'll be a right API.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Yeah, I'm hopeful.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I suspect what they'll do is it'll be like preferred only.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   You know, they've already announced that Flipboard have got a better API access than other people.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Yeah, Flipboard has Google+.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   It's actually a little weird because when you're using Flipboard, normally you have sharing capabilities to Twitter and other things.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   As soon as you get in the Google+ stream on Flipboard, you can only plus one it and re-share to Google+.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Really?
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   So what they've done is they've said to Flipboard, "Well, you can include us, but we're not going to let you kind of manipulate how people interact with this."
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Right.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And it's actually is bizarre because it changes the user experience depending on what you're reading.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   That's not typically good user interface.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   But it's one of the things that Android gets right.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   You know, Android vets, this gives you the share thing and anyone could hook into it.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   You don't have hard code every time.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Unfortunately, you get a mile long share menu, but yeah.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I do like that.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   You could share it anything.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Right.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Right.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   I suspect that I think I know you're hopeful.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   I know you're hopeful.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I know you're hopeful.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   It's only mid-day one.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   It's only mid-day one.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I don't know.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   I think if they were going to announce it, they would have announced it then.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   They would have done it.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   There's no reason to hold on to this.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   This is huge, right?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Developers want this.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   They do.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   But they talked about a lot of stuff.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I mean, Jelly Bean today and Project Glass, they kind of, I think, had to lead off with the really big stuff.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   They could have shortened this, by the way, quite a bit.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   There was a lot of, for instance, with Project Glass, they kept saying over and over and you could take pictures.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And you could take pictures.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   The Project Glass demo went on a little long.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Plus you could take pictures.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Right.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Right.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   They never showed an interface.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   They never instead had your controlling.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   So there was room.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I'll tell you there wasn't room.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Fair enough.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   But maybe they didn't know there was room.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   I don't know.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   So let's talk about Jelly Bean.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   We'll go and order on the announcements.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   No.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Jelly Bean is 4.1.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Does that imply, I think the semiotics of that are, it's not a major update.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   It's not an ice cream sandwich update.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Yes?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   You didn't say, oh yeah, this is, this is slightly different.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Five point out would say, hey, we're making a big update.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Right.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Semantic versioning is major.minor.patch.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   So this is a minor.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   So it does count as a minor.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   But there's some, there's some really interesting stuff here.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Well, what, okay, so tell us.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   So I'm, what I was--
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I love the, I love the widgets.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   No, no, that's okay.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Widgets was really, really cool, right?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   So smart, resizable widgets, you add a widget to your screen.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   If there are icons already taking up space, they automatically rearrange themselves.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.600]   If there, if there's not enough room, the widget resizes itself, that's really nice.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.280]   And I think that that's something that it's important for Android to emphasize the fact
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.280]   that their home screen is way more customizable than, than iOS.
[00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:50.560]   It's a differentiator, not only from iOS, but even Windows phone, Windows phone has
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.760]   tiles that you can resize, there's three sizes.
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:53.760]   Right.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.760]   And there's at least their live tiles on the Apple.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.760]   Yep.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.760]   Right.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.760]   But there, it's very primitive compared to what you can do with widgets on the screen.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:00.760]   It's true.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.760]   It's true.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.760]   And Microsoft did, did emphasize that as well.
[00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.360]   I mean, the home screen, the home screen is definitely right for innovation.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.360]   And I think that Jelly Bean is, is, is continuing to do that.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   I love widgets.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.560]   And I think that that is huge.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.240]   So, but if any launchers let you do that, by the way.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.240]   And that, right.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.240]   There are many launchers that you do that.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   So resizing is not that unusual.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.320]   Notifications was a thing that those rich notifications that you could perform actions
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.600]   in the notification bar without launching the app, like liking or commenting on a four
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.920]   square check in, responding to an email, "Hey, I'm on my way."
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.920]   With the hand-in-the-note.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.920]   In the notifications.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.800]   And that new two-finger gesture where you can expand a notification to see more information
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.000]   about it, like the sender and subject line and new email, I was really excited about
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.560]   the new notifications.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.080]   Again, this is, this may be cross-pollinated back from Apple because Apple did at least
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.960]   put some weather and stuff in its notifications.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.120]   So they're a little bit smarter, but they've gone one step beyond and much in their--
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.640]   Well, they've given you more than one action for the notifications as well, which is also
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.640]   important.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.800]   At the moment, if you're coding notification, you can click on it, but that will take to
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.800]   the app.
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.800]   Right.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.800]   There are some--
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.000]   I know it's one of them in a phone call.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.640]   The notification there, I can pause mute, do stuff, something with music.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.880]   So there have been some actions within notifications, but this is going to be much wider.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.880]   Guys, this is--
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.880]   Guys, this is being call back or hang up phone calls from notifications.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:14.880]   Right.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.880]   But it looks like you can hook your own.
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.880]   I mean, I mean, just look at the API's for that.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.880]   It looks like you should be able to create an notification that appears and give you a
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.360]   little mini UI in there.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.360]   Right.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.360]   Right.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.360]   So they showed the four-square app.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.360]   You could like a friend's check in or comment in a notification.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   That's a third-party thing, right?
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.240]   So that's going to be another thing that developers can hook their apps into, kind of like the
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.400]   home screen widget of like, this is another way that these are going to interact without
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.200]   launching the app and having to tap through it.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.800]   It's a little risky, though, to overload too much of that window, isn't it?
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.560]   I mean, can you put too much in there and make it too busy?
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.080]   I have to say, I do not-- the Apple notifications, I spend a lot of time closing.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.360]   You have to do it section by section.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.560]   It's easy on Android.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.560]   You just press--
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.560]   Right.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.560]   And you're going to go away.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.560]   Right.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.560]   You can clear them all.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.560]   You can do one by one.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.560]   You can be thoughtful about how you use notifications.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.560]   Right.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.840]   It does take a little setup to say, these are the things I want to hear from.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.840]   These are things I don't.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.840]   So it doesn't get too chatty.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.840]   I do that as well.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.840]   And you really have to configure it on Android.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   It's one of those things.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.840]   Sometimes the phone will just be chirping all the time.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.840]   And iOS as well, though.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.840]   iOS will--
[00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.840]   True.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.840]   I agree.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.840]   True.
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.840]   Yeah, the badges and--
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.840]   Maybe even more so.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.840]   iOS-- you know, iOS invited for every app ask has to ask permission to notify you.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.840]   Right.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.840]   Whereas on Android, every app gets to do it and you get to turn them off.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:21.840]   So it's--
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.920]   I've gotten in the habit on iOS.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.720]   Every time you install a new app and open it for the first time, it says, "Allow, don't
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.720]   allow notifications."
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.520]   I've gotten in the habit saying, "Don't allow."
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.520]   My default is now no--
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.520]   Right.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.520]   I don't want to hear from you.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.960]   I'll let you know because it was getting so chirpy and busy.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.160]   And I do wish Android gave you that capability.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.480]   Well, you can do it, but you've got to find it.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:47.320]   I run Nano Twitter, which is an ancient app that basically pipes some of the tweets into
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.320]   the notifications.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.520]   So I'm used to having a big pile of notifications like that.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.520]   Mm-hmm.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.520]   That's cool.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.520]   That's a busy notify list.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520]   That's busy.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.560]   But if you have more than three pages, you're doing it wrong.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   Well, no, but this is deliberate because I want to--
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:02.560]   You want to get a tweet stream there.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.000]   And it's not my full tweet stream.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.560]   It's just, you know, @dretmestures and a sub-soph--
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.520]   And you never have to go into the app.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.520]   It's all just there.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.520]   You've just seen that.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.520]   You've got to get the new ones through.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.520]   So it's cool.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.520]   And it's open source, so I may go and hack that to have better buttons on it at some point.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:18.600]   There is a danger creating this other inbox that you have to clear out.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.840]   You know, the point at which, you know, it goes from being fun to being work and you
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.440]   just have to configure a little bit.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:29.680]   One of the things that's always been a negative, at least in demoing Android versus the iPhone
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.720]   is that frequently you'll have-- the screen will rebuild.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.720]   Widgets will redraw.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.400]   Icons will redraw.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.720]   And that has given people the feeling that Android's slow.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.760]   That's the first thing you see.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.760]   Right.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.320]   Apple has been buffering those images.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.480]   And it makes this scrolling very much smoother on the iPad and the iPhone.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.960]   I guess that's butter, right?
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:49.960]   Yeah, so--
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.960]   Right.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.960]   Butters is about making those things look very, very smooth.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.640]   In fact, kind of do the same buffering, right?
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.640]   Right.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.640]   Right.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.640]   Similar buffering.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.640]   Much more responsive.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.000]   Yeah, they let off, actually, with Project Butter, which I think, you know, was an interesting
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   choice.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.080]   Kevin and I were talking about it and I was like, oh, they started kind of slow in this
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.000]   keynote and then kind of build up the flashy stuff.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   You know, first we were seeing charts about frame per second and that kind of thing.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.600]   And then we got into the skydiving, so I guess it was a slow build.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.960]   Skydiving was an hour and a half in.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.960]   Are you kidding me?
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.280]   I was slightly skeptical about the project Butter, Demos, they showed because they said,
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.680]   okay, we've got V-Sync matching, which is good.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.680]   Right.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:26.680]   What does that mean?
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:32.160]   It basically means that they wait to draw until the screen refresh is coming, which
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.160]   is kind of weird on LCD.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.480]   I think it actually has really have V-Sync, but it means they've got a regular pulse
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.480]   when the screen changes.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.040]   V-Sync is a TV thing.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.040]   So that was--
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.040]   That's puzzling to me.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.640]   That's slightly puzzling because the point of LCD is you don't need to update it all the
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:45.640]   time.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.640]   Right.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.640]   But then they said there were triple buffering and that may be paused because it's a little
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.360]   pause because it's like, well, that's-- you just added another buffer of latency.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.360]   You've got three buffers, then you're waiting--
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.720]   Three's got to be better than two, which is better than one.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:00.800]   And I know they did the high-speed camera thing and they showed all of the animation
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.720]   smoother, but they didn't show, I'm dragging my finger around the screen and the thing
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.720]   is following me.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.720]   Mm-hmm.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.520]   And there's a very neat demo that Microsoft Research did where they showed the difference
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.360]   between 100 millisecond and 10 millisecond and 1 millisecond response.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.360]   Huge.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.920]   And when you're trying to draw something or do it on the screen, that's what matters.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.360]   So that's the demo I want to see them optimize for.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:21.680]   They may not have done that yet.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.240]   They said they were doing predictive on your chart, so it would actually draw at the point
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.720]   it was expecting you to go to.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.720]   That sounds horrible.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.920]   That does not sound good unless you're a very predictable guy.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.920]   If you're dragging, that's OK.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.720]   But if you're trying to draw, I don't know.
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.720]   So that's going to be the difference between me.
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:37.720]   You're going there?
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.720]   No.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.720]   Oh, no.
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.720]   Oh, no.
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.720]   Well, it reminds me very much of the early days of mice.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.400]   You know, Apple has always paid attention to this.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.240]   Apple's mouse was direct drive.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.400]   It really felt like, even on the earliest Macintosh, when you moved the mouse, the pointer moved
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.040]   in exact synchrony.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.760]   On Windows, it took a long time for Microsoft to get that right.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.200]   It was in his more silent than that, because Apple wasn't completely direct drive.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.200]   When he went slow, it was that.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.200]   When he went fast, it had to go to the screen.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   Right.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   So it understood what you were doing.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   Yes.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.200]   And it's the same with the track pads.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.280]   Somebody wrote a piece this week about the reason that all Windows machines suck is because
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.800]   you have to configure their track pads, whereas the Mac gets it right from the get-go to the
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.800]   box.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.800]   That's true.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.200]   It does feel like an extension of yourself there.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.400]   And that's because they've closed that loop really tightly.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:24.160]   And I'm hoping that they've done some of that on this, but we have to try it and see.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.800]   Is this one of the issues with Android?
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.520]   There is that extra little bit of lag.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:30.880]   And Apple will throw away the display in order to make the tracking work.
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:34.480]   When you start scrolling on the Mac, they will make the thing track you, even if they
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.720]   can't draw everything, yet the only let go it fills in.
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.720]   Whereas, Android does the opposite.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.560]   It's like, OK, I'm going to fire the refresh loop and load everything from the net web
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.560]   to draw that.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.200]   And you just get this slight resistance.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.960]   And it's not a frame rate thing necessarily.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.240]   It's, are you responding to my finger thing?
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.720]   It's the most critical part of any touch-screen experience.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.320]   As soon as I feel like I've touched the screen and hasn't registered, you come out of it.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.640]   You're like, ah, Android.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:04.560]   And this is my-- the project butter effort sounds great, but I'm not concerned about
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.040]   how quickly or smoothly my applications menu expands.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.840]   I'm concerned that when I tap a button, that's going to respond.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.920]   I don't want to look at spinners.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.920]   I don't want to wait.
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.200]   I don't want to have to tap twice.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:19.000]   I want it to respond everywhere in third-party apps, everywhere throughout Android.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.720]   I never want to be taken out of the experience and think, I'm having trouble with my phone
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.400]   and I can't get done what I want to get done.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.600]   There is a lot of that in Android.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.040]   In fact, the Kindle Fire, which is Android, even though Amazon never admits it, has a
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.720]   particularly bad problem with that.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.800]   Not merely screen lag, but unresponsive taps.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.520]   Oh, that-- it's the worst.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.040]   It kills you.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:37.040]   Yeah, it's the worst.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.560]   It makes you feel like this piece of crap.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.560]   What did I buy this one?
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.680]   And ironically, it may be a fast machine.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.840]   It may do everything well.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.520]   It may have a beautiful screen.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.800]   But it's that responsiveness.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.800]   It makes you feel like this is a good experience.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.320]   So good.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.600]   So butter is about that.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.600]   Butter is about that.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.280]   And I hope that it improves it throughout the application experience, not just rendering
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.640]   the applications menu.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:03.440]   They mentioned a predictive keyboard, which I think I would guess many Android users
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.120]   do not use Google's stock keyboard.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.480]   They're using a third-party swipe that's provided by the handset
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.560]   manufacturer, or they've already downloaded Swift Key or Slide it.
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:15.080]   Right.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.440]   The power user told us about swipe.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:16.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:20.600]   I mean, I think the Android user base is kind of split into the super power users who
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.960]   feel strongly about open source, and then they've got a regular--
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:22.960]   not sophisticated.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.240]   Right in the regular folks.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.640]   And the regular folks are probably using the stock keyboard.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.080]   I have to say that that demo, the stock keyboard, it was--
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.200]   he typed something like, I'm able to--
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.640]   or no, actually, this was the voice demo.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.440]   He said, here I'm giving you voice dictation, even though I don't
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.480]   have a connection.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:46.920]   And Android typed even no KNO, and then it changed it to even though, in the context
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.920]   of the sentence.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.920]   Did you catch this during the demo?
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.920]   I don't know.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.920]   That's neat.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.240]   And it was like, oh, it knew that it was even though, not even though.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.240]   It misheard.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.240]   It looked at the context that no, I must have misheard.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.680]   And it happened really fast.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.280]   The voice stuff has been doing that before.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.880]   I mean, there's also a bit of lag.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.960]   I did notice there was a bit of delay after he spoke, because it was trying to gather more
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:07.960]   than one word before it would respond to the end.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.960]   Right, before we typed.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.960]   Right.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.400]   So it was a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very good.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:21.420]   And it was, you know, a lot of people, like, I was just, like, I was just like, oh, I'm
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.800]   not going to be able to do that.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.320]   And I was just like, oh, I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.520]   But you know, I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.520]   I'm just going to be able to do that.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.520]   And I'm going to be able to do that.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.520]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.520]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.520]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.520]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.520]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.520]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.520]   I'm going to be able to do that.
[00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.600]   And the value of what they were doing was feeding that loop with everyone's voice and
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.320]   improving it from that.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.800]   And that's how they were able to get such good quality for the, for the dictation and
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.160]   for their voice stuff.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.120]   It is, it is why they turned off a Google 411, wasn't it?
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.920]   They had collected enough data.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.320]   I think I, yeah, at that point they, they, they were getting out of the phones.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.320]   There's never enough data.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.320]   There's never enough data.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.320]   Thank you.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.320]   You were done.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.520]   Maybe that was too expensive for them.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.800]   We've keyboard, offline voice typing, better accessibility.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.520]   All of these are things that you would expect, you know, improvements as operating systems
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.520]   are updated.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.520]   What happened with the camera?
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.760]   What's new in the camera?
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.320]   I see your note, Jabb, but I didn't see them.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:22.080]   They put, they made it quicker to take and easier to manipulate them once you've taken
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.080]   them.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.800]   And you can combine preview and shooting mode.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.360]   So you can preview the picture that you'd taken before you shot, but you can also, did
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.360]   you see that?
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.160]   He kind of dragged the, so he was in shooting mode.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.160]   So he's moving it around.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.000]   You could see what was in front of the camera, but then you could kind of pull the picture
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.680]   that you'd taken before it and compare.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.680]   And see.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.040]   So it just looked easier to kind of switch between and view pictures versus shoot them
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   kind of at the same time.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.800]   And again, that's something that a lot of users won't see because Samsung, HTC and others
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.040]   all customize the camera.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.040]   They have their own camera app.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.000]   And in fact, in most cases, it's better than the stock camera app.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.160]   The touch was for app in here does panoramas, does HDRs, does, and I love this.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.240]   It'll take three or five and it'll take the best picture.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.360]   Oh, it'll algorithmically determine the best picture?
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.360]   I don't know.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.480]   You've never used it because it seems kind of odd, but yes.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.760]   I think that's in here.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.760]   Maybe I'm fantasizing.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.080]   I mean, I see Esto's, it will also wait for a smile shot.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.080]   So let's try it.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.080]   Let me just see.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.080]   So don't smile.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.080]   Frown at me.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.080]   All right.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.080]   Now smile.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.080]   It did.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.080]   It did.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.080]   It did.
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.080]   Yes.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.080]   Holy cow.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.080]   That was cool.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.080]   You got to swear, right?
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:38.520]   It put a green box on your face and it waited and then it took a picture.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.520]   Do that again.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.520]   Let me just see.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.520]   Okay.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.520]   It's got your face.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.520]   Okay.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.520]   That's good.
[00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.400]   So it's things like that.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:47.960]   That's a Samsung feature, not.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:54.160]   But in some ways, I guess Google has to pay attention to its stock apps, but often the
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.320]   handset manufacturers are modifying this stuff.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.920]   And they have another third party cameras as well.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.640]   So notifications, we mentioned quick responses.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.640]   There's a search for this.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.640]   This is important for Google.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.640]   What's Google and search?
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.640]   There are three new things.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.400]   There's a new UI, there's voice search, and then there's this thing called Google Now,
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.400]   which I thought was really interesting.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.880]   One of the most interesting things we heard about.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.200]   And as I watched it, I thought it was maybe a little creepy.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.560]   Because they're saying based on your previous searches.
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.560]   Right.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   We think we know what you want.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.120]   You think you can go to this sports team.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.160]   Based on where you are and where you're going, right, we're going to make predictions
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.160]   about.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.360]   Maybe Google now just screened Project Glass to me.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:31.640]   I was like, this is clearly what's going to run on those glasses.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.640]   Right.
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.640]   This like constant.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.640]   Right.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.640]   We know where you are.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.640]   We know what you're looking at.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.640]   Best bet you want this.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.280]   Those fake movies kind of implied that.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.280]   Right.
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.280]   Right.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.280]   The voice search, you can ask a question.
[00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.560]   I think the demo was like, who's the prime minister of Japan and the voice responds.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:51.240]   And the voice is a little bit, it's a female voice, a little bit higher, a little bit less
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.240]   robotic than Siri.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.440]   But still the same voice.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.160]   It's a similar, very similar voice.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.160]   Right.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.160]   So it comes up with, I think they're calling them smart cards.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.720]   It's kind of a white card with the Roboto.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.800]   I think it was still the Roboto typeface.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.160]   And kind of snip it from Wikipedia or from Google Maps or from whatever you ask.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.160]   There are a bit of the one boxes, but rendered from mobile.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.160]   One boxes, but rendered from mobile.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.920]   You can bits of that already on the search.
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.560]   If you just do a straight web search on Google, if you search for weather, it'll give you
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.200]   an embedded thing in the browser on the browser that works.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.560]   So they're just taking that and pulling it up more.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.480]   But they're giving you a button to go there if they get it wrong.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.480]   Right.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.480]   Right.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.480]   And it's been really nicely done.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.560]   They've really nearly just leaned in and they kind of came up with this nice kind of,
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.600]   I must have been IMDB or just wanted one box kind of with the picture.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.200]   Which is the sidebar search stuff they've been doing, which is the, what kind of what
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   they call it.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200]   Oh, right.
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.200]   The sidebar.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.200]   The knowledge graph.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.200]   Knowledge graph.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.200]   Right.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.200]   So I don't know how to suspect it's drawing on that stuff as well.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.200]   You can see all these things kind of converging.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.200]   Well, that's what now really showed me was they are going to take advantage of everything
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.600]   and kind of start to integrate it all together.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.960]   This would events kind of the invitations in Google+.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.560]   They really are starting to take advantage of everything they know.
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.560]   Time it all together.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:00.560]   Cue as well.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.880]   One more thing on Jelly Bean, it comes with Chrome.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.600]   First device to ship with Chrome is a default browser.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:07.600]   Yay.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.600]   Yay.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.200]   The challenge they really need to do is to backport Chrome to all the other androids.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.200]   Because the problem with--
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.560]   Well, they are offering it now for download.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.560]   It's in Play Store.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.560]   Yes, but anyone's on full.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.560]   Pardon me?
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.560]   Anyone's on full.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.560]   Oh, it doesn't run on the other side.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.680]   So the problem we got is a web developer on Android.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.440]   Well, a bunch of these old Android browsers that are missing features.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.280]   So if you're trying to HTML5 stuff, you'll find that one of them won't play audio properly.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.320]   Or it says it will play audio where it actually have any codecs.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.320]   Or there's pieces missing like that.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.520]   And because the update cycle for the browsers is tied to the OS cycle on Android, it means
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.160]   that they don't get patched over time.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:46.680]   So you'll start with an IE6 type situation on Android where suddenly your crappy as HTML5
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.480]   browser is the one on most people's phones.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:55.520]   So this is something-- the way the Fluent developer conference recently was the JavaScript conference.
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.520]   So I already run.
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.640]   This was a big bone of contention among people because they're like, great, we can do move
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.640]   to all this.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.640]   But--
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   We're leaving people behind.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.480]   But this thing is getting-- they're stuck in the past and bits aren't working well.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.880]   So hopefully, if they can get this right, then they go, OK, I'm now we'll make sure
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:14.160]   that Chrome for Android runs on all the old androids too and gets on the update cycle
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:20.320]   train so that they get all the features, then they'll be doing the web a big favor.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.400]   So I did get the sense from some of the conversations we were watching on the keynote that they are
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:31.440]   aware of this fragmentation issue, that they really do want people to move to the newer
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.440]   versions.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.880]   They understand it's a problem.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.080]   But they did that last year too.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.080]   I mean, last year or they--
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.880]   Yeah, last year I said 18 months upgrades.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:46.120]   But what they said this year was that they have got a developer SDK for future releases
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.360]   that will be released so that you can port your hardware to map with it three months
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.920]   before the release of the thing with the assumption that that means the developers
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.920]   are going to do that.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.520]   And the question is, is that going to come with Jelly Bean?
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.920]   They're going to show, oh, right, Jelly Bean will start running on my two-year-old phone
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.920]   or whatever.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:03.920]   No.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.320]   Right, they're calling it the PDK, the platform development kit to port your-- so Jelly Bean
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:13.920]   is over there, update comes out for Zoom, the Nexus S. What other device is it, mid-July?
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.920]   And open-source mid-July as well.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.720]   And open-source mid-July, which is great.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:18.720]   Very important.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.520]   Yeah, what was the one, the other one?
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.320]   There was one other device, and I don't remember now.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:24.320]   Galaxy Nexus--
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.520]   Oh, so the Galaxy Nexus, the Nexus S.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.520]   S.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.720]   And the-- I thought they said the Zoom.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.120]   Who-- how many-- show of hands?
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.520]   How many people have a Zoom?
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.520]   Nobody.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.520]   Zoom?
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.520]   Okay.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.520]   A Zoom?
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.520]   Not the Zoom.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.520]   Not the Zoom.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.520]   The Zoom.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.520]   Exoom.
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.520]   Exoom.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.520]   Still?
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.520]   No, nobody.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.520]   Max has one.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.520]   Max Rebo, Joseph--
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.120]   Okay, so there are a few people here.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.120]   Two.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.920]   A few, two.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   That's it.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:53.920]   They keep raising their hands.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.920]   It's the same two people.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.920]   Linux Doc66 has a Zoom.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.320]   I gave the one that I got in Google I/O a couple of years ago to a friend, and he was
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.320]   kind of like, "Thanks."
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.320]   [laughter]
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.320]   This doesn't do so well.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:05.320]   You think it's--
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.320]   You think it's--
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.320]   Even get Zell doesn't take him.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.320]   We're going to take a break and come back with more.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.320]   Gina Trapani in studio.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.920]   I love that from smarterware.org and thinkupapp.com.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.920]   Kevin Marks from TummelVision.tv and salesforce.com.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:21.920]   Great to have you both here.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.920]   They were at the keynote.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.920]   We're talking Twig.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.920]   We're talking Google.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.720]   There's lots more to talk about in just a bit.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.720]   But first, let's talk Ting.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.720]   Hover has been a sponsor for a long time.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.320]   They're run by a company called Two Cows.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:39.360]   I'm sure a lot of you remember Two Cows used to stand for the ultimate collection of
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.360]   Windows software.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.160]   It was a great shareware site for Windows.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.160]   It's so much more.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:50.000]   Elliot Noss who runs Two Cows came down in, I think, last fall and said, "Git, we're
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.760]   going to do the same thing we've done with the main name registration with Hover.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:56.000]   We're going to do it with--get ready for this--the cell phone industry."
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.360]   And he showed us Ting and I was blown away.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.560]   This is an industry that's ripe.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.960]   Believe me, for reinvention.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.400]   Ting is going to change everything.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.520]   They're going to give you control of your cell phone bill.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.480]   They're going to give you great support.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.320]   They're going to give you transparency.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.040]   They call it billing clarity.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.320]   So you save money and you understand what you're paying for.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:25.240]   And let me just go to Ting.com, actually, if Ting.com/twig and you can find out, for
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.880]   instance, how much you would save.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.400]   They have a great savings calculator.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.960]   Go with your current cell phone bill.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.560]   But this is what I love about Ting.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.320]   By the way, Android phones, of course.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.320]   You choose the plan.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.120]   First, you choose how many phones you're going to have.
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.040]   So it's great for a business or family.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.400]   Let's say $6 a phone per month.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:45.400]   Period.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.400]   That's it.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.400]   Flat fee.
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.080]   Let's say four phones is a whole family, 24 bucks.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.960]   And then I choose how many minutes those four phones will have from 0 to 3,000.
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.240]   Don't freak out about this.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   You don't have to worry about it.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.880]   I'll explain why in a second.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.640]   How many text messages 0 to 6,000?
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.720]   How many megabytes of data?
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.280]   0 to 3 gigs.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.040]   But you're just--it's almost like just--this is what I think I'm going to use.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.880]   Here's the deal.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.120]   You can max all this stuff out.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.840]   But here's the deal.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.960]   You only pay for what you actually use.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:19.680]   So they'll refund the difference if you pay more than you need.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.000]   And you could always pick 0 across the board and then you'll just bill you for what you
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   use that month without a penalty.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   Without a penalty.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.880]   Creditor charge the difference from this price structure.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:37.160]   Also, voicemail, picture and video messaging, three-way calling, caller ID, tethering, hotspotting,
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.720]   all included at no extra charge.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.600]   So this is really fantastic.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.760]   So 24 bucks, I'm going to get--let's get 1,000 minutes.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.440]   That's enough for the family of 4,000 messages.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   That's got to do fine.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:54.680]   And I'll get a 2 gigabytes of data because we like to use--let's go all the way.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.640]   Four phones, $107 a month for four phones.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:02.240]   And if I don't use it all, I get a refund.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.520]   They've got some great phones too now.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.880]   I'll tell you the negative.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.520]   They're not subsidizing the phones as heavily as some of the companies, other companies
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.520]   are.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.720]   But they do have great phones.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.640]   There's feature phones as well.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.640]   They have data devices.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.720]   They're running on the Sprint network.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:23.240]   So you know you're going to get great service if you get great service in your area.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:25.440]   Samsung Transform Ultra, that's nice.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:33.800]   200 bucks, Galaxy S2, 485, and you could save $50 if you go to Ting.com/Twig.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.360]   This is the way phone--I hope--phone companies will operate in the future.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.120]   But right now they're the only ones that do.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.880]   ting.com/Twig.
[00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.760]   No overage penalties.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.760]   Great rates.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.760]   Multiple devices on a single plan.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.640]   Great for businesses and families.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.720]   And no fees or limits on how you use it.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.640]   That is just the way it is.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.840]   Very, very simple.
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.080]   Thank you Ting for your support.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.040]   Thank you, Elliot, for doing such a great job there at 2Cows.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:05.840]   All right, we're talking Google I/O, Gina Trapani.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.840]   It's here.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:09.160]   Jeff Jarvis taking the day off.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.800]   Kevin Marks is also here.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.800]   Thank you for coming up.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.160]   Both of you, I know you'd like to be back at Google I/O finding out about that API that
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.160]   they're never going to send you.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.120]   A friend of mine is in one of the sessions.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.600]   I guess they're handing out little red cards with plus ones on them.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.000]   If you like the session, you drop it in the box in the end.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   I like it.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   It's a real life plus one.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   That's cool.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.760]   I'll tell you what, I plus one.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.920]   Wow.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:37.240]   So, Vic Conductor is talking on, a little bit of a little droning on about events.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.640]   This is a new feature in Google Plus.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.320]   And all of a sudden, Sergey Brin, one of the fanners at Google, says, "Wait a minute.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.960]   I'm going to let you talk in a minute."
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.320]   But first, Beyonce-- no, no, it wasn't that.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.240]   It was-- but first, this is a time critical demo.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   Yeah, that was great.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.920]   I mean, he ran on stage breathless, wearing the Google glasses, and just like, "Hey, you
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.920]   know, I hate to interrupt you."
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.200]   But just got something going on that's a little time sensitive.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:06.160]   And up on the screen, you see kind of an air balloon or like a Zeppelin kind of hanging.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.720]   And we're like, "My first thought was, oh, it's a Google Maps flyover.
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.720]   They're doing something crazy."
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:12.520]   It looks like that 3D thing, yeah.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.520]   But it was actually--
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.400]   Skydiving, wearing Google Glass, Project Glass.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.400]   It was amazing.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.600]   Now, some people were saying, "Well, that must have been scripted, right?"
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:26.600]   I don't think so.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.800]   I think that the Hindenburg or whatever it was called, the Zeppelin--
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:36.520]   it's probably not the right name-- the Zeppelin was right over the Moscone Center, and it had
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.040]   to be when it was there, right?
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   Right.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   I don't know.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.040]   They can steer it a bit.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.040]   They're not blend by the wind.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.040]   It's not like a high eblin.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.880]   Well, why do you think it was so critical?
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.880]   Then that they do this at the exact time?
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.080]   Oh, they do it the exact time.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:56.200]   I mean, yeah, I mean, maybe they had to have gotten some sort of airspace regulatory kind
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.760]   of permission for these guys to drop onto the--
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:32:59.760]   So that's the other thing.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.760]   Did they get permission to do this?
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:08.400]   They had to-- so the Force guy drivers in a plane wearing Google Glasses jump out of
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.240]   the plane and land on the roof of Moscone, which was--
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:16.280]   Well, doing a hangout, by the way, there's five divers.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.760]   And they're in a hangout.
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.600]   This was one of the most incredible live demos.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.600]   Gutsiest-- gutsiest.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.600]   I mean, just the conditions.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.160]   Well, as Sergey said, this might go all-- this might go-- here's the interrupt.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:30.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.280]   You can take it from my screen if you can see my screen.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.280]   Can you see my screen?
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.280]   Let me go back a little bit.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:36.280]   Here we go.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.120]   Sergey, equal event for you.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.120]   [CHEERING]
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.680]   So Sergey Brin wanders that in the middle of a big speech.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.680]   Guys?
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   And he's not seen in public without the last time.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.680]   We're going to do something pretty magical here.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.680]   He's right here.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   And we have a special surprise for you.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.400]   We've got something pretty special for you.
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.600]   It's a little bit time sensitive.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.120]   So I apologize for interrupting.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.480]   The good news is that Vic is very poised and he can handle this kind of thing.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.480]   I don't know.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.160]   There's a lot of presenters who would have been completely thrown by this.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.160]   It was actually really neat to see the difference between the two of them.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.720]   And one of the reasons I like Google's keynotes, they're very real.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:13.720]   They know they're talking to developers.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:14.720]   They're real.
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.720]   They're genuine.
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.240]   And the developers, I think, appreciate that.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.440]   They don't want to be marketed to as much.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.440]   Mm-hmm.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.440]   Yep.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.560]   So they had these guys up in this Zeppelin.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.200]   I'm told it's a Zeppelin because it's a rigid frame, not a blimp.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.720]   Well, we can see that on screen, but they actually jumped out of a plane.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.960]   I think the Zeppelin must have just been there.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   No, no, no, it was a Zeppelin.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.960]   Oh, they--
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.960]   Because I thought you could see the wing when they were coming out.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.800]   No, no, I think they jumped out of the Zeppelin.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.800]   Because it's the-- it's the-- it's the-- it's the gong-blowing thing.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   Because they were hovering.
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   OK.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   OK.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.800]   All right.
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   See, the wing is probably that little fin there.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.800]   So they have a couple of guys--
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.800]   Right, you're right.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.800]   You're right.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   We just saw a shot up.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.520]   And they had a hangout.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.520]   And they have squirrel suits.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.520]   They have those flight suits.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.240]   I know, those flights, those are so cool.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:57.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.240]   Those are so cool.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.680]   They must have been able to steer that way a little bit.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.680]   He said that.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:03.680]   He said that.
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:04.680]   We can steer a little bit.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.760]   We've got to be over the top.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.200]   They did a perfect landing on the roof.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.760]   And then they biked and repelled and ran into--
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.760]   Oh.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.760]   --manual.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.760]   I've got it on my screen here if you want to go to chat.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.960]   Which is great for their landing.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.520]   I lent you down here.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.120]   And I thought maybe you guys could show us a fun time on the way down.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.760]   And you skip forward a bit, because they took a while to actually jump.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.760]   It looks like a long way down.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.480]   But yes, so somebody in the chat room was saying the quality looked too good for it
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.280]   to be Google glasses.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:33.360]   But they had someone with a camera on as well.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.840]   You could see that they were cutting back and forth.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.200]   Well, they cut to a much better quality picture.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   The glasses do not have 3G or Wi-Fi only right now.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.840]   And so this is clearly not Wi-Fi.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:49.240]   I would guess that they glasses were connected to a pack that had 3 or 4G built into it.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.480]   And here he is coming down.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.520]   We speculated that it was maybe a live view, which we've used.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.760]   They have a small-- they have a very small unit it could have been.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.480]   There's other companies making something similar.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:02.280]   I thought I saw some wires kind of coming off the back of the ear that went down to
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.280]   a battery.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.280]   That's a very good image, though.
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:06.600]   And this is from the glasses.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.760]   And then we got the ground they cut to--
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:09.760]   Then they have.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:10.760]   You can see it.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.760]   That's a camera guy.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.160]   And you can actually see the camera operators running around a little bit.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.520]   These are the people landing.
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.920]   At this point, Niskoni, the whole hall was just like--
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.920]   Losing it.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.920]   Everyone was losing it.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:24.040]   But it was this like tense silence.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.640]   I mean, it was just-- it was ran-- the energy just went up.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:27.640]   Yeah, they didn't.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.640]   Well, it was clear.
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.160]   Sorry, it was clear that he was not sure that this was going to work.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.720]   And he was amped and kind of breathless and excited.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.920]   Which is why you should do stuff like this.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.920]   Takes some chances.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.920]   Absolutely.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:45.760]   And they hand off the glasses to some acrobatic bicyclists on the roof who actually took my
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.160]   breath away because they rided the edge of the roof to a ramp.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.160]   This was crazy too.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.120]   And they jumped to the next building.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.680]   No, no, no, no, no, no!
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.640]   And you could tell the audience is kind of going, what?
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.080]   At this point, we were all just like holy cow.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.760]   This is the best there's never been.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.920]   And now they're handing off the glasses.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:12.280]   Now it's funny because as it turned out, this was a non-working prototype.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.760]   Sergey pulled it out of the pouch and nothing happens.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.760]   I think this isn't.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.760]   That's not the point.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.840]   Nobody's paying any attention.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:20.760]   So now this guy's going to repel down the side of Moskone's center.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.600]   How did they get permission to do this?
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.360]   How did they rehearse this?
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.360]   I mean, look at this.
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:28.320]   I mean, see when they rehearse it at Google.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.320]   I don't know.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.320]   They might have rehearsed it.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.320]   Is they should have been here at the end of them doing it?
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.560]   Yeah, they would have done it at Moskone because it would have stopped traffic.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:38.560]   I mean, look at that angle.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.560]   The guy running down the side of the--
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.320]   I'm still just telling the guy, oh no, we're not on the first floor.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.320]   He ran all the way to the bottom.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:49.360]   Then he gets on a bike on the balcony when he rides in on a bike.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.360]   And the less people over in the--
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.280]   They aren't going slowly into the hall either.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:58.480]   It's pretty clear that-- so this is not the glasses.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:37:59.480]   This is-- that's the glass.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.480]   This is another--
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.480]   That goes through--
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.480]   A lot of hands.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.480]   This is the goes in the--
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.840]   A kin to the Olympic torch being heavy on it.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.840]   I know.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:08.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.840]   And the riding through outside.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.240]   I'm amazed nobody got clipped, to be honest.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:15.560]   This is kind of like me running up fourth street on the way to the things.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.520]   And into the hall where you guys are.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.520]   That must have been very exciting.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.520]   It was exciting.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.520]   It was exciting.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.520]   It was a showmanship.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.520]   I have a press pass.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.520]   I'm sitting in the press section.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:27.520]   I'm trying to kind of keep my applause.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.720]   You know, I'm trying to be cool, right?
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.320]   It was difficult though not to applaud for these people.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:33.320]   Pro tip.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.520]   Or if not the corporate tactics and the who the human effort.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.520]   It's OK to applaud this.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.160]   Yeah, you gotta applaud these people.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   This is not a product.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.160]   I mean, they just--
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.160]   These are amazing.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.160]   It was an athletic feat.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:47.840]   And then this like, you know, crowd of glass wearing athletes kind of like strutted in
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.680]   all badass and everyone was taking pictures and there were lights.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.680]   It was crazy.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.720]   How long before they do the slow motion walk video of this?
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.040]   Because watch is they come in the hall.
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.040]   They look very stud--
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.040]   They do.
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.560]   Yeah, they do all of their look very studly wearing the glasses.
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.160]   They're very right stuff.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:04.640]   Yeah, it's like, oh, right.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.000]   That's pointing to the--
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.520]   Sergey handled this, I think, pretty well too.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.880]   He made it a little more exciting by being somewhat uncertain.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.160]   Yeah, he was uncertain.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.160]   He was excited.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.160]   He was--
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.160]   I mean, he's--
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.160]   I don't believe this is going to work.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.160]   He's a pilot, right?
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.160]   He's really into flying.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.240]   So not that I've ever met a pilot that was ever in support of Skydiving.
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.240]   Why would you ever jump on the corporate plane?
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.240]   We need the slow motion.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.240]   Yeah, but check this out.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.240]   This is--
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.240]   Don't fall.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.240]   Don't fall.
[00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:30.240]   Right stuff, isn't it?
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.240]   Yeah, don't fall.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.240]   The right stuff, isn't it?
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.240]   Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.720]   Yeah, people are going nuts.
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.640]   It was pretty jaw-dropping.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.480]   That's a good demo.
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.520]   Yeah, it was a really good demo.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.520]   It really was.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.120]   Oh, man.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:50.760]   All right, absent that, we actually learned nothing.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.760]   I don't know.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.760]   We learned that you can take pictures.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.760]   But we knew you can take pictures.
[00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.760]   We've been seeing pictures for months.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.760]   You can take pictures.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:39:59.760]   It's like, from your point of view.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.760]   From your point of view.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.760]   Did I mention that you can also take pictures?
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.760]   Because you could just take pictures.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.760]   Because you could just take pictures.
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.760]   With your--
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.760]   From your--
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.760]   Look, here's a baby.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.760]   Yeah, from your--
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:11.760]   Yeah, from your--
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.760]   Yeah, from your--
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.760]   Yeah, from your--
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.760]   Yeah, from your--
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.760]   Yeah, from your--
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.760]   Yeah, from your--
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.760]   Yeah, from your--
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.760]   And that picture is being taken by the mother.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.760]   So, okay.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.760]   So, how do you take pictures?
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.760]   What do you do?
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.760]   You just--
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.760]   Well, right, I know.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.760]   Do you cross a button?
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.760]   Are you shrugging?
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.760]   Are you--
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.760]   They said that it is just your wear.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.760]   So, you can go like this.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.760]   You could blink.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   I don't know.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.760]   They said it's paying attention.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.760]   It's watching your gaze.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.760]   And it's actually that interesting.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.760]   Yeah, but I have to say, the baby video--
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.760]   I was curious.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.760]   I mean, you know, so the skydiving thing was great and exciting, but not all of us are
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.760]   going to be skydiving, repelling, and jumping across buildings every day.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.760]   But looking at your newborn who won't give you--
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.760]   --give a big, boldy camera--
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.760]   --crisis.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.760]   --a smile--
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.760]   Yeah, I mean, that was--
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.760]   --right, so--
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.760]   --that was pretty powerful.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.760]   That's true, and the newborn looks back into your eyes because he's a smile.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   Yeah, and smiles because he sees mom.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.760]   Yeah, that's--
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.760]   --that's pretty powerful, so--
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:02.760]   Now, I thought this might get the biggest roar from the crowd at the very end, and we're
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.760]   jumping ahead a little bit.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:09.040]   Vic comes back on stage and says, oh, and by the way, we're going to let those of you
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.680]   here buy these.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:12.680]   Did you get excited?
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:13.680]   I was pretty excited.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.680]   I want to put those glasses on.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.680]   I was less excited when I heard $15,000.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.040]   When he heard the price, I was like, we're buying it.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.760]   And then $15,000, it was like--
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.480]   --and he said it's not going to work very well.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.560]   Right, not going to work very well.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:30.360]   We only want people who really care enough about this, or as you said in the car up here,
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.360]   or really rich to try them.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:33.360]   I don't even want to buy.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.360]   And then it's--
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.360]   I'm a thing.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.360]   Can I expense that?
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.360]   And then it's next year.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.720]   Right, and then it ships next year.
[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.360]   So you order today, you can only order Ad I/O, and then it ships early in the show.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.960]   So I have a text from Jason Howell of all about Android and TNT.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:45.960]   He's there right now.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.960]   He says, should I get the glasses?
[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.040]   Should we take a vote?
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.640]   I think that what he meant to ask was, can I use the credit card?
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:54.960]   He says, exactly.
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.320]   He says, you want me to sign up for Project Glass?
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.320]   You could have mine if you want.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:03.480]   Yeah, with my money.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.880]   Should I say yes?
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:05.880]   Everybody in the chat room says yes.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.880]   I think I think you could.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.880]   Yes.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.880]   Do they keep your money?
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.280]   No, they probably don't bill you until later.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:14.240]   My favorite tweet of the entire morning was Tom.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.760]   Order one pair.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:19.520]   Tom tweeted, Eileen, in all caps.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.280]   Order the glasses.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.840]   Exclamation point.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.520]   And then they told us the price.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:30.120]   And as I remember, Tom said, stop it.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:34.360]   But yeah, it reminds me of as way back when I used to do video game development.
[00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.680]   And they bring out a new console.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:37.920]   And you had to pay for the development machine.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.000]   Prototypes are expensive and one of things.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   Sure.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.440]   This is not an early manufacturing run.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.680]   This is like, we've got a bunch of these that they-- the ones they're wearing, they
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.000]   probably will handmade.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   Right.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.800]   This batch will be an early manufacturing run.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   And it'll be flaky.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:54.200]   And they want to make sure that-- I think it's deliberately to deter.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:57.520]   They've pretty set that price deliberately to deter people from going, oh, yeah, sure.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:00.280]   And so like, oh, that's like a whole new laptop.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.600]   Delta 9 is pointing out that I could probably sell it for $3,000.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.000]   Yeah, I mean, that was right.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:05.520]   Right.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.200]   Could make a little money on the side there.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.960]   I'm going to try to use that argument with my wife.
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.440]   When we're done, we'll sell it on eBay.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.280]   Yeah, we'll make a profit, honey, really.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.080]   It's cool.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:14.800]   Probably will, actually.
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.120]   I look like a complete dork.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.080]   But really, we'll make some money from it.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.000]   She's going to say, OK.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.600]   But you cannot wear these outside of the house.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:22.600]   Right.
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.680]   You can't wear these without--
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.180]   Right.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.720]   Anywhere where we're supposed to be looking at it.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:26.240]   Right.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:26.720]   Right.
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.880]   We're supposed to have some things.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.320]   People trying on Sergey's glasses.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.440]   So this is the only thing.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.320]   I mean, we still don't know even is it Android?
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.920]   Does it tie to a phone?
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.840]   Does it-- how do you control it?
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.640]   We don't know anything about it.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.760]   Besides the fact that it takes pictures from your point of view,
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:42.560]   and video.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.760]   Pictures and video.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:44.400]   That's all we got.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.640]   And it's a decent camera.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.400]   Although--
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.080]   Decent.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:50.280]   You take the sensor out of any Android phone.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:51.120]   And it's not that big.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.600]   I mean, I could fit that sensor in all the supporting hardware
[00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.600]   and a small battery, I guess, into something that
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.560]   would fit over my ears, right?
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.960]   I believe there are things like this already.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.840]   If all you're talking about is cameras,
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.120]   a chat room, isn't there a company that
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.440]   makes something that is basically glasses that you wear
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:09.840]   that take pictures?
[00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.920]   They don't-- that doesn't do anything else.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.680]   Right.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.840]   So I don't think that that's particularly innovative.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.120]   We'll have to wait and see.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:16.620]   Yes.
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.360]   We'll go back to that.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.440]   The assumption is that it's talking to a phone in your pocket.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:21.320]   That's my assumption.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.960]   But I don't think they've even said that.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:27.440]   I think-- well, yeah, I think I'm thinking they've shown that.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.160]   But yeah.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:30.120]   Is it Android in here?
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.440]   Or is it a peripheral--
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.760]   Or is it Android accessory?
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.160]   If the designer said they wear less than sunglasses,
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.640]   the battery isn't in them.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.800]   No, they said the battery's in them.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.200]   They said it.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.320]   I think I remember reading that the battery is in them.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.800]   It's very confusing.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.480]   If the battery's not in it, then you're
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.440]   having a wire leading from your glasses to your pocket.
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:49.040]   Tell me that.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.040]   What is it?
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.480]   Look.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.480]   OK.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.000]   Anyone?
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:54.480]   I just want to--
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.000]   I don't know.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.080]   I hope not.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.520]   This is Sergey with a thing plugged into a wire going
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.000]   to the glasses, and Liz Gans is wearing them.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.680]   That's the pickup so that you could see the output.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:05.560]   You know what let's call Liz?
[00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.080]   Liz, what's going on with that?
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:08.520]   All right.
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.400]   There's more to talk about.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.920]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.600]   This was a long keynote.
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:16.040]   We've now kind of shown you the really most exciting thing,
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:16.400]   right?
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:16.920]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.280]   Well--
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:17.880]   That was fun.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.000]   Two other devices we haven't talked about yet.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:20.960]   I'm waiting them.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:23.080]   We're going to talk about that in just a second.
[00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:27.560]   Also, Google Play has encryption now.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:27.760]   OK.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.920]   Developer explained to me why the developers--
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.160]   does that mean that's for security?
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.680]   I think so.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.880]   It's not any piracy.
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.680]   I mean--
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.440]   As they said, it was signed for that one.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.760]   So that basically you could only decrypt it
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.280]   on that device that bought it.
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:41.480]   Right.
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:42.280]   The device ID is actually--
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.240]   DRM.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.320]   Yes.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.000]   That was whether they went over it quickly.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.040]   They did go over it quickly, right?
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.480]   But it was a way to embed the device ID into the APK,
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:53.600]   which is the application package, to say,
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.760]   you purchased this on this device.
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.120]   It's only going to be installed on this device.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.120]   Personally, I don't care about this.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.840]   I turn this off when I upload it to my app.
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:45:59.360]   I get to do that.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:45:59.840]   It's your game.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.880]   Right.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.880]   The incremental app updates I really like.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.160]   I thought I was excited about.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.880]   So only the parts of the APK, which I've
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.840]   changed, get downloaded, which is great for everybody.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.600]   Less bandwidth, less installation time.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:12.560]   It's just great for everybody.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.220]   And I assume they use that smart compressed
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.400]   they develop for Chrome that's really good at compressing code.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.080]   Oh, I hadn't thought about that, but yeah, that makes sense.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.760]   There's a good technical about it.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.920]   But basically, they looked at code, say, oh, right,
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.400]   code is really compressible if you understand code.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:25.920]   Right.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.280]   And you can compress it by--
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.240]   if you understand what the address offsets are on all
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.960]   the pieces where the jumps are, you can actually compress it
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.480]   really easily, because then you can move it about.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.240]   If you don't understand that, all the address offsets
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.400]   don't work very well.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.560]   So you have to turn the absolute jumps to relative jumps.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.880]   So there's a bunch of kind of stuff
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.920]   that they built for that, which is deployed in the Chrome
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.360]   update cycle, which how they can do those updates
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.120]   quickly.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:48.040]   So I think they've moved that brains into this as well,
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:48.960]   which would be really good.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.760]   Yeah, it's really nice to see these things converge
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.800]   and to see different technologies kind of benefit one
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.560]   another.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:58.600]   So Darren Murph writing for Engadget says, here's
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:02.600]   what we know about Google Glass.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.920]   They were able to talk to people at Google I/O.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:07.040]   Engineers are experimenting with connectivity options,
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.560]   existing prototypes, including those worn in the skydiving
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.920]   stunt do not have 3G or 4G connectivity.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:18.080]   Although it is possible such a module could end up
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.320]   in production devices.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.520]   The general idea is latching onto nearby Wi-Fi hotspots
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.400]   or relying on a wireless tether with your smartphone.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.840]   So there you go with a smartphone.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.360]   That was the picture we saw.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.720]   Controlling Glass will rely on a mixture of inputs.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.840]   It'll recognize voice commands while also taking cues
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.200]   from the right sidebar.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:40.120]   We've seen Sergey do that to swipe his temple to do things.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.480]   The touch sensitive pad on there that'll understand gestures.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.720]   It's also probable Glass will be able to be controlled
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.160]   by a via one smartphone.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.800]   But physical inputs would be the preferred ones.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:51.440]   There's an accelerometer and a gyroscope
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.600]   so you could nod or shake your head.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:56.720]   The internal batteries, it's just behind the ear
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.160]   on the right side.
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:47:59.640]   There's the battery.
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.320]   Nice.
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:00.840]   Nice.
[00:48:00.840 --> 00:48:01.640]   Good looking.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:07.520]   Capacity and longevity not confirmed.
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.000]   Glass will be able to record locally.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.160]   But the idea is to have most everything streamed live
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.960]   to the web.
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:14.960]   Great.
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.320]   Take them off before you go to the bathroom.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.720]   In an area where wireless data is not available,
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.640]   storing video locally will be possible for uploading later.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:26.600]   So that's inside stuff that they can confirm.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.560]   Now they mentioned when they were talking about Play Cloud
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:29.080]   messaging.
[00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:30.440]   Now I was really interested in that.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.560]   Is that sending intents through the cloud?
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.160]   Would that mean that I could control an app?
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.960]   I mean, they're close because Play will install.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.400]   I can go on the web, say install it,
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.640]   and my phone starts installing.
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.160]   That wasn't clear.
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.080]   Well, they remember that.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.520]   They said go to the session and they didn't explain it.
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.120]   I'm assuming it's an iMessage competitor.
[00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.560]   That was my takeaway.
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.760]   They did it really quickly.
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.000]   It was C2DM.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Well, they just said--
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:51.800]   And it was like, what?
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:52.160]   C2DM's.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:55.240]   So cloud messaging, they just said free for all developers,
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.240]   no quota limitations.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.040]   But I still wasn't clear on what exactly it was.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.000]   I mean, there's the same thing that
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.840]   lets you send up notifications to the device.
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:01.840]   But I think they meant that.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:02.280]   Right.
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.840]   I think they meant individual ones.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:08.400]   That was-- Android Cloud to Device Messaging Framework.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.000]   C2DM.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.440]   So this is a service that helps developers send data
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.880]   from servers to their applications.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.680]   So they're like, push messages from the server?
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.080]   So lightweight mechanism servers
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:21.960]   can use to tell mobile apps to contact the server directly,
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.800]   to fetch updated applications.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.360]   Basically, you mean your app doesn't have to wake up
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.280]   in polls, so it should be good for battery life.
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.040]   Instead of polling--
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.880]   Instead of polling, push.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.720]   You can-- your server-side app can--
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:38.200]   C2DM has been officially deprecated as of June 26, 2012.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:42.840]   So I guess it's now replaced by GCM--
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:44.040]   Google Cloud Messaging Framework.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:44.040]   Right.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.680]   And so this supersedes that.
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.180]   Right.
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:46.680]   So it's deprecated.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:47.680]   This is the thing that I was talking about.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:48.880]   Does the same thing.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.200]   This could be lightweight messaging,
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.160]   telling the Android application there's new data to be fetched.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.000]   So hey, I got something for you.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.440]   Or it could be a message containing up
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.960]   to four kilobytes of payload.
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:01.840]   So you could use it for instant messaging.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.680]   Yes.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:03.680]   Or tweeting.
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.680]   Or tweeting.
[00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.200]   4K is quite a bit, actually.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.560]   Quite a bit of text.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.440]   You're quite a bit of text.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.520]   Not so much for images.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:12.240]   Very short piece of audio.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.640]   It handles all aspects of queuing of messages
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:16.520]   and delivery to the target Android app.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.560]   That's cool.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.480]   I don't know if there's an analog in the Apple world,
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.320]   but I think there is.
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.520]   I think when they introduce notifications,
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:23.440]   they introduce some lightweight--
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:24.440]   Right, great.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:24.960]   --push.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:27.200]   I mean, any app right that was going to update with new content
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.280]   that could benefit from that.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.240]   And then magazines.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.000]   That was the deadest oldest response in the whole thing.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   And we've got magazines.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:35.520]   Any pause?
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.280]   Anyone was like, huh.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:37.800]   OK.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.440]   Magazines.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.440]   Magazines.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.360]   I think you remember those.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.200]   Yeah, they're magazines.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.200]   What are those again?
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.880]   You print there's something--
[00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:44.840]   Yes.
[00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.840]   Magazines.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:47.000]   Movies for sale.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:47.520]   Movies for sale.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.400]   Not just rental TV as well on the Play Store.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.200]   This was all sort of build up to--
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:54.200]   The Nexus 7.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:55.400]   The Nexus 7.
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.640]   So you're both going to get one later today.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.200]   I was hoping that you would push forward in the line
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.800]   and you would say, I want one.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:03.480]   I'm going up to the brick house.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.240]   I need to bring it for that, but you didn't.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:10.600]   It is a sea of very elderly backpack laden nerds down there.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.240]   And they said they were going to start at 4 PM.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.320]   So that line at 4--
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.000]   in fact, I'm probably going to wait till tomorrow.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.320]   Right.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.000]   Well, I don't know if I'll be able to wait till tomorrow.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.200]   So I'm going to wait.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:19.960]   Tegra 3.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.280]   It's the first Tegra 3 device.
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.600]   That is a very, very fast system on a chip.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.800]   They mentioned quad course CPU.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:26.640]   And what do they say?
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:29.280]   16 GPU threads or something?
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.600]   Some huge--
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.320]   The spec sounded very nice.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.280]   And they demoed it.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.280]   It looked fantastic.
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.720]   It looked really good.
[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:36.800]   Really amazing.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:42.360]   Real time 3D stuff, 12-core GPU, gyroscope, accelerometer,
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.680]   nine hours amended, by the way, later to eight hours
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.080]   of video playback.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.040]   Was it amended?
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.320]   And if you go to play.google.com right now,
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.160]   it's on the front page.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.240]   It's for sale right now.
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.080]   Why are you doing it?
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:53.560]   I know you did.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.480]   You covered.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.480]   You keep yours.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.400]   You keep lying.
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.200]   That's yours.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.200]   He was kissing.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.800]   And I ordered one.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.640]   So this is the Google's Kindle Fire for the Play Store.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.520]   This is not an iPad.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.640]   But more responsive, I think, than the Fire.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.200]   Because I think Google looked at the Fire and said, that's crap.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:10.880]   We can do better.
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.320]   And we want people buying stuff from our store.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:17.960]   How often have YouTube rented movies from the Google Play Store?
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.360]   I do it from Apple all the time, every day, almost.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.280]   From Apple.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:22.400]   From the Apple Store.
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:22.600]   Right.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:25.200]   But how many times have you rented something from the Play Store?
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:26.520]   I think it's the Play Store.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.280]   You used the Amazon one.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:29.600]   I use Amazon quite a bit.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.120]   Amazon I use.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.520]   You used the three ones on Amazon quite a lot.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:32.320]   So what prime?
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.520]   Why not use Play?
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.160]   Because you'd have to watch it on your phone.
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:40.480]   We're going to get to the solution of that in a second.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:42.960]   $199, that is a shocking price.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:46.200]   That's the same thing right at Amazon, available next month.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:50.920]   $250, $249, $2.49 for 16 gigs.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.480]   Target's straight at fire.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:55.960]   And obviously, unless you feel like the connection to Amazon
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.200]   is important for you, it's going to be
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.560]   a fire killer, I would say.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.080]   I would agree.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.640]   I mean, it has all the Google productivity apps built in
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.200]   as well, right?
[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.600]   So the Fire is very much a media consumption device,
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:06.720]   an e-reader watching.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.080]   But with this, you get Google Calendar, you get Gmail,
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.520]   you get all the Google goodness, Maps, you get all that.
[00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.520]   That's the with Google.
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:13.520]   Right.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.600]   The Kindle Fire is a not-a-with-Google Android.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.280]   It's an open source Android, which
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.760]   means that they don't get all those pieces that you get
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:22.080]   by signing a deal with Google.
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:23.280]   So they were making a thing about that.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.280]   You get the full set.
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.000]   You get the full set.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:25.520]   Yep.
[00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.200]   Yep.
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.280]   And it will be ice cream sandwich.
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:28.800]   Yes.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.400]   Yes.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:29.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:30.560]   Oh, no.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.080]   Or deli bie, before one, deli bie.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:37.240]   And presumably, the Kindle app will still run on it.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.240]   Has Amazon done a video playback app for Android?
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:41.080]   For Android Android?
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.280]   Or only for Kindle Fire?
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.760]   I think just the Kindle Fire.
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:45.880]   I was wondering about that.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.600]   No.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.880]   Because they've got a very good point.
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.440]   I cannot watch Amazon movies on this.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.880]   I don't think you can.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.360]   That's a very good point.
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.720]   Anybody in the chat room, can you watch
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:57.440]   Amazon movies on your Android phone?
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.320]   I don't think so.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.160]   Or on your iOS device, either.
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:00.520]   No.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.040]   Right.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:01.040]   No.
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:01.520]   Right.
[00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:03.320]   The only reason why is Amazon is I can download to my Tivo.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.000]   Well, you can, but you're going to do it for the web
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.120]   and with Flash.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:06.320]   Right.
[00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:06.920]   You can do it right.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.320]   Certainly you can do it on the web for Flash.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:09.280]   You can do it on Google TV.
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.000]   And it's Flash.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.040]   And it crashes a lot.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.440]   And it-- yeah, it gets to us now.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.320]   A lot of us naps.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.680]   Yeah, a lot of us naps on that.
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.800]   I always download Amazon stuff to my Tivo.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.300]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.080]   You know, which is paying because you have to say send a Tivo.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.640]   And then you have to wait for it to download.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.920]   So I'm willing to switch to Google Play Store if I can get it
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.760]   on my TV.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:33.240]   Well, get ready because for a mere $300,
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:37.560]   I don't know why $199 seems like such a good deal for the Nexus
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:42.480]   7 and such a-- and $299 seems such a bad deal for this cube.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.760]   But it does.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.080]   They're the cube, I should say.
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:45.440]   Cute.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.400]   It's anything but a cube.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.400]   Well, it seems like a bad deal because that's three Apple
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:49.400]   TVs.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:49.840]   And the other thing--
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.600]   Yes.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:51.600]   And the other thing that's--
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:52.600]   That's a good way to--
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.040]   --to the price has a screen.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.120]   So it's like, what did you put in there?
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:59.280]   And apparently, the people saying the cost is they put a really
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.520]   good audio amplifier in there.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.040]   It's like--
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.400]   And now that's an interesting point.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:03.280]   So there's a 25 watt--
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.240]   I can't about that one.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.480]   Right.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:09.840]   Even Sonos, which is probably the most direct competitor for this,
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.520]   sells a connect-- it's $350.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.280]   It's a little more expensive--
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.760]   that lets you connect to the internet.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.680]   It's Sonos uses a proprietary network, not your Wi-Fi.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:20.040]   It uses a mesh network.
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:23.080]   And it doesn't have an amplifier and the Sonos connect.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.080]   But--
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.080]   I--
[00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:25.600]   But Apple--
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.360]   But I have one of those, and I like it,
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:30.880]   because I'm into the Sonos ecosystem.
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:31.800]   But Apple says two things here.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:36.680]   Apple sells the Apple TV, which is $99, does this, does the TV.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.560]   And you can't hook it up to your own speakers.
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:39.240]   You can't be--
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:39.760]   HDMI.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.080]   You have to use an HDMI cable and go to your TV.
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:42.600]   You're a TV.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.080]   You're a TV.
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:43.960]   Which is all they said this did.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.240]   Which is how I do it.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.600]   But Apple also sells the little Wi-Fi
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.720]   extended thingy that has an audio socket on it
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:51.640]   that they've sold for years.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:52.000]   Yeah, but what--
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:52.640]   What Express?
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:55.400]   What Express that you can plug any headphone jack
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:55.920]   into a plug in.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:55.920]   Absolutely.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.520]   Because when that's analog, yeah.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.520]   That's analog out.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:55:59.040]   So I don't--
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.440]   And that's cheaper than-- you know, that's still--
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:00.720]   Now--
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.960]   That's a $100 or something, right?
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.480]   One of the reasons it's so expensive, it's made in America.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.320]   Yes, it is.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.000]   Made in the USA.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.320]   They made a point to kind of zoom in on that label,
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.280]   kind of on the inside.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.560]   That's very interesting.
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.200]   Yeah, I thought it was great.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.200]   That made me really happy.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.600]   And you know, they're pushing the social aspect of this.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.100]   OK.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:16.720]   They're calling it the--
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:18.240]   I mean, I'm going to throw me nuts.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.160]   OK, you come over to my house, I'm playing some music,
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.840]   you take over my playlist.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:22.640]   That sucks.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.200]   No, but I come over your house and say, Leo,
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.640]   did you see this kit video?
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:26.240]   And you can add to it.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:27.400]   You've got to see this.
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.600]   But the moment you get a second, we really don't want you
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.200]   to do it.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.000]   Did you see this kit and video?
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:33.340]   Come on.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.440]   But you don't do that with your friends.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.400]   You don't go like, oh, I'm passing around the little screen.
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:37.960]   I do it with their play, yeah.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.360]   Oh, have you seen this thing?
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:39.560]   OK.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:40.120]   And then you say--
[00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:40.280]   And then you say--
[00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:41.080]   --there's a solution.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:41.840]   --that already has a solution.
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:42.400]   Screen sharing.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:49.400]   They're saying, this is a playlist.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.480]   You can see the playlist on the screen.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.320]   You can manipulate it.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.760]   So it's kind of a turntable--
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:56.120]   Dave MacDee in our chat room says, great idea.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:58.680]   I have music listening parties with my friends all the time.
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:56:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.200]   And also movies.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.200]   Like, oh, hey, I bought this movie on the Google Play Store.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:03.720]   It's awesome.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:04.560]   Let's watch it.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.560]   And then I'll just send it to you.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.320]   Well, now, that's not going to--
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:09.000]   I would guess that's not going to work because I would guess.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.800]   But I don't know that the queue is logged into--
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:11.800]   No, they said that.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:12.300]   It's a movie.
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:12.800]   It pulls it from the cloud.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.840]   On my account.
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.160]   It pulls it from the cloud.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.480]   It just says, yeah, it's a text account.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.560]   The queue is not registered to the home users account.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.920]   No, the queue is registered to the home users account.
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.240]   But when you log into it on the Wi-Fi,
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.160]   it inherits the accounts of all the people who are there.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.280]   Yeah, like it recognizes devices.
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:25.440]   That was fun.
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:26.280]   I think that's cool.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.560]   So that was the neat part.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:27.560]   OK.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.560]   And that's the piece.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:31.160]   So I could bring a movie over in a--
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:31.660]   Right.
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:32.680]   --I could pay for the movie.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:33.600]   It's doing--
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.160]   It's doing--
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.160]   OK.
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.680]   Oh, I'm back on my day.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.520]   When we did--
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:40.560]   Did you bring his sketch over?
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:43.880]   Here, I brought a VCR cassette.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:47.480]   No, the analogy for me is the thing we did with iTunes.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:49.800]   When I was at Apple, which was, you
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:51.720]   can see all the machines in the room and everyone's connection
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:52.320]   and play that.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:52.800]   Right.
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:53.280]   Right?
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.200]   And that was very cool.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:55.920]   Right.
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:59.280]   Even if you weren't attached, you brought a laptop in.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.520]   And that actually did work over the net.
[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:05.080]   But Apple had to turn that off because the label's got grumpy.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:08.120]   So I was somewhat involved with that.
[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:12.600]   And the version we shipped would play anything over any URL.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.760]   And so you could actually subscribe to anyone's music
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.320]   anywhere, but it would find the local ones easily.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.400]   And then that gradually got turned off as the label's
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.960]   going, you can play music on other people's houses.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.960]   What the hell is that?
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.400]   Not going to allow that.
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.360]   Now, you can buy multiple $300 queues
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:30.960]   and put them around the house and plug in your own speakers.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:33.080]   So it could have a Sonos-like--
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.560]   So if you--
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.360]   You know, I--
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:36.320]   Yeah, well, this is--
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.320]   It is Sonos.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.360]   This is up against clearly.
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:39.360]   It's dead on a rival.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:41.000]   It's just bizarre compared to the Apple TV.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.600]   That's the piece that I don't get.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:43.600]   I don't understand it.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.840]   Apple is selling something in every retail mall in America
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.240]   for a third of the price.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.240]   They're just the same thing.
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:52.960]   If they made this $99, it might have a chance.
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:55.960]   At $300, I think it has zero chance.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.680]   Am I off base on that?
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:58:58.200]   Also--
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:58:59.280]   I want to play with it a little bit.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:03.400]   It doesn't have the screen sharing airplane thing.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:05.480]   They explicitly didn't do that.
[00:59:05.480 --> 00:59:07.280]   And that is the other--
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.440]   Apple TV is worth buying just for that, actually.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.160]   Wait, what's the screen sharing?
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:14.400]   So Apple TV, you can--
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:18.960]   from your iPad or your iPod or your phone,
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:21.200]   you can go to the bottom and say, share my screen to that.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:22.280]   And it goes on to the TV.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:23.520]   Oh, and so then whatever you're doing--
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:24.560]   So the way you're doing can be--
[00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:26.160]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:31.000]   And that's become the way we do presentations at work.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.800]   So everyone has an iPad, and we just have one of those.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.120]   And you just push into that and stuff.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.360]   It's shared around like that.
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:38.440]   And they just announced at the Apple thing last week,
[00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:40.920]   the week before, that the next version of macOS,
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:42.800]   we'll be able to send to that as well.
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:43.800]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:45.840]   So it doesn't do the-- it doesn't do the sharing.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:46.880]   It does do the screen sharing.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:51.000]   The nice thing it does is it does-- you're not having to push.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.280]   The problem with the Apple Airport Express one
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:57.280]   is that you have to have your Mac open and iTunes running
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:59.840]   to send sound to it, whereas this one is just queue them up
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.080]   and it'll pull them and play them.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.840]   So that is actually a better decision.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.840]   And I can see that making more sense.
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:05.840]   And fitting it--
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.320]   But wait, for $400 you could buy a pair of bookshelf speakers
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.880]   on the Google Play Store that will then
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.280]   turn your Google queue into a stereo.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:14.920]   Right.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.280]   To me, the differentiator is the app, right?
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.040]   That's it.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:18.800]   But that-- yeah.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.320]   But--
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.400]   You know, amps are not massive magical things.
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.160]   They're not expensive either.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.040]   And if I am the kind of person who cares about amps,
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.720]   I've already got a separate pre-empower system
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.440]   and a whole bunch of expensive hi-fi kits
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.800]   from the expensive hi-fi kits store.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.240]   I think Logitech is just saying, thank God,
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:35.720]   we didn't license this.
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.800]   That's all I'm thinking when I see it.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.760]   Well, you know, I'm assuming that at some point they'll go,
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.880]   OK, we'll license this and you'll
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.960]   get third party ones that don't have an amp in them.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.880]   They just have an HDMI cable.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.680]   Well, is there technology in here that you could like?
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.200]   I mean, what is the--
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:50.840]   Wait, it's Android.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.800]   Oh, it's Android.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.400]   It's a little Android device.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.040]   They said it's running the same chip as the tablet.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.040]   Also, it's micro HDMI.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.040]   What kind of--
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:05.520]   It's not a-- in fact, the connectors in general
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.240]   are a little odd.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.960]   You have to have banana plugs for your speaker wire.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:11.760]   They're banana plugs.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.240]   They're not--
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.920]   They're banana jacks.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.760]   No.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.000]   So--
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:17.680]   No, I mean--
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.680]   That means there's going to be a sudden run on a banana
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:21.920]   plug.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.480]   I happen to have banana plugs at home
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.400]   if anybody wants to borrow them.
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.920]   Micro HDMI, which is a type D HDMI.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.040]   It's not a standard.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:29.760]   There's plenty of space.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.320]   There's plenty of space.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.200]   It has ethernet.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.000]   I presume it has Wi-Fi.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.840]   And then it has TOS link.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.760]   It has optical out.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.560]   I don't think this is particularly competitive.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.200]   I think Sonos is here first.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.200]   I think Apple TV, if you're price sensitive.
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.640]   I don't-- I just don't see this.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.800]   I don't have a special word of fit.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:46.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.560]   Especially with Google TV.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.080]   Right.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.600]   Which we'll see presumably tomorrow, right?
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.400]   Yeah, presumably.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.280]   It's kind of weird.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.160]   But this is the first device they said
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.240]   that Google has designed completely from the ground up.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:57.680]   You know what?
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.280]   It is pretty.
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:58.920]   It's pretty.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.280]   It's got 39 LEDs that you can--
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.960]   It's programmed to do anything you want.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:03.560]   What do we say?
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.920]   It looks like the training device, the Jedi training device.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:06.640]   Yeah, you said that.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.400]   That was a good line.
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:09.040]   Yeah, that was a good line.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.200]   It looks like the ball that Luke Skywalker used.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.040]   Or the Death Star.
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.120]   You know, depending on how you want to look at it.
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.640]   Use your mind, Luke.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:21.840]   There, it looks even better with the banana plugs in.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.760]   I don't have it up.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.000]   That looks like an oud.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.360]   That's a little scary looking.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:27.000]   It looks like something's good.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:27.880]   Do you remember the oud?
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.400]   If he's-- you watched Doctor Who?
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:31.080]   I don't want Doctor Who.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.880]   They squid like this and they carry goggles.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.280]   They watch Glee because that's a great show.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.760]   I just think you guys did Doctor Who.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.520]   Moving on, I'm skeptical of the cue.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.960]   The Nexus 7 does look like that.
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.640]   It's a winner.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.120]   They did add events to Google+, I've looked at them.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.040]   I'm not sure how that is compelling.
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.800]   But what it does to me, say to me,
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:56.960]   is that they really are going to slowly make Google+ a hub.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:59.400]   Anything that deprecates E-Vite and Facebook events,
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.520]   I want to succeed.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.120]   Well, this is their response to Facebook, right?
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:04.720]   It's definitely their response to Facebook events.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.200]   And it looks pretty cool.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.160]   What I like is that they're the before, during,
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.160]   and after the event mode.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:11.760]   I like that a lot too.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.720]   And so if you're at an event with a bunch of friends
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.600]   with Android phones, then you can turn on party mode.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.000]   And everyone's photos get automatically updated
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.080]   or uploaded to the event page, which is pretty neat.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:23.240]   Yeah, it looked nice.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.120]   Hopefully it's less annoying than E-Vite and--
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.520]   Unfortunately, yeah, you've got to get all your friends
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.320]   on Google+.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.720]   And I think that that's really the deal here,
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.160]   is that they're just making it more and more compelling,
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.000]   hoping that more and more people will--
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:35.800]   It will get on plus.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.320]   Get on plus.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.040]   You can send invites to people by email,
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.480]   so you don't have to be on plus.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.480]   But you won't get that cool picture sharing, really?
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:41.960]   That's true.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:42.240]   Right.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.000]   No, you won't.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.760]   But what's nice is that the Google+ app is going out
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.880]   for iOS and Android, so it's not just--
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.640]   Right.
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:49.720]   That'll work no matter.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.000]   Yeah, I want to say what the emails invite someone
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.440]   who isn't running Gmail.
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:53.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.640]   What does it look like if you're--
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   What does it look like if you're Yahoo?
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.120]   It's changing.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:57.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:03:58.340]   All right.
[01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.200]   Well, let me start one here.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:04.900]   This is-- the event is let's go shoe shopping, OK?
[01:04:04.900 --> 01:04:07.820]   Because apparently that's what the image is.
[01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:11.280]   Unless that's like elegant.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.000]   Shoe shopping.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.440]   This is my ood.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.040]   And oh, yeah.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.680]   With full oo.
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:18.880]   Well, that's the ood.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:20.360]   But they have these orbs attached to them.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.400]   The oob orb.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:21.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.960]   All right.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:23.720]   Location.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.680]   Where should we go shoe shopping?
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:26.120]   I don't know.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.120]   I give up.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.500]   I don't even want to do this.
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.700]   All right.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.580]   You're asking me, Leo.
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.060]   You're on the table.
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:35.220]   Well, you should have made an event for this show.
[01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:36.500]   That should have been an app.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:37.500]   Exactly right.
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.460]   The show said we could have we invited to it.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:40.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.260]   Oh, what might I think of that?
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:41.760]   OK.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.540]   Here we go.
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:44.900]   Let's see.
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:47.300]   Anything else to talk about?
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.780]   The Wired magazine-- I don't know how they did this so fast--
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:54.900]   has a tear down already of the Nexus Q. People leap into action.
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:55.900]   And it's beautiful.
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:56.900]   It's beautiful.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:57.400]   Huh?
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.400]   I don't know how they got it.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.960]   Yeah, that's impressive.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.760]   Maybe this was provided by Google.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.120]   Yeah, they must have--
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.480]   there are a couple of stories that
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.120]   published about the Nexus Q before that they
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:07.960]   started talking about it.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.000]   So there was a-- there was a--
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.960]   32 LEDs on the circuit board here.
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.040]   And that does the dancing lights.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:19.240]   Oh, and what do you think of the music visualizations?
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.240]   Trippy.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:24.240]   Trippy.
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.240]   Trippy.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.620]   That's the word that leapt to mind.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:34.060]   Yeah, finally, a parody with Windows Media Player.
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:41.160]   So thank god we've got the Winamp module built in.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:45.440]   Anyway, Google Maps-- well, actually, right now already,
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.520]   there's considerable updates.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.520]   I got about a dozen new Google apps on my phone,
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:53.840]   including UpdateG+, but I don't like it quite as much.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.760]   It's not quite as pretty.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.360]   I like the kind of the slot look of the Google Plus
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.520]   on Android before.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.560]   Now it's a little bit more spacious.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:08.600]   We still have the kind of wacky animations.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.920]   Yeah, kind of laggy.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:10.800]   I don't like it.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:11.920]   I really didn't like that.
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.800]   It doesn't-- it's now the sidebar instead of the slide.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.280]   I like--
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:15.800]   I kind of--
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.440]   I like being in with that.
[01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.280]   This is more standard, I have to say.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.880]   And I'm getting invitations.
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:23.760]   And by the way, if you want to participate in these invites,
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.480]   you do need to update the app because the old app did not do it,
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:26.800]   of course.
[01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:27.680]   But now I can say--
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:31.720]   My Gmail inbox is packed right now with just all Google Plus
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.200]   invitations.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:33.400]   These are just folks that are--
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.160]   I try not.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.640]   Yeah, there's going to be some cleaning apps.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.280]   People are trying to work on this lunch.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.040]   Someone I never heard of has invited me to chat.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.880]   Yeah, I'm getting a lot of invitation.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.640]   A-S-D-A-S-D-A-S-D.
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:50.360]   Jeremy's invited to me to his birthday beer bash,
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:52.960]   which he's invited me to testing Google Plus events.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:55.880]   Roberts invited me to Fringe Circle's Fringe season 5
[01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.520]   begins.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:06:58.640]   Look at all of these.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.280]   Yep.
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.440]   Oh my goodness.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.720]   These are all invitations, folks.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:07.240]   Oh my-- oh my-- oh-- oh-- oh-- oh-- oh--
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.720]   I don't think I can get to the bottom of this list.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.160]   I think it's a bottomless list of intents.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.160]   It looks like Kevin's applications.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.240]   Holy cow, this is worse than Kevin.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:19.040]   Look at him only halfway through, folks.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:19.960]   Wow.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.960]   Aww.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.720]   These are the new notifications, actually.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.040]   It's not just invitations.
[01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:30.200]   So I don't-- I like field Google Plus.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.400]   Yeah, you like everyone better?
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.640]   I like field, but I'm not sure I like this one as much.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.320]   Anyway, that'll be updated on your phone.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.080]   They also updated Maps, now has the offline feature.
[01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.280]   And Google Earth now has a 3D feature
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.000]   that they talked about just a couple of weeks ago.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   That's already built into Google Earth.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.280]   It's not an update, but it just
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.720]   managed to not update G+ and lose it.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.040]   Oh, I just had a ton of-- oh, yeah.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:54.760]   It's been a little weird updating for Google Plus.
[01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.720]   But I just had a ton of updates.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.720]   YouTube got updated, all sorts of stuff
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.520]   they didn't even mention got updated on Android.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:07.320]   New York Times brings its content to Flipboard.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.280]   I mentioned that because Android now has Flipboard.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.120]   In fact, all Android's have Flipboard, right?
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.120]   Right, right.
[01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.760]   Which, that's to me what you're competing against
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.320]   when you're doing magazines on Play.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:18.000]   Nothing, very Flipboard-y.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.720]   It is a little Flipboard-y, yeah.
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.600]   It's scrolls rather than flipping.
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.600]   Right.
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:23.800]   I like Flipboard.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.720]   I'm a big fan of Flipboard.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:27.360]   I really didn't like that last iteration of G+.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.800]   When they went to everything being like--
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:30.360]   The little--
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:30.880]   Cinemascope.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.880]   Yes.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:32.880]   It was like you were looking through a little--
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.520]   Staying through shapes thing.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.760]   A little slot, everything.
[01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:35.360]   Yeah, it's like--
[01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:36.960]   So they apparently you're not alone,
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.520]   because that's-- that's-- now I'm gone.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:41.640]   But also, I don't like the way that text is like third-class
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.280]   citizen on there, and you can't read anything anymore.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:43.800]   Right.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.720]   It feels like a photo sharing app.
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.640]   So the notifications I've got popping up with tweets in,
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.800]   I find really useful.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.120]   The G+ app used to have the text bits being in text,
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.280]   and you could actually scroll through it,
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.200]   and then pop them down.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.000]   Now it is--
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:54.480]   Now they're like--
[01:08:54.480 --> 01:08:55.400]   They haven't fixed that.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:56.160]   It's still full.
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:56.880]   We just put some kind of text.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:56.880]   Right.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.720]   It's very image-set.
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.400]   And truncate it.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.680]   See these nice green tiles?
[01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:03.680]   I do feel a lot of pressure when posting to G+ to have
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.360]   this very rich media post.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.200]   Yeah.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.840]   I guess these are pictures that haven't loaded.
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.240]   I don't know what they are.
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:13.520]   Well, I've read a huge run about this in December, I think.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.840]   Whereas I was saying, because of G+--
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.800]   because of Facebook-favoring images,
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.680]   and because of Twitter-in-law-favoring images,
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.920]   we have these plague of infographics that
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.240]   has giant bitmaps.
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:24.840]   Right.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.320]   Anyone else who wrote an article
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:30.200]   has to put a photograph in it, and you end up with this--
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:32.120]   we're throwing huge amounts of bits across the wall
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:33.480]   to say less.
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.800]   You know, half the images you see in Facebook now.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.400]   Worth a thousand words, though, in the heavens.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:37.960]   Worth a thousand.
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:38.800]   And you know what, Tre--
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.360]   But they're like 15 words, back and forth.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:40.360]   I know.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.680]   And they're in the stupid font.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:41.680]   All right.
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:42.920]   They're just all fart.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.080]   In fact, Tre Rachlow says something very interesting.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.420]   The photographer, and who has taken great advantage of Google
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.000]   Plus, he thinks that, in fact, we
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.680]   are moving into a post-verbal world.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:52.080]   You're going to hate this, Kevin.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.880]   But then, in fact, images, which, for you know,
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.400]   hereditorally, were very always very visual, important to us
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.600]   in a pre-literate society, it's coming back.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.080]   I don't know if we're post-literate,
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:07.240]   but that we're going to start using images to express
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.640]   ourselves more.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.640]   Well, yeah, people already are.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.640]   That's true.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.600]   They're much more visual than we used to be.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.760]   People were as easy to do.
[01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.400]   You can just pull a face at things.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.000]   And do back.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.360]   Or you can use my face, wear, and or your age faces,
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.400]   or things like that to send little emoticons.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:28.760]   But to the point where all the text that's
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.240]   being written is being rendered as images,
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:31.720]   that's the point where we've gone--
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.680]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:36.360]   Instead of posting text, you post a picture of text.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.560]   Oh, I hate that.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.200]   Or you post-- instead of writing an essay,
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.280]   you create an infographic, which
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.360]   is the essay with some really bad pie
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:43.880]   chance in it.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:44.880]   Right.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.360]   Right.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.120]   I see what you're saying.
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:47.040]   I agree with that.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:47.920]   And it's not readable.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:48.760]   It's not--
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:49.680]   It's not searchable.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.320]   It's not accessible.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.720]   It's making the web worse.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.760]   And this feedback loop's been encouraged,
[01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:57.320]   because all these sites haven't done the effort
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.400]   to make good previews of web pages.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:05.080]   If you post a web page that give you half the first sentence
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.480]   in a link, but if you post an image, they go, oh.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:08.640]   We'll take the whole image.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.480]   Beautiful.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:09.980]   Right.
[01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:11.920]   So the feedback is fed the wrong way.
[01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:14.760]   The Google+ app on Android is exactly that.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:18.140]   And there is a role for that.
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:19.480]   Pinterest does that really well.
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:22.160]   It says, we will express the web in a visual form.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.560]   And it makes sense in that realm.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:25.380]   But to inject it into these other things that are more
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:28.920]   texty seems like you're missing something there.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.420]   Right.
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:29.920]   OK.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:30.420]   Yeah.
[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.360]   I'm a texty person, sure.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.800]   I mean, Twitter's still my social media network of choice.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.680]   And that's texty.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:39.760]   I mean, if you expand an image, they might show an image in line.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.380]   But that's just text.
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:46.340]   Apple wins a bid to block the Samsung Galaxy tab.
[01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:49.980]   That happened Tuesday.
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:52.340]   California judge instituted injunction banning
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:56.380]   sales of the Galaxy tab in the US.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:00.020]   This is at the request of Apple Incorporated.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:03.460]   Judge Lucy Coe wrote that Apple had made a strong case
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:06.420]   that Samsung had violated its design patent, which
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:08.820]   describes the front back and sides of a device that
[01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:10.200]   looks like the iPad.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.120]   It's the first injunction Apple has been granted against Samsung
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:13.920]   in the US.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.520]   Trial is coming July 30th.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:19.480]   Which--
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:22.600]   This is the older product.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:24.240]   The court said Samsung has been banned
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:26.800]   from importing the device or any other product that
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:30.560]   is no more than colorably different and embodies any design
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:34.240]   that infringes Apple patent.
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.480]   This is depressing because I think--
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.640]   This is really depressing.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.900]   I had like, thrown a spike in this last week.
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.320]   I thought so too.
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:44.320]   But Posner is, I think, maybe swinging extreme.
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:44.820]   He's not--
[01:12:44.820 --> 01:12:46.960]   Well, he wasn't even working as a circuit court judge.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.560]   I think he was slumming.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:52.240]   So Apple has rights to the rectangle?
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:55.960]   Apparently, Apple owns the 4-3 rectangle.
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:59.520]   The ban will go into effect after Apple delivers a $2.6 million
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.360]   bond to cover damages Samsung would suffer if the court later
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:05.720]   finds the injunction was issued incorrectly.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:08.760]   That tells you how many pads they plan to sell.
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.960]   It's only $2.6 million.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.400]   Dollars.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:17.240]   Very-- yeah, I think it's a little disappointing.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:22.120]   And once again, the IP and patent wars go on.
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:22.800]   We're going to take a break.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.160]   Come back with our picks of the week.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.480]   Gina Trapani is here.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.320]   Thank you for coming up.
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:29.440]   Really have grateful.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:31.280]   It's so cool to be sitting next to you.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.040]   Yeah, first time in the break house.
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.640]   I'm out of Skype in San Diego.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:38.840]   Hey, also here Kevin Marks, who-- is this your first time here,
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:39.340]   too?
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:39.840]   Yes, yeah.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.200]   Me to the cottage before I haven't been here.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:41.760]   Wow.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.080]   Well, we'll just have to have a party.
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:43.800]   It's an upgrade.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.960]   Let me send you an invite.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:47.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:51.880]   Meanwhile, I invite you to try Squarespace.com, everything
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.520]   you need to create an amazing website.
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.800]   And what I love about Squarespace is it
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:58.200]   makes it really easy to try it out.
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.000]   Let me explain, though.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.680]   I think it's really important to understand what
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.640]   Squarespace is.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:05.560]   It's hosting and a content management system,
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.920]   tightly integrated.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.800]   So a Squarespace site is always updated.
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:11.000]   It's always secure.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.360]   It's always on.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.280]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down,
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.680]   because they're using some very sophisticated, Java-based,
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:21.120]   virtual server technology that means they can turn on bandwidth
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.920]   as needed.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.520]   So it's-- I mean, it is the best hosting out there.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.240]   I could say that unequivocally.
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:28.920]   And the software is so cool.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:34.240]   You get templates, 85 plus professionally designed
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:37.000]   style variants from big name designers.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.040]   And the nice thing is that you can point and click your way
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.440]   to a unique looking website.
[01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:45.600]   You don't have to be a CSS wizard to do this.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:49.720]   However, if you do know CSS, it's even better,
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.880]   because they have a built-in CSS editor with code coloring.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.240]   It pops right out.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.880]   I mean, you could do anything on here.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:14:58.880]   I love it.
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:01.600]   They have the Google Web Fonts, 300 plus Google Web Fonts,
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.360]   integrated in.
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.320]   So it's funny what a small difference
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:09.640]   of a unique font can do to make you stand out.
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:11.720]   Most people use just generic four fonts
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.240]   that your browser's guaranteed to have.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.520]   These give you 300 plus new fonts.
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:19.200]   They've got a great iOS and Android app
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.560]   that allows you to post, moderate, update, even get stats
[01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:27.040]   about your site, all from your iOS or Android device.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.720]   It's a really, really nice device.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.920]   Really nice program, by the way, with full site previews,
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:34.440]   the works.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.480]   You can really do it all.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.560]   So here's the deal.
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:39.120]   Go to squarespace.com.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.680]   I don't even need to give you an offer code.
[01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.800]   Just that green button.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.360]   And you don't need to give them a credit card.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.040]   Just your name, an email address, a name for your site
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:47.640]   and a password.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.840]   And you're ready to try Squarespace free for two weeks.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:55.680]   You have virtual run of the entire Squarespace feature set.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:58.160]   And then if you decide you like the site,
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.320]   it's very affordable.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:01.360]   They've simplified their pricing now.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.880]   There's standard and unlimited.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:03.280]   That's it.
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.560]   Now, standard is as little as $8 a month
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.160]   when you buy a year package.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.200]   But my recommendation is take a look at the unlimited.
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.400]   For $16 a month, it's hosting.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.600]   You get unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth,
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:17.360]   and unlimited storage.

[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.680]   and hook it up so that it automatically goes to your site.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.600]   All of that.

[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.480]   Twig6 for the month of June.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.240]   That's the offer code, squarespace.com.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.400]   The secret behind some really gorgeous websites,
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.160]   including our own inside Twit blog, which we really
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:48.080]   have just loved using.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:51.680]   Gina Trapani, do you have a tip this week?
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:52.640]   Well, the tip--
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:53.760]   Use e-fights.
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.200]   No, I'm sorry.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.200]   Use break--
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.200]   No.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.920]   Well, we already kind of covered this.
[01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:01.000]   But if you haven't checked it out already, like I said,
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.600]   anything that deprecates E-Vite and Facebook events on 4--
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.120]   Why do you hate those?
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.640]   Well, I hate E-Vite because they--
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.400]   at one point, at least, they spam.
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.360]   I use a special kind of E-Vite only address
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.280]   and then was receiving spam.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:15.720]   Facebook events just bugs me because I just feel like it
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:16.560]   feels spammy.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.480]   It just feels like I get a lot of notifications of things
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:20.000]   that don't really matter to me.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.280]   And they're also just not integrated
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.160]   into my regular kind of scheduling apps, right?
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:24.760]   So that's--
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:26.240]   This is nice because it works with Calendar.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:26.680]   Well, right.
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:28.000]   It's integrated into Calendar, which we had
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:28.720]   uncovered earlier.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.320]   So if you go to plus.google.com/events, you can create an event.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.960]   You can check to see if the people who you want to go to the event
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.920]   are also free using Google Calendar.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.440]   It all integrates in your Google Calendar.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.080]   So once you've created the event,
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:41.600]   you can view the event on your calendar.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.160]   You see avatars of your friends who you've invited right
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.960]   there built into Calendar.
[01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:50.320]   And like we said, you can invite people who aren't necessarily
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:50.880]   on Google+.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.720]   I've been invited to Wichita, Kansas for the Spiderman
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.280]   premiere.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.800]   Of course, you can also spam your friends with lots of good
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:57.800]   nights.
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.640]   I've just seen quite a few of us.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:00.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.160]   So maybe, maybe not today, but--
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:06.000]   Don't send me an invite, please.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:06.880]   Oh, Google.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:09.280]   Oh, after hours of training, Paul Oaken feels--
[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.760]   Now that's the one they talked about.
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:11.640]   That's pretty cool.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:12.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.680]   I didn't get an invitation to that.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:13.880]   Right.
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.080]   That's going to be the first live.
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:15.560]   Oh, I did.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.080]   You did.
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:16.880]   You did.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:17.400]   Oh, I'm good.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.880]   That's going to be the first live.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:19.720]   By the way.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.400]   916 people are going so far.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:21.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.400]   Well, there you go.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.280]   Out of 3,000.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.080]   I'm sure there'll be plenty of--
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.200]   Can I forward this to you, Kevin?
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.360]   Can you forward?
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.400]   And this is nice because you could check availability.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.360]   You can actually load your calendar.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.680]   This is only going to conflict with the virtual coffee
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.200]   party that somebody's throwing in Wichita, Kansas.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.280]   So I think I'm OK.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:40.440]   I think you're all set up.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.480]   I'm ready to go for a night of interactive simulations,
[01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:44.840]   hands-on experiences.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:45.360]   This is nice.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.920]   I love the themes.
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:49.040]   Look, they look at it even moves because that's the--
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.040]   what do they call it?
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:51.040]   Cinemagraph.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:52.040]   Cinemagraphs.
[01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.040]   Cinemagraphs.
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:54.040]   Cinemagraphs.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.040]   That's ridiculous.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.680]   Let's not make up a new word for everything, shall we?
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.600]   It's a cinemagraph.
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.080]   That means there's a moving part of the picture.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:01.760]   Yes.
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.600]   I could stare at that for hours, but--
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:07.600]   Hypnotized.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:08.600]   It's a record.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.720]   Hypnotized.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.200]   It's nice.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:11.840]   I like this.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:12.680]   Look at that.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.680]   It's like a real paper invitation.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:15.680]   It's got to fold out.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:16.680]   It looks like that.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.480]   It'll be some stringy fold.
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:19.480]   It's very scumorphic.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.640]   There's some wax on it.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.640]   Yeah.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.640]   No kidding.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:24.640]   I want to steal.
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.360]   It's got a map, and I can get directions.
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:31.760]   To me, in a lot of ways, shows you how Google really does intend to leverage all of its assets.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.480]   This is actually a really useful idea.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:38.320]   The problem of moving stuff between email and calendar and all the other bits and pieces
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:40.480]   drives you mad half the time.
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:41.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:44.960]   Microsoft has a solution from 15 years ago with Exchange and Calendar and Decoration.
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:47.600]   That kind of sort of works, doesn't quite.
[01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:50.840]   It drives you mad when you're trying to use it on other devices.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.680]   That's why I was saying, I want to know what this looks like on Yahoo mail.
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:55.800]   I want to know what this looks like on an Exchange server.
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:00.080]   If I send these to people who aren't using Gmail, it'll still work.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.080]   That's the actual challenge.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:05.160]   I would guess this is HTML5, and probably this is very similar.
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:06.840]   The question is, what is the experience like?
[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.600]   Does it force you to sign up for G+ to say yes to it?
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.280]   The thing that was bugging me about E-Vy is E-Vy was like, someone's going to invite you
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.280]   something.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:14.280]   I'm going to tell you where or when.
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:15.280]   And she do click on this website.
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:17.280]   I'll screw you.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.800]   I'm not going to go then.
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:24.040]   Whereas the Facebook ones work because they're integrated in the flow there.
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:25.240]   So you can invite people there.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.800]   It always has a sense of who's there.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:28.520]   You can see the updates.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.840]   The model works for Facebook invites.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:34.400]   So I found myself using those to invite people to things because they work.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:38.080]   If I wanted something like this, I'd use Eventbrite and say, okay, I can invite a bunch
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.800]   of you here and you can say yes or no.
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:42.960]   But it always feels more like I'm inviting you something you're supposed to pay for because
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.640]   that's their default model.
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:49.280]   So I think there is space to do this right and what I saw looked good.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.000]   I'm waiting to play with it a bit and see whether it behaves well.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   And there's a little bit of doodle.com in there too.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.520]   So you can see like show me the times when my friends are available.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.280]   Yeah, like it'll check other people's calendars.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.280]   It'll be busy.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.280]   Yeah, it'll be busy.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.760]   Which is the piece you get from the exchange thing.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:10.400]   Some people did say that, well, I can see for instance that when I look at who's not going
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:14.800]   to this party, that one person not using Google+ is not going to the party.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:18.360]   So I don't think you have to join Google+, now they don't have a picture.
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:23.760]   No, the sad, loose, the sad, out line, but at least they were able to respond with that
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.760]   presumably without joining Google+, so that's a good sign.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.400]   Some people said that this kind of replaces Schemer.
[01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.200]   Do you think that that's the case?
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.560]   No, Schemer is more like bucket list.
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.680]   Bucket list, yeah bucket list kind of things.
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.120]   And we'll look forward to seeing all the photos for the Google I/O party.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.360]   That would be kind of cool.
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.360]   Yeah, that would be cool.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:46.080]   Because so you can sort of experience the event if you're not there.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.200]   So I'm going to say, no, well, I could go.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.680]   Maybe I should go.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:50.680]   Now I'm tempted.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:52.240]   Sounds like a good party.
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:53.240]   Jason's not going.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.040]   I can see who's going and not going.
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:56.040]   Yeah, maybe I'll.
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:57.040]   Yeah, come down with us.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.040]   I'll see you.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.040]   I'm just going.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.040]   I'm taking off.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.840]   You have a number in place of Mr. J.
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:05.880]   I would throw something else in too, which was the face recognition of the cats.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.520]   Do you see this story this week?
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:08.520]   That face recognition?
[01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:09.520]   So I hope I--
[01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.520]   What is the world coming to?
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:11.520]   I could be.
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.520]   So this was--
[01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.520]   Put the link in the notes so I can like--
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.520]   It sounds right up my alley.
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.520]   I could click on it, but I will click on it.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.480]   But this is in the chat.
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:22.520]   This is a paper that Google released this week where they're trying to do some fairly
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:26.240]   low level brain modeling research.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.720]   So they're building a neural network and they're trending on images, but they're not
[01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.000]   giving it a feedback loop.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.640]   They're just saying, here's a roundly wide neural network that show you an image, let
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:36.640]   it relax.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:41.840]   We're not saying, yes, that one's a face, that one's a dog, that one's a frog, whatever.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:42.840]   They just--
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.120]   So it doesn't learn at all?
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:49.120]   So it learns, but it's not-- it hasn't got a training set.
[01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.760]   They're just feeding it random images.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:54.800]   And after they've fed it lots of images from YouTube, they then look at the neurons and
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.920]   see what the neurons are specialized to.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:02.040]   And they found a neuron that-- you can see the picture there that looks for faces.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.360]   Basically, that's what it responds to.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.160]   So they actually created a neuron?
[01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:08.440]   So they looked at all the neurons and then they fed it things like, what is this one
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:09.440]   responding to?
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:10.440]   All that one's found faces.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.120]   And they did a map of what its response wiring looked like.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.120]   And it found--
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:15.120]   Wow.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.120]   Now this is a machine, right?
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.120]   This is not a human or a cat.
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.560]   And then there's a second one that the picture's in this paper aren't as good.
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.680]   There's a better picture of this in the Google blog yesterday.
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:22.680]   This is the cat face neuron.
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:23.680]   The cat face neuron.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.400]   And the human body neuron.
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.240]   So the cat face doesn't really look like a cat.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.680]   It does in the Google blog.
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:31.280]   It's just not a very good image on the PDF.
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:34.880]   And the body, you can see, it has a very generic-sized human body.
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:36.880]   So what have we learned here?
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:38.880]   So it's not so much what we've learned.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:42.880]   They've got close to modeling how the brain works in a useful way.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:47.880]   That's the piece that's kind of interesting because there's a better cat face.
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:49.880]   Oh, it does look like a cat.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:50.880]   Oh, where is that?
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:52.880]   That's in the Google blog.
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:53.880]   Wow.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:58.880]   So basically, it's like a tabby can, isn't it?
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:04.360]   So there was a long-held theory of brain research that you have specialized in the
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:06.360]   neurons that will fire when certain things happen.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:10.360]   And you'll have one for faces and one for your mother and stuff like that.
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:11.360]   Right.
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:14.360]   And they found one for human faces, they found one for cat faces.
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.360]   And by throwing them random frames from YouTube.
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:17.360]   Which is-
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:20.360]   So what you're saying is that this was a clean slate.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.360]   Yes, this thing had nothing.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.360]   Yes.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.360]   There was no pattern in it.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.360]   There's not the thing in your phone that says, I'm looking for a face.
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.360]   A face has two circles and a line.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.360]   Right.
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.360]   And then when the thing underneath is curvy, that means it's smiling.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:33.360]   It wasn't a thing like that, whether they had a template.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360]   A template.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.360]   This started from a blank.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.360]   This was-
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:40.360]   They just showed it lots of random frame grabs from YouTube.
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:43.360]   And one of the things they found was the one that was looking for faces, another one that
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:47.360]   was flying when they found cats.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.360]   And they were, you know, they wouldn't fire every time, but they were fairly good at detecting
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:52.360]   them even if you were rotated a bit or doing something like that.
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:56.360]   So it turned out 70% improvement and accuracy.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.360]   Over doing this.
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.360]   Over.
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.360]   Over the previous attempts to do this kind of thing.
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.360]   Wow.
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:02.360]   That's interesting.
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:04.360]   And the other thing that's set off in my head is right.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.360]   All right.
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.360]   And then when you're carrying a camera round on your head that's looking at everything
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.360]   all the time.
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:09.360]   It's cut to a lot.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.360]   There's a big data set, isn't it?
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.360]   That's, you know, you can join a few dots up there and go, "Oh, right.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.360]   Google's going to work out what everyone's looking at all the time and decide which one's
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.360]   a cat, so much one's a face.
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:23.360]   That's why I think Google has to get a little more sensitive to the creepy factor.
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.360]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:26.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.360]   They need to understand what real people might think about that.
[01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:31.160]   The glass system was very good at suppressing the creepy factor.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:32.160]   Right.
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.160]   You know, the shots they carefully chose?
[01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:35.160]   Babies.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:36.160]   It was nice babies.
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.160]   It was babies and pelicans flying past and people skied having had a zen.
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:45.240]   But if Google knows you're shopping for pants because it can recognize pants, only because
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.160]   you were wearing those glasses all the time.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.160]   Right.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:53.160]   And if you suddenly, it will have a high creepy factor if you don't understand how Google
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.080]   knew I was shopping for pants.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:56.560]   That's what makes it creepy, right?
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.560]   Right.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:01.560]   And what was the thing they said about the Google Now thing was that it would--
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.560]   Based on your searches.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.960]   You have to tell it what your favorite sports teams are because it knows what you've been
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:05.960]   searching for.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:06.960]   That's not--
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:07.960]   But it's--
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:11.080]   But they have tone deaf to how creepy that sounds to real people.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.960]   But if they show you in the interface, this is how we know, you know, like you're based
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:15.960]   on your last search.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.840]   Like, I feel better when I know, you know, why am I seeing this ad?
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.040]   Why are you suggesting this to me?
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:21.040]   How did you know that?
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.040]   This is how I knew.
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.040]   I'm not saying it's bad.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.040]   I'm just saying that normal people might care about it.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.040]   They're worried about it.
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.600]   What the array I will think about stuff.
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:30.600]   Yeah.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:32.600]   So they were saying things-- oh, we worked out what your commute to work is and there's
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:34.240]   a roadblock this week.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:36.080]   So you should go this other way.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.920]   There was-- it started to give you stuff like that.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.200]   But you know, there's a creepy factor to autonomous vehicles too.
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:44.040]   I think someone, Larry and Sergey, go, yeah, we understand because this is new and it's
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:48.240]   creepy because it's new and they'll understood and you're perhaps anthropomorphizing it into
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:51.920]   being a human being that's actually looking at you and you'll get used to it.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.000]   You'll get the same way you'll get used to a car driving itself.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000]   Right.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.360]   And in the long run, it will be better, safer.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:59.560]   Well, one of the things they cited in this paper was trying to tell the difference between
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.400]   a motorbike and a car.
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.080]   So they were-- it's something they're thinking about.
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.920]   That's probably part of that as well.
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:06.920]   So you said a number of the weeks.
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:15.080]   So the number I've got, which was a BBC news story, was that patent trolls cost US companies
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:18.720]   $29 billion in direct measurable costs last year.
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:19.720]   There you go.
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:20.720]   There you go.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:21.720]   That--
[01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:25.680]   They looked at all the lawsuits from the non-tax entities, the patent trolls--
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:26.680]   The calling.
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:28.480]   Worked out how much that cost and that was the--
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.080]   If it's $1 billion, it's too much.
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.080]   That's--
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.080]   That's a lot of--
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:34.080]   $29 billion.
[01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.080]   Potentially sold it up.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.080]   Exactly.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.080]   There's a lot of potential stuff.
[01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:38.080]   Think about how much innovation can happen with that money.
[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.080]   That's a lot of innovation.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.080]   Not to mention the chilling effect.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.080]   No, we don't eat-- we can't measure.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:43.080]   Right.
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:44.080]   This is just the ones that they could measure.
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:45.080]   It's actual costs.
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.080]   And they say that.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:48.080]   You could multiply that up.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.080]   So that was my-- do something about these parts.
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.480]   You know, Jeff tries to give us positive numbers.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.480]   That's what she does.
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:54.480]   Yeah, that was a downer killing.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:56.480]   I'm just kidding.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.480]   I'm just kidding.
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:59.280]   I'm in an up number.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.760]   I don't know where to start.
[01:28:00.760 --> 01:28:02.920]   There are so many new tools and new exciting things.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.160]   I don't know where to start.
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:10.360]   I would say immediately if you're using Android, go out and update your Play Store
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:13.080]   because there's a lot of new updates on the apps.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.360]   All the Google apps have been updated.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:20.000]   And I'm hoping that we will have a 7 because I have a feeling that may end up being a really
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.560]   cool device for--
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:23.560]   No, in the doc for you.
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.560]   There's a note in the doc for me.
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.560]   Shh.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.560]   Sorry.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:29.560]   Don't turn anybody.
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.560]   What does it say?
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.560]   It's in the chat.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.560]   What does it say?
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:33.560]   It's in the chat.
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:34.560]   You're quiet.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.560]   I'm not gonna say.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.560]   What?
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.560]   Oh.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.560]   I have to do an ad.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.560]   I thought you were gonna say something about how cool--
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:41.560]   Sorry.
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:42.560]   You thought it was much easier than that, wasn't it?
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:52.560]   How cool it was that there was a Nexus 7 sitting at the door for me.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.560]   Or something like that.
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:58.560]   No, I do want to mention backing your data up with carbonite.com.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:00.560]   I don't know how I forgot about that.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:03.560]   This is the ideal way to backup because it's automatic.
[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.560]   It's continuous and it's online.
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:10.560]   Plus, it's cloud storage for less than five bucks a month for everything on your internal
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.560]   hardware.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:12.560]   $59 a year.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:14.560]   That's how much it costs for an individual computer.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.560]   They have plans for external drives, multiple computers, small businesses.
[01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:18.560]   Here's what I would suggest.
[01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:20.560]   Go to carbonite.com.
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.560]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:23.560]   Just the offer code twig.
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:24.560]   You can try it for two weeks.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:25.560]   Mac or PCC.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.560]   See how you like it.
[01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:31.560]   If it's doing what you want, if you feel good about that, then when you sign up with the
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:36.560]   offer code twig, you'll get 14 months for the price of $12.59 a year.
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:37.560]   Awesome.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:38.560]   Carbonite.com.
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:40.560]   The offer code TWIG.
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:45.560]   If you're not backing up, just do yourself a favor.
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:48.560]   Just go there right now and set the backup up.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.760]   The peace of mind is fantastic.
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:52.440]   You will have a crash.
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:54.560]   And Chad says, "Thank you, Gina.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:58.160]   We're not letting Leo forget that."
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.560]   So that's my product of the week.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.560]   Darnit.
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:01.560]   Carbonite.com.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.360]   Hey, thank you guys.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:07.880]   We do have Jason and Eileen and Ron from All About Android.
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.200]   Our at Google I/O.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:11.360]   They're going to have a very good All About Android show.
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:17.240]   And I do think they're going to come back from the event with some stuff, maybe little
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:20.040]   ball shapes, force field tester.
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:21.040]   I don't know.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:23.120]   And maybe a little tablet.
[01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.120]   They're giving you an excess.
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:26.520]   What are you going to do with a Nexus phone?
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:27.520]   I'm going to use it.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:28.520]   Are you excited?
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:29.520]   I'm excited.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:30.520]   Are you still using a Nexus that way?
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:31.520]   Yeah.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.520]   Well, I have the Nexus S, which is also going to get jelly bean.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:33.920]   So I'm getting jelly bean.
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:35.960]   I'm just excited to try out jelly bean, honestly.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:38.720]   And yeah, I think I'm going to switch them back.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:41.800]   Finally, we got to rough that iPhone thing.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:42.800]   It's about time.
[01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:43.800]   I was pretty impressed.
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:47.160]   I have to say, last night I was looking at Google I/O 2011.
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:48.760]   And all the things that were announced.
[01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:55.080]   I mean, 2011 Google I/O was music beta, Android at home, ICS, the Galaxy tab, Android 18-month
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:31:00.600]   upgrades, open accessory API, the Chrome Web Store, Chrome Books, Google TV.
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:06.960]   None of those things were like huge kind of hits.
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.640]   So last night I was like, I don't know.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:10.280]   And I just don't think this is going to be that good.
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.280]   A lot of hardware.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:12.280]   I've got to say, a lot of hardware.
[01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:13.280]   Everything because jelly bean.
[01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:14.280]   I'm excited.
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:15.280]   We'll be back tomorrow.
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:20.280]   At 10 AM Pacific, 2 PM Eastern-- or 1 PM Eastern time because part two.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:21.280]   Right.
[01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.280]   This is only day one of two.
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:23.280]   What are we going to see in part two?
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:24.280]   Google TV.
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:25.280]   There's going to be a new Google TV.
[01:31:25.280 --> 01:31:26.280]   I think so, right?
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.280]   I think so, as well.
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:28.280]   I think the Sony unit.
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:29.280]   This today was very Android-y and--
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:30.280]   Chrome OS.
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:34.280]   --we see Chrome OS and Chrome browser and a bunch of the website stuff as well.
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:35.280]   Right.
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:37.280]   Last year, day one was Android and day two was Chrome.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:38.280]   All right.
[01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:39.280]   Sounds like we're going to hear about Chrome Chrome.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:42.280]   We're back here at 10 AM tomorrow covering Google I/O day two.
[01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:43.280]   Thank you, Kevin Marks for coming up.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.280]   I really appreciate it.

[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:51.280]   It's a little great to be here in student studio and sit next to you.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:52.280]   Love having you here.
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:55.280]   Who's on the triangulation tonight?
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:56.280]   Do we know?
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.280]   No.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:58.280]   We do not know.
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.280]   It will be somebody wonderful.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.280]   Meanwhile, it's time for TNT.
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.280]   Thanks for joining us.
