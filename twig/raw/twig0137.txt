[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.400]   and Apple asking Android handset manufacturers for a little bucksheesh.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.200]   It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.520]   Twitter, Facebook, all of that stuff.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.240]   Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University of New York.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.960]   Cooney, he's a professional journalist there.
[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.520]   He's also a blogger at buzzmachine.com,
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.000]   the author of a fantastic new book called Public Parts.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.800]   Great to have you, JJ.

[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.000]   Highlight of my week.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.120]   Say hi to Gina Trapani.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.880]   She is from smarterwear.org, founding editor of Life Hacker.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.760]   And also the author of a fabulous book.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.640]   I guess you did not mention this book.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.920]   The Life Hacker book.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.720]   The Life Hacker book.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.280]   Life Hacker book.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.000]   Now it's the third edition.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.800]   Life Hacker book.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.280]   Third edition.
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.000]   Yes.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.080]   See that what I did there?
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.200]   You say you are good.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.320]   You're good.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.520]   Are you headed off for South by Southwest after this?
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.120]   I'm not.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.600]   I'm not going this year.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.160]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.120]   This is going.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.520]   First time in six years, I'm feeling kind of--
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.280]   Why?
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.680]   I'm so sad about it.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.120]   It wasn't worth the time that traveled for me this year.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.640]   Although I am regretting it, seeing some of my friends
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.040]   talking about the panels that they're doing.
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.520]   And I know.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.800]   That's the FOMO fear of missing out.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.200]   But I try to do no FOMO here.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.760]   I try to be present where I'm at.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.200]   But yeah, I'm regretting it a little bit.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.800]   I think it's going to be nuts.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   I think that's going to be great.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.200]   I hope everybody who goes has a great time.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   I want to hear about it and see pictures and all that stuff.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.600]   It's a great time last year.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.680]   It's a social event now, really.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.920]   That's why we didn't--
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.240]   we had to decide whether to cover it.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.800]   Sarah Lane's going.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.000]   But we had to decide, do we want to cover it?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.240]   And I just decided there probably
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.440]   wouldn't be a lot of news there.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.120]   Unless something weird happens.
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120]   It happens.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.080]   It's not the SAPI of 2007, where Twitter launches
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.880]   or four-square launches.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.320]   It just isn't that anymore.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.400]   As much as I think a lot of new startups want it to be that.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.640]   I don't think it's that.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.840]   It's a similar to Comic-Con here in San Diego.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.240]   It's just so grown, so far out of proportion
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.520]   that it gets watered down and difficult to enjoy.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.440]   Although I love the SAPI folks and I hate to feel like I'm
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.800]   slamming them, I'm not.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.600]   It's been a great event.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.840]   I've gone every year for the last six years.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.400]   And I might go back next year.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.240]   Well, we'll have to talk about it.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.240]   Maybe the three of us are back.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.440]   It's just in your, Gina.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.240]   I got into a little bit of a semi-public tip on Google+
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.520]   because of their contract for speakers that
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.640]   doesn't let you speak anywhere else.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.800]   And I just decided that I was going to try something else
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.440]   this year.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.560]   I do regret the expansion to all the campuses.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.640]   And it's just hard to stand in the hall and see your whole
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.840]   world swimming by, which is the way it used to be.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.600]   And that's gone now with size and it's inevitable with size.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.320]   I have a friend of mine who runs another conference in
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.760]   Europe.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.880]   I won't say what it is because he said that his partners
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.520]   would kill him for thinking this.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.200]   But he said, you know, it's been around five years.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.040]   It's a really good conference.
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.480]   It's grown big.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.680]   Maybe it's time to kill it.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.520]   And that there's a natural size and a natural time.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.680]   And if you grow really big, one of two things is going to
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.000]   happen.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.720]   You're going to be Ted and become very exclusive.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.560]   Or you're going to become South by and you're going to
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.080]   become so damn big that you lose your charm.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.160]   And success is a wonderful thing.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.040]   I agree.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.160]   I love the South by people too.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.160]   I think they put on an amazing conference.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.400]   They do a phenomenal job.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.320]   They've obviously brought our whole tribes there.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.600]   But there was a dinner that I've had the last three years
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.000]   there.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.840]   And somebody started to organize it again this year.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.360]   And every single person at the dinner was saying,
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.080]   not there this year.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.720]   Not there this year.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.000]   Not there this year.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.520]   Well, maybe it's new tribes.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.240]   Maybe it's new people.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.160]   Maybe we're just too old for South by.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.640]   I don't know.
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.880]   Well, from a news point of view, I think because Twitter,
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.520]   and then Four Square, and then Gowalla launched so big,
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.160]   and it really put them on the map, three successive
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.840]   South buys, now last year there were hundreds of launches
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.720]   there.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.520]   And so no one could launch big because there was too
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.880]   much competition.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.800]   And so that's why I feel like I don't think we're going to
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.240]   miss any big launches.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.640]   I don't know.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.480]   What is the-- is highlight going to be the big app this year?
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.480]   Is any thinking about-- usually they tend to be social apps,
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.360]   location, aware, in the last couple of big launches.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.280]   What do you think?
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.880]   You guys, even though you were not going to be there,
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.400]   you're going to mind making any picks?
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.600]   Anybody know what--
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.400]   I don't even know.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.280]   And I just--
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.640]   I wait.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.160]   I feel a little fomo.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.040]   I love that phrase.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.840]   I'm going to use it for now.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.760]   I feel a little fomo myself.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.040]   It's like catarina fake, whether that's what I heard.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.520]   Yeah, is it?
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.400]   Yeah, perfect.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.320]   And I'm hedging my bet a little bit,
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.680]   because Sarah will be down there.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.040]   I said, Sarah, if anything, big happens,
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.200]   you'll be on TNT, and we'll have some coverage down there.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.760]   But of course, last year, there was a huge story
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.000]   with an Apple pop-up store because the iPad 2
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.400]   went on sale during South Buy.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.080]   This year, it's going to go on sale three days after South Buy.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.880]   And so maybe we don't need to be there for that.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.520]   I don't know.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.000]   I guess I should mention that we are recording this
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.280]   the same day Apple sucked all the year out of the room
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.640]   by announcing they didn't name it, just the new iPad.
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.840]   Which I love that.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.280]   Why do you love that?
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.280]   I love that they dropped the model number,
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.000]   that it's not the 3 or the 2S, or--
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.320]   I like that it's just the new iPad.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.480]   I think it's just simple and clear.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:40.680]   This is what it is.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.560]   Oh, you need to know.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.760]   This is the new iPad.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.360]   Tech writers are going to say the third generation or the new.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.320]   That's the only thing I don't like,
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.640]   is that they're going to be somewhat required to do that.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.160]   Right.
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.280]   Is it the last iPad?
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.280]   The ultimate.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.240]   So I'm serious.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.600]   Is it-- yeah, is this the last one,
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.040]   and the next one that they have in mind,
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.640]   Steve's next product is looking different?
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.640]   You think so?
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.680]   I don't know.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.800]   No, I don't think so.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.200]   No.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.000]   No.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.320]   I think this is-- oh, good.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.360]   I'm pre-ordering right now.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.880]   We'll talk about ourselves.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.680]   Would you mind?
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:19.160]   You got to watch-- I cannot think of an example.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.360]   In history, in the history of the world,
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.040]   where a company created a product,
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.240]   for which there was such instantaneous demand
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.200]   at a product at this price,
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.720]   starting at $500 and going up to $829,
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.920]   there was so much demand that they could not even--
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.720]   the website just--
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:43.080]   which means it must be more than a million people
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.040]   trying to order right now.
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.840]   No, full-on Leo.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.040]   You don't think that there isn't that
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.000]   somewhat engineered?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.640]   It was like, it's like,
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.640]   "Run out, run out, online all the time,
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.840]   and you know they have more in the back."
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.960]   No, I disagree.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.040]   I don't think Apple needs to play those games at all.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.880]   Some people do.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.640]   Apple-- Apple--
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.720]   I know.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.600]   They did it for the iPhone.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.400]   They did it for the iPhone.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.280]   They were running the--
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.880]   I think they may be the first time,
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.760]   but I think they can sell every single one they can make.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.360]   I think they've been making them as fast as they can
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:09.800]   for at least four or five months,
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.240]   and they would love to be able to fulfill every order
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.120]   just like that.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.680]   Why not?
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.560]   It's just money in the bank,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.920]   and they don't need more marketing.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.640]   I don't think you can make a case anymore.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.320]   I mean, maybe you could in the first iPad,
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.440]   or the first iPhone.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.800]   You don't need to make-- they don't need to--
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.000]   they don't need to do nothing.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.480]   They just need to sell it as fast as they can.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.760]   They need to upgrade their servers.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.480]   I can't think of anything like this.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.520]   There's no other-- it's amazing.
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.960]   Somebody's saying, "Well, what about the Woot bag of crap?"
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.960]   Okay.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.920]   You're right.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.960]   You're right.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.640]   It's the iPad and the Woot.com bag of crap.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.840]   There you go, right there.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.880]   That says it right there.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.520]   Those are the two--
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.560]   This is what a consumer economy we live in.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.840]   That's a good point.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.440]   The Woot website goes down every time when the bag of crap--
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.880]   They actually-- they have some sort of bizarre lottery scheme
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.560]   if you want to order a Woot bag of crap.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.640]   I feel like as a Google fan,
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.880]   it's my duty to make some sort of snarky remark
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.320]   about how Apple doesn't do web apps that scale well.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.920]   But I'm going to refrain from that.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.040]   No, I disagree.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.520]   I think you-- I brought this up in Mac Break Weekly.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.520]   Facebook can figure this out.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.720]   Google can figure this out.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.240]   Why can't Apple figure this out?
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.760]   It's not just their store.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.560]   It's Siri.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.720]   You know, it's more germane for Siri,
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.200]   which is only a bath of the time.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.960]   Notice they did not put Siri on this new iPad.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.160]   They put voice dictation,
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.760]   which will probably be just as broken.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.680]   And I think that this is a failure.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.960]   I think that is a failure.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.280]   I think--
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:42.920]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.560]   I mean, one could argue that it would be
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.680]   fiscally irresponsible to build your entire server
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.080]   infrastructure for two hours a year.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.400]   Right.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.120]   And so, you know, it'll be fine.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.720]   And we get a fringe benefit out of that.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.920]   People are going to talk about it.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.720]   It doesn't hurt.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.840]   That doesn't-- yeah.
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.880]   But Siri is a year in year out.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.440]   And they-- and, you know, I think that you can scale it.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.640]   I think you call Mark Zuckerberg's people,
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.080]   or you call Larry Page's people,
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.920]   and you say, "Hey, how do you do it?"
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.240]   Well, but that's like saying that Google could design better devices
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.160]   by just calling up Apple's people and being like,
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:17.960]   "Hey, how do you do it?"
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.680]   I mean, I think just some companies are just better at certain things.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.880]   I mean, Apple's incredible at building amazing hardware company.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.680]   They're not--
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.200]   And amazing software.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.480]   You know, installable software.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.840]   But the cloud part, they're not so not as great.
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.280]   They've never done a good job, have they?
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.200]   They haven't.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.320]   But again, I don't want to trash Apple because the iPad looks really good.
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.480]   In fact, I didn't watch the live announcement today and the coverage
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.880]   because I just-- I got caught up with some work stuff.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.800]   So I'm not quite as frothy about it as everyone who has been watching it.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.400]   I haven't even attempted to order it yet.
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.120]   I probably will want to get one at some point,
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.480]   although I'm sure that it's going to sell out.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.120]   And, you know, it'll be a few months before I get it.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.400]   But it sounded like a really solid update.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.880]   I mean, it sounds like a really great, great new update.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.160]   I mean, I think for casual users and iPad 2,
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.080]   I don't know if upgrading to the iPad 3--
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:07.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.520]   Wait till you see the screen.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.720]   Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.560]   I imagine the retina display isn't--
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:11.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.520]   I do love that on iPhone.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.480]   Who is that, Leo?
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.120]   And there's really nothing else that knew about it.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.680]   Well, there's a decent camera for a change.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.600]   Faster processor, but no, it's all about the screen.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.640]   In fact, they call it on the front page of the Apple.com site,
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.160]   resolutionary.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.920]   Yeah, that was a little gimmicky.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.280]   That was just-- that kind of showed to some--
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.480]   It's a little cheesy.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.680]   It's a little cheesy.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.200]   For a company that usually does very elegant marketing,
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.120]   that whole resolutioner.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.760]   I was like, you don't think that would have gotten past Steve.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:43.880]   Steve, not exactly.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.320]   Would Steve have done that?
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:51.000]   But OK, I'll give it to them because the retina display is really great.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.200]   I love it on the iPhone.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.960]   And I'm certainly going to go--
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.920]   I want to see it on the iPhone.
[00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.560]   I think it's one thing to see it on a 3 and 1/2 inch display,
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.040]   and another thing entirely on a 9.7 inch display.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.480]   I think you-- I suspect people will be so blown away that this will be a product
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.800]   that will outsell anything they've ever done by several orders,
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.240]   by maybe an order of magnitude.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.400]   I mean, it's going to be very significant.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.200]   And really, the big story-- and we touched on it a little bit,
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.360]   but I don't know-- we got the big thinkers.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.960]   We got the big brains in here now.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.600]   I think the big story, and Apple certainly pushed this is--
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.040]   this is a post-PC device in a way that--
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.600]   Jeff, boxed up your iPad 1.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.480]   You said it's just a content consumption device.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.040]   I was wrong.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.000]   No, you weren't wrong.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:35.960]   I have it.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.760]   But you weren't wrong.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.800]   Because I had one.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.360]   I got it.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:38.840]   I crow.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.480]   That's a delicious crow.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.440]   No, but I think that the third one in the way that it's evolved in terms of speed,
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:53.160]   capacity, and screen is now-- and it's clear that Apple wants it to be--
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.280]   a content creation device.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.480]   I think merely for video and pictures alone.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.040]   Right.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.400]   Yeah, they clearly do.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.840]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.560]   No, no, go ahead.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:03.960]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.800]   They clearly do.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.200]   But you know, I watched the promotional video, you know,
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.240]   the dad taking video of his kids playing in the sand at the beach with the iPad.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.520]   I just-- first of all, I don't bring my iPad to the beach.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.360]   I live here in San Diego, so I go to the beach a lot.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.120]   That just seemed crazy to me.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.800]   And the table with people sitting around a table with garage band up,
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.200]   with each-- with four iPads kind of all linked together,
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.400]   playing, you know, the drums and the piano on the iPad,
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.440]   that kind of bummed me out.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:30.760]   Really?
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.400]   You don't like that.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.840]   You'd rather see him play real instruments.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.960]   Get some instruments.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.000]   You're such an old fart.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.280]   I love-- yeah.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:37.960]   This is definitely my old fart mode.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.280]   I was like, people get some pictures.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:40.920]   I think is great.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.520]   I still think it's weird.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.360]   When people take pictures with their tablet,
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.440]   and Neil-- my boss, Neil, put together this milkshake feed of pictures,
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.080]   photos of people taking pictures with their tablet.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.520]   And it's completely dorky.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.960]   I mean, it's so dorky.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.200]   But I don't think-- I think that's going to change.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:01.720]   I like the idea of putting together a commercial or a movie of my kid's birthday party on the iPad.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.640]   It's just not something I've done.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.440]   And I'm not convinced yet that I'm going to do that on my iPad.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.440]   Does Apple does sometimes do that where they--
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.880]   FaceTime's a good example, where they can make a very compelling commercial
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.560]   and say, boy, you're going to really want to do this.
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.120]   And you even might get sucked in initially.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.640]   And then you never use the feature.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.320]   I think Siri is on the edge.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.240]   FaceTime definitely, that's a case.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.920]   Even people will always say, oh, no, I use it.
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.320]   But really, I don't think it's vastly widely used.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.720]   So it's very easy to make a commercial that looks like,
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.000]   ah, I really want to do that.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.640]   There's the dad on the beach.
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.280]   Right.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.000]   I mean, come on.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.240]   Would you bring your iPad that close to the sand?
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.360]   Maybe I'm just too particular about my devices, but--
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:38.600]   Right.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:38.600]   Right.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:38.600]   Right.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.120]   [CHUCKLES]
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.280]   Well, you actually are going to learn something right now.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.080]   I never go to the beach because I can't stand getting sand in my socks.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.000]   I'm looking at you and thinking, this is a man who's never been in the sun, period.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.800]   No, I don't.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.200]   I don't.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:50.680]   I don't do it.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.400]   Plus, I'm sorry.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.040]   You cannot see even the retina display in the sun.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.360]   And because I live in San Diego, so I know this for sure.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.520]   Especially if you have sunglasses on and you turn it the right way,
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.200]   the sunglasses interact.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.600]   But anyway, I'm not going to hit the commercials.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.000]   It looks like a really incredible device.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.680]   And I definitely want one.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.720]   That's very interesting.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.360]   I'll admit it.
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.080]   But--
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.080]   Do you have one now, Gini?
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:11.520]   I do.
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.160]   I have the iPad 2, and I have to say, I love it.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:15.720]   I love it.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.400]   It is my favorite computer.
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.560]   I love it so much that I bought the keyboard.
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.800]   I bought the stylus.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.640]   I draw on it.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.160]   I do things on it that I normally don't do in a computer.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   It's my play computer versus my--
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.920]   I code on my MacBook.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.840]   And at night, I kind of draw and play and browse on the iPad.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.640]   And I think that's why I love it, kind of the leanback computer.
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:37.760]   So I do love it.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.720]   I held out to the iPad 2, and I sort of begrudgingly fell in love with it.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.480]   But yeah, really love it.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:48.160]   All right, enough of that.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.280]   OK, yeah, I feel like that now I'm frothing out.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.480]   And somebody pointed out-- and I think this is really true--
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.880]   is that cloud services--
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.680]   Microsoft has had some problems.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.720]   In fact, most recently, their Azure service went down on Leap Day
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:04.440]   because somebody did program February 29th into the computer.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.160]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:05.960]   It's pretty--
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.960]   I do stand in love.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.720]   Maybe you could call Facebook and ask it for that algorithm.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.960]   I think it has something to do with divisible by 4.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.560]   Oh, boy.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.080]   Chromium blog, February 27th.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.800]   They announced the Ponium Rewards for exploits.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:34.680]   $60,000 if somebody discovers a full Chrome exploit, 40 for a partial.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.440]   There's a $20,000 consolation prize.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:43.640]   Somebody has just claimed the $60,000 full Chrome exploit.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.040]   This is Sin Sundar Pachai posting on Google+.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.800]   He's, of course, the guy in charge of Chrome OS.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.000]   Congrats to longtime Chromium contributor Sergey Glazinov,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.400]   who just submitted our first Ponium entry.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.840]   Looks like it qualifies as a full Chrome exploit.
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.640]   You've got to admire a company that actually
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:06.200]   publicizes the fact that their browser has a massive hole in it.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.680]   Open source, baby.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.200]   Turn the--
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   Oh, wow.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.040]   --the drivers make them work for you.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:11.760]   60 grand.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.960]   That's a lot of money.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.400]   He says, we're working fast on a fix.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.000]   We'll push via auto update.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.920]   This is exciting.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:21.280]   I love-- this is-- I don't know if this is spin.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.800]   Or if-- I think he's sincere.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.960]   That's what I love about Google.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.880]   This is exciting.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.520]   We found a big hole.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.160]   We're going to give you 60 grand.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:31.720]   Wow.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.880]   Well, that's a heck of a lot less than the headcount
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.880]   they'd pay to somebody.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.920]   Silly hole.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.560]   We have to re-try to do it.
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.200]   Sifty grand is cheap.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:41.560]   That kind of engineering--
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.280]   Very cheap.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.960]   So I don't think this is spin.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.640]   I think this is really them saying, no, we want people to bang on it.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.800]   And we're going to let you know if there's a hole.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.880]   And we're going to fix it.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.240]   By the way, if you're a Chrome user and you're interested,
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.480]   we did a really interesting security now yesterday on SPDY.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.600]   The SPDY technology that Google is starting to implement in Chrome,
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.440]   that they say will speed up websites three times.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.800]   Websites that support the SPDY technology three times faster.
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.160]   And that is another thing Google's done a really good job with,
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.680]   is speeding up the web.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.040]   It's one of the chatroom mentioned that bug bounties
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.480]   in open source culture are very--
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.080]   A long time.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:21.600]   --com.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.100]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:22.760]   That's a pretty tough--
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.280]   --even in close source.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.360]   Microsoft used to do that.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.320]   They'd have pizza parties.
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.560]   And they'd give you--
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.800]   But on the other hand, I don't think
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.600]   that they would make a big deal about a massive exploit
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.640]   in a shipping product saying, hey, we found one.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.640]   Right.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.800]   It's true.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.120]   It's true.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.000]   You've got to love that.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.240]   Three times faster.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.680]   Does not the same as three times as fast.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.800]   I'm told by up in the chatroom.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.240]   I don't know.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.480]   Professor?
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.320]   Three times--
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:51.800]   Yeah, I mean, I'm just a little faster.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.680]   Three times as fast.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.960]   I don't know what the difference is.
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.360]   I think they're right, but I'm not going to--
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.280]   I could tell you the Apple Store is not using speedy.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.800]   Well, here's the funny thing I should
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.160]   say on the air.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.320]   I'm not there.
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.320]   I haven't bought yet.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.040]   But I got farther in Safari than I did in Chrome.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.160]   What a surprise.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.000]   Oh, shocking.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.040]   No, that's one thing I do.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:13.000]   I don't-- maybe it's just me.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.280]   But Chrome does not work well on my Macs.
[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.600]   I end up using Safari because Chrome seems sluggish.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.320]   Chrome--
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.800]   YouTube videos get it confused.
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.560]   And then it bogs down and I've got to restart Chrome.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.320]   Meanwhile, back at the Apple Store.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.240]   I had the disable flash in Chrome to make it--
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.080]   Is it flash?
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.040]   It helped me a lot because I was beach balling often.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.360]   So I just-- I think I installed an extension that's flash block.
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.760]   So it shows you if there's flash and you turn it on,
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.360]   if it's something you definitely want to see.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.760]   And that helped me a lot, although I know what you mean.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.520]   It is a bit sluggish on the Mac.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:59.160]   Larry Page shared this link, Calcudoku puzzles.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.400]   This is actually a fascinating page.
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:07.040]   Calcudoku.org.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.400]   They analyzed the usage data of the Calcudoku number puzzle
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.480]   website for years 2010, 2011, consisting of over 1 million
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.360]   South puzzles as a site that solves your sort of good puzzles.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.240]   Attempted to determine the numerical intelligence
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.960]   of users of IE, Firefox, and Chrome.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:28.680]   I don't know if I should even mention this.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.920]   Chrome users are smarter, apparently,
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.800]   and faster than Firefox and IE users.
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:34.640]   And they have more sex.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.920]   Is this a joke?
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.480]   And then IE users more likely to give up on a puzzle
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.080]   than Firefox or Chrome users.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:42.600]   They just go--
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.080]   Aw.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:43.600]   Aw.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:43.920]   They just--
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.280]   I feel like we're--
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:45.780]   We're--
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.780]   We're--
[00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:47.640]   We're trash talking, though.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.640]   They get frustrated.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:48.960]   They get frustrated.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:49.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.920]   Aw.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.000]   We unwashed masses.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.680]   They give up on Sude Kupuses.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.560]   We're leaders.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.720]   We went from Apple to leaders in the Google leaders.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.760]   I just love it that Larry Page posted that.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:01.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.760]   Well, of course.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.160]   Wow.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.160]   Wow.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.720]   I think there was a hoax last year that did a survey,
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.840]   but I don't think this is it.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.120]   This is something completely different.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.240]   But anyway, go ahead, Gina.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:14.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.800]   We should talk about Google Play.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.800]   That seems to be the big thing.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:18.800]   This is so good.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.000]   This is bizarre.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.520]   So if you go to market.android.com--
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.840]   It's not there.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.960]   It is no longer there.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.000]   It's just gone.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.640]   It changes it over to play.google.com.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.720]   Because apparently, even if you're buying an app,
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.680]   what you really want to do is play,
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:42.680]   focusing, obviously, on movies, music, and not apps and books.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.720]   Because I don't think you can play a book unless it's audible.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.320]   I guess you could play an app if it's a game.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.440]   This is also on the Android devices, right?
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.320]   There's an update.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.880]   In fact, I should check my Android device
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.680]   and see if there's an update on the store.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.800]   Is it clear your cache?
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.440]   And then you-- on your market, Android market?
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.920]   You have to clear the cache to get it.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.040]   No, but I'm just saying--
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:04.640]   Oh, no, it says it.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.240]   No, it did it.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:05.800]   It's doing it.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.560]   If you haven't gotten it yet, that's a true.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.200]   It says play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.760]   But you should have the new icon, too.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.440]   Oh.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.080]   That's what I mean.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.720]   Like if you want the new icon--
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.680]   I have the old icon.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.560]   So I have to clear the cache to get the new icon.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.000]   Or just wait till it rolls out to you, whatever.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.760]   So why?
[00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:24.480]   It's much better branding.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.680]   I really like the new name.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.160]   I like the new icon.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.480]   I don't like that it's sort of subsume the Android brand
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:32.440]   inside of it.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.600]   Like you can buy Android apps inside the Google Play Store,
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.160]   which I'm actually not used to saying yet.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.680]   Well, Gina, isn't that because you can also
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.000]   buy songs and books?
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:41.520]   It's not--
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.000]   Well, right.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.840]   Yes.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.640]   Yes, exactly.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.760]   But the Android brand is in part of the name.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:48.640]   And that was just an interesting thing.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.080]   If you read the name literally, I mean, for me,
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.600]   as a maker of a to-do list app, I was kind of like, well,
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.520]   where do the productivity apps go?
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.360]   When I say, get an app of the Play Store,
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.440]   I imagine that they're going to be games.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.120]   But you can't really take the name literally.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.720]   The iTunes Store is a lot more than music.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:06.520]   I really like it.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:11.560]   I think it was a smart kind of rebranding, a good move.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.320]   I like the word.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.520]   I think it sounds just a lot better than Android Market.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.120]   And I think it kind of differentiates a lot more.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.280]   But it's going to be kind of a rough--
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.800]   it's kind of a rocky transition here,
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.840]   especially for tech writers and developers.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.440]   They emailed out developers of Android apps and said, hey,
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.600]   your app is now in this place called Google Play.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.880]   And here are some banners that you
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.440]   can put on your site that say, go play this on Google
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.600]   or whatever their little phrases.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.840]   And I was like, I'm not putting that on my apps website
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.680]   just yet.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.800]   And they're waiting till people get used to it.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.440]   They also updated the videos app.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.560]   It's now called Google PlayVid Movies.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.600]   And you have to download that.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.000]   And the reason I know that is because they're
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.760]   offering 25 cent downloads in glorious bastards is 25 cents.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.440]   And--
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.520]   Wow.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.280]   They've got a lot of 25 cent albums.
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.680]   Look, I can get blown on the Carter 4 by Lil Wayne
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.600]   for just 25 cents.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.320]   I am so excited.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.520]   I am so excited.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.400]   So you.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.240]   It is me.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:04.760]   It is me.
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.600]   Lil Wayne.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.760]   He's my man.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:14.040]   That's 18 Lil Wayne songs for a quarter.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.040]   Worth twice the price.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.120]   So I noticed other albums too.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.240]   It's 25 cents is great.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.200]   Does that mean--
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.960]   Does that mean--
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.120]   Oh, hey, this is interesting.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.480]   ScooterX says you cannot read a movie from Play Movies
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.440]   on a rooted device.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.160]   So that's interesting.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.320]   That is something to know.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.240]   Is there a audience?
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:34.760]   Right.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.480]   Because of the-- why?
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.800]   Because there's no--
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:40.880]   Couple of DRM?
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.800]   No DRM, baby.
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.560]   Flick Golf-- so their apps to flick golf extreme
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.400]   is a quarter right now.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.840]   There's a bunch for 49 cents too.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.080]   I have a big sale.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.240]   This is good.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.960]   I guess do the developers only get a nickel?
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.000]   Or what happens?
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.840]   No, what happens is I think that they still have to guarantee.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.240]   Google subsidizes it.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.480]   Look at all the movies for 99 cents.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.440]   Dirty dancing, the original.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.760]   People should watch that instead of that bad remake.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:09.920]   Go to the shell.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.200]   It's a good promotional opportunity
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.040]   to get people to set up their wallet
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.720]   account and to just load up on content
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.920]   and get used to the idea of how it all works.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:18.940]   Yeah.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.120]   Get the upside down.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.080]   Sorry.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:21.520]   Go ahead.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.800]   The way that Amazon does it with the--
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.360]   Free app of the day, yeah.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.640]   Well, though with Kindle lending library
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.920]   is that they have--
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.040]   I think it's $600,000 this month that they'll divvy up
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.280]   among all those who have been borrowed in the library.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.800]   So if you're on Kindle and you own a Kindle and you're on Prime,
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.320]   you can borrow things for free.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.160]   And then Amazon ponies up that proportion.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:56.000]   Since I only charged 99 cents for my--
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.840]   my-- here I am.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.000]   Where is it here?
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.560]   My-- watch me call it-- my e-book, my Kindle single.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:07.600]   Then I'll probably make more from the share
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.640]   than I will from the book.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:10.120]   Wow.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.000]   Just because of the passive sales.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:12.520]   Well, yeah.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.200]   And just because that's only 99 cents,
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.120]   whereas if you're going to make something that's $10,
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.520]   you'll get the same I will.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.560]   Right.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:24.160]   So it's hard to make lending structures terribly fair.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.080]   But--
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.080]   Wow.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:26.560]   This looks good.
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.960]   This is HD streaming on the-- this is the Galaxy Note.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.880]   This looks the Singlorious Baster.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.200]   It's just pretty good.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.800]   You're going to have to zoom in a little bit to see it.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:36.720]   So you're streaming?
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:38.220]   Yeah.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:38.960]   I didn't download it.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.120]   It's streaming in high quality.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.760]   Are we going to get pulled from YouTube for this?
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.200]   Absolutely.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.200]   Absolutely.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.280]   Let me just-- it's pretty good.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:52.400]   I shouldn't show this part.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.760]   It's where the baseball bat and all that stuff.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.920]   But still, still, that's pretty good.
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.000]   I have to say, for $0.25, the quality's excellent.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.040]   But they have to because, of course, Apple has now
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:06.480]   started with this 1080p and they've got a new Apple TV.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.360]   This is-- I love it.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:12.640]   Because for those of us who like content and stuff,
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.760]   the industry is completely reinventing itself.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.280]   Yes.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.640]   And it's all streaming.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.640]   Netflix made a deal with Apple that you
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.720]   can use your iTunes account to pay for your Netflix subscription.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.320]   Netflix is integrated right into the Apple TV.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.200]   HD 1080p from Netflix 5.1 surround.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:35.600]   Forget-- forget physical media.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.160]   It's dead.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.160]   And what Google's doing and Apple's doing, huge.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.360]   So Netflix is letting customers--
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.640]   so they're giving-- making Apple a customer entry point.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.040]   So they're--
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:47.960]   Yes.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.480]   They're--
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.760]   Yeah, you don't have to buy a Netflix account through Netflix
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.680]   anymore.
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.320]   Right, right.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.160]   I wonder what that deal is, though, for them.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.800]   I mean, given their Apple's history of keeping customer
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.080]   information from--
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.560]   That's a good question.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.720]   That's a good question.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.640]   I think it's a big win for Netflix.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.320]   I'm not surprised they would do it just
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.920]   because of the volume.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.840]   And Netflix, you know, a lot of companies
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.640]   wants to get out of the physical media business.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.160]   That's what they struggled with.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:13.600]   Right.
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:17.160]   With the quick stir and all of that.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.680]   Right.
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.520]   I hope the terms weren't--
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.200]   no, any--
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.640]   I hope the terms were good for them.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.400]   I like Netflix.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.080]   I do too.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.400]   I really like those guys.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.920]   And I know they got a lot of heat
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:29.960]   because of their flip-flopping and all that stuff.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.600]   But I'm just saying, between this Google Play,
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.800]   what you're really seeing is this move towards streaming
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:35.960]   everywhere.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.460]   Yep.
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.560]   And it makes sense.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.440]   Well, but it has more control.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.440]   Well, for the movie companies, for sure.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.840]   For the movie company, it's what they should have been
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.960]   going through ages ago.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:44.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.720]   And also, the next thing to conquer
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.680]   is get it when you want it and get rid of these windows.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.960]   Because the argument is that that's
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.360]   the primary driver or piracy.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.800]   I can't get what I want now.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.400]   So the heck with you?
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:01.320]   I'll go get it.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.960]   If I could get it now, then more people would.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.240]   That's the oatmeal cartoon.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.200]   The oatmeal.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.640]   Yeah, oatmeal-ing is my new version.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.440]   Oatmeal-ing.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:11.880]   Who I like that.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.200]   I tried to pay for it.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.160]   I couldn't.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.360]   I want it now.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.360]   I want it now.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.200]   I got it now.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.880]   I downloaded it with the intention of paying
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.120]   for it when I am able.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.040]   That's oatmeal-ing.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:21.880]   That's key.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.080]   So the key in oatmeal-ing is OK.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.000]   It's OK to download a pirated version now,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   as long as you buy it when it's available.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:28.520]   Right.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.440]   I wanted to pay for it.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:30.360]   I tried to pay for it.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.520]   I was unable to pay for it.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:32.520]   So I downloaded it.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:34.600]   But I will pay for it when I am able to pay for it.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   Just don't forget.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.280]   Right.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.200]   Yeah, I just write.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.160]   Well, that's right.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:38.680]   Just don't.
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.840]   Oatmeal-ing.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.320]   Oatmeal-ing.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:41.680]   We like it.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.680]   What it says in the end is a company has a choice
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:46.080]   of whom to piss off.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:51.040]   They're old sales channel or they're customers.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.000]   And they didn't have a relationship with the customers
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.280]   before.
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.760]   They only had a relationship with the sales channel.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.440]   But that's the essence of the disruption that's going on.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.760]   And when they learn that it's stupid to piss off
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.880]   your customers, then go buy sales channels.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.400]   But when you frame it that way, that's fascinating.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.880]   That really makes a lot of sense.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.960]   And that's what's happening.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.760]   The relationship is changing from channel to customer.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.840]   I think that the retail as a whole is--
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.400]   I'll get a term over saying this--
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.000]   but nearly doomed.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.200]   That the reason to buy something physically is that it's
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.920]   perishable or you need it right now.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.000]   And that should be a premium.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.440]   And it is.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.240]   That's true in books now.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.840]   You can buy the same book on BNN.com.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.600]   You can buy the bookstore.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.720]   You're paying a premium to get it there.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.480]   Everybody knows that.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.600]   The economics of that do not work anymore.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.240]   It's going to go away best by and you name the place.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:45.280]   And so that's what that says is the whole notion
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.520]   of the sales channel goes away.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.680]   Now, that's true and not true because there's a new sales
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:51.040]   channel.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.760]   Amazon is a new sales channel.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.320]   Apple is a new sales channel.
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.160]   But sales channels are meant to be disintermediated.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.240]   Mm-hmm.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.520]   I think that's absolutely true.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:06.920]   Although Apple makes the in-person retail experience
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.800]   a very premium.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.160]   I mean, I enjoy going to the Apple Store.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.280]   Went not on iPad release day.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.160]   But any other day, they make it--
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.960]   when I bought my iPhone, it was amazing.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.520]   A friend of mine bought a phone at a Verizon store.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.440]   And I went to go buy my iPhone on the same--
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.760]   during the same week.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.800]   And the experience was completely different.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.440]   I mean, it was just a nightmare for her.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.680]   It was, you know, go to this one.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.880]   Like a computer was slow.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.960]   And what model do I get?
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.120]   And the paradox of choice.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.000]   And the upsells and the crazy.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.560]   At the Apple Store, you know, the guy who's standing there
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.920]   with his iPhone, with his little connection.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.320]   And I was able to transfer my number,
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.120]   buy an iPhone, have it set up without leaving the table
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.080]   I was standing at.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.160]   So I think there's still room for that premium experience.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.720]   And doing that premium experience really well in person,
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.880]   for sure.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.000]   But I think you're absolutely right.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.640]   I think that the--
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:59.080]   The trap experience is, you know, there's
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.120]   not there's in a market for that anymore.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:06.280]   And, you know, I worked with a group that we tried to take
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:09.280]   over this large white elephant mall in New Jersey
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.280]   called Xanadu.
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.200]   And our bid didn't win.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.960]   But the idea of this brilliant marketing guy working with,
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.680]   I mentioned him in a sentence in public parts,
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.480]   is that retail space becomes about marketing
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.800]   rather than about fulfillment.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.680]   And, you know, in a sense, that's
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.440]   what the Apple Store's real value is,
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.360]   is that it's marketing space.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.120]   Yeah, yeah, you can get it here.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.640]   But it doesn't make any difference to Apple
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.320]   whether you buy it there or not.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:33.680]   Not.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.000]   Right.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.360]   Come for the classes to just look and try and touch.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.680]   Experience all that.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.200]   Yep.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:40.200]   Yep.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.600]   And any store today that doesn't encourage you to hang out--
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.960]   I mean, I've said this to Best Buy and Pest--
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.080]   that they should be turning on their Wi-Fi for everybody.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.000]   They should be a hangout.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.120]   There's an opportunity to create a new third place.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.400]   Right now it's Starbucks.
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.040]   It could be bookstores.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.840]   It could be-- I mean, Apple is not a third place
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.280]   where you're going to sit down because you can't.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:07.280]   But they used to have stools in the 14th Street store in New York.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:12.440]   But there's that idea of having a social hangout
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.160]   as a new form of marketing and retail
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.480]   becomes really interesting, I think.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.160]   I agree.
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.320]   We're talking about Google, the Cloud, Apple, whatever
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.200]   is on our mind.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.760]   Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trepani.
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.480]   More to come in just a little bit,
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.760]   but first a word from our friends at Citrix.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:33.000]   They make so many great products, including GoToMyPC, which
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.080]   is the best remote access software out there.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.040]   There are choices.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.760]   There's lots of choices, including free choices
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.120]   from remote access.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.160]   But when you get serious about it, if you're in business,
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.880]   for instance, you need something that's secure, reliable,
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.360]   won't crash on you, go to MyPC.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.400]   It's fast.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.760]   It's easy to use.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.320]   And it happens all the time that your stuff's
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.480]   on the office computer, but you're on the way to the airport.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.480]   And you go, oh my goodness, I forgot this.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.800]   Or I need to send an email from the office address.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.880]   And this is where GoToMyPC is amazing.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.160]   Of course, it works on any computer.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:06.960]   Mac or PC, if you go to the website now, go to myPC.com.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.120]   Click the Try It Free button.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.080]   Use the offer code Twig.
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.120]   You can set it up on your office computer right now.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.120]   But here's the beauty part.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.960]   You can access that office computer
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:19.680]   from a lot of different devices, including an iPhone.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.280]   An iPad.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.080]   So even the iPhone will let you access a weird access window
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:26.960]   seven from an iPhone.
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.200]   But you can do it.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.040]   And it works really well.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.200]   It's just a disconnect.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.560]   Sociologically speaking, go to MyPC.com.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.560]   Try it free right now.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.240]   For 30 days, if you visit GoToMyPC.com,
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.240]   click the Try It Free button.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.040]   Use the offer code Twig.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.920]   T-W-I-G-G.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.880]   Twig-G.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.000]   And then set it up on Mac or PC.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.560]   And then download the free app on the iPhone or the iPad.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.680]   I don't know.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.560]   Is there an Android app?
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.800]   They're working on it.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.600]   I think they're working on it.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   There might be a tablet app.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.280]   I don't remember.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.960]   Anyway, I know iPhone and iPad.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.600]   It's just so cool.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.920]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:07.720]   Give it a try today.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.720]   And we thank them.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.560]   And all Citrix just supports us with all of its products.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:12.160]   So nicely.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.520]   I'm really very, very grateful.
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.760]   Just an update.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:16.800]   New animal.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   Is this like-- so this is frozenplanet.com.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.440]   They have just--
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.280]   I guess.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.360]   This is a Sea World.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:25.120]   Oh, it's a show.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.440]   It's a show.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.000]   It's just a live cam.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.680]   Oh, those are the-- those emperor penguins.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.680]   The emperor penguin walks.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.280]   What was it?
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.280]   It was so funny.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.760]   Billy Crystal on the Academy Awards.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.520]   He does that thing where he's reading people's minds.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.040]   He reads Morgan Freeman's mind.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:40.520]   And he's--
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.960]   The emperor penguin walks.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.240]   So that was very well done.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:43.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.120]   That was really well done.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.320]   And then it's, again, snowing.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.480]   And then the polar bear camp.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.280]   Well, it's--
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.080]   It's the animal update.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.840]   Where there are polar bears and snow.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.640]   After the ad.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.800]   All right.
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.600]   So since we're in sort of an iPad haze
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.920]   after the announcement today, I have two questions.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.280]   I didn't watch the iPad announcement.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.960]   So I'm curious if Tim Cook said anything that was very
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.040]   obviously about Android.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.840]   And the second question is, what does Android
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:11.080]   have to do to compete with the iPad?
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:13.600]   I had a bet, which I did not lose.
[00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.800]   I said, I will drink an entire bottle of crystal head vodka
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.160]   on this show if the word Google is mentioned at any time.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.280]   And it was not.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.480]   I mean, that's the golden rule.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.800]   You never name your competitor, right?
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.760]   There will be no-- well, it's funny because Google kind of,
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.880]   even backhandedly, Google talked about Apple at I/O.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.960]   But Apple doesn't know.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.160]   It's actually interesting.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.680]   He didn't make any cracks about--
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.880]   No, nothing.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.040]   I thought I saw somebody--
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.920]   I thought I saw some tweets saying that he said
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.480]   something about page load being skippy.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.920]   But it could have just been my friend's name.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.600]   There was a graph that he showed, which
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.200]   was interesting about sales in which he showed Dell,
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.520]   and Acer, and a bunch of PC companies, and said--
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.560]   and this is the point Apple would like to make.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:59.000]   If you include these post-PC devices, the iPhone,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.040]   and the iPad, we sell more PCs than anybody else.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.560]   They would really like what they would love you to include
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.160]   iPad sales in their sales figures,
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:11.960]   because then they are, in fact, much bigger than anybody else.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.120]   I think you can make a case.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.120]   I don't know about the iPhone.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.400]   In the case that the iPad should probably be in that,
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.240]   it is especially with--
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.040]   as they get more powerful, it really is.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.920]   Let's talk about that part, that as you mentioned
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:29.640]   at the top of the show, but is the laptop the next dead thing?
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.400]   He did-- oh, Boeing is right.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.880]   He did take a cheap shot about how Twitter looks on--
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.800]   what did he say on an Android tablet, or did he say--
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.600]   Samsung.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:39.680]   It was on the Samsung.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:40.400]   So you're right.
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:43.480]   He did mention the Android stuff.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.440]   Android apps Yelp and Twitter, and how bad they look,
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.600]   and how well-integrated they are in iOS.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.640]   We weren't watching the stream.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.120]   We were just watching the live blogs,
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:55.200]   because they don't stream it, of course.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:55.840]   Oh, right.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.320]   But did they post it after the fact?
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.920]   They posted it almost immediately after the fact,
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.720]   which is a little different for Apple.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.680]   Usually they take a day or two.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.280]   I guess they-- I don't quite understand it.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:10.240]   That is mentioning Google.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:10.560]   Is it?
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.080]   Right.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:12.760]   Right, right.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.640]   I don't want to drink a bottle of vodka.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.440]   Saved by the bottle of vodka.
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.000]   I know it was a ticket.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.960]   So what does Google have to do to compete with the iPad?
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.120]   I felt like the Google Play announcement yesterday
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.360]   was sort of a little bit of a half-hearted attempt
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.680]   to be like, hey, we're still here.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.600]   We've got a thing happening this week, too.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.640]   It's over.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.840]   You think it's over?
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:34.880]   It's a done deal.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.520]   I think Android competes well with iPhone.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.400]   And I'm an Android user, and I love the note,
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.640]   and I love the choice.
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.960]   The tablet that's even the Asus transformer prime, which
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.000]   is, I think, arguably the best that comes even close.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   The Kindle Fire is the only Android app that is even
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.840]   in the ballpark, and it doesn't say Android anywhere on it.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:55.280]   Nask Amazon, they won't say the Android word.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.360]   So I think that-- boy, when you look at how they've
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:04.200]   leapfrogged, again, the competition, I don't know.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.400]   I think that it's not even close.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.000]   I really don't.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.240]   And I love this.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.800]   I mean, I love the-- I far prefer Android phones.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.400]   The things that I can do with my Android phone far out way,
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.400]   anything I can do with an iPhone.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:23.280]   In the tablet, it's not even close.
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.120]   Alas.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:24.880]   I hope that changes.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.040]   I hope they at least have something that's at least
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.040]   a little bit of a contender, because more competition, I think,
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.120]   is a good thing.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.880]   But at this point, it does feel like the iPad is so far ahead.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.600]   I don't know what Google could do.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.200]   So Jeff, you said this is the death of the laptop.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.560]   Well, I'm just asking--
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:46.600]   Well, to try to not look pink and weirdly dead when I'm
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.880]   at home doing the show, I went out--
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.000]   You're going to buy a PC?
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.840]   I bought one.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.360]   I mean, I did buy what you said.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:58.720]   I bought the cheap new Asus X101.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:58.960]   I think it's all--
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.280]   Actually, those are nice little PCs, yeah.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:02.800]   269 bucks.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.840]   Wow.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.520]   Yeah, which is pretty amazing.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.240]   But just looking around, I thought, well,
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.440]   okay, do I buy a desktop?
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.440]   Or how silly?
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.560]   You may buy that anymore.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.480]   There are a few.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.840]   But why would you possibly put this big honking box, right?
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.360]   Laptops, I'm walking around all the time
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.960]   with my Logitech keyboard and my iPad.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.360]   And yes, folks, I did re-box it.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:23.080]   But I do have one, and I do like it.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.280]   And I'm trying to buy another one right now, and failing at it,
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.080]   and then I get pissed.
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:33.320]   But is the idea of the computer over?
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:35.560]   When I do talks now, and I talk about, pardon me,
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.120]   for the great time, folks, that Gutenberg's invention
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.840]   was originally called automated writing, the horseless care.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.400]   No, really?
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.160]   It was called automated writing.
[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:44.760]   Yeah, it really was.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:50.880]   Because we always define the future in the past.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.880]   Horseless carriage.
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.680]   It's a carriage without a horse.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:58.440]   And it was the font were designed to look like scribes.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:58.920]   Right, right.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.400]   That was the whole point is you could write fast.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.400]   In fact, they printed "Bible," nothing but "Bibles"
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.560]   for 30 years because they couldn't think of anything to do.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.760]   So why do we still call this a phone?
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.440]   Of course, it's ludicrous.
[00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.920]   I was talking to somebody who's so not a phone, is it?
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.280]   It's what they said.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.560]   When their kid was to communicate or was to do something,
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:19.720]   they don't say, hello?
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:24.280]   What they say is, they say fingers moving.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:26.960]   It's a texting device that happens to have a phone capable.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.560]   Like phone calls.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.920]   The thing you make in order to find your friend's phone that's
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.360]   lost in the couch, right?
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:34.880]   That's good.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.800]   We need a phrase for that.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.280]   So the whole idea of--
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.200]   Find your phone.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.280]   So now we'll go too far.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:41.920]   That's what I do.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.840]   That's what I do for a living.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.120]   I go too far.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.200]   Is the computer dead?
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.640]   Is the idea of having a computer?
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.440]   Well, that's what they're saying with a post when they say post
[00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.920]   PC.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:57.160]   And I-- yes.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.720]   I hate when people say dead.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.240]   Dead is a ridiculous thing to say.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.040]   Nothing's dead.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.840]   But are we moving into--
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.320]   I mean, for laptops kind of superseded desktops for most
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.640]   people about four or five years ago,
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.600]   I think in that same way that they're still desktops.
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.880]   But laptops became good enough to use instead of a desktop
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:21.440]   and had enough value to use instead of desktops.
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:24.360]   I think that's what's happening right now with the iPad.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.720]   And this is the first one that's that good, I think.
[00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:30.480]   These devices are the most personal of all computers.
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.000]   Yes.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.520]   And if you're going to take the name very literally,
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.520]   that they're actually growing into-- these devices are growing
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:38.080]   into the name instead of growing out of it.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.920]   It's the most personal device we've ever had.
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.360]   The phone's particularly right, because they're in your pocket.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.080]   The iPad, you still kind of have to carry.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.520]   Right.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:47.760]   But I mean, what are they?
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.560]   If not computers, like, what do--
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.400]   are they communications devices?
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:54.200]   Or are they the Star Trek flip up?
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:56.520]   Right.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.360]   Communicator?
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:58.960]   Because it's something new that we don't
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.640]   know what to call it yet.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.240]   Right.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.760]   I mean, I guess the word computer sort of connotes
[00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.480]   like giant calculator.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.040]   It doesn't really encompass the connectivity
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.320]   and the mobility.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:13.840]   Calculator.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:14.320]   It is.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   It's a calculator.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.280]   It's a calculator.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.480]   Yeah, the internet, it's a communications device.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.320]   Pre-calculator.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.280]   I mean, pre-internet, it's just a calculator.
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.040]   More like personal communicator.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:25.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.000]   And it changes exactly-- it changes everything.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.800]   It's not that people don't still use their computer
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.880]   as a calculator, because they do.
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.240]   They still do Excel.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.840]   They do look red sheets.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.920]   But it's really become a communications device.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:37.840]   Yep.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.480]   Communications and media.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.600]   And media.
[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.120]   Consumption and creation.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.480]   Yeah, I am varying flavors and proportions.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.000]   And so I was reading a wonderful-- there's
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.600]   a guy named Nick Diacopoulos, who's
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.760]   working with a security doing a map of opportunities
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.120]   in media/technology.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:58.240]   It's really a cool paper I'll link to and put it up.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.880]   But in there, he was talking about computer.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.840]   What defines the computer versus a journalist
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.160]   is algorithms that both take information,
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.600]   and they do all these things to the information.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.360]   And the difference is simply that one is human,
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.440]   one is algorithmic.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.200]   And so when you start to think of a computer,
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:19.840]   not as the hardware, but as formula, as scripts,
[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.360]   as programs, as what Gina makes.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.840]   And that's what a computer is.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:26.000]   Computer has never been the hardware.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.160]   The computer is the program.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.360]   Right.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.360]   That's what makes it do what it does, right, Gina?
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:30.840]   Right.
[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.760]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.200]   Absolutely.
[00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:34.160]   You're asking a programmer this, Jeff?
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:34.840]   Yeah, I mean, it is.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.960]   I'm sucking up Gina.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.320]   It's a set of rules for--
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.760]   Ask the designer.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.960]   He'll say it's a CPU and a RAM chip.
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.800]   No, ask, ask a assistant, and you'll get spat on.
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:47.720]   Right.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:48.520]   But no, I agree.
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.400]   I think it's a software.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.400]   And then you can abstract it to create another layer,
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:56.400]   which is software is just really a way of describing a problem.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.520]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:01.480]   So I think it's just a fascinating--
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:02.880]   when you bring it back to Gutenberg,
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.680]   that really, I think, that kind of contextualizes it
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:08.280]   in a way that starts to make sense.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.680]   Yeah, that's a really great example.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.680]   You said that it's a communication device,
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:14.680]   but it's also a consumption-- or it's a media device,
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.880]   which is kind of a consumption device.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.680]   But I think that's what's different now,
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:20.400]   is that consumption and communication go hand-in-hand.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.280]   Creation and creation.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.160]   And creation, right?
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.520]   So we don't do these things alone.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.400]   This stuff is actually--
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.400]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.400]   It's all of a piece.
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.400]   It's all of a piece, yeah.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.400]   Exactly.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:33.960]   And we don't really-- we don't even have a word that covers all
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.280]   of that, that describes that.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.160]   I'm watching a movie with my friends online,
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:41.320]   or I'm playing a massively multiplayer online game.
[00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:45.800]   I'm pair programming over Skype with my other developer.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.600]   So to add to Apple's complete and utter dominance
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.360]   of every area of technology, they've now extended
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:53.920]   an olive branch, according to the Dow Jones Newswires,
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.120]   to Android device makers.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.880]   They've said, we will cut a deal with Samsung and Motorola.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.680]   All we want is-- remember now, Microsoft's getting
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:07.080]   we guess $10 a handset for their patents.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:11.560]   All we want is $15 a handset, and you don't have to worry
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.000]   about court ever again.
[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:20.440]   So now, explain that to me, Lucy.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:21.520]   Well, it's called licensing.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.160]   I mean, that's what happens with patents.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.640]   The real question for a long time in my mind was--
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.880]   and it came up because of Walter Isaac's since biography--
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:35.120]   is Apple suing Samsung and Motorola and others because they
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.560]   just-- and this is often the way businesses gets done,
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.920]   because they want the license fees.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.920]   Look, those are our patents.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.840]   We tried to make a deal.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.040]   You said, no, OK, pay up.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.360]   Or because they want to scorch Earth and just destroy
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.680]   competition and win outright.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.000]   When you read Steve Jobs saying, I am going to
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.840]   murder lies Google, I'm going to spend every penny and every
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:00.820]  -- I last read the kill Google because they stole the
[00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:01.920]   Android phone for us.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.480]   You might think it's the latter, but in fact now, the Apple
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.600]   says, we're willing to license it.
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.200]   Actually, they're asking for, according to Dow Jones Newswires,
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.000]   from $5 to $15 per handset for some of their patents.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:15.500]   That's OK.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.400]   So that's going to go straight through to the consumers.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:18.880]   Absolutely.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.320]   It comes with Apple Tax.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.320]   It's the Apple Tax.
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:21.960]   We're already--
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.040]   You should know that on 70% of Android devices were already
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.840]   paying a Microsoft tax of similar--
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:29.400]   So let me just work out the numbers here.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:35.440]   So how many Android devices were supposedly this year?
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:36.960]   We see the new numbers every week, right?
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.200]   But what's the number out of--
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:38.680]   I don't know.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.680]   I lean--
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.520]   I lean Android--
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.520]   50 million, 100 million.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:44.400]   I thought it was 350.
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.760]   It's a lot.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:48.200]   So $350 times $15 is please help me.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.800]   Somebody with a computer, Gina.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.800]   You are computer?
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.720]   Calculating.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:58.560]   Working, working, working.
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.040]   What?
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.960]   Jackrobe.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.000]   $350,000 times $15 is what?
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.080]   What's the bottom line?
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:08.160]   Go to Apple.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.400]   $350 million.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.880]   $350 million devices, right, you said?
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:12.360]   No.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.360]   See, this is where I would like to have a calculator.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.280]   It was like $5.85 million.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:22.280]   $3 million total devices, $850,000 activations a day.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.920]   OK, so $300 million, good.
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:24.880]   That's easier.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.960]   Times 10 would be $3 billion plus another half.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.840]   Well, well, well.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:30.160]   You know what?
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:31.880]   It's chicken feed.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:36.360]   It's $4 and 1/2 billion, but it's chicken feed compared to--
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.880]   What's Apple's gross these days?
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:39.600]   Oh, god.
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:40.840]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.640]   They make more than that in a week.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.480]   So it's chicken feed.
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:48.480]   But it's interesting because they don't need the money,
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.120]   but they would like the money.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:55.280]   They feel, I think, that they-- these are-- we invented this stuff.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.600]   So slide to unlock.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.480]   You better pay us if you want to have a slide
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.360]   to unlock on a phone.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.840]   In some ways, I'm relieved because it's a lot easier to pay $15
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:08.680]   or something per handset than if the company wants to kill you.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.000]   And I was really afraid that that's really what Steve Jobs wanted.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.760]   He wanted to kill Andrew.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.360]   But do you think maybe this is the all-branch because Steve
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:17.120]   is not here anymore?
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.480]   They knew they had to-- OK, well, all right,
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.160]   we'll nullify Steve.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.080]   But the truth is, it's not good business.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:26.000]   Well, right.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.560]   It isn't good business.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.320]   And you're not going to kill Andrew.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.360]   You're just going to piss people off.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:37.920]   The question is, A, will these companies go for it?
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.360]   Or-- I mean, will motor-- let's say motor
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:44.440]   roll it with all the cloud of Google behind them.
[00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.560]   Will they-- do this or will they say, no,
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:49.880]   we're going to fight this to the death because we think
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:53.200]   we have the right to use the swipe to unlock.
[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.040]   We think there's prior art.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.200]   So it may not--
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.160]   Well, then you're mitigating risk.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.840]   Then all business is about risk.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:03.360]   But then-- well, OK, but understand, it's like extortion,
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:03.680]   right?
[00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:04.640]   At that point, it's like--
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:05.160]   It is.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:05.640]   It's like the mafia.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.760]   It's like a protection racket.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.200]   Well, you got a choice.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:10.120]   You could fight us in court.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:10.620]   You might win.
[00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:11.200]   You might lose.
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.080]   Or you just give us $15.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.520]   And we'll be done.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.280]   So there's an economic stack.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:17.720]   Right.
[00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.160]   On every device forever.
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:20.200]   Forever.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:20.800]   Well, aren't you?
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.360]   Well, and so what happens is do Android devices
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.840]   become too expensive then?
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:27.640]   No.
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.360]   But what is-- you know what?
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.320]   It does hurt the third world market, the very, very, very
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.920]   low-cost phone market.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:35.320]   And they may go to end up going to Windows.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:37.680]   It might actually-- you know, maybe the big victor here
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.920]   is Microsoft, because Nokia, of course,
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:43.120]   which makes the bulk of cheap low-end feature phones,
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.320]   may just say they're already going
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.520]   to deal with Microsoft.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:47.920]   I don't want to pay the Google tax or the Apple tax,
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:48.360]   I should say.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.320]   So I'm going to make a Microsoft phone.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:54.680]   That's why-- I'm sure that's why Microsoft did it.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:59.880]   And Apple doesn't license it so, so it's an interesting question.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:03.560]   It does change things around a little bit.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:08.520]   Apple and Google are meeting with a member of the Senate
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.760]   to talk about privacy.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.760]   Chuck Schumer.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.960]   Chuck Schumer, what do you mean?
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.520]   What are you saying here?
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.520]   Chuck Schumer.
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.960]   Something tells me about Jeff has something to say about this.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:20.560]   Yeah, I'm going to say one more.
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.160]   Seems like you're upset about that.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.160]   What's going on there?
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:25.680]   I was screaming at the TV only this weekend,
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:28.240]   because Chuck Schumer is famous for having press conferences
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.240]   every Saturday.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:32.400]   When no one else has press conferences, they have lives.
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.440]   And so he gets his stupid, cocky story on the TV news.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.640]   You get the news cycle.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:37.200]   Right.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.400]   It gets this cycle going.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:39.480]   And that's where it is now.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:42.560]   So he comes out with, oh my god, there's stealing things.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.080]   And so there we are.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:44.520]   Bingo.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:45.000]   Right again.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.520]   We've got to meet with him, because he got his attention out of it.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.760]   Adam Fier, Tierra-- I hope it's Tierra, I don't know--
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:53.440]   who's a really good libertarian writer online--
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.160]   released a white paper today, 80 pages long.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.400]   And I think I put on the rundown.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.840]   It's really, really good so far.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.840]   I'm a quarter of the way through it.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.880]   About a topic that I was working on before,
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.960]   but he did a much better job than I would have done
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:10.360]   on moral crises, moral panics, rather.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.080]   And it's been called by others, this techno-panics.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:13.560]   Right.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:16.320]   And it goes back to the story I've had about Kodak cameras,
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.520]   causing all kinds of fears.
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.680]   Like just coming out of the wall and killing--
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:24.560]   cartoons, comic books, all these kinds of things
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:26.080]   that cause moral panics.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.320]   And that's where we are right now,
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.520]   is there's this illogical argument of possible harm and ohs,
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.200]   and politicians can grab on it.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.000]   And then, my god, we need a law.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:35.360]   Oh, good.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.400]   Now we need all kinds of people to regulate that law.
[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:39.360]   Now I'm going down tomorrow to Washington
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.840]   to speak to 1,000 chief privacy officers.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.480]   I'm going to carry a mask so I don't
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:49.400]   get hit with tomatoes in the head.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.800]   But that's why it starts this whole structure going.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.120]   So they're forced to go talk to Schumer,
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.960]   because Schumer knows he's going to get attention for it.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.800]   It's a cynical act.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.760]   But the problem is that's where we are
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:00.760]   with last week's discussion.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.520]   I'm starting to believe all politics is cynical act.
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.080]   It just is.
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:05.560]   It is.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:11.400]   So Mr. Schumer said, this Chuck have a strong accent.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:13.360]   Oh.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:16.200]   He said, we asked them if they could find a way on their own
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.160]   to prevent apps from having access to private info.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.280]   They were friendly and open to the idea
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:24.200]   that it is ought to be changed.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.240]   That's Apple and Google.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.800]   They were friendly and open.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.960]   You know, what are you going to say?
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.240]   No, Senator.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:32.560]   I disagree.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.160]   Yeah, you're right, Chuck.
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.240]   That ought to be changed.
[00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:39.400]   We ought to fix that.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:43.280]   Neither Google nor Apple had a comment.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.040]   The stick, of course, is he has also
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:49.080]   sent a letter on a Sunday to the Federal Trade Commission
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.320]   asking them to investigate Apple and Google
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.640]   on these privacy issues.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.680]   Well, I learned something reading the White House's
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:54:00.280]   proposed privacy bill of rights and guidelines.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.800]   And I learned a little about the law.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.160]   And they're much more reasonable in Europe.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.280]   I still have some issues with them.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.200]   I'll write all that.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:11.120]   But their structure is-- and it said this oftentimes,
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:16.800]   even without legislation, the FTC shall do this and this
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:17.600]   and this.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:18.720]   What they say the FTC is going to do
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.800]   is that if you're a company and you warrant
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.560]   that you're going to have a behavior, either because you
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:25.320]   have your own policy or because you
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.880]   subscribe to an industry set of guidelines.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:33.160]   If you fail at that, that's when the FTC goes after you.
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.920]   So they don't need a law, which is exactly how the FTC has
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.040]   gone after Facebook and Google so far.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.280]   Because their contention was not that they violated the law,
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:44.000]   but that they violated their own policies.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.880]   And so if you get an industry to create a policy,
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:50.480]   then the FTC can go after you basically for a former fraud.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:54.520]   It further says that if you say that you subscribe
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.400]   to an international set of behaviors-- that
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.080]   is to say the EU's privacy regulations--
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:03.000]   and you fail on that in the United States,
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.120]   the FTC would persecute you on that basis
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.480]   without legislation or courts.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:13.320]   Well, as long as I got you head up,
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.560]   New German Bill wants Google to pay for new snippets.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:18.640]   We're just going to keep--
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.680]   it's like I'm poking Jeff with a stick.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:22.280]   Yeah, just kidding, Jeff.
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:25.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:29.320]   So--
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:32.200]   You've got a nice German lady there in the studio who's probably
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.200]   shaking her head all up.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.200]   She's laughing.
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:35.480]   She goes, Jarvis, about the German's here.
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:36.000]   There he goes.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.040]   After more than three years of intensive lobbying,
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.840]   German news organizations appear to have convinced politicians
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:45.360]   of Berlin of the need for law to protect the use of their content
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:50.680]   on the internet and for a compulsory licensing scheme to use it.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:54.320]   I guess it'll go up for a vote in the next few weeks.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:58.800]   Apparently, Belgium did the same thing, but nobody noticed.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.680]   Well, Belgium, there were court cases on this.
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.080]   Court decided it wasn't a law.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.000]   That's right.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:04.600]   Right.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.600]   Right.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:12.760]   Marcus Bekdahl, the editor of netspolitik.org,
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:14.960]   posted, for now, we're relying on the intelligence
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:19.920]   of the German parliament not to implement such nonsense.
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.160]   If the German parliament's anything like our Congress,
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:23.440]   I wouldn't rely on it.
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:25.440]   Oh.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.520]   They're probably smarter.
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.240]   They're busy these days because they're running Europe.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.320]   Germany's in charge.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.320]   Oh, you're frozen.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:32.320]   Oh.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:32.820]   Mm-mm.
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:33.760]   See how you were.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.320]   Never mind.
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.120]   He's fine.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:37.080]   So I was just upset.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.000]   It stopped poking him.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:46.640]   Google slashes storage prices, but still no G drive.
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.840]   Google had dropped the prices on cloud storage.
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.600]   I noticed that the other day I was actually talking about it
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.800]   on the radio show, and it went to look at the pricing,
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:58.240]   and it dropped a lot.
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:02.760]   Well, not a lot, but it dropped a decent amount,
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:06.320]   a couple of pennies per gigabyte.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:08.840]   Google's facing competition from Amazon's S3,
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:12.400]   as well as from Dropbox and Azure and SkyDrive
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.640]   and all the other.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:16.160]   Do you upload a lot of stuff to Google Docs?
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:16.720]   I don't.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:21.000]   But that is one of the things that I think we've talked about,
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.520]   but I think people don't know is that you can upload any arbitrary
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:26.040]   file to Google Docs.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.480]   It is cloud storage.
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:27.840]   It is.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.440]   I don't know if people know that.
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.080]   But it doesn't have the--
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.280]   we talked about it before, but it just
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.240]   doesn't have the functionality.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:34.080]   It's not easy.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:34.600]   Right.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:37.000]   It's even to manually do it, and I forget.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:37.760]   I guess I don't--
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:39.120]   I'm a little distracted.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.920]   I apparently just ordered 22 Apple T-shirts.
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:43.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.080]   I'll take one.
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:44.560]   Thanks.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.360]   $178 worth of Apple TVs.
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:48.360]   Wow.
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:49.960]   $3,800 worth of Apple stuff.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:50.460]   Yeah.
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:52.600]   I don't really want that many Apple TV.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:53.440]   One would do.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:56.440]   I don't know how to get out of this, though.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.480]   I'll pay you back for one.
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.200]   Maybe just continue shopping.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:57:59.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.160]   Apple TVs for everyone.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:04.160]   One year we gave Roku's to everybody--
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:04.760]   all the hosts.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:06.920]   Yes.
[00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:07.560]   Yes, you did.
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:11.160]   Indeed.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.400]   I'm going to take a break.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.600]   We have a few more things to talk about.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:17.600]   And then, of course, Jeff's number, Gina's tip, my tool.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:22.080]   Everybody-- I'm kidding.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:24.160]   Are you getting all-- and then polar bears?
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.120]   Are you kidding?
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.640]   I'm getting on Facebook, all these things,
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:28.880]   from saying join my network on branch.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.200]   What is that all about?
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:34.200]   Isn't that the new product from--
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.040]   Obvious.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.600]   Is Don Everly and Jason Goldman?
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.280]   Yeah, Obvious is investing in them.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:41.840]   It's a curated conversation.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.720]   I saw an example of it with Meg Horahan and Ev Williams.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:45.440]   I think it was that.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.400]   I think it was on branch.
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:47.320]   That was branch.
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.960]   And that was a really good conversation that Neil--
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:49.800]   It's a great conversation.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:50.920]   Organized that.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:51.440]   Oh, so sure.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.440]   Maybe I should say OK.
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.280]   When somebody says, join my branch?
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.560]   So from what I understand, you get
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:02.080]   invited to comment on a thread.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.480]   So when Neil was able to get together--
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.280]   Oh, a specific thread.
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:06.760]   --the original pirate team who built blogger to ask,
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.200]   how should blogs evolve?
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:10.400]   And then so everyone kind of gets to watch this conversation.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.640]   It's a little bit velvet ropey.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.040]   But that was a really good conversation.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.160]   It's a very good conversation.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:16.360]   Interesting.
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:16.840]   OK.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:18.320]   That all of them kind of participated in it.
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.960]   That's how we--
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:20.480]   Who else was there?
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.040]   Matt Howie Ev.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:25.520]   It was also interesting to see Meg Horahan and Ev,
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.360]   two of the partners who started blogger,
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.600]   disagree or trying to probe their mutual memories.
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:32.480]   Oh, interesting.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:33.360]   Do you remember--
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:34.860]   Yep.
[00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:36.680]   Don't you remember that time we looked those wireframes
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.560]   and talked about building that thing and we didn't?
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:40.120]   That was a really good--
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:40.640]   I can't maybe--
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.480]   I can't remember that, Ev.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:42.080]   Oh, yes, I did.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:42.720]   But this is what I meant.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:43.640]   Oh, OK.
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.320]   It was kind of cool.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.400]   And then I've said later at Google, we talked about this.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:52.720]   I mean, we should post that link in the show notes.
[00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.880]   But Branchette looks pretty interesting.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:56.440]   Is there a website?
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:57.400]   It's a branch link.
[00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:57.960]   Let me see if I can--
[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.200]   It's at branch.com.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.440]   Is that it?
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.800]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.720]   So you have to give them your email address.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.760]   Oh, what the hell?
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.800]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.440]   And then auto-failuring, tell me more.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.840]   OK.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.320]   So you're going through here.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:15.000]   We're working around the clock to make room for you.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.200]   In the meantime, tell us what you hope to find in branch.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.280]   Huh.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:19.880]   We could use that.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.680]   You know what we used for our live coverage of the--
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:23.440]   Yeah, to look--
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.240]   --outable announcement.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.600]   We used Google Hangouts.
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.520]   It was what I decided to do--
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.440]   I'm trying to figure out how to incorporate Hangouts
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.760]   into our stuff.
[01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.160]   And this worked pretty well.
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.720]   So we had our live panel.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.800]   And then I invited only tech journalists
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.760]   into the Google Hangout.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.480]   And I just-- you know, I have a pretty large group,
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.520]   hundreds of tech journalists.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:50.120]   And Mike Elgin, Steve Garfield, about eight people responded.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.160]   They were all tech pundits.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.760]   It worked great.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.840]   And it was kind of like having the second channel
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:00.000]   of conversation going on.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.760]   I thought that was a very interesting way to do it.
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.800]   I'd like to explore that maybe for this show.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:05.840]   I think it'd be great.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:06.840]   I think it'd be great.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.520]   I'm all for that.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.160]   It works better.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.360]   I think if there's an event, a special thing going on,
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:12.320]   as opposed to just a regular show.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:13.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.960]   I just added the link to the--
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.040]   Thank you.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.840]   --on down of that conversation.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.560]   You could now-- I mean, this is how Trace shows done, right?
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:24.120]   You can also record it--
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:24.760]   Right.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.600]   --on its own, and that is the show, right?
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:27.560]   And I did that.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:32.440]   And it will be-- it's on YouTube, I guess, because I did it.
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.040]   Actually, you know, I never checked to see.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.520]   But I think it would be on my YouTube channel.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:42.600]   Because I got invited to do that.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:42.880]   Nope.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.000]   That's just the Twig time lapse.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.880]   So I don't know where it went.
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.400]   It went somewhere.
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.920]   Would it be on Google+, well, we'll figure that out a bit.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.400]   I got to do a commercial for Squares and Uswers.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.360]   I just-- that's a good question.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.120]   Because I pushed the button and said, record this,
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:01.360]   and I say, it'll be public.
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.320]   We got 146 plus is 59, shares 208 comments.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.560]   I didn't even see the comments.
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.200]   Wow.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:14.720]   But now how do I-- do I go--
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.080]   Tim Street, Russell Holly, Steve Garfield, Mike Elgin,
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.480]   Lamar Wilson, and Jesse's Day.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:18.880]   It was great.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.280]   It was a great panel.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.360]   I don't know how you then watch it.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.200]   I'll have to figure that out.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.800]   Anyway, moving on, Squarespace.com,
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.320]   the secret behind exceptional websites.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.360]   I'm so excited.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.960]   They've got Squarespace 6s and beta right now.
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.400]   And I was able to wangle.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.040]   You'd think I could just pull strings,
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.960]   but no, I had to wangle an invitation to the new version 6.
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.560]   And I'm so excited.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.680]   I'm moving my blog over there.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.160]   One of the things they said, which
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.280]   is I think kind of interesting-- I think this is the state
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:51.360]   of the art and design now.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:54.520]   They said, you designed for mobile first.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.800]   That's telling, isn't it?
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.520]   You don't design a website for desktop.
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.960]   And then as an afterthought, say, we're
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.880]   going to have a mobile site that looks different.
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.640]   You design a site that looks good on both,
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.160]   that you design for mobile first.
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.720]   And who's done that with, I think,
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:12.760]   great effect is Ome Malek on his personal blog, which
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.400]   I think is Ome.co.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:21.680]   It's a beautiful, simple design that works great on mobile,
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:25.720]   but then has additional features, I guess, on the desktop.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.480]   So this is what Squarespace is doing.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:29.720]   This is very exciting.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:30.240]   If you are--
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.760]   This is a responsive design, right?
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.080]   Yeah, it's called responsive design.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:33.840]   That's right.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.440]   Very nice.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:34.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:35.560]   And so they're mingling.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.760]   So you don't have to be--
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.040]   Ome hired a designer.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.400]   It's very expensive.
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:42.360]   Trust me, I know we're doing another design for one
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:42.840]   of our sites.
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.760]   It's very, very expensive.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.240]   Define responsive design for me.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.360]   Gina, you're going to have to do that.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.400]   It's a web page designed in such a way
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.280]   that if you resize the browser viewport,
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.320]   it organizes itself in a way that it's
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.560]   readable at any size.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:01.040]   So if you visit the site, it looks on the iPhone.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.440]   The modules basically stack themselves in a way
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.960]   that it's readable on a screen, a small,
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.520]   it's a smartphone, two tablets.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:08.880]   That's what Lullabot said.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.680]   For a couple of bucks more, you can get a responsive design.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:13.520]   I said, I'll take it.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.520]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.160]   So if you resize your browser, you watch the page
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.280]   kind of reorganize itself, and it's always readable and usable.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.920]   And really, that it looks good on mobile, first and foremost.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.200]   Anyways, we could go on and on about the philosophy.
[01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.640]   This, but here's a great deal.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.120]   Go to squarespace.com.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.160]   Click the try and free button.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:32.440]   You can play with there stuff for free.
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.240]   All you need is the name for your site, a password,
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:35.560]   and your email address, and you're in.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:39.320]   And you get for two weeks, you get complete access
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.880]   to all the features, so many great features.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:46.560]   Design-- they have some brand new templates,
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.880]   13 new template redesigns, 85 new style options,
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:52.280]   two brand new templates.
[01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.880]   They've got integration with all the social media,
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.240]   automatic, built-in plugins.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.400]   You've got a great Android and iOS app,
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.680]   seamless blog importing and exporting.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.960]   It's got that Google philosophy.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.960]   You can get in and out for moveable type, WordPress type,
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.200]   and blogger preserves all the SEO, all the images.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.040]   All the links stay the same.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.080]   I can just go on and on, but it's really easy to try.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:17.080]   Just click that green button in there at squarespace.com.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.440]   And then once you've tried it and you want to sign up,
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:24.000]   it's very affordable-- by the way, this is hosting and the software.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.160]   So you're-- they're the web hosts.
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.960]   You don't have to install software,
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:28.960]   keep it secure or anything.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.360]   They do all of that at squarespace.com.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.920]   If you decide to buy, make sure you use the offer code
[01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.800]   TWIG3.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.840]   Twig in the number three, you get 30% off for three months.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.520]   It's a good deal.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:49.000]   squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.720]   And I will let you know when the new LEO goes up on Squarespace
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.360]   6, I'm very excited about that.
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.960]   The Squarespace team was at the Tech Meetup in New York,
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.240]   I think, last week.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.000]   And I didn't get to go over my students went,
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.640]   and they were just wowed by them.
[01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:02.640]   They were just absolutely wowed.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.040]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.840]   And it's neat that they're in New York.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.040]   They decided that they wanted to--
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.840]   Anthony, who started the company, was in Maryland,
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.000]   University of Maryland.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.520]   But he said he wanted to be in New York.
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.360]   And that was the first one.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:15.860]   Yay!
[01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:16.860]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:17.680]   So come out.
[01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.040]   Yeah.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.600]   California, you're such a cliche.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.400]   You're full of yourselves.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.280]   [SCREAMING]
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:26.080]   So you're so with it.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.600]   Oh, you just wish you lived here.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.960]   You just wish you lived in California.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.160]   Actually, you used to.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:32.880]   You moved to New York.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:33.920]   I actually tried to come back.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.320]   I tried-- I tried-- I came here,
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.280]   and then I tried to re-box my move and go back to California.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.920]   No, I love New York.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:40.720]   I love New York.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.560]   I would live in New York.
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.960]   Absolutely, except a kind of structure.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.680]   Yeah, years later, right?
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.960]   Helps of you marry a Jersey girl.
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.440]   And it's--
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:45.920]   It helps.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.400]   Years later.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:48.720]   I now say that I have to be here.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.920]   But at the time, I left California.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.520]   And I said, that's too easy here.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.200]   And I got to New York.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.640]   And I said, you idiot.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.360]   What's wrong with my feet, easy?
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:56.800]   Yes.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.640]   Yeah, life is a lot easier out here.
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.360]   But I got to tell you, if I started a company,
[01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.400]   I would do it in New York.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.960]   I would do it in New York before San Francisco.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.760]   Hey, Gina.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:04.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.320]   Really?
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:06.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.880]   Definitely.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.360]   Yeah, there's a big-- there's a burgeoning tech community.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:12.760]   There's some really interesting stuff going on.
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:13.960]   There's some really good companies,
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.360]   really good investors going on in New York.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.800]   That's where I would do it.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.080]   Of course, I was born and raised there.
[01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.160]   So you know, I--
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.040]   I was born back east and moved out west.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.640]   Jeff, where were you born?
[01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.280]   I was born in the Chicago area.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.240]   And then I went to four elementary schools in three states
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:33.160]   and four high schools in three states in three years.
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.120]   And that explains why I'm so neurotic.
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:39.200]   Or so brilliant.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.400]   No, neurotic.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.960]   Oh, so brilliant.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.560]   Google getting into the airline ticket business.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:46.720]   Now, this is-- I'm surprised that they did this
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.520]   after the whole thing of her IATA.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.520]   And--
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.360]   IATA, ITA.
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.920]   Google bought that, remember, ITA in order
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:01.000]   to have airline schedules on the search results.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.160]   Well, now they're going to sell tickets direct.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.960]   Now, it's just with a little tiny New England regional airline
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:09.560]   called Cape Air and Nantucket Airlines.
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.840]   But their software, their booking software,
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.320]   is powered by Google.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.560]   That's very-- I think this is very interesting.
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.800]   I think it is, too.
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:22.840]   It doesn't make every industry now nervous.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.920]   In the content industry, I keep saying
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:27.040]   that Google can't own content because it's channel conflict.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.960]   It's got to be trouble.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.840]   Well, now if you're in the travel industry,
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:35.320]   in any mediator role, Google's just
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.560]   going to go in and attack you.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:40.960]   And does that lead to antitrust, monopoly, too much power
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:41.600]   or arguments?
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.920]   Well, I'll tell you where it does with the price dumping
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.440]   problem.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:47.480]   For instance, these 25 cent movies and records
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:51.440]   are clearly for simply to get you to sign up for Google Wallet
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:51.960]   to have.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.400]   And it turns out now when you sign up for a new Gmail account--
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.960]   I know none of us have done that in a while--
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:57.200]   it asks you for a credit card.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.400]   You don't have to give it to them.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:03.160]   But they really want to get people into this payment system.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:03.960]   Same thing here.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.840]   They're selling tickets.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.560]   It may not even be about the tickets.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.240]   It may be a very small part.
[01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:11.320]   It's about getting you into the Google ecosphere.
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.720]   Well, Amazon is the best analog for this, right?
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.320]   Amazon with the $999.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:18.480]   Pissed off every publisher, they marshaled through it.
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.360]   And now you know what?
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:19.880]   It doesn't matter.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.000]   That's why they return some pricing power to the publishers
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.880]   because now Amazon is a publisher.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.720]   And it's a position to be so because of that.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:30.000]   This really-- I don't envy regulators now
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.080]   because when you look at a purchase like ITA,
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.480]   there's a whole lot more to think about.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.680]   And this whole idea of price dumping is the big issue.
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:41.160]   Google can lose money on stuff because they
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.560]   have a secondary way of making money.
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.080]   And that jeopardizes businesses that
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.920]   this is their primary business.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.040]   Yes.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.640]   I didn't know about that credit card during the Gmail sign.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.640]   I didn't either.
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.640]   [SIGHS]
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:56.520]   But yeah, it's interesting.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.680]   So it's a promotion for Google Wallet saying, hey,
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.280]   set up Google Wallet now while you're here,
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.120]   while you're signing up.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.160]   Give us your credit card and then you can buy stuff
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.560]   in the Google Play Store while it still says Android Market.
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:11.040]   I certainly don't regret doing that.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:13.080]   I use the Google Wallet a lot.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.080]   Same Amazon.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:14.600]   I love it.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.360]   It's great convenience.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:16.680]   You don't have to re-enter your credit card.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.520]   No, who wants to do that?
[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.040]   Just say buy it.
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:19.200]   I'll take that.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.080]   Yeah, it is more convenient.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:25.080]   And it would be interesting to see if mobile payment systems
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.960]   actually do kind of take off.
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.080]   I think that'll be--
[01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:31.640]   if they do take off, which I kind of hope to see them take off.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:33.640]   I don't want to deal with cash or credit cards.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.000]   I just want to be able to waive my phone
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.600]   and not have to touch the third hand.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:37.920]   I was surprised I was at Kmart.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.160]   And I could waive my phone at Kmart and pay.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:44.440]   Which shows you shop at Kmart.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.760]   Kmart is your saving place.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:46.960]   Nice shirt.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.040]   Nice shirt, Kmart.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.560]   This is a Scott Evest.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.120]   Scott Jordan's, by the way, going to join us on a triangulation
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.280]   this afternoon to talk about Shark Tank.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.320]   There is a story.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.400]   I love Shark Tank.
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.760]   I love it, love it, love it, love it, love it.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.600]   I show it to my entrepreneurial students.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.960]   Did you know that in order to get on Shark Tank,
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:07.440]   you have to give them equity in your company?
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:09.200]   Give Shark Tank the company?
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:10.720]   What's happening on the TV show?
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:11.720]   Yes.
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:13.280]   You give ABC the producers of Shark Tank.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:15.200]   You give them equity in your company.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.000]   In order merely to appear.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.960]   Because they know they're adding tremendous value.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.840]   Whether or not you got money from the Sharks.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:22.960]   Doesn't matter.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.040]   Doesn't matter.
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.840]   What a great business model.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.840]   I should just start doing that.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.960]   Just give me one share, man.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:28.800]   That's all I want.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.600]   Just one share.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.520]   Anyway, we're going to talk about Scott Jordan
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:34.560]   was on Shark Tank last week.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.920]   We'll talk about his experience on triangulation this afternoon.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.400]   Which was his business?
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.640]   Scott makes this.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.840]   He says, Scott, he's best.
[01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:41.840]   Yeah, he makes the--
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.840]   Well, he was going to get money.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.840]   Why did he accept money?
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:44.840]   He doesn't need money.
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:45.840]   I don't know.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.840]   I think he's starting a new venture.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.320]   But he said he was careful not to mention Scott,
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.360]   he's best on Shark Tank, or they would get equity
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.520]   into an existing company.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.200]   Oh, wow.
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.600]   So it is a new business he's doing.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:57.120]   Right.
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.120]   Yeah, something like that.
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.120]   So it's like American Idol.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.520]   If you go on American Idol, and you've got to sign up,
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.520]   basically, with the new--
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.040]   You have to sign with your record company.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.040]   It's by the way.
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.040]   It's the same guy.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.040]   There you go.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:12.040]   He's a very--
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:14.040]   What I like about this is entrepreneurs as stars, right?
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:20.600]   Entrepreneurship is becoming cool, and the creators of companies
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.600]   are becoming stars.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.600]   Right.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.600]   That's me.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.600]   Right.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:31.520]   NBC has partnered with YouTube for the 2012 Olympics.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:34.760]   They're going to provide the video player and live streaming infrastructure for the Olympic
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.760]   games on NBC.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:36.760]   That makes sense.
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:41.000]   Nobody knows better than YouTube how to do this stuff, right?
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.440]   NBC says they're going to broadcast every live event in some form showing more than
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.320]   3,600 hours of Olympic coverage.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:57.440]   So YouTube will leave official video on demand partner at NBCOlympics.com.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.440]   That's good.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.560]   I like-- they can-- especially when it's a different time zone.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.080]   It's not so bad for you East Coasters, but for West Coasters is it--
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.080]   --the most interesting thing about the universe is the universe.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.080]   Yeah, it's the worst.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.080]   It's the worst.
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.080]   It was really bad in China.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.080]   You know, you couldn't see anything live.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.080]   Mm-hmm.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.080]   Yep.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.880]   Well, at least you don't have to stay up late for the Oscars.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:16.880]   That's true.
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:17.880]   That's true.
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.440]   I was so glad that was live.
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.800]   The Grammys was taped delayed.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:21.800]   It makes me crazy.
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:25.760]   It's like, this thing is taped up the road, and I have to wait three hours to watch it.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:29.280]   And it's kind of the Twitter world where people are talking about what's live events.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.200]   It's so frustrating.
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.440]   So are the Google Map car, the Street View car is coming to a neighborhood near you?
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:37.520]   Are you ready?
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:38.520]   Are you ready?
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:41.680]   Comedian Nathan Filion says, yeah, I'm ready.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.280]   Is this a new house you're in?
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:45.840]   It's a-- yeah, it's a new house to me.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.520]   They didn't just build it, but it's a new house to me.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.840]   I moved not too long ago.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:53.320]   There's always-- there's always-- you're very excited about the new house, but there's
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:55.760]   always things you're going to miss about your old house.
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.760]   OK.
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.920]   One of my big things I was missing about my old house that kind of made it hard to move
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:04.280]   was if you looked it up on Google, the Google Map, you did that street feature where it
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:07.120]   ticks the map, pulls it up, and you're looking at the front of your house, you can see my
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.120]   cat.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:11.120]   My cat made it into the picture.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:12.120]   [DING]
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.120]   There he is.
[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:16.120]   So I was kind of like, oh, I'm not going to have that anymore.
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.320]   Wait, what are you looking at it?
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.320]   Regularly.
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.320]   Do you?
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.320]   Cat doesn't move.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.320]   You can shoot it up the one time.
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.320]   So you look and you go like, hey, there he is.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:25.320]   Oh, look, that's a cat.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:26.320]   OK.
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:30.520]   And I was a little disappointed because I wouldn't have that feature right in my house
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.520]   anymore.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.520]   I'm standing on my porch.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.120]   This wasn't three months ago.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.400]   I'm standing on my porch and the Google Map car is coming down the street.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.400]   There's a car?
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:40.400]   You can't miss it.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.240]   There's all these big Google-- I've never seen that thing.
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:49.280]   It's got giant robot eyes all over it and devices on the wheels and they know exactly
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.920]   where they are and they're taking pictures everywhere they go.
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:52.920]   Wow.
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:53.920]   Here they come.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.600]   They're coming right down the-- oh, OK.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.360]   I need a Google Map pose.
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.360]   [APPLAUSE]
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:11.000]   And I think this is very important and something everybody-- I'm looking at you guys-- everybody
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.520]   should think about is if the Google Map car is coming down the street, what am I going
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.560]   to do?
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.560]   And this was mine.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:26.360]   Of course, Nathan Flynn, not a comedian.
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.280]   He was now from a serenity and he's now got a TV show called Castle, which I can't
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:35.840]   actually-- on the other hand, there's the guy in France who's suing because the Google
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:41.760]   Street View picture took him a picture of him peen in front of a truck in a driveway
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:45.400]   and as somebody pointed out today, it invokes the Barbara Stray's hand rule.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.400]   Right.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.400]   Don't bring it up.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.400]   So is this guy with a pen?
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:52.880]   He says, I live in a small town and even though they blow up my face, they recognize
[01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:53.880]   the rest of me.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:55.280]   I don't know what to do.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:58.440]   And they're mocking me endlessly in my little town.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.120]   This should be a lesson to all men.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.120]   Why do men do this?
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:02.120]   Because we can, Gina.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.280]   Hey, you're just jealous.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.120]   It's so disgusting.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:10.800]   I-- listen, I am jealous about the convenience of that ability.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:11.800]   I am.
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:15.280]   But I wouldn't use it to pee on the side of it in public.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.280]   What is that?
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.280]   I don't know.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.280]   Come on.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.280]   It is true.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280]   It is a male thing.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.280]   They should skewer this guy.
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.280]   No.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.280]   It should be a lesson to all men who've ever peed in public.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:27.520]   Gina, this is the nation that invented the piss war.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:28.520]   That's true.
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.520]   In France?
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:30.520]   The piss war.
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.520]   They don't have many more.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.520]   They don't have many more.
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:35.440]   But in Paris, they used to have these little metal things that you go in and you pee.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.600]   And you're basically in public.
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:42.760]   I mean, you know, there's a little barrier, but they don't have those anymore.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:43.760]   Jeff, I don't know.
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:47.760]   I keep looking for piss wars and I couldn't find them anymore and then I'm anymore.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.760]   I'm sad.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:51.280]   That was a very nice thing.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.480]   I'm too shy to do that.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:53.880]   Even I am too shy to do that.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:56.800]   I have to say, it seems like it would be a lot of pressure.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:05.080]   I am proud to say that I have peed on a tree at the Bohemian Grove.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:08.760]   So you're supposed to do.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:12.040]   There's no women there, so it's okay.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.920]   And the trees are very stunted looking.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:20.800]   Jonathan Franzen, one of my favorite novelists, he wrote the possessions in his most recent
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.640]   book, what's it called?
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:26.080]   No, sorry, the corrections is most recent book is called freedom.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.080]   Fantastic.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:32.640]   He says, Twitter is the ultimate irresponsible medium.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:38.280]   You old farts.
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:40.120]   Twitter is unspeakably irritating.
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.320]   Actually, I agree with him on that.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:45.280]   Twitter stands for everything I oppose.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.280]   It's hard to cite facts or create an argument in 140 characters.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:54.120]   It's as if Kafka had decided to make a video semaphoring the metaphor, metamorphosis, or
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:18:01.040]   it's like writing a novel without the letter P. It's the ultimate irresponsible medium people
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:03.720]   I care about are readers, particularly serious readers and writers.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:04.720]   These are my people.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:06.480]   We do not like to yak about ourselves.
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:08.400]   Oh my, oh my, oh my.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.600]   Oh, fart.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:10.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:14.000]   I've revised my opinion of Jonathan Franzen.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.720]   No, I still like his novels.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:20.320]   All right, time for Gina's tip of the week, Ms. Tripani.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:27.520]   Yes, this is a good tip for fans of Thank You and Please for nice people, like myself
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.440]   and big fan of Please and Thank You.
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:31.560]   Google has added a little feature to search results.
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:36.200]   We all know that you can see if one of your friends has plus won a search result and those
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.440]   will show up higher in your results if you're signing a Google.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:44.120]   Now if you search for something and say Leo has plus won the link that I found useful,
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.000]   there is a link to thank the person.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   Oh my God.
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.840]   So he can click thank, like right there.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:52.920]   Thank Danny Sullivan for the first meeting of this search engine called Google and it
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.160]   just opens up a window for you to be like, hey, you know, you help me out.
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:57.160]   Thanks a lot.
[01:18:57.160 --> 01:19:02.920]   I love this because I'm a nice person and I like the Please and Thank You and I like
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:07.400]   software that makes that easy and possible stack overflow does this and jig does this.
[01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:11.320]   There's a couple of bits of software that let you kind of, it's kind of like plus wanting
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:16.000]   someone or favoriting someone, but I wish that sometimes Twitter or like lots of social
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.640]   software had a way to just be like, hey, thanks, you know, you help me out.
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:20.640]   This helped me out.
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:24.120]   So Google is incorporating that now and into search results.
[01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.640]   And you know, it's interesting.
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:27.040]   This kind of there's a story.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.280]   I think maybe it was last week.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:32.320]   I think it was after our last episode about how Google Plus is this ghost town and no one
[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.320]   really uses it.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:37.680]   But then Vic and Dutre came out and basically said, you know, Google Plus is an A product.
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:38.680]   It is the product.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.760]   You know, it's not going away.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:43.360]   The Google Plus is Google period.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:47.680]   So and I like to see them do things like this, you know, incorporating that this kind of
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:52.040]   use of the service inside of their, their, their premier service, which is the search
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.040]   and the result.
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.040]   So I'm seeing the thank you links now.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.040]   I don't know.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.040]   Are you seeing them?
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.040]   Are you seeing them?
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.040]   Well, Leo, I think they're well that I tried.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:00.280]   I tried to, but I don't see, I don't see any social links at all.
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.040]   So I might, I might have turned that off.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.040]   Oh, you might have turned that off.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.040]   Okay.
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:05.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:09.400]   So if I Google the word Google, I see that several of my friends, many of whom are Googlers
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:13.160]   have, you know, it says these, these people have plus one this and then I get this thank
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:14.160]   them link.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:19.160]   And it actually, that's so nice pops up away from me to just send them a message on Google
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.160]   Plus saying thank you.
[01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.160]   That's nice.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:24.760]   You're so right, Gina, because every fears that the internet's gonna make rude and nasty
[01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:27.120]   and awful and is ruining civilization.
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.560]   It's just a nice little touch.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.000]   So I say thank Dan Patterson.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.800]   Well, this is the thing that internet has to build in mechanisms like this to encourage
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.800]   good behavior, right?
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:36.800]   Yes.
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:40.400]   So easy to be a jerk, right, behind the screen.
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.800]   You know, it kind of encourages you to be a jerk.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:46.400]   So I think apps, especially social web apps have to kind of overcompensate in this way.
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.800]   You know, say thank you.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.680]   That's a nice, I mean, it's a little finger waggy, you know, mommy, your vegetables,
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.680]   brush your teeth.
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:53.680]   I don't like it.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:54.680]   But it's good.
[01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:55.680]   And it's only to Dan Patterson.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:56.680]   It's not public.
[01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:59.560]   So it's not like I'm going to be spamming Google Plus with this.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:01.160]   I think that's not nice.
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:03.080]   Not, it's not all thank you as good a Dan Patterson.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.080]   Just that one.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.080]   Just that one.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:06.080]   Just that one.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.080]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.120]   Yeah, saying it now online.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.600]   That's really cool.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.680]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.480]   Oh, me.
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:17.880]   Oh, I love that though.
[01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:22.680]   I just watch Jeff's frame.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:28.640]   Oh, I'll do my, I'll do my tool and then we'll do the number of the week if the tool
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.280]   shows up.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.960]   So you're a good rumba.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:37.800]   We were talking last week, Jammerby, John Slonina, my studio manager and one of our
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:45.400]   greatest contributors said that this is this maps GL thing new.
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:49.160]   And we decided it wasn't new, but now he said, no, it is new.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.160]   And it's on.
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:53.320]   If you go to maps.google.com and I'm still waiting for it and you need to do this.
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:57.200]   The person whom you're trying to reach currently unavailable.
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:01.600]   Oh, you need to do this in Chrome, I think.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:07.680]   It's maps GL view 3D buildings, fly over 45 degree aerial view imagery swoop quickly
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.080]   into street view without a plug-in.
[01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:13.240]   So this is just something you might want to try enabling.
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.880]   My system is kind of slow right now.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.760]   So I don't know if what this is going to look like.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:21.120]   Chrome does not work well on this Mac for some reason.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.440]   Okay, now it's enabled.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.440]   Welcome.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:29.000]   Let's go take a guided tour of maps.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.240]   Click here to start the tour.
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:32.680]   Anyway, you might want to do this on your own system.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:34.960]   Shall we see a Westminster Abbey?
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:35.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:36.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:37.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:41.240]   Okay, I'm in satellite, so I'm going to choose map, map mode first.
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:43.120]   That's one thing you have to do.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:52.600]   And then let's go to Westminster Abbey London.
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:55.520]   Get the pop up out of there.
[01:22:55.520 --> 01:23:00.480]   I want the Google map cameras to go to the castle in downtown Abbey.
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.960]   Oh, I know.
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:03.800]   I know that's cool.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.520]   Zoom until the slider is here.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.520]   Okay.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.740]   Do you see?
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:12.340]   Do you see?
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:14.200]   See 3D buildings.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:19.080]   So you could do this before, but now you're actually doing it.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.560]   Now we can zoom and pan.
[01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:28.080]   And these are supposed to change the angle.
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.040]   Shift some...
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:35.240]   Zoom in and pan.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:40.200]   Hold the middle mouse button.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.080]   What middle mouse button?
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:44.560]   That's a very googly thing to say.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.280]   Hold the middle mouse button.
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:51.360]   Anyway, I'll leave it to those of you who have middle mouse buttons.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:56.240]   I have a pad that clicks.
[01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.160]   I just have a pad.
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.040]   See now we're seeing some...
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.280]   Some 3Dness.
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.280]   3Dness.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:04.760]   Oh, I wasn't in the map mode.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:05.920]   That's why.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.440]   There we go.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.440]   There we go.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:10.440]   And now, anyway.
[01:24:10.440 --> 01:24:11.600]   Jeff, are you back?
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.600]   We can't get him.
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:13.600]   He's not back.
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:14.600]   No.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:15.600]   And he's left our document.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.880]   He's probably restarted.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:19.600]   I think his whole system is offline.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:20.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:21.600]   That's okay.
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.800]   We had a number.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.800]   I should go to the Google Doc and see.
[01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.200]   His number?
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.200]   What was his number?
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.200]   Twenty million.
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.200]   Twenty million.
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.200]   Twenty million.
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.000]   Gag hits that number.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   Oh, Gaga.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000]   Gotcha.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000]   It sounded like a Gaga.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   All right.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.960]   Maybe Gag was some sort of subliminal thing.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:42.960]   Lady Gaga hits 20 million Twitter followers.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.240]   Unfreaking believable.
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:47.960]   I remember when I was the number one guy on Twitter.
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:50.560]   Of course it was 2007.
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.760]   And I had 5,000 followers into this.
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:54.760]   That's a...
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:57.160]   I should go up here on your Wall of Achievement.
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.480]   Being the biggest follower.
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.960]   Having the biggest follower on Twitter is a big deal.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:01.960]   Didn't last.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:02.960]   It didn't last.
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.960]   But you were early.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:04.960]   You saw it.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:05.960]   It was early.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:09.880]   It's back when having 5,000 followers on Twitter could make you number one.
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.400]   And then Kevin Rose, I don't know if you remember.
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.280]   And I had this little battle about who was number one on Twitter.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.640]   And then Lady Gaga came along.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.240]   Justin Bieber, 18 million.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.280]   Katie Perry, 15 seven.
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:21.680]   Shakira, 14 five.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:25.880]   My problem is my hips do lie.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.520]   Yours and my balls.
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.040]   They don't lie.
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.040]   They lay there.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.040]   It's because similar.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:33.040]   Wow.
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.040]   That's amazing.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.040]   She also has 48 million.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.040]   Oh, is Jeff still?
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.040]   No.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.040]   All right.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.040]   I don't want to do his number without him.
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:43.040]   48 million fans on Facebook and 800,000 circled on Google.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:44.920]   Actually, that isn't very many.
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:47.320]   But that's because she joined Google plus way late.
[01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.760]   Just a couple of weeks ago.
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:50.480]   She'll be big there.
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:51.480]   You know why?
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.400]   Because she actually interacts with her fans on Twitter.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:56.280]   She will type stuff and I admire that.
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:59.680]   I think unlike a lot of people.
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:00.840]   So no luck with Jeff.
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:01.840]   That's all right.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.760]   I think probably City University of New York is a big crater right now.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.760]   I don't know if it's gone.
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:09.000]   Yeah, he's not backing our doc and he's still not.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.600]   I've called him multiple times.
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.040]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.040]   CUNY, they call it.
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.640]   He also is the author of a great book called Public Parts.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.640]   You must read it.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.640]   His blog is buzzmachine.com.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:28.840]   Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org and the author of ThinkUpApp, ThinkUpApp.com and should
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:33.480]   have as many followers as Lady Gaga and the fact that she doesn't is a massive crime against
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.480]   humanity.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.640]   Oh, I don't know about that.
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:36.640]   Gaga's pretty fabulous.
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.640]   I don't know.
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.080]   But thank you for saying that, Leah.
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:40.800]   I go Gaga over Gaga.
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:42.760]   I thank you all for being here.
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:47.240]   We do this show every single Wednesday, one o'clock Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time at
[01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:48.240]   twit.tv.
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:52.120]   You can watch live, but if you don't get to, please by all means download the audio or
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:53.120]   video.
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.920]   We make both available in a variety of formats at the website, t-w-i-t.tv or subscribe and
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:02.960]   Google Listener Dog Catcher or iTunes or whatever it is you use to listen to podcasts.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:06.840]   And that way you make sure you get it every single week.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:10.000]   Oh my goodness.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:14.200]   I've finally got to please sign in in the Apple store after an hour and a half.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:16.560]   Wait, so you haven't placed the order yet?
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:18.160]   No, I keep doing this.
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:21.440]   I thought so you didn't order the 30 Apple TVs with the two minutes.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:23.920]   No, of course I didn't.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:24.920]   I stopped it.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:25.920]   You can't unload it.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:26.920]   Those easy.
[01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:29.880]   You think I should put a little blanket out in front of the brick house?
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:33.200]   Apple TVs get your Apple TVs here.
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:35.200]   Brand new 1080p.
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.200]   Oh, good.
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:41.680]   But don't show the screen right now because it's showing my personal stuff.
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:43.480]   We'll just, we'll just.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.480]   Thank you.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:45.480]   Sorry.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:46.480]   The transition.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:47.480]   Did you?
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.480]   Yes.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.480]   Oh, we wait.
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:54.480]   Do you do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.480]   That one has an armband.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.840]   Oh, it's banded.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.120]   So are they in a zoo?
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:04.480]   Oh, there's one right up on the screen.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:05.480]   Nice.
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:06.480]   Oh, the Internet is watching.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.520]   Let me just make sure I've got one of each.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:15.320]   Yes, she's Louise, and I'm going to have one of them personalized with Leo LaPoix chief
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.320]   to it.
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.320]   Leo, you really.
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:21.960]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:22.960]   Oops.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.680]   And the apple fonts.
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:26.680]   So close.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:31.920]   Yes, I feel like that penguin is flapping my wings, but I don't go anywhere.
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:34.040]   You got wings.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.680]   I have a flightless iPad buyer.
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:42.120]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:43.120]   Thank you for a great show.
[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:44.120]   All right.
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.120]   See you later.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.120]   Bye bye.
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:29:01.440]   So is there a Fraule-Fele in the studio?
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:03.200]   Eh, who?
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.200]   Yes, she's here.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.200]   Fraule-Fele, this is just Hachman.
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:08.200]   Fraule-Fele?
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:09.200]   Fraule-Fele?
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:10.200]   Yes.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.200]   Where are you from?
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.200]   Germany.
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:13.200]   Well, I knew that much.
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:15.200]   You're in Germany.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.880]   Dusseldorf.
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:17.880]   And do you--
[01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:18.880]   Don't go through that's built.
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:19.880]   They're built.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:20.880]   She built.
[01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:21.880]   She's--
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:22.880]   They built.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:26.160]   She says something in German.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:33.520]   It really isn't amusing that I am so monolingual, but there you go.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:36.960]   As I always say, I speak 1.1 languages.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:41.920]   Well, that's not-- how did you know that she would be here?
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.520]   She did a picture of me on the monitor.
[01:29:44.520 --> 01:29:46.880]   Oh, well, welcome.
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:47.880]   That's nice.
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.200]   We've had an audience all day today.
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.200]   It's been really fun.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:55.120]   I love having people in here because I'm so proud of the studio and everything.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:58.840]   And we probably should start getting rid of those Macs, however.
[01:29:58.840 --> 01:30:00.520]   That's not a permanent display.
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:04.120]   We can leave them for this.
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:06.080]   I don't know what the hell we're going to talk about today.
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.320]   Well, we got polar bears again.
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.720]   I mean, it's kind of raining over here.
[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.320]   There's some-- there looks to be some frost.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:13.760]   So something's happening.
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.760]   So--
[01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:15.760]   Thank God for--
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.760]   It's just the update.
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:17.760]   Thank God for Eileen.
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:21.400]   I don't know what we do without the polar bear care.
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:22.280]   We got some stuff.
