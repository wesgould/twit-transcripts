[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.300]   Yeah, I love me - mr. Sondheim of course
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.900]   Here's one that at least I see a lot of motion
[00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:18.700]   So I learned the organ when I was a kid that
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:27.120]   Yeah, did you ever had organs at every living room in the 50s had in the house the cat baby?
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.120]   It was it was from my grandparents. Yeah
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.320]   They bought that and the encyclopedia Britannica. Yeah, we're both yeah. Yeah, so between
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:43.260]   1880 and 1900 the number of pianos in America went front and home was went from 800,000 to 4 million one in every 15
[00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.260]   Homes to one in every five homes Wow
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.340]   Wow figure that out and then the radio came out and they got really exactly
[00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.340]   Never mind
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.420]   I tweeted that and everybody said I got a piano. I'm trying to get rid of me
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.580]   You can't get rid of you. You got a pain to get a ticket away now. I miss
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.860]   Every once in a while you'll go somewhere where there's no TV
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.700]   There's no internet and people have to entertain themselves and it's wonderful because people will do that they'll sell a person a song
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.100]   They'll do little skits they'll play you know charades. It's so much. It's nice
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.860]   What you do on your cruises no cruises they get all that stuff
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.940]   You don't have to I get people to do that for you. You know, that's the whole point of a cruise
[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.300]   All right big story big story broke a couple of days ago
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.020]   Jack Dorsey very suddenly leaves
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.300]   Twitter
[00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.460]   This is his tweet not sure anyone has heard but I resigned from Twitter
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.980]   It's from after 16 years of having enrolled our company from co-founder
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.740]   To see we should say by the way. I think a lot of people think Jack Dorsey invented Twitter
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.980]   Right that is not the case
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.540]   He he was at the he was at the company is Jack Biz Ev
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.740]   And then the guy who invented is so is a fourth person
[00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:07.460]   Who thought had this beetle? Yeah, he's I've forgotten his name now as everybody else has but they were swinging on the swing sets
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.460]   at South Park in San Francisco and
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.100]   And they were trying to figure out what to do because ODO which was here was a good idea of where they am said
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.700]   Why don't we do a company a podcast company now make podcasts?
[00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.420]   We'll just have a directory and tell people how to download them called ODO ODEO
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.100]   And that was such a floppy ended up paying the investors back. It gave the investors back
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:32.220]   Which is pretty amazing. No one glass was that his name? No glass. There's the man
[00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:38.380]   Yeah, you know what you could probably get that from all the best book about Twitter is Nick Bilton's
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.180]   Book about Twitter talks about that. Yeah
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.300]   Hanging Twitter. Yeah, very good boy. You got a good memory
[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.260]   And Noah glass was the guy who thought it up
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:55.540]   But these guys were all there anyway 16 years having a roller company from co-founder to CEO to chair to executive chair to interim CEO to CEO
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.620]   Jack says it's time for me to leave. Why well, no one knows
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:05.500]   No one knows well actually Dan pre-mac had a really good story talking about what's the theory? So
[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:09.500]   His theory is that Elliot management was unhappy with it
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.300]   That happened last summer
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:19.880]   Last March in Twitter. Yeah, they gave Elliot a board seat. They did some things, but yeah
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.460]   behind the scenes
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:28.100]   Elliot had won a new management and more product innovation and I
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:34.260]   Think they just kind of influenced the ask until they got it is kind of his theory they pushed it and pushed it and pushed it
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260]   Or Jack just finally made sense to people
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:43.340]   Well one of the things Elliot which who Elliot these folks Elliot management are at what they call activist investors
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:49.820]   They take they buy a stake in a company big enough stakes so they got listened to and then they go in and they really do try to shake things
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.580]   up in house and
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:56.220]   One of the things they didn't like was the fact that Jack was splitting his time between Twitter and Square. Yep
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.580]   There's other companies so he's gonna stay at Square. I
[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.060]   think also
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:07.180]   There's something to be said I let me see if I bookmarked this did you see how he says the whole?
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.860]   Founder led is is pretty much a problem nowadays
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:18.660]   Becomes one at some point kind of right wasn't he kind of saying that that it's okay for a while who said that Jack said it
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.900]   In that statement. Yeah, there's also
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.500]   There's also I can't remember where I read it
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:30.340]   But it was an article saying well, it's interesting that all of these people are leaving just as soon as it becomes hard
[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.540]   Exactly
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:40.740]   Stuff is hitting the fan and there's all kinds of controversy around your platform and people are calling you out because everybody has a
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:46.140]   Megaphone to do so now so yeah taking that money and running that's all the new CEO
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:53.180]   It's funny the stock market when they saw the rumor the Dorsey was leaving Twitter stock went up then as soon as they heard
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.020]   Who was replacing in Paregg Agra wall?
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.620]   They went oh and the stock tumbled yeah
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.620]   He's a CTO and the reason the thinking is that
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:10.660]   Stock market didn't like it because he's an insider and they wanted fresh blood they wanted somebody who come and figure out
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.700]   What is really the challenge for Twitter which is given its?
[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.740]   Its success its position in the mind share of America
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:25.260]   Not necessarily the number of users because that's not really growing but it should be doing better
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.060]   It should be making more money and why isn't it? That's what the stock market's asking and they figure well
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:37.300]   Agra wall is wall is just gonna do the same agar wall agar wall is that you say agar wall?
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.940]   Yeah, it's a g r a w a l so I'm saying it phonetically agra wall
[00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.060]   Oh, but I don't know wait Jack founded square
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.140]   Well along with Ev Williams
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.980]   No, no you don't know. Oh square. Yeah. Yeah, Jack squares Jack's baby. Yeah
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.980]   so
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:05.980]   There's a famous story of him going to a maker space and actually 3d printing the first because the whole thing about square was you got there
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.260]   I first started for free. They send you the card reader that would go in your
[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.700]   Into the headphone Jack
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:16.820]   And there's the story is he would go to the maker space
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:22.460]   I think in the East Bay here and and 3d print until he came up with on me. He was very involved in other words
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:28.460]   Yeah, but I'm just saying that because he's he was complaining about founder led companies
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.700]   Right. Well, he's to all the square versus Twitter. Isn't it much younger?
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.660]   Well
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:41.220]   He's gonna he's gonna stay on the board for a little bit
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.840]   But he really wants to leave and he says I'm gonna leave because I don't want to be
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.060]   overseeing
[00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:52.700]   You know, I want power out to have his you know and by the way, this is a weird transition because usually
[00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.620]   There's months of preparing. I'm gonna leave in jen june first
[00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:17.100]   Nothing par
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:23.460]   Good guy in the valley and co CEOs are always a terrible idea. Yeah, that's all I'm gonna say
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:29.820]   I want you to know this was my decision says Jack. I own it. I was a tough one for me
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:34.500]   I love this service and company and all of you so much. I'm really sad yet really happy
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.580]   There aren't many companies that get to this level and there aren't many founders that chose their company over their own ego
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.580]   I know we'll prove this was the right
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:47.540]   Move but then you also has crypto currency aspirations to well. Yeah, well interestingly
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:51.180]   Paregg Agra wall was also in charge of
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:54.980]   Twitter's crypto stuff. I presume still will be
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.380]   CTO the belief is he'll carry on blue sky
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.340]   Yeah, and trying to come up with a distributed architecture
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.020]   Which is where I have the biggest hope we've talked about the show a few weeks ago
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.780]   I think there's a lot of hope for the next level of the internet
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.540]   The net kind of distribution that kind of value but later from the point of view of a for-profit company
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.300]   It's kind of hard to see how that helps Twitter be a successful company
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:24.180]   Hmm. I think there's a lot of value added services they can put on top which you'd pay for which would get premium advertising
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:28.340]   Which could have commerce? I think there's ways to have basically
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:31.020]   scores of Twitter's
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:36.460]   Is what I see with with with with blue sky. What about Ben Thompson's take?
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:42.340]   Why I didn't have a data read it you he writes long story bottom line
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.580]   He says well, it's it's actually quite interesting
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.340]   He talks about Twitter's advertising problem
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:54.900]   And I think he characterizes Twitter in a way that those of you who really love Twitter and I'm including about Stacy and Jeff
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.700]   I like Twitter as well. Okay, so you two might agree with
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:04.620]   He says Twitter is intense and
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.900]   combative
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:12.100]   It's a lean forward experience and far more likely to be tied to something happening in the physical world
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:17.980]   Whether that be watching sports or politics or doing work in other words, you're you're you're leaning into Twitter
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:23.060]   He says this matters for advertising particularly advertising that depends on a direct response
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:29.580]   Which Twitter has been forced to to resort to when you're leaning back and relaxed as in say Instagram
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.460]   Mm-hmm. Why not click through to that Shopify site to buy that Nick Nack?
[00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.460]   You didn't even know you needed how many times have I done that?
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:40.220]   When you're leaning forward though, and I think this is true of Twitter users
[00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:46.460]   You don't have the time or the inclination if you're doing Twitter. You're really not clicking add links. You're seeking the information
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:52.020]   Not in there. Yeah, but I've got another theory. Well, wait a minute. I'm not so let me give you all events theory. Yeah
[00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.020]   It's better. Sorry. It takes a while. Yes. I'm sorry
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:15:00.500]   Hey, I'm saving you hours of reading dude. Thank you. Yeah, this ties into Twitter's third big problem
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:06.140]   I forgot what the first one was this was a hundred thousand sentences ago it ties into to his third big problem
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:11.740]   The number of people actually want to experience the internet that this way and this lean forward active way is relatively small
[00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.500]   There's a reason that Twitter's user base is only a fraction of Instagram
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.020]   It's not a lack of awareness
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:22.700]   For sure everybody knows about Twitter the reality is most people are visual Twitter is textual. Yep
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:29.540]   Which of course is exactly why Twitter's most fervent users can't really imagine going anywhere else you three are the exact
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:36.980]   Prototypes like that. Yep. So he says you're gonna have a problem making money on Twitter in the old-fashioned way with advertising
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:43.100]   He says, you know what Twitter should bite the bullet and become a subscription service
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:49.620]   The let's it did well fully subscription paywalls. Oh, there's so let's review
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:56.580]   There's both little evidence that Twitter can monetize via direct response marketing a reason to believe the problem is not simply mismanagement
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:01.260]   I agree. I think it's in it's it's structural at the same time Twitter is absolutely essential
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:07.100]   To a core group of users who are simply not uncan or not simply unconcerned with the problems
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:12.100]   Inherent to Twitter's model public broadcast model the abuse and mob behavior
[00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:17.500]   They don't care about that but actually find the platform indispensable for precisely these those reasons
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.980]   Twitter is where news is made
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.980]   shaped and battled over and
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:28.020]   There's very little chance of another platform displacing it in large part because no one's economically motivated to do so
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.020]   They look at Twitter and go. Yeah, I'm not doing that
[00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.740]   So given this why not charge for access?
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:40.820]   This goes to things there one is I think you can but if you have these these value added layers
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:44.860]   The this is what Jack said when I when I said this on Twitter
[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:50.740]   He came back and said exactly I said that that blue sky thinks that the speech layer is gonna be the commodified layer
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:55.500]   And then you add value layers on there. I want to find the authoritative people
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.060]   I want to find the entertaining people. I want to find the relevant things
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:05.380]   I want to find stuff and others can come along and create those value-added layers and charge for those
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.140]   Charging for a place to go talk and blather. No, we got plenty of that
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:15.580]   Yeah, but to go to the effort to find something on top. This is always what happens right? It happened with with I'm sorry
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:17.580]   I'm gonna say this Gutenberg it happened
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.620]   where we hit
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:23.620]   The late the turn of the last century when magazines exploded
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:31.300]   There's efforts to say there's a wealth of things going on. How do we find stuff? That's point. Here's the two point two. Oh, yeah
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.420]   I know you had two points. Go ahead. I told you did
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:40.900]   I lost track of the points go ahead point
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:46.500]   Okay, simply put the advertising on Twitter sucks because you feel like you've been fooled every time you click on it
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:52.860]   Which is not good and I think that what Twitter should do is what BuzzFeed did and what Vice did in their days
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:57.100]   Is they need to open their own agency where we say we know how to make advertising that works on Twitter
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:03.660]   You idiots don't and they haven't done that and they've got to invest in advertising that would be relevant or would be
[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:10.300]   worthwhile to do something the advertising is there I always think oh, I was like on that. Oh, it's promoted. No, I'm glad I didn't
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.020]   So those were two points. Thank you very much for that
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.980]   I would submit the what the reason your first point doesn't work is because Twitter is unique
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.860]   So your first point you're talking about an area where there's many like many different
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:26.740]   Publications but Twitter. I don't think there's anything like Twitter. Twitter is a unique experience
[00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:31.740]   So I think anything that says let a thousand flowers bloom. That's not the point
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.540]   Everybody goes to Twitter because that's where it happened
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.860]   There's a billion Twitters though. You and I don't see the same Twitter. I understand you hate it
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.340]   I like it still one Twitter even if there's even if it's
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.340]   Customizable
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.900]   You go to Twitter. You don't go somewhere else if somebody if in fact
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:55.980]   I was just on Twitter and I saw somebody's name and I thought is he dead. Yeah, and and and the reason
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:02.140]   You know in the trending and in the end never look at trending. I hate never never never never well on the Twitter front page
[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:08.060]   It's there. I hate to say it. I don't look at it. I never see it. You're using it wrong. So anyway
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.180]   No, I'm the one who likes it. You're the one who's using it. I think most people
[00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:16.580]   By the way about it and Twitter certainly would prefer this go to the front to go to the website the front page
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:19.780]   Yeah, I actually use tweet deck and I don't see any of that stuff
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:22.300]   But but really if you go to the front page, that's what you see
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:26.460]   But that's the point is this is where it's happening. This is it. This is ground zero
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.980]   That's all mass media thinking that's no
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:34.620]   So that's what that's what they have to get rid of I would get rid of trending entirely and the idea that there is one Twitter and Twitter
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.700]   Says Twitter left Twitter to this is BS. There is no Twitter
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:45.020]   There's a whole bunch of fascinating amazing wonderful informative voices along with some jerks and a-holes
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:51.180]   And and and the point is to find the ones that you like and the ones that that I like are gonna be different
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.460]   And that's okay, and there's value to be found in there
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:58.140]   Wait a minute, but this isn't exactly like the old way of like
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.260]   There's a New York Times
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:07.940]   This is Twitter isn't monolithic in that sense. It's only monolithic in that it's all happening at Twitter.com
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:13.660]   So I think it's the best of both worlds. It is absolutely who had ever feed you want to make of it
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.980]   But it all happens at Twitter.com and because it all happens to Twitter.com
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:22.860]   You can do that you can conform it and I tell you this comes from my experience with Mastodon
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.420]   Which is a federated?
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.460]   System and there is no there there and so
[00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.860]   You have to actually actively figure out if you want to follow somebody interesting you have to know about them
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.340]   It's a completely different experience on Twitter
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.960]   It's all there and it's it's real
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.580]   It's trivial to add that person to your experience or take that person away from your experience
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:45.060]   So I do think there's a lot to be said for the fact that it's a centralized
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.780]   One place but Harper's new monthly started in 1850. Sorry
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.980]   They promised that quote it would be a place within reach to it
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:21:00.820]   Job would be to place within reach the great mass of American people the unbounded treasures of the periodical literature of the present day
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.020]   That's what we need for Twitter, and I think
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:10.900]   Isn't that what no literature part there's nothing longer than my COVID list does that to an extent
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.700]   Yes, but I you know could I charge for my COVID list if you really wanted no
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.540]   That's why I'm saying you can't Twitter can
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:23.100]   Well, no, but under blue sky I could I know and that's what I'm gonna work and I'll do more development
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:25.100]   It's like an API for content recommendation
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:31.300]   No, we'll see I think I think Ben's actually got it exactly right now
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:35.420]   There's a challenge because if you start charging for something that's previously free that's people
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:44.220]   But I think enough people like you guys are so addicted to Twitter that you would I mean can't be like a lot
[00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:49.820]   It's gonna be like Twitter blues two or three bucks a month. Yeah, I think they made a mistake by making Twitter blue
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.340]   too little
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:56.500]   In terms of features too few features and and they didn't require it
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.580]   But I think you could maybe you'd lose a third half of your users
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:06.300]   But it's if you could somehow charge three bucks a month and keep Twitter being the place where it happens
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:10.620]   That's a great business well to their credit Twitter blue is still new
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:13.820]   They're probably working on some more features for that three. They just didn't get a great
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.380]   They didn't go far enough. Yeah, you're fine
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:20.500]   and if you lose users you lose some of the value of the platform because I mean I
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:28.300]   Think you I don't think you lose the users it matter the people are most not sure that the best the people who I follow that
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:32.780]   I find most interesting are not journalists and people like that. It's the people who are
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:40.100]   like small people who research FCC filings and you know experts in antenna design
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:45.500]   Well history wonks on my side. Yeah, and they may not be willing to pay three bucks a month. Yeah
[00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:51.700]   Your plan is the Donald Trump wouldn't bother with Twitter if it were just people paying for it
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.740]   Seriously
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:23:00.620]   No, that's just that's wrong the reason he loves Twitter is not because the base read it the base season on Twitter
[00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:04.180]   It's because the media sees it and then amplifies. That's it. That's all it is
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.220]   Narcissist. I don't think the base is reading him on Twitter
[00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:12.020]   I think the media is and that's that's one of the reasons you use Twitter because that's where the media is
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.020]   Yeah, you could stick it in our eye
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.340]   Did you see about Twitter's policy on?
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:23.620]   Hosting we have to say on this. This is really interesting. So another thing that happened
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:27.660]   Oh, yeah, and it happened after Dorsey leaving. I'm wondering if this is
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:35.380]   Move no, no, they ban sharing private images and videos without consent
[00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:38.860]   That's a lot of interviews about this. Yeah, what does that mean?
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:46.860]   What they're trying to do I think it's just a badly written policy with a good intent and it and a lot of us came on quickly and said
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:52.300]   Whoa what intended consequences watch out? Mm-hmm. The policy is trying to say we're trying to fight
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:58.860]   Harris one of the ways people harass each other is by putting up addresses and they already say you can't do that with phone numbers
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:05.520]   No, no, no, no, no, right another way they say is that we put up photos people don't want and so what they're saying is that somebody comes to us and says
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.140]   Jarvis put up a photo of Leo the port picking his nose and
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:15.620]   Leo says I'm fed up with this guy Jarvis. He harris is me all the time. He knows I have a nose job
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.620]   he knows how sensitive I am about this and
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.540]   It's you can't understand how bad it is
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:26.340]   I didn't give my permission so under this rule because you didn't get permission for the photo to be up
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.380]   We're gonna say we'll take it down. Oh, I gotta nose. I got a schnoz
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.900]   We'll compare here
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.820]   Unfortunately in this in this the now you a public figure who they're explicitly exempt
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.500]   But let's say I were to public figure. Yeah, right exactly. Well, you're not fully exempt either
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.900]   And so the problem is there's this broad statement
[00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:50.780]   Which Twitter can use in the future if you come to them to say that photos without permission aren't allowed
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:56.480]   But that statement alone is really really troubling because do I have to go and get you know the the
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.220]   Permission of everybody I take a picture of in Central Park. Yes
[00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.140]   Yes, what's wrong with that?
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.460]   That's no, no, they have to complain first
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:09.660]   So they just complain first. Let's say you took a so let's say you took a picture of people in Central Park
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.740]   And let's say I was skipping work that day and I see myself in your picture. I'm like, oh mother plucker
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:19.420]   So I come after you and I say Jeff you skip take that down. Oh you skip going to work
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.660]   I thought you were skipping as an hopscot poppin skipping. Oh, I do also skip
[00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:27.340]   That would be embarrassing that would be gotta be more embarrassing Stacy if you were caught skipping
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.340]   So you could as a private
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.340]   Program Jeff not up
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.140]   Let's let's go and track here
[00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:40.220]   As a private individual you would say I don't want you to have then I would I would email Jeff
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:45.500]   Twitter and I would say hey this photo of me is online and I don't want it and Jeff would have to take it down
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:51.180]   I think it's primarily it's primarily about harassment say revenge porn things like that
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.500]   Right, but it has a
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:59.180]   Journalism and and what if what if here's here's the argument we'll make so if one of the cops who murdered George Floyd
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:04.940]   Said I'm a private individual right now as he was doing it. He was and I didn't give a picture that photo and take it down
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:10.060]   Um, that's what people were fearing the head of Reuters of the New York
[00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.420]   Of the White House press photographers association
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.820]   Complained about just that on Twitter saying whoa, this is going to have an impact on journalism
[00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:23.340]   On newsmakers doing things it's going to be used by cops to say i'm private individual take that down
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:29.820]   But but our cops are private individually for cops doing something in in public as part of his job, right?
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.820]   He's not private individual
[00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:37.020]   So I thought well, well, no public in public in the case of twitter doesn't mean government public means we don't know what it means
[00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:42.060]   We don't know what it means. It's a badly written policy. Yeah, so I don't think the policy is ill intended
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:45.660]   I don't think it's a it's a problem in itself, but it can be misinterpreted
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.780]   It couldn't because confusion it needs a lot of clarification and a lot of people if I go to
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.540]   a protest so let's say I
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:59.420]   Sitting oh, let's say I went to the q and on wait for jf k thing in dallas
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:04.220]   And I took pictures of people there and I posted it and I was like hey
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.020]   this is you know
[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:12.700]   Well, I I the only reason I would post a picture of someone in that situation. I'd be like, hey, it's the q shamed guy
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.660]   He's hanging out here. I thought it was a jail. Um,
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.500]   And then what would happen is so bad honestly
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:28.140]   Um, I think the problem is it's turning into a judgment call for twitter. It's not as but any any moderation
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.300]   It's the wrong judgment. Yes, it is moderation
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:35.020]   And you're quite right, but the judgment is now is not what the judge would be the judgment should be is this harris
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:39.180]   But or not instead the judgment is is this public or private or not?
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.860]   And and that's what's going to get in trouble with things like newsmaking
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.860]   Now to stay sees point your points. Stacy. There is i'll give you an example where that's the case
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:51.500]   What if if if you go to a demonstration that has a lot of undocumented immigrants
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:58.780]   Who are this happens this happened in north western university where the paper took photos on campus of people in a demonstration?
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:05.100]   And some of them said whoa, that's gonna. Let me read. Let me read. Maybe you haven't read the actual policy
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.500]   this policy is not applicable to media featuring public figures or
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:15.740]   individuals when media and accompanying tweet text are shared in the public interest
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:20.060]   Or add value to the public discourse, right? So they've got to make a judgment about that
[00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:25.020]   And I think I'd rather have them that exempts paris the george floyd video that exempts
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.180]   Well, when does it become when does it become in the public interest?
[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:34.380]   Uh, that's the well, I think all journalism pictures. No, I think all journalism
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.580]   Would be shared add value the public discourse or in the public interest would call
[00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:44.620]   A young woman who took the video of george floyd was not a journalist not media
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:52.060]   That's the that's the point. So at that moment some moderator says well, but look at this look at the rules. Hmm. Yeah, not a public figure
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:57.820]   Uh, not good permission. It's all I think I think this is clear enough that a moderator understands
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.540]   That if it's harassment
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:06.780]   It should go down. It should go down. I mean, that's what they're trying. That's what they're saying policy should be written as that's my point
[00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:13.660]   If the purpose of dissemination private images of public figures or individuals were part of a public conversation is to harass
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.980]   Intimidate or use fear to silence them. We may remove the content
[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:22.060]   In our line in line with our policy against abusive behavior
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:27.180]   Right, but above it just says outright that that photos without permission are not to be on twitter
[00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.580]   That's the problem that statement
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:33.740]   Then we'll get miss interpret in all kinds of ways because that's that's that's that's that's the line of
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:37.740]   It's on the bullet. So this is not allowed photos without permission not allowed period
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:42.140]   And other things will fall out from that there should have the caveat should be there
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:47.580]   Yeah, that's I think this is I think this is uh, it's fixable. What's that fix? What's that button?
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.740]   You have the moral panic button. I think this is
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:56.940]   Panicking it is not is not here. Just look you chase Stacy away. I don't think this uh, I don't I think you're
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.580]   Presuming there's problems ahead of time
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:04.220]   Well, I hello. What does everybody complain about the internet? I think this is what will happen
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:09.260]   I think this is the time to have that discussion. I think this is I think this is well designed actually and
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:15.500]   Is pretty clear in its intent and obviously it's not a legal document. It's not a contract
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.980]   It's just an expression of what their intent is in terms of moderation
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:23.180]   And I think that it will be done properly if it's not then people can bring it up
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:28.540]   But I think this is exactly right that if if it's shared in the public interest or ads value public discourse
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:34.540]   Will allow it if it's done to harass people we will not hear let's bring up as an example
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.980]   Marjorie Taylor green or no no no loren bobert
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:43.900]   Calling ylana omar a terrorist. Mm-hmm now they're both public figures
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:51.580]   Uh, it is probably not shared in the public interest or adding value of public discourse. It's probably intended to be harassment
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:57.100]   I think twitter there's enough room in here that twitter's can can make a judgment call
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:02.860]   They're gonna have to is if you want something that's written so tightly that there's no judgment involved. I think you're out of luck
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.260]   I don't know I want judgment. I just want it. It's relevant to the point which is harassment
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.660]   Rather than having that like about that
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:15.580]   Well, I understand the bullet points there, but the bullet point is not the legal like a legal contract that it has
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:21.500]   I guarantee you cops are gonna use it that way. Well in twitter has the right to say no
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:27.180]   Because look it's shared in the public interest rights and it's not to harass you. It's because you murdered somebody
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.580]   I'm here's another example. So let's take a picture
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:34.140]   Let's take a screenshot of the three of us. Okay, and or Stacy if she's back the four of us
[00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:39.020]   I'm back. I had to open the door for my dog. I'm gonna read on wait a minute
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:46.460]   Were you recognize there are instances where account holders may share images or videos of private individuals in an effort to help someone
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:51.660]   Involve in a crisis situation such as in the after this is specifically written for George Floyd
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:57.020]   Such as in the aftermath of a violent violent event or part of a newsworthy event due to public interest value
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:01.260]   And this might outweigh the safety risks to a person a suggestion
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.660]   We will always try to assess the context in which the content is shared
[00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.260]   And in such cases we may allow the images or videos to remain on the service
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:12.220]   I think this is actually quite well written and I think it's well
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:16.780]   I don't think there's a reason to be right. I don't think we just disagree about the excuse
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:20.220]   I don't think there's a reason to fear this. I think this is
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:21.980]   Look
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:27.020]   We keep saying we want twitter to do something about this stuff. They do something and now we
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.740]   Equivocate and quibbles with what clarity and so Kathy yellow. I think was great about this
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.540]   Uh, but we should we should have her on the show. She's great
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.060]   Um
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:40.220]   Um trying to find her I can't find her. She's what I'm about to section to three today. The niece the niece
[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.540]   I'm not alone in this there were a lot of people who raised the same issues
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:49.180]   Which means that it wasn't clear enough and it just needs to be clear. That's all it's not a big deal
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:55.020]   The new i had a new york post reporter call me today wanting to find oh this came a day after jack left
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:59.020]   Just being so they said no no doesn't and it wanted to find it was a whole big thing. I said no
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:06.060]   It doesn't relax. It's just uh that some of us are saying there could be unintended consequences. I think it's quite clear
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:07.820]   I disagree for instance
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:12.940]   We would take into consideration whether the image is publicly available and or is being covered by mainstream
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:20.060]   Traditional media or if a particular image in the accompanying tweet text adds value to the public discourse is being shared in the public interest
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:25.900]   Whereas relevant to the community. I think this is fairly clear about their intent and I think their intent is 100 right on
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.820]   Now let's wait and see what happens
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:33.020]   But I I think it's much more likely that they're just not going to enforce it than that they're going to enforce it poorly
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:36.140]   I think that much more likely there this is lip service
[00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:40.860]   Right and so then you're going to have people on the right coming after them and saying I asked for taking on my
[00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.940]   That photo i'm making fun of me and they wouldn't do it and and they're going to find them
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.820]   I think there's enough places in this copy where they could say no no read line 50
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:54.780]   It says in the public interest. I don't I don't see this being a problem now. All right, so we disagree there
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:34:00.300]   We'll wait and see but it's not a big disagreement here. Yeah, I'm a bad policy. I think it's badly
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:04.860]   I'm really glad they did this. We've been wanting twitter to take a stand on this
[00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:09.180]   Because that to now they don't and uh, you know they take pictures
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:14.940]   Uh, i'm a public figure so I accept that but they take pictures of my family and post them
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:19.180]   Uh, and I can't get them down. So now I have
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:24.700]   A foothold to get them down. I think that's come that's a good thing nice
[00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:31.020]   Denise howl summarize it on twitter in general under us law and individuals reasonable
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:34.700]   Of privacy were now in about in the public place is low
[00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:38.940]   Well, that factor into twitter's analysis of what constitutes consent
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:43.420]   This remains to be seen but it sounds like twitter has something more explicit in mind
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:48.060]   I think so I would submit that twitter doesn't want to be the place where you post
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:52.300]   pictures of kids fight school fighting in school. Yeah, they don't want to be
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:58.540]   Admittedly that stuff's legal. You're in a public place. Yeah, that doesn't violate law
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:05.740]   But they want to be a higher standard. They don't want to be sensible. Yeah, if I were Tom Brady, I would definitely want this taken down
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.940]   So, I mean
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:13.180]   No, see you can't because he's a public figure right and this is no's worthy or not. I don't know
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:18.060]   Um, did you see um, the other news online 23?
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.540]   That happened within the last hour or so no
[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:28.620]   Square's changing its name. Thank you for putting that in that's new. It's gonna be okay. What's like square, but not
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:32.540]   Block block. We're gonna call it block
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:37.980]   It's like traffic is like as in blockchain. Yeah
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:44.540]   Payments giant square will change its corporate name to block effects of uh, december 10th
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.860]   That's a big deal because you build brand recognition for years. Yep as square
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:54.140]   Now your whole name is that the brand of the of the uh, they change are they changing the brand of the service
[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:58.940]   Well, you built the square brand for your solar business, which is where it belongs
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.420]   Sondrosi block is a new name
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:05.980]   But for our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same here's what kate runny's running at cnbc
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:11.420]   I think she's right the move comes as square expands beyond its original credit card reader business
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.980]   With a focus on new technologies like blockchain. I think that's fair. Yep. Yep
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.420]   Block it'll still be a ticker sq
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.700]   Blockhead jokes to come
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.100]   Blocks a good name. I surprise it's available
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.300]   Oh, I'm sure they paid a pretty penny for it
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:34.380]   By the way, I forgot this but they bought jz's music service title. Yep. They also
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:37.260]   Yeah, I forgot that
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:41.820]   They also bought the by now by the way, apparently we were talking about this one with his weekly
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.300]   By now pay later is all the rage
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:49.820]   Apparently they bought a afterpay which is a by now pay later thing. Are you an afterpay?
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:52.700]   Yep
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.580]   Thanks for joining us. Do you see uh, let me see what else I can tell it
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.220]   They bought her chocolate juice. No, they didn't know
[00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:04.140]   I'm like what else do they own I am so pluix. Yeah, that's interesting yet
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:09.500]   So we were talking about by now pay later on windows weekly is
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:13.420]   Unaccountably microsoft has bundled this in and you can't turn it off
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:17.660]   A little by now pay later thing into its browser edge
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:23.260]   To encourage people to buy now pay later. That's what browser I don't use
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:27.900]   Yeah, that's a really good reason to not to use the I tried it. That's ridiculous
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.020]   But then they started putting a bunch of coupon things up on the screen
[00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:36.700]   I feel like by now pay later is the equivalent of payday loans, right? It's like um
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.860]   Could be a predatory less predatory, but I mean
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:46.060]   Yeah, there's no interest right if you buy now is it like layaway? What is it? I don't
[00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:51.420]   It's more like layaway most of them don't have interest, but they can
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:56.780]   Well, though. There's some they just have long term evil part here. So to get you to buy things you can't afford. Yes
[00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:59.740]   Yeah, a lot of them just have those long stretched out terms
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.980]   Yeah, I'm trying to remember there was a whole I read like several articles
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.700]   I was fascinated by it because I was curious who was but doing it
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.780]   Well, let me look up what after-paced terms are since they're owned by square
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:18.140]   Uh afterpay your gift list apparently it was one of the things that fueled black friday and cyber monday sales
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.900]   lot of
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.460]   And by the way, the kids call it bnpl
[00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.220]   lot of
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:26.220]   Thank you
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:31.260]   OMG OMG buy a bnpl purchases for black friday
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:37.820]   Uh afterpay how it works here. We go shop now pay over six weeks never pay interest
[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:41.660]   Uh, does this who pays for this the merchant?
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:47.820]   There's got to be how does after they make money so you get you get late fees
[00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.660]   um in
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.340]   Merchants do pay
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:55.900]   And it says let's see credit karma did a survey. This is a consumer reports article on it
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:39:00.460]   34 percent of consumers who use bnpl services fell behind on one or more
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.380]   And young people are
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:02.540]   Wow
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.780]   Afterpay says late fees are capped at 25 percent of the purchase price
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.140]   So clearly they're hoping to get a little bit of that
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:15.980]   Is this for the unbanked and the unaccredited or do you how do you pay in turn? Do you pay the credit card?
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:21.740]   It's an option to get away from credit cards. No external credit checks. No interest. No fees
[00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:26.620]   That's that's a lot of this. Yeah, that's a lot of this. So it's it's a risk thing
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:34.220]   Calculating the risk of a bad pay and I'm thinking the merchants pay a few points on the sale too, right?
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:37.580]   You must that must be where the bulk of their revenue comes from the merchants
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:41.180]   Because it's like a credit card, right?
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.380]   But it's not
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:48.220]   Yeah, because they're not
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:50.620]   Well, I guess they are giving you credit
[00:39:51.580 --> 00:40:00.300]   Afterpay charges here. I've got the info afterpay charges 4.17 percent to the merchant on all that's higher than a credit card. Yeah
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:04.460]   So it's late payment fees plus merchant fees
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:09.500]   Yeah, and sometimes you're late payment fees if you miss them they will get reported to a credit bureau
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:13.820]   But sometimes they won't and it kind of depends in the rules very
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:17.100]   Via provider. So the online shop
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.060]   charges a flat fee of 30 percent
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.860]   I'm sorry 30 cents
[00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:28.700]   And a commission that varies with the value and volume of the transactions processed using afterpay the more you sell
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:33.420]   The lower the percentage the fee can be as high as 6 percent per transaction
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.780]   And as low as 4 percent. So it is more than a credit card
[00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.860]   Both of harder credit in order to get you to the merchant so I'm
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.020]   I'm Joe's
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:46.780]   Blue jeans shop in order to get you to buy blue jeans got a little yah young people in here
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:50.300]   They don't have credit cards. I say look buy now pay later. It's easy
[00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:55.340]   I I give up 4 to 6 percent of the sale, but I make the sale
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.660]   Um
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.660]   I wonder if you can get insurance for bad
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.220]   debt and payment
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:08.780]   Afterpay pays within 48 hours. So the the risk is not on the market. What was good. The risk is on afterpay
[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.700]   Yeah
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:14.300]   Afterpay pays the whole amount. Yeah, 48 hours. Oh
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:17.420]   Wow
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.700]   So it's it's been risk mitigation business. It's entirely risk mitigation
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:28.380]   The merchant is totally fine. I wonder if you get turned down. Can you can you kill off your afterpay account because you've oh, I'm sure they could be
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.580]   Blacklisted from afterpay. Yeah, sure. Yeah
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:37.660]   Uh, on the other hand, maybe they don't want to blacklist you because they get that the sweet 25 percent in late fees
[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:40.300]   Yeah, like credit card companies want you to pay late. Yeah
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:47.180]   Well, now we've learned everything there is to know about bnpl and by the way when asked microsoft said oh
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:52.220]   Uh, when you use edge and buy now pay later, uh, we don't take a fee from the merchant
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.580]   But then when asked, well, does anybody pay you they said no comment
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:58.220]   So
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:01.260]   Yeah, the answer would be yeah, we make money on it
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.740]   Uh, I just feels a little
[00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:06.780]   Skeavy to me for microsoft to encourage this
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:11.100]   Um, I guess it's no different than a credit card, you know, I'm
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.780]   But we'd certainly been doing that for years. I tell my kids don't buy
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.140]   Baby don't you know if you use a credit card but pay it off every month
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.940]   Because I remember when I was their age, you know running up 30,000 credit card
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:28.700]   And bills right the stupid credit cards that shows up on the college campus with freshness. Oh, yeah
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:30.780]   I can't pay it off
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:34.380]   Vulture's totally screwed me up. Yeah, it's really screwed me up
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:37.020]   I I had to dig real my 30s
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.740]   Real deep to get that payment and then
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:43.580]   You know to finally pay off all the credit cards being what a great feeling that is
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:47.180]   And I just made a point from now on that credit card is not a charge card. All right
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.820]   I'm not gonna run up a
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:56.220]   Bill because I mean what 19 year olds right here. That takes us. You know that stuff. You know that takes it to some discipline exactly. Yeah
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:01.660]   Uh, my wife took over our bills real fast. Oh, yeah
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.540]   Yeah
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.540]   I'm not saying this why I'm married Lisa
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:10.620]   But it didn't hurt
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:15.100]   Nice to have a CFO. Yeah, no wait nice to have a CFO in the family
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:19.740]   She is so she's almost like scary good at this stuff
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:25.900]   I mean, it's like it's like oh wow. We've paid off the house. Oh, yeah, it shows. Oh, my god
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:29.660]   I mean she's scary. I don't I'm good and me. I'm like, hmm
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:36.220]   We have how many times have the where the lights turned off on the house because oh, I forgot to pay the electric bill
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:41.420]   We actually got this is hard to do got the water turned off. Oh, that is hard to do
[00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:44.620]   Wow, it wasn't I didn't have the money. That's it was just I forgot
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:45.580]   Yeah
[00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:52.220]   And then I saw the notices my wife makes fun of me because I used to insist on paying the bills once a month because that's how I should do it is
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:54.140]   Doing this mother said well, that doesn't matter. You're gonna. I don't care
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.260]   I just 30 first of the month you sit down at your little desk

[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:29.740]   I mean the only reason Andrew does it is yeah, because he's doing the business stuff anyway, but yeah
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:33.020]   So you have two people in the family who could do that. Yeah queen fruit
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:39.260]   She you know, she contributes so whatever but most of it falls on me and that's an agreement we've had from day

[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.060]   The interest rate it goes up to 18
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:01.260]   19
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:05.740]   She's uh, anyway, so twitter
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:10.300]   What do you think are they I feel like I'm still enjoying twitter blue
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:17.500]   I'm I'm too. I don't get much out of it, but it's good. I get the top articles. It's how articles has been great for me so far
[00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:26.060]   They were so smart to buy nuzzle. Mm-hmm and incorporate that in because there were a lot of people. I wish I was a I wasn't happy that they bought nuzzle
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:32.060]   I agree, but I know directly or did yeah, uh, Tony by no. No. No. Yeah, they bought it
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:39.660]   They bought the company the button. Oh, you're okay. Yeah, but I bet you that the venn diagram of twitter users and nuzzle users was like
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:43.340]   Yeah, 50 67. Oh, yeah. Right. Oh, yeah. Yeah
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:53.740]   Yeah, I'm still happy with twitter blue at the moment. It's three dollars. Well, you know, I'm not happy with who act blue
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:58.620]   act blue this is the uh, and I'm sure there's an act read. This is the
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:03.180]   Donations. Oh, this is the democratic donations. Yeah, oh, I
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.780]   I feel like this is a scam
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.100]   for instance
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:13.820]   They some dark patterns a little bit on the site where you don't know that you're signing up for a monthly
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:23.740]   Contribution. I didn't notice for months that I was giving a thousand dollars. Yeah, mark kelly who already won. Oh, jesus
[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.700]   I just lock predatory mock
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:30.780]   Um, dark patterns in dark. Maybe
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:36.780]   And I both sides do it. I know that the that's very common in uh, republican fundraising as well
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:42.700]   So I'm just not going to use act blue anymore. No, right to the donate right to the campaign all the all the
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:47.900]   I'm the only reason it's coming up is because I see stacey abrams is using act blue. Oh, okay. Yeah, that's why I can't
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:52.700]   They all just use anything. They all do it. Yeah, you just got to pay attention, but yeah, yeah, you do
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:55.420]   Don't they take it?
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:47:01.980]   Take a chunk. Don't they take it up. They do but you also can give them more and then they want you to also tip them
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:09.740]   Pretty predatory. It's gonna give direct
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:13.340]   Um
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.700]   Okay
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:20.460]   Okay, wow. I'm gonna take a break now after this fascinating but you didn't show these
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:24.620]   Can you show it the two in the onion before you went on the air? Oh, I'll show it
[00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:29.740]   But there's a bad word in it. I had somebody sent me uh get on the join the forums
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:34.780]   Saying you shouldn't say the word crap. I'm never gonna listen to your shows again because you said the word crap
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:40.060]   Yeah, I got kicked off the bbc for using the word crap because I was trying not to use the s word
[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.580]   I thought was the safe. I'll say crap and bull mikki k me off. Yeah, well
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:46.540]   I'm not of that religion
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:55.420]   But I don't like the other a whole word self-important a hole making big show about leaving twitter jactorsy
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:48:00.460]   Of course, that's you know play on the fact that everybody including me by the way leaves twitter has to rest
[00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:03.260]   The obligatory blog post about why i'm leaving twitter
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:10.060]   Jackson just blog posts. Yeah, I think that's good our show today brought to you by our crowd
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.060]   I love talking about this because
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:18.140]   You know for for years. I don't invest in the tech companies and i've sat on the sidelines and watched people like kevin rosket rich
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.940]   with the same you know
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.300]   because
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:26.140]   They're covering these stories and they're investing and and i'm just like well
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:27.980]   I'm sitting on the sidelines
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:31.100]   Maybe though if you're and you have to be in a certain position in your life
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:36.700]   Where you've you know, you've done all the right things you got the the rainy day fun and you're saving in the right way for
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:40.620]   Retirement all that stuff but there comes a time when you're saying I would like to invest
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:46.700]   In some of these exciting new companies these startups because every once in a while one comes along
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:51.500]   I knew I should I should have boy if I could have only invested in twitter before it went public
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:55.580]   Which is what kevin ros did I would be doing well right now sitting pretty
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.220]   You should know about our crowd
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:02.940]   Our crowd a a bunch of very smart venture capitalists. They're always analyzing companies
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:07.500]   In the private market. This is what's different. This is not here. You're not buying stocks
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:11.820]   Then the global and globals important too by the way they look all over the world
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:15.980]   They select those with the greatest growth potential and then they present them to you
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.580]   and say
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.580]   Would you like a chance to invest
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:25.340]   From personalized medicine to cybersecurity to robotics quantum computing and more
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:30.700]   In state of the art lab startup garages everywhere in between our crowd is identifying innovators
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:37.180]   So you can get in when the investment potential is the best which is early before the exit before the ipo
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:43.180]   But you can't it's not something to do easily right you you don't you don't read about these companies in the paper
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:50.380]   And I should mention in order to do this you need to be an accredited investor which every country has different rules about this
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.700]   You can find out
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:57.660]   You can you can buy just going to the our crowd website and entering your country and they'll tell you what the rules are
[00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:03.020]   But our crowds accredited investors have already invested over a billion dollars in growing tech companies
[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:09.340]   Our crowd has had now 46 exits 46 ipos or sale exits of their investments
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.540]   And those members really benefit when you get a big exit
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:17.420]   You can this is a great way to truly diversify your portfolio
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:25.820]   Investing and it doesn't have to be a massive investment. I'll explain investing early in innovative private market companies of our crowd
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:27.820]   Actually our crowd has two ways to do it
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:34.140]   Accredited investors can participate in single company deals for as little as $10,000

[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:57.740]   A lot of people we figured we're joined because you get ad-free versions of all the shows
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:00.620]   That's nice. No, most of them are there for the discord
[00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:04.540]   I think the discord is a very surprising word and wonderful thing
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:08.700]   Stacey had her book club there's going to do another one. There's a poll right now for the next
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:13.180]   And we're that that poll is now closed over. What did you pick closed it? It is
[00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:20.380]   Autonomous by miss oh annaly newlets. I can never say yeah in fact. Uh, I interviewed uh annaly
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:27.580]   On triangulation. I remember the book. It's a great. It's a fun book. Yeah. It's a super fun. Yeah
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:30.140]   Yeah, and brings up some interesting
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:33.740]   Robot human questions into a step
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:39.340]   Well, see now next up is we'll have to schedule the time for the next book club and miss stacey
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:41.820]   I will be reaching out to you to figure that out
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.060]   January because
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:48.620]   So when's the book when's the book club? January when is when are you gonna do autonomous?
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:53.900]   That's what we got in January. I don't know. I don't know if it's gonna be January after I've looked at my calendar
[00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:58.140]   But we'll see we have a lot of stuff coming up to a mirror. Mike Elgin are gonna do as virus
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:03.660]   I'm gonna do I'm gonna do that one. Uh, we also have you said to jeff jarves is well
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:07.580]   He's he's coming up a little bit later in spring. Yeah, I think he's scheduled me for like
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:13.580]   You
[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.540]   Seven bucks a month and you're not going to sit with him. Oh good
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:22.700]   You think you see all the stuff you get and I mean this is huge. We have the untetel linux show in there
[00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:31.260]   The book club there's all sorts of stuff going on in the discord all of the shows make it to the twit plus feed including dikty bar tollo's uh giz fizz
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:38.780]   So if you are interested, I think it's a very fair seven bucks a month cup of one frappuccino and a cup of coffee a month
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:44.620]   Uh and all the details and everything uh at twit.tv/club to it and by the way
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:50.060]   It's month to month one of the reasons we made it month to month is if you join and you go, I'm not getting my money's worth
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:53.660]   That's fine. I understand completely. We will always continue to do what we do
[00:54:53.660 --> 00:55:00.060]   You know the shows for free the chat remierc.tut.tv for free the twit forums twit.com community for free
[00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:05.740]   What's funny is the main complaint is uh, it should be ten dollars a month not seven really
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:09.660]   I think seven's right. Thanks for writing in about that
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:15.980]   Memberful gets y'all can pay more. Could you you could have a seven or a ten dollar option and see what people should
[00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:21.820]   get to cuts uh stripe gets a cut but I think we end up being about five dollars per person per month
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:26.140]   We're very happy with that. That's that we're so grateful to all of you
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:28.540]   And if you do that, you don't have to listen to the ads
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:33.500]   Which I think some people really like that idea. So yeah, that's it comments about that too
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:36.940]   Yeah, I'm gonna pay the seven dollars a month and I still want to hear to add
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:40.460]   And people say I don't want another subscription. I completely understand that's fine
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:44.940]   We're not there. No pressure, but we won't show up at your house demanding money. Yeah
[00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:49.420]   Appreciate this today the support appreciate the support. All right, aunt may show up
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:52.140]   Oh god
[00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:53.340]   Terrifying
[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:55.340]   Terrify run
[00:55:55.340 --> 00:55:57.660]   Black friday
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:59.500]   Not great
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.340]   It's not a thing anymore. Not a thing
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:06.620]   And the novelty is worn off the whole long lines and stuff I can remember
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:11.660]   Thanksgiving leaving my mother's house on you know, Thursday evening whatnot and
[00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:15.340]   getting on i-85 north to head back to charlotte and
[00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:21.420]   There was there's always this traffic heading off to the different exits near maul's because people were going shopping
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:26.380]   After eating their meals used to get up at four p four a.m
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.580]   on
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:29.580]   Thursday Thursday night friday morning
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:34.780]   To go to target, you know for the door bus specials. I don't think people do remember you'd see all those
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:39.020]   Yeah, you don't do that no stories, but people crushed. Yep. You don't see that anymore
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:45.260]   I think there's a few things going on black friday shopping dropped 28 percent from pre pandemic levels
[00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:53.340]   Now this is according to dobi and this is to big work and mortar stores. Okay, uh online was about even with last year
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:55.340]   So some of it is it went to online
[00:56:55.340 --> 00:56:58.220]   But I have a new theory that nobody's mentioned
[00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:01.180]   I think there's also a move to buy local
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:05.500]   And those aren't getting counted by adobe because they're small mom and pop stores
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:09.260]   And I wonder because i've noticed weird lee s and I
[00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:15.660]   Are doing that for our christmas presence. We're shopping rich people buy local. I don't say what rich people
[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:18.860]   Yeah, i'm serious buying locals expensive
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:23.260]   So rich people and there's small business saturday, but really what here's here's what it is
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:26.620]   It's this year. You got the pandemic. You also got
[00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:34.140]   The words about supply chain so people started doing their sales early. They've been selling a lot longer. You're right spread out. Yeah
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:41.820]   And then you've got the online shopping most people would rather do online shopping many retailers decided not even open on thanksgiving
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:47.180]   And so I think this is to brick and mortar stores on thanksgiving day
[00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:53.740]   Crater 90 percent from a year ago. That's according to sense of two years ago. That may also speak to you
[00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:59.260]   Um workforce issues. Yeah a lot of people on the target target decided to close
[00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:06.220]   On thanksgiving walmart best buy all my local starbucks is closing every day at one p.m. Now one p.m
[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:10.060]   You need more teenagers
[00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:13.100]   Have you noticed this what is sounds i'll try to make some
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.900]   Get on that
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:19.900]   I I noticed this downtown and starbucks down 15 years it's filled with high school kids
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:24.460]   This is instead of going to the mall. They go to starbucks. They do their homework. They sit at the tables
[00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:27.740]   They drink coffee. They chat. It's a social thing. It sure is
[00:58:27.740 --> 00:58:32.380]   Is that me or they've been doing that for like 10 years. Yeah, I know I'm just noticing. Yeah, oh
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:35.020]   But I think that's interesting
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:41.100]   But I think the reason that your starbucks jeff closes early is because uh everybody in your neighborhoods in bed by no
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.500]   I think it's a labor. I think they're trying to
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:46.300]   Tuff out unionizing
[00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:48.300]   You know
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:50.780]   They don't want to pay more they don't want to pay more or fight in a unionization
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:54.460]   So they'd rather close the stores and make less money. I'm some i'm shocked
[00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:59.100]   I haven't seen a business story about this just shocked. You know, yeah, you said this but this is only yours
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:02.540]   I know that my all around me my starbucks are
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:06.700]   But you're also in cia close to
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.380]   us
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:12.060]   Do maybe you're a little by coffee afternoon in your neighborhood
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:16.220]   They all want to sleep because they're old
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:18.220]   Naptime
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:24.940]   Yeah, I I will say I agree with mr. Stacey regarding the the big box stores versus the shop local because
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:30.140]   I can make that sacrifice and buy my groceries at the more expensive
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:37.820]   You know family-owned grocery store or whatever but electronics. I don't know if I can you know can afford to do that because
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:41.580]   Well, there's no real mom and pop electronics. Sorry is there
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:47.500]   Well, I mean some camera shops and things like that. They're all dying. That'll be nice of that, right?
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:51.500]   They're all dying, but I mean I still try to support the the one in
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:58.140]   Mostly it's clothing. I think so only only rich people go to a clothing store is that what you're saying?
[00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:03.180]   to me but
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:07.660]   They go to the big they go get costco to get their pants. I go to
[01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:11.660]   Walmart from my brittches
[01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:13.660]   Zara
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:19.740]   Tila cheaper where do you shop leo? I shop at nemon markers brooks brothers
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:26.380]   And it's beautiful. No, this is L.A.M. Actually. Oh, no, we're not going to move to them we gave them
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:31.740]   Did you get that? No, we were giving them way too much. L.L.B.E.N. goes with a wicked good slippers
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:34.940]   I only buy clothing from Maine
[01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:40.940]   Actually, that's true these shoes are also from Maine
[01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:43.980]   So how did you get to see that that quickly?
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:50.380]   Maine shoes are easy to put on and easy to take off
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:57.180]   That's one of the reasons you buy shoes. I forget this table is high. It can for you. Consider it high
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:59.580]   I can't really move like mates in it
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:05.980]   You see it made in Maine made in Maine says that doesn't it
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:11.180]   Maine Maine u.s. Now your finger smells too does not smell I have
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:16.700]   Times and and time honest does it smell? I'm not smelling his finger

[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:30.700]   Let's talk about what other stories my guys is trying to read anything else
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:33.900]   Thank you miss Stacy. Hey back on the tracks

[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:43.020]   What's the chip story? I don't know. I just boring but
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:47.980]   She'll make him make it interesting. No, no, no. Oh, let's talk about there's a Tesla story
[01:01:47.980 --> 01:01:50.620]   There's a really good Tesla model. Why story that's a good one
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:54.380]   The dog says a dog degree
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.180]   The Tesla story
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.620]   PayPal says
[01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:05.340]   Spending via its buy now pay later service soared 400 percent on black friday
[01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:10.380]   See you're just behind the times. Is it the people is that how poor people buy?
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:19.180]   You got it's an honest question and an honest answer. Yes, and you know, that's why you're poor
[01:02:19.180 --> 01:02:26.300]   Exactly. You don't spend the money you have you spend the money you don't have exactly
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:32.620]   It's it's all predatory big story. Here's one. I got one that Stacy's gonna go. Oh
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:34.780]   Oh
[01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:36.700]   Ready who no actually you're not
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:42.940]   Meta has chosen Amazon web services as its long-term strategic cloud provider
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:50.620]   According to protocol a big win for AWS. I think if meta, which is I thought this was so weird because meta
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:55.180]   Like facebook was one of the pioneers behind open compute right
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:03:02.540]   All the way back in 2008. I was quizzing mark succuburg on how many servers they had because it was a really interesting number
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:09.740]   So yeah, and I for the longest time thought they would really like this story push out. Oh, I'm sorry
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:12.620]   You're right. You didn't get an oo but you got another setting
[01:03:12.620 --> 01:03:15.740]   It worked really well
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:20.540]   No, you're really love it
[01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:24.780]   Facebook's famous for open compute, which was a network operation center
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:31.660]   Yeah, they did run they do run their own. So I thought they were gonna offer everything as a pass
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:36.460]   Um, I always thought that would be a really interesting business model to go up against Amazon cloud
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:41.260]   But one layer up part of the reason they say is this is for pie torch. What's that?
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:44.540]   Oh, uh machine learning
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:46.540]   I
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:49.340]   Just make a but of me
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:53.500]   Uh machine learning
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:59.820]   Um, y'all are very mean and I am the nicest person
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.860]   What is pie torch tell us
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:06.620]   I think p.y means python right?
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:10.780]   It is it's a it's a framework for machine learning. Oh, okay
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:17.340]   And so why can't facebook run their own freaking pie torch servers? I guess it's because it's
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:24.060]   Facebook if you if you think about cloud computing and facebook's monolithic jobs like the big
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:27.100]   Jobs that they would need like
[01:04:27.100 --> 01:04:31.980]   They're specialized data center infrastructure for is probably things like storing photos
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:38.140]   Uh newsfeed their social graph stuff. So maybe the machine learning was just one bridge too far for them
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:41.820]   I don't know. I'm just guessing. Um, so having that kind of workload
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:47.740]   Amazon's built their graviton. They built the what is it called like infra? They've got the worst names
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:50.460]   Um, they've got a bunch of machine learning
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:56.620]   Uh options available for you. So maybe facebook was like, yeah, we don't have to build it. Amazon's got it. It's cheaper
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:05:02.540]   This by the way was announced at amazon's reinvent conference today or it will be anyway
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:06.380]   Uh, are you paying attention to a ws reinvent? What is that?
[01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:14.700]   Uh, that's their big giant cloud computing conference and I always preface it as like so where amazon tells you which
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.900]   Businesses and startups it's going to kill this year
[01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:23.580]   Because every time it sees like a startup doing really well or a feature that's gaining ground
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:25.660]   It's like let's launch that and then it does
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:30.540]   Who goes in vegas? I don't know if it's a live event or it must be
[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:33.340]   Vegas it must be hybrid
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:35.500]   Yeah, who goes to this?
[01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:40.860]   Everyone everyone who's anyone in an enterprise computing but stacey you're not there
[01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:46.700]   Are you are you watching it virtually you are? Okay? Okay. That's sensible 10 and so
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:55.500]   So people were interested in enterprise computing go and amazon then presents to them what a ws is up to
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:01.180]   It they release so much news. They were there's like I don't even know how many service
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:05.020]   There's the over 200 aws services cloud services, right? It's crazy
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:11.900]   frat ws is it? Yeah, it's like only for yeah only for amazon's cloud computing were
[01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:14.700]   uh, yeah, that's exactly what it's like
[01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:20.380]   And they'll do I'd like to take advance from kind of to exactly that was nice
[01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:23.740]   Yeah, I was like it's like the google
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:27.660]   Cloud but actually in this case. It's not like google. I owe
[01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:34.620]   It's like their google cloud event. Okay. It's for partners though, right? Mostly like people were already. Yeah
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:39.260]   It's people who build on amazon, but it's also it's their customers go
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:43.260]   It's everybody in enterprise. So the investors are going to be there
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:47.740]   You've got all the startups there. You've got anybody who's got to build any sort of application
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:51.100]   I mean, it's a it's a huge so like this year where like the
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:57.100]   2019 one had I think 60,000 attendees. Oh, yeah, I have to say
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:02.060]   legit jeff bays is famous for for years. I think they still do it
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:08.540]   Not buying desks for people who work at amazon but giving you a pair of saw horses and a door for your desk
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:11.740]   And i'm looking at the tv the video feed
[01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:19.100]   Uh of what's going on in amazon re-invent and this is the equivalent of us two saw horses and a door
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:25.020]   This is the gesius tv set. It doesn't even go all the way behind the person
[01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.940]   It's like oh
[01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:29.900]   We couldn't afford to have it is that a bad
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.260]   Tell that's a there is the full view
[01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:37.660]   But it's a picture of the strip that's too short to actually go behind
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:40.620]   The host those chairs look horrible
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:45.500]   Uh, we just bought chairs like that on amazon in fact, actually our marketing
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.980]   person saw barter chair there and she
[01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:52.300]   Were laughing right because she said it was really small
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:56.300]   It's a little tiny chair
[01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:59.500]   Um, I you know, oh no, come on jeff
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:06.780]   I guess he's not the ceo anymore. Come on, Andy. He's not jet was a jess. What's his name? Andy jessie. Yeah, anyway
[01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:12.460]   I'm sorry. I shouldn't who used to be there's another a ws guy every year
[01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:17.100]   I think there's another big a ws story online 52. I think that's big
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.500]   Uh online 52
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:25.260]   Hold on. Can I ask stacey more about the chips? There's a big story that uh that ant wants to talk about
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:28.220]   Oh, that's not that super big jeff, but sure no
[01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:31.100]   Okay, I want to
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:36.380]   Nasdaq is moving markets to amazon's cloud. That's the story he wanted to talk about. That's not a big deal. Yeah
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:39.180]   I mean everybody use
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:41.500]   Everybody uses a
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:46.620]   But nasdaq I don't even think nasdaq is a big operation to be honest with you
[01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:49.180]   Yeah, the nasdaq used to come to when I was at giga home
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:53.260]   They used to come to all of our cloud computing conferences because they were always like
[01:08:53.260 --> 01:08:55.740]   All the markets are very advanced
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:09:02.460]   All the by nant the banks too on the financial and the cloud front so well that was the to me the fascinating thing
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:05.420]   About all this was michael lewis's flash boys
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:11.180]   Which was all about flash trading and it starts off with somebody building a fiber
[01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.420]   uh
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:16.700]   As straight as possible because even the slightest bend is low
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:21.500]   Between chicago and the new york the chicago exchange the new york has changed so they could be
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:24.860]   Milliseconds ahead of the other traders whose fiber line
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:29.100]   Sick and sagged so they had to build it very very very straight
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.660]   And it just shows you you know
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:37.500]   You're right and when it comes down and stuff like this cut through technology is everything everything so
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:45.740]   Yeah, and jeff just so you know aws has hosted a bunch of nasdaq stuff for years some of their data links don't have billions of transaction records
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:49.100]   And a data warehouse operated by a ws
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:54.620]   Because right nearby office is the is the fake nazdaq headquarters, which is ridiculous
[01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:57.660]   It's it's oh, yeah time to square. Yeah, there's nothing that actually happens there
[01:09:57.660 --> 01:10:00.380]   They're just gonna have flashy lights like I see other thing that lagging flash boys
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:04.700]   He says you know the stock he's changed where you see the shots are going by by boys. It's fake
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.140]   None of that nobody's done that it's in new jersey. Yeah, nobody's done that in years
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:13.260]   It's all fake. It's all for show. It's so maria barderomo has somewhere to stand
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:15.820]   And be the money honey. How to be insane
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:21.260]   She's the number the money honey. Is she no no, she's no, she's the nut job now
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:25.260]   Never the man. Don't get don't get him started. Well, stay
[01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:27.180]   Don't get him started
[01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:33.980]   Stings with the chip chip known we're we've got an AMD story and AMD story. I wanted to ask breaking news
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:36.140]   AMD
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:39.420]   Partnering up with the meta. This was a couple weeks ago
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.700]   Um right after the stop breaking. She's not breaking
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:47.100]   But it's still a pretty big news because they're partnering up with meta with their cloud computing
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:49.900]   Processing did you see anything about that?
[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:55.100]   Metas gonna use metas the metas vr stuff their oculus is gonna use AMD chips
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:59.420]   And uh, they're gonna actually uh, they're gonna use some new chips
[01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:05.180]   Which helped I mean somebody liked it because the stock price went on the end stock went up 10% somebody liked
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:10.700]   Uh, he's been on a tear though for the last couple of years in the stock market though already
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:15.580]   Sony and um, Microsoft both use AMD chips in their game system
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:20.540]   So it's actually not much of a surprise really. Thanks. Yeah, these are good chips for that
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:23.020]   Um
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:29.260]   And then you said finland is gonna have its first quantum computer up and running. Oh
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:38.940]   It's pretty isn't it? Uh, it's only it's only don't get excited. It's only five qubits
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:43.180]   Well, it does actually looks like a good k-cup machine
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:46.140]   Thank you
[01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:52.620]   This force our coffee machine. We need a new k-cup machine. Oh, it's it's a little big for the office
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:55.020]   Um
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:57.420]   Stacy does it have to be kept? Did they give it outside?
[01:11:57.420 --> 01:12:05.340]   I got a great question for you stacy because i've been seeing a lot about lately. Hmm fusion
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.260]   as a power source for the future
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:11.180]   Now of course
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:17.980]   Nuclear power plants currently use fission which produces byproducts that are deadly and you got to put them somewhere
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:20.140]   Yep, but fusion is how the son is like
[01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:24.140]   Did we maybe yeah, I'm just giving you something else to talk about so
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:26.300]   son
[01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.140]   Even you answer me job stacy
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:34.460]   No, we talked about the New York the New Yorker did a big article it was there like every 10 years they look at fusion
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:40.300]   Yeah, and there was a startup at mit that has figured out. I swear to talk to I do maybe we did
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:46.620]   I'm sorry. I do combine in my mind fusion with quantum computing because they both seem
[01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:50.860]   Like way out there distant in the future. Maybe never
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:54.460]   That's all so there
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:13:00.300]   That's where that's how my mind. I don't I don't know what to say here. There is a 238
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:07.420]   I think is the most largest cubic computer running around right now. So that's computer is not a little teeny. We yeah
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:12.300]   Easy basic cubic computer 256 cubic big enough for finland
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:20.780]   Who has the 256 is that ibm? That is no, it's actually a star from harvard bill to harvard mmit. Yeah, huh?
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:23.260]   Okay
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:24.700]   quera
[01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:26.700]   q u e r a
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:28.380]   computing
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.740]   nice
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:35.260]   But it's only for specific problems. Google has a 53 qubit machine
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:43.900]   And ibm has a 53 bit quantum computer. How big would a quantum computer? How many qubits would you have to have to actually do real work?
[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:47.660]   The issue with quantum computers is
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:54.620]   You have to program to do a specific type of job. Oh, like so they're only good at certain types of jobs
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:14:01.180]   So it's not like so it's not like you're gorgeous. Yeah, oh like it's got 256 transistors
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:03.740]   You would say yeah, well good luck with that
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:12.300]   So you'd have to like run them as a benchmark you'd have to do like I can say in in some things like Monte Carlo simulations
[01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:19.660]   The quantum computer is going to be much better at than a traditional computer. Right, but I don't you know like it's good for simulations
[01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:21.420]   particularly
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:23.420]   Yeah, so I'm trying to think because
[01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:27.900]   You couldn't gauge it on performance. You could do it on speed of application
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:31.980]   But you'd also want to have one other thing so you'd be like would it be energy as your trade off?
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:35.020]   Would it be cost because quantum computers on cost can't
[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:40.940]   I mean again. I don't think you could do a benchmark here. You're gonna have to come up with a completely new job that can only be
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:47.100]   New things. Okay. Okay. Well, one of the things of course it always comes up with quantum computing is the idea that it might
[01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:50.300]   Make it easy to factor large primes
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:53.900]   Which is kind of critical to the public key cryptography system
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:15:00.140]   We used to bay and if they got really good at that we'd have to come up with another way and actually scientists are already working
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:07.500]   Oh, yeah, yeah, I go to I go to there are so many webinars on that right now. I've been at least three
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:12.140]   I'm really hard to understand. Yeah, it's pretty sophisticated
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.300]   I don't know if it's a elliptic curve they're using or something
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:17.740]   but something that would not be as easy to crack as the
[01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:23.020]   prime factoring which is what's the backbone of public key crypto these days
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:29.820]   But I then again, so that would be the question like well, how many qubits do you need to to break the RSA?
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:35.020]   You know, four thousand. Oh, there's so much that oh, I can answer that. I've read this answer before
[01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:38.780]   Okay. I'll really work on that while I read another ad. How about that?
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:45.100]   Okay, okay. You want to know about this kind of stuff. There's a great place to go Udacity
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:50.700]   Udacity is an online education program geared towards people looking to take
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:56.460]   Their tech knowledge to the next level and man do they have some great content
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:00.540]   They can really help you to go further in the career you want or get the career you want
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:05.420]   The latest cutting edge nano degree programs. You can't find anywhere else
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:11.740]   Udacity is all about encouraging your yes, you your career growth. They want to give you the information
[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:14.940]   You need to decide what career you want
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:19.900]   You know help you choose that career then give you the skills for that career and then
[01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:27.100]   They go all the way help you get the job in that career Aaron. Here's an example. There's lots of success stories in the website
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:31.900]   Here's a guy named Aaron. He said Udacity's nano degree programs and career resource center
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:36.140]   Played an integral part in helping me land a job offer from
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:42.300]   Google Google nice that isn't that is a hard thing to get that is the golden ticket
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:47.500]   Yeah, a job offer from Google if you're looking to get into the most cutting edge technology careers
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:50.860]   You can get nano degree programs and AI and flying cars
[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:58.300]   I would love that in fact they've got a nano degree program for a flying car and autonomous flight engineer
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:05.580]   Or intro to self-driving cars or machine learning engineer or robotic software engineer and a whole lot more Udacity's courses
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:12.220]   Are created with the companies you will want to work for industry leaders like microsoft and google
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:18.780]   And ibm and a ws and more they select team leads at the top companies to be your instructors
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:20.940]   So you're learning for people are in the field
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:30.860]   Working on this stuff. You're going to get the right knowledge from experts who are working on these exact problems every single day in big businesses
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:37.580]   This is so cool when you sign up for a nano degree program with Udacity you can expect courses to be project based
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:41.500]   I think that's really important to get that active learning to do it to build it yourself
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:45.020]   Not only does it test your knowledge but having built those projects
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:48.540]   You can now put them up on your github which they'll help you do
[01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:51.180]   Put them a reference to it in your LinkedIn
[01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:56.860]   People think a lot more highly if you could say oh yeah, that's a project I've worked on that makes a big difference
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:01.340]   Your projects and homework will be reviewed by qualified professionals in the field
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:05.420]   You get real human feedback reviews just like real code reviews
[01:18:05.420 --> 01:18:09.820]   And you're never alone. You're going to get access to mentors 24/7
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:12.220]   It's actually a great community of Udacity
[01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:15.020]   Flexible schedule you can work
[01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:18.540]   Whatever as hard as you want as little as you want
[01:18:18.540 --> 01:18:24.940]   But to give you a sense if you work maybe five to ten hours a week you can graduate and as little as three months
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:30.220]   Here's a good example of a scholarship offer at Udacity
[01:18:30.220 --> 01:18:35.340]   There are quite a few of them if you go to the Udacity webpage and select scholarships under resources
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:38.700]   There's one one ten and blacks in technology
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:45.260]   Is teamed up with Udacity to offer part-time online tech scholarships for black americans who don't have a four-year degree?
[01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:47.180]   That's awesome
[01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:50.300]   The truth is the four-year degree is not necessarily the golden ticket
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:55.580]   You need to get the skills these companies want and and having a nanodegree
[01:18:55.580 --> 01:19:02.220]   Program at Udacity having that that that that certificate can make such a difference
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:05.820]   Right now 110 blacks in technology in Udacity are offering

[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:03.180]   All right, Stacy
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:10.460]   How many qubits would it take to crack a 4096 bit RSA private key?
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:17.660]   Oh 4,096. Oh no, you can do 1024 if you want. That's okay. I have a 2048
[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:20.300]   It's a in cruise 2040. Okay
[01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:26.220]   You can actually so in 2019 Google and someone from Sweden's
[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:28.860]   Royal Institute of Technology
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:35.020]   Figured out they could do it with just 20 million quantum bits. Oh 20 million
[01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:40.940]   That's how many do we have? 20 million. How many have so far? Well 256. Okay, good. I feel safe
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:43.660]   Hold on
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:50.380]   There is a there is a two pronged answer to this one is to get the exact number into complete shores algorithm
[01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:57.340]   Yes, or encryption. Yes, but there's another way to do it where it's kind of like probabilistic computing where you get close
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:21:03.580]   But maybe you go about it a slightly different way. Yeah in the Chinese in 2020
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:06.620]   They found a way to use
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.460]   D-ways quantum computer
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:16.220]   To factorize large integers. Yeah in bypassed shores algorithm completely. Yeah, and they think they can do that with
[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:18.860]   Hold on
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:20.860]   A Mac Bupro
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:30.220]   No 89 noisy qubits noisy qubits. That's a lot less than 20 million qubits
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:37.180]   Yeah, so but that oh, but that was only factoring RSA 768. So there's a lot of there's a lot of it
[01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:41.980]   So by the way, I use I used to use 40 96. That's why I asked about that and I now use
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:45.260]   A much stronger elliptic curve. So in other words
[01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:49.820]   While people are talking about there's a potential threat with these quantum computers
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:53.180]   We're kind of still a far away from anything. Yeah, well
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:59.500]   The knit now NIST has this is why I go to those events. This is those are the NIST is the national institute. Yes
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:03.900]   Standards and technology. They are they have a quantum proof
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:10.140]   Encryption working group that should come out with oh, yeah, they're working on this right now. Yeah in 2024
[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:12.300]   Yeah, I'm using curved 20
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:15.180]   255 19 right now
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:17.820]   and
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:22.300]   It's I think it's not quantum proof of course, but I think it's a good
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:28.540]   It's kind of what I should be using for now and as anybody and it's you know, there's it's easy as you can do it fast
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:32.620]   It's not a tough thing to do. I have a feeling in the long run. It's gonna
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:40.380]   Uh, you know at some point, maybe not in my lifetime. There will be an 80 million qubit
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:43.180]   Maybe not
[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:49.500]   I like we're at kind in our chat. You cubits keep quiet or I'll go through their warm hole and quiet you down myself
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:52.940]   Uh curved 25
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:58.140]   255 19 is very good yet. And by the way, yes, I was gonna do it and I said not to lord
[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.580]   What's a cubit?
[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:07.020]   Of course just a callback of course just a callback. That's all we don't have to go any farther
[01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:11.260]   Googles do not be evil motto goes to court
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:16.460]   Three fires software engineers blame
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:25.820]   No, I did see this three fired software engineers claim google's don't be evil clause of its code of conduct amounts to a contractual
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:28.620]   Obligation
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:31.420]   They file the lawsuit in san eclair county where google is
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:34.380]   in superior court
[01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:38.220]   Claiming the search giant fired them in 2019 because of their activism
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:41.820]   around google's involvement with customs and border patrol
[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:46.860]   And immigration and customs enforcement during the trump administration
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:53.660]   They had organized fellow employees to speak out against immigration policies released a petition signed by
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:59.580]   1,495 googlers as well as 94 other supporters calling for an end to google's involvement with a practice
[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:02.220]   They viewed as unethical google argued
[01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:05.420]   Google they argued was doing something evil
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:09.580]   And as a result
[01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:11.660]   They violated
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:17.340]   The code of conduct which amounts according to this suit to a contractual obligation
[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:20.620]   It's hard to imagine how this gets
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:25.820]   Very long if it's true the engineers activism was consistent with google's own rules
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:29.100]   Meaning the company may have fired them unjustly
[01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:33.020]   In other words because the code of conduct said don't be evil
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:39.180]   They had the right to raise concerns over what they've used in evil practice that seems right
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:45.580]   Did they did the google change this little mantra from maybe that's why because this was in 2019 right
[01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:50.460]   But you're right jeff i don't know what a judge is going to say
[01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:53.740]   Uh because show me the status evil
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:59.500]   No way in our in our new sharia law in america, maybe it works, you know, I don't know
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:05.580]   Sorry, I got a hunch they're going to get paid the code of conduct also says
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:08.540]   And this is in the lawsuit
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:13.260]   And if you have a question or ever think that one of your fellow googlers
[01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:19.900]   Or the company's a hole may be falling short of our commitment. Don't be evil here comes don't be
[01:25:19.900 --> 01:25:21.660]   Silent
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:26.140]   So they say look we this is in the code of conduct we were told to raise a ruckus
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:30.140]   Which was always the point about it that it was an opportunity to question anything the company did
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.980]   Yeah to keep the company
[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:34.140]   Honest what was facey doing now the cut
[01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:39.820]   The company said they had fired them not because of that
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:42.940]   And this is by the way, it's strange how this keeps coming up
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:46.300]   Because they violated the company's data security policies
[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:48.780]   Uh, that's that's why they fired
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:50.860]   Didn't it go brew
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:53.100]   Yeah, that's why they fired
[01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:56.060]   Her colleague, I can't remember her name as well
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:58.460]   Margaret Mitchell. Yeah
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:26:02.860]   See, I think well she wrote gone with the win, but I think she also worked at google
[01:26:02.860 --> 01:26:04.860]   Yeah
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:08.860]   She was married to an attorney general, but yes also worked at google
[01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:10.940]   Wow, there's a lot of Margaret Mitchell's in the world
[01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:12.380]   Yeah
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:14.380]   So the NLRB is investigating
[01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:19.820]   This as well to see if they were unlawfully discharged. I think this is interesting
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:22.940]   You know, don't put don't be evil in your
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:27.260]   Code of conduct if you don't you don't want to stand by it and they by the way did
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:31.420]   I think google did remove that from the code of conduct in 2018
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:37.980]   Although alphabet has it in their code of conduct as do the right thing
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:42.860]   That's different than nobody if I were spiky, I'd be upset
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:46.620]   Um both are very subjective. Yeah, but sure yeah
[01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:51.580]   As of September 2020 my daughter
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:56.860]   Oh, send her out the door and say make good choices make good choices. Whatever that might be
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:59.820]   I'm choosing to get high
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:05.500]   as of uh, september 2020 google's code of conduct did in fact say quote remember
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:10.060]   Don't be evil and if you see something that you think isn't right speak up
[01:27:10.060 --> 01:27:12.780]   I think that's a good code of conduct, but maybe you shouldn't
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:16.060]   Put it in writing
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:20.540]   That's the thing. I I think they're going to get paid here. You think so? I think they're going to get paid
[01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:25.260]   And you and you don't think so jeff will find out no I think i think the judge is going to say
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:30.380]   That's an interesting point
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:32.780]   You know if if the company had done
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:36.940]   In any if there's documents that say don't be evil for example
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:41.020]   Mm-hmm and this file into that then there then there'd be something to go on
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:44.380]   But I think this don't be evil's very general open not to such
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:50.620]   How can you hold the standard of evil that isn't statutory? It just doesn't I think this speak up
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:55.820]   Thing is more to germane because it's right. Yes. I thought it was evil so I spoke up right
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:59.500]   I were harmed in the whistle bars of harm, but then you sue under whistle blower
[01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:02.300]   Well, i'm sure that's the NLRB's uh
[01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:09.660]   Investigation probably right. Yeah, here's a weird one remember facebook bought jiffy g or is it giffy giffy god?
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:14.140]   Giffy I was like the peanut butter company you almost had me again
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:18.620]   Is it giffy or jiffy
[01:28:19.020 --> 01:28:22.380]   Giffy and the peanut butter is actually just but
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:25.660]   Yeah, facebook agreed to buy
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:32.860]   I can't say it giffy giffy in may of last year for 400 million dollars
[01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:36.620]   Uh regulators in the uk yesterday said
[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:39.340]   They have told facebook
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:44.780]   That would be to sell giffy. They didn't know they know they already bought it. It closed it closed
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:51.580]   After finding quote the takeover could reduce competition between social media platforms and increase facebook's
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:55.820]   It's interesting how one country can decide this on behalf of the whole world too
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:59.020]   Well, can they I don't know company that's not based there
[01:28:59.020 --> 01:29:05.260]   Oh, I didn't think well facebook can always decide to not put things there a country
[01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:10.380]   I mean do they have sovereignty over their citizens and what their citizens can access and do sure
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:15.740]   Yeah, I don't know what the law is on this. It's what happens in a global market is going to have to be national
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:20.940]   Oh here. This is interesting. Yeah, we can say this though for like decades and we're still not there yet
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:28.540]   It's it's so for decades. It's been that long. Yeah, not only is the problem that facebook's market power increases by denying or limiting
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:31.820]   other platforms access to giffy
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:35.740]   Giffes
[01:29:35.740 --> 01:29:37.740]   Get it right gifts gifts
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:39.820]   gifts
[01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:43.740]   Or changing the terms of access to its gifts for competitive sites
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:47.980]   they also said the deal is anti-competitive because
[01:29:47.980 --> 01:29:52.140]   Giffy had an advertising business which facebook shut down
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:55.340]   And they said you know what that advertise you bought giffy
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:58.220]   Also because that advertising business competed with yours
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:06.620]   As a result regulator said facebook will also be required to reinstate the innovative advertising service giffy offered
[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:09.580]   before the merger i've got to go to discord to see
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:13.420]   how they feel about giffy
[01:30:13.420 --> 01:30:16.700]   and animated gifts
[01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:18.860]   It's not a gift. It's a gift
[01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:22.540]   All right
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:25.260]   Really so the so we've all reached consensus that is
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:27.100]   Giff
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:28.220]   Hard G gift
[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:29.100]   I must
[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:34.620]   First of all we're gonna myself i'm a soft G personally comes to that. Oh my god. Why are we still debating this?
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:39.180]   Well, but I don't debate it. I just say it because i'm a grown man. So the question is
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:41.420]   What have you wrong?
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:46.300]   I will go with the what the company said is is this name right because
[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:50.140]   Uh, they don't have a right to determine root
[01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:51.820]   Really?
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:52.380]   Really?
[01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:55.980]   Unless they're right. No, no because it's a company name. There is no word giffy
[01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:58.940]   Yeah, let's see what it says on the youtube
[01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:07.100]   We are looking at how to pronounce the name of this american online database and search engine
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:08.460]   It's off the table
[01:31:08.460 --> 01:31:10.460]   The CEO of diffy
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:12.700]   calls it hard g
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:13.260]   Small
[01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:17.500]   Interesting words as well. So make sure this is the creepiest voice ever heard
[01:31:17.500 --> 01:31:20.060]   It's english. What is it?
[01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:22.140]   Giffy
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:24.460]   Giffy pretty straightforward giffy
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:27.020]   Okay, okay, okay. All right. So that's the company
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:33.420]   But the person that came up with the actual file. I thought they they pronounce it as a soft
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:39.260]   They pronounce it gif, but it's short for graphics interchange format and graphics is a hard g
[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:41.820]   How do you pronounce giraffe
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:44.380]   Giraffe
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:50.300]   Well, okay, I went to wingate university, but apparently it's supposed to be wingate university
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:53.340]   Wingate and we can talk about carnaegi and carnaegi
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:58.140]   All right, giffy. I'm gonna say giffy because I don't like the guy who developed the game
[01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:01.020]   So
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:02.860]   Is jiff. I'm gonna say gif
[01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:06.780]   And actually it is relevant for the pronunciation of giffy
[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:13.340]   Regardless of how you pronounce giff or jiff. Yeah, because that that's a company name and the guy who founded it says it's giffy
[01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:15.740]   Yes, fair enough. You ready you know what he says what?
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:17.980]   quote
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:21.660]   At giffy, we know there's only one gif and it's peanut butter
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:26.780]   Alex Chung founder and CEO of giffy said in a press release if you're a soft G. Please visit
[01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:34.220]   Uh, jiff.com if you're a hard G. Thank you. We know you're right. Oh wow giffy giffy giffy giffy
[01:32:34.220 --> 01:32:36.700]   Giffy smug much giffy giffy
[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:39.100]   In any case it became better for a short while
[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:45.260]   Yeah, well, I don't know does this mean if you pay says you must have asked
[01:32:45.260 --> 01:32:50.860]   Do they have to I guess I mean if they want to be in the uk? I don't know if this is fascinating
[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:53.580]   I don't know so that's enough for them. This is where we are in the uk
[01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:58.220]   I think it's just on their nose. They really make us. Yeah, right. It's like we're a u.s company
[01:32:58.220 --> 01:33:01.100]   Make us what are you gonna do?
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:04.300]   And then they're gonna say well, you can't be in the uk
[01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:06.860]   You know what the uk did do this week. It was so exciting
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:08.940]   what?
[01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:13.420]   They pass their cyber security law it resembles a lot of california's sb
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:19.980]   327 it's a cyber security device law says no hard-coded passwords. No default passwords. Oh, yeah, all right. Yeah
[01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:27.580]   It provides an expiration date for security updates on connected devices at the point of sale. This is fantastic. All right
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:33.900]   All right, the california law does not do that last bit. That's where the uk law kind of boosts out
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:35.980]   And I've been calling for this for years
[01:33:35.980 --> 01:33:40.940]   So when you buy something that's connected you should be able to say look on the box and be like
[01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:47.020]   I have five years of security updates. Yeah, that's really great. Yeah, that's nice. That's really great
[01:33:48.380 --> 01:33:52.140]   The national labor relations board speaking of the nlrb has reordered
[01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:57.260]   a new election at amazon's bessam or alabama site they said
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:34:02.460]   You guys really messed with this
[01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:06.860]   And you're gonna have to have a second union election. Did you see john
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:13.180]   Oliver's thing on union busting it was quite good a few months ago. I haven't seen him in a long time
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:16.220]   YouTube is just getting better and better with the
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.100]   recommendations for me. I love it
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:25.180]   Okay, we know everybody wants to watch john Oliver except for ant proid so we will not push
[01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:32.620]   The union said amazon's intimidation and interference prevented workers from having a fair saying whether they wanted a union in their workplace
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:37.100]   Amazon says it's disappointing the nlrb has now decided that those votes
[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:42.620]   Should not count our employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union they overwhelmingly chose not
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:46.300]   To earlier this year. In fact, that was true
[01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:49.260]   1,798 to 738 against
[01:34:49.260 --> 01:34:53.580]   Wow, that was what they say that amazon did
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:58.540]   That was just among other things installing their own mailbox to collect ballots
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:04.460]   Amazon security guards had access to the mailbox giving some workers the impression amazon controlled the results
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:06.700]   Uh
[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:09.500]   One of the things companies do is they have mandatory
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:13.580]   um on site meetings with anti union
[01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:19.420]   Representatives who explain why union is a terrible idea and you got to go
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:23.500]   Mandatory that's a lot of companies do that
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:26.380]   Really? Yeah
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:28.940]   Again john Oliver had a good good piece on it
[01:35:28.940 --> 01:35:35.900]   Yeah, i'll check it out. They don't violate the law. You know, you kind of try to stay within the uh letter of the law
[01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:37.900]   Maybe not the spirit quite
[01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:41.660]   But that was a big deal remember that when alabama voted no
[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:43.580]   Yeah, i was like see
[01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:47.100]   Everybody's happy at amazon film this and as we don't need unions
[01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:50.700]   They hate unions. They do just like starbucks. They hate him
[01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:56.860]   I worked for a couple. I worked for advanced publications, which is kind of you asked and new house newspapers
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:36:01.820]   And the there was one union newsroom and the Cleveland plane dealer
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:08.140]   And the others were given in newsrooms if you were union you were given a lifetime job guarantee
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:12.700]   Well come the troubles of the internet they had to redefine life
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.540]   Oh
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:19.020]   And uh had to say well, it don't it's the life of the company not your life and the cup
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:26.860]   We're going to close the company and then reopen it as something new and um, so yeah, it's that Brett Taylor
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:30.940]   Yeah, sorry
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:33.660]   My slave reaction
[01:36:33.660 --> 01:36:35.660]   Like two hours
[01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:41.020]   That's right tried to say that's wild so he is now the chair at twitter and the coceo sears force
[01:36:41.020 --> 01:36:48.140]   Yeah, I know him from back in the day. He created friend feed, which I loved he worked on gmail and google maps
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:54.860]   This guy was great great guy cto facebook. Oh that Brett Taylor you getting good, which are calling yes
[01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:56.780]   Oh
[01:36:56.780 --> 01:37:02.300]   I tried to tell you but you wouldn't listen to me you just steamrolled over i knew the name and I thought oh, it can't be that
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:08.620]   Brett Taylor. He's a computer programmer, but I guess he's also a good business person. Yeah, he he was a founder quip
[01:37:08.620 --> 01:37:15.980]   Uh, but he's you know, that's how he got to sales force. They bought quip. No, he's a great great guy great coder
[01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:21.740]   I'm pretty sure we've interviewed him on our shows. I feel like I know him. He's too big for us now
[01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:23.580]   Not now. No, it's too big
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:27.660]   What's this theory about coceos being a bad idea
[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:36.460]   Someone's just never it just never works out. That was me. I'm just thinking about can we name any coceos that have been a good idea?
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:38.780]   Yeah, uh, blackberry
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:40.860]   The most famous is oracle, right? I mean they know
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:42.380]   Oracle
[01:37:42.380 --> 01:37:43.820]   It's the last one i remember
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:48.380]   Yeah, well rim worked because those two guys were founders. No, they did not work
[01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:51.100]   Yeah, look how well rims doing
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:53.340]   Yeah
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:55.340]   Blackberry in your future
[01:37:55.660 --> 01:38:01.500]   No, actually it's interesting because because they renamed the sales blackberry, but now they own qnx
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:06.780]   They actually have found us but bazilies or whatever his name is they've left demonizable
[01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:14.380]   Yeah, they're they're back to single cuz yeah sales force. Benioff is clearly the boss. Benioff takes over any room. He's in
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:18.060]   But I think this is a way probably maybe this is how to get him. This is my right hand
[01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:23.900]   Yeah, he's trying to get out. So maybe he has to do this double thing for a while to keep the investors
[01:38:24.140 --> 01:38:28.220]   It's really interesting because I mean Brett's a great coder and a great this product guy
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:32.780]   To see him as a business guy isn't is an interesting thing. He's been in this role
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:38.060]   He's been at a high level for quite a while. Yeah, he left google 2007 to become a vc
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:41.500]   So the normal people are screaming the nerves are taking over
[01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:46.140]   All right, I guess that's what it is in a way and that's what there's where my surprise lies
[01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:49.180]   It's not somebody from bane capital. Mm-hmm. You know
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:53.500]   I think it's interesting because I think we're entering to this like service
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:59.900]   Slash api economy and so I think there's a lot of issues that need to be technically solved
[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:05.420]   When doing these business deals and I think having an understanding of that will give companies an advantage
[01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:10.460]   Well, look at sam lesson we had on the show last week. Oh, that was so good. He was great
[01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:15.900]   There's a perfect example of guy who's both a coder and a business guy and it obviously a very successful vc
[01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:19.340]   by the way we we we we
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:25.580]   Glanced around too is the number of I think indian born ceos and technology keeps growing
[01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:28.540]   Yeah, so never shy so not to the della
[01:39:28.540 --> 01:39:30.940]   and now
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:35.180]   Arwa it to their argar argar argar agro wall cto
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:37.100]   I mean
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:43.660]   Yeah, go look up at the is tie still a thing because if it is I guarantee you there's indian ceos everywhere. Yeah
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:46.060]   What's tie?
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:52.140]   Uh the indus american something it's an organist. It's a oh, okay networking organization for
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:54.780]   South Asians
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:56.780]   uh
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:59.340]   Oh that bread tailor. I like him
[01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:01.900]   Jesus
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:02.780]   I'm sorry
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:07.660]   Came out of nowhere. Well, there was another story about him being named coseo salesperson. I thought
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:10.300]   Wait a minute. I know who that is
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:14.940]   I should have been that up in the rundown. I'm getting old. That's all it is. It really is
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:18.940]   How about we do a uh one of them, you know what i'm talking about press a button
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:25.420]   Google change law press a button
[01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:34.860]   It's time for the change law google announces a grab bag of new features for android
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:37.740]   For the end of 2021. This is actually
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:40.220]   you know google's
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:43.580]   Policy these days lately is to hold features back and ship them over
[01:40:43.660 --> 01:40:47.260]   Gradual period time new widgets new android auto features
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:53.340]   So they fix android auto first for the six maybe that's the fix fix bluetooth the old right 12
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:58.860]   Updates for google assistant google photos big blog post from google
[01:40:58.860 --> 01:41:05.820]   So this is like all in one change log get festive this holiday season with new android features
[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:11.420]   This just came out. I have an idea chance to read it keep your family on track this season with family bell
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:16.060]   What's that? Uh, it's uh, it's an alarm
[01:41:16.060 --> 01:41:18.700]   For the whole family
[01:41:18.700 --> 01:41:20.700]   Lots of noxious
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:22.460]   Uh
[01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:27.260]   Family members will be able to set bells on their own devices so they can stay on top of their individual goals too
[01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:32.460]   But with family bell and your android fawn home speaker smart display bells and notifications will go out
[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:38.540]   Throughout the house when it's time for important moments throughout the day. I mean, I may need to implement this
[01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:43.180]   I struggle with the family bell. No, you know, right?
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:48.860]   Time for dinner or time to get ready for school that kind of they're all done. They're all the things. Yeah, yeah
[01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:50.940]   I may need to implement this because I usually have
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:53.260]   Right
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:56.460]   When I was a kid my mom got so tired of yelling
[01:41:56.460 --> 01:42:02.460]   Come down for dinner. Yeah that she got a bell that she would ring. So this is just the modern equivalent
[01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:04.700]   You have a Pavlov
[01:42:05.340 --> 01:42:09.660]   Mounstyl waters every time we click the lights on and in downstairs for our daughter's room
[01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:15.020]   Just do poop. So that's you know, that's a good idea. It's a lot better. It's much more civilized than going
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:19.580]   Hey, that was quite the iot moment. That was an iot humble brag
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:25.660]   No, no other parent can do that than I can because my how do you do that? Do you do you give it a voice commander?
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:31.900]   Um, there there are multiple ways we use lutron a lutron pico upstairs and then the google display for
[01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:34.620]   There's a button on that. She's in it
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:36.220]   Or can you just say yeah?
[01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:42.220]   We have a physical pico remote for her bedroom and then if she's in the family room, we just use the google display
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:45.260]   There's no toggle on the voice
[01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:48.300]   And it's a big complaint I have
[01:42:48.300 --> 01:42:52.380]   What ever one of our listeners? I don't know how I figured this out Roberta
[01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:55.660]   online and bed on my birthday in the morning
[01:42:55.660 --> 01:43:00.460]   And my echo suddenly says you have a message from her burrito
[01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:02.380]   So
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:05.580]   And he comes on in my house and says happy birthday
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:12.140]   And I don't thank god. No one else. I know has figured out how to do this. Roberta. You're smart. Oh happy belated
[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:17.420]   Well, I don't care. First of all, I don't but it was like what how do how do he?
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:24.780]   That's great and creepy at the same time. Yeah, exactly. He was like, how did he figure that out?
[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:29.980]   So maybe he knows about this family bill. No, no a lot more about that encryption than you do it
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:34.860]   I don't understand how he did it get more out of your favorite google app and by the way and then
[01:43:34.860 --> 01:43:39.900]   The amazon, you know how it has a light that pulses if you've got a notification
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:43.740]   Pulsed until I said all right. What's the notification? Roberta says happy
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:51.100]   Uh, all right. Here's another one get more out of your favorite google apps with widgets
[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:56.060]   Home screen displaying a photo of mother and child from the google photos people and pets widget
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:44:01.580]   Oh, it's because I always have had a google photos widget. Mm-hmm, but now you can have a people in pets widget. Okay
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:05.580]   You can uh have a google play books widget. You might like that
[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:08.300]   Stacy because I know you like books
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:12.860]   You'll have a youtube music widget. You can have holiday tunes in it
[01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:20.380]   And uh, and then the google people and pets widget you can relive festive memories with google photos
[01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:24.220]   I'm a big fan of memories in general, but now these will also
[01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:30.700]   Uh, among other things as be a birthday memories, you know special event memories new years eve halloween
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:33.500]   graduations
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:37.900]   Uh, when you're driving home for the holidays or simply going to the store for some last minute groceries
[01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:41.980]   A suite of updates enhances just how helpful and right could be on the road
[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:45.020]   Unless it doesn't work at all
[01:44:45.020 --> 01:44:49.260]   Replied a messages in the car with a tap
[01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:54.700]   You can set andro'd out a launch automatically when you connect your android phone to your compatible car
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:59.820]   compatible card not included to stay connected on every drive once you're on the road
[01:44:59.820 --> 01:45:03.980]   So you should try though. Maybe with this update. Maybe they'll that's one of the things they'll fix that would be nice
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:07.420]   Hope I also am wasting 20 bucks to buy an actual google
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:12.300]   Uh, usb cable so I can't i'm trying to limit everything I can yeah
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:15.580]   Yeah, nice people nice listeners sent me a
[01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:18.540]   Links to a kickstarter thing that
[01:45:18.540 --> 01:45:23.580]   Allows you to use wireless even if your if your car requires wired thinking that might fix it
[01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:26.940]   But I'm not I don't think so. I think it's I think it's something on the six
[01:45:26.940 --> 01:45:35.900]   Uh, once you're on the road android auto helps you get things done so you can stay focused on the road smart reply options are coming soon to messaging
[01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:42.940]   I love it and I actually I get this with uh apple's carplay, but I presume it's available in android auto
[01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:49.500]   Where i'll say you have a message from abby shall I read it and it reads it would you like to reply and I can dictate or apply
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.980]   Oh, yeah, I would like to send it. I love that feature. I used to get that
[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:54.700]   And it's really great. Yeah
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:46:01.020]   You can listen to your favorite music with a single tap of the new always on play button right next to the home button
[01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:08.940]   Coming soon you'll be able to use your voice to search for music faster in your media apps on android auto
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:13.820]   So a bunch of new features app permissions are getting a private boost
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:17.020]   Uh privacy boost
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:19.740]   Get notified when app permissions are removed
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:22.700]   when so apparently
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:26.140]   After a while
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:31.660]   You'll have the permissions will reset and you'll have to go through that process again to give them permissions again
[01:46:31.660 --> 01:46:34.300]   Your device will automatically turn off
[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:41.260]   Runtime permissions which allow apps to access data or take actions on your behalf for downloaded apps
[01:46:41.260 --> 01:46:43.580]   You haven't used in a while you can always turn them back on
[01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:49.900]   But they'll expire if you don't use them. That's good, right? That's good. I forgot. I'd love that on
[01:46:49.900 --> 01:46:55.180]   Share the love with new emoji kitchen combinations
[01:46:55.180 --> 01:46:57.900]   Have you played with emoji kitchen?
[01:46:57.900 --> 01:47:00.380]   Uh, no, let's you take an emoji and
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:03.900]   Fix it up add to it. No, yeah
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:07.180]   I wouldn't tell people not see it then because it's not standard
[01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:09.980]   Um, it becomes a sticker
[01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:16.700]   So so it's not an emoji. It's a stick. It's no longer. Yeah, basically you're making a sticker with an emoji. I guess all right
[01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:21.420]   Um, so those are some of the new features boy that was one
[01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:27.740]   Item in the change log that turned out to be a great money going for a long long time hours

[01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:11.660]   Quick takes model y brakes constantly and by brakes i don't mean it's broken. I mean the brakes
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:14.380]   stops the vehicle stop the vehicles
[01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:18.700]   Um, yeah people are starting to complain about various
[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:25.420]   Bits even elon said can you guys don't rush we got plenty of time don't rush when you're making our vehicles
[01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:27.820]   So maybe the the factory there's
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:33.980]   Yeah, well it seems like a software problem in this case. It thinks that it's got uh barriers that it doesn't have
[01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:36.860]   Oh, I had that problem with my mom licks all the time
[01:50:36.860 --> 01:50:38.460]   At least it could play better than all the time
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:41.100]   It would think because it has as many cars do
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:46.060]   You know the auto stop if you're about to run into something and she'd be driving down the road and almost on a ridge
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:51.020]   Because it thinks something's in the road, but there's nothing it's scary as much as it's not
[01:50:51.020 --> 01:50:55.100]   You can turn that off. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not good. Yeah, yes
[01:50:55.100 --> 01:51:01.900]   Uh, little controversy over 23 and me they did a spec as you remember we talked about that some months ago
[01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:05.020]   their earmarking cash from that spec for
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:09.020]   Drug development they want to use what they know about your genome
[01:51:09.020 --> 01:51:11.820]   to help drug companies
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:19.100]   Developed this is an interesting question. Maybe jeff you don't think this is such a bad thing. Yeah, I don't think it's a bad thing
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:20.220]   Yeah
[01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:26.220]   By querying its database 23 and me can find causal links between genetic variations and disease remember they collect
[01:51:26.220 --> 01:51:28.700]   Not only the genetic information
[01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:32.700]   But they also collect your phenotype these questions you answer all the time in questionnaires
[01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:35.260]   And they're using that information to develop new treatments
[01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:41.260]   Among its findings so far evidence of genetic variants that bolster the immune system and decrease the risk of cancer
[01:51:41.340 --> 01:51:45.660]   They actually have two immuno oncology drugs under development
[01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:48.620]   Through a glaxo smith cline
[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:51.340]   ones in the clinical trial stage
[01:51:51.340 --> 01:51:53.740]   Is anybody think that's bad? I think that's good, but
[01:51:53.740 --> 01:51:56.380]   privacy people say well, wait, but that's my
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:52:01.660]   But that this is for everybody. I mean, it's the same people who got mad because amazon didn't
[01:52:01.660 --> 01:52:08.380]   Uh pay them to use their devices for sidewalk. That's how I think it's the same people who are mad because they're like
[01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:12.540]   Well, I got you know, I paid them my money to get my gene tested
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:16.380]   You know, well, and they do keep your spit. I mean they keep your
[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:22.780]   Stuff so it's not I mean I don't know there must be a process thanks to gdpr in the california privacy

[01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:53.660]   Okay, good. This is a good one. Here's a good one
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:53:00.620]   You could get if you trick people into visiting a malicious web page
[01:53:00.620 --> 01:53:06.540]   There are 150 models of hp printers that can be compromised
[01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:10.460]   To once they're in the printer as you know stacey on iot
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:15.900]   They can use that printer to attack your network steal information and infiltrate
[01:53:15.900 --> 01:53:17.980]   promise
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:22.940]   Printers we don't think of them as iot devices, but they in fact are because they're on the inner yep
[01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:31.500]   Lexmark actually just launched their own iot platform based on everything it learned about printers over the last like two or three decades
[01:53:32.300 --> 01:53:38.700]   Lex looks like a good platform the printer company. They're still around wow. Oh, yeah, didn't know that yeah
[01:53:38.700 --> 01:53:47.020]   Uh an indonesian court has given the government permission to pull the plug on the internet if it should feel threatened
[01:53:47.020 --> 01:53:52.780]   Uh, who's pulling the plug in the internet the indonesian government
[01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:56.060]   Oh, okay
[01:53:56.060 --> 01:53:59.020]   indonesia has been cracking down on tech platforms for some time
[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:01.660]   Packing down is one way to put it. Yeah
[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:07.020]   Uh, they restricted internet access during independence protests and demonstrations in papua
[01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:14.940]   Uh, and now really the government has all the power they need to simply shut down the internet or any individual service whatever
[01:54:14.940 --> 01:54:17.500]   They feel threatened
[01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:20.380]   So that's not good
[01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:26.140]   Uh new rule will allow debt collectors to track you down on social media
[01:54:27.180 --> 01:54:32.780]   Federal regulators in the us really doing anyway. Well, now it's now it's official the uh
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:36.540]   This is a change to the fair debt collection practices act
[01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:40.860]   Um, it's because everyone's ignoring the phone
[01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:46.780]   Oh, how do you know what it has a phone call? Yeah, this is actually a trump era
[01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:50.460]   Uh, why however do you have one?
[01:54:50.460 --> 01:54:53.660]   I have to explain to the kids what this is
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:55:03.820]   What is that if he seems like you would shame you even that's it because we we stop them from calling like at certain times that we're problematic
[01:55:03.820 --> 01:55:06.380]   Now creditors can slide into your dms
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:14.060]   Along with every other spammer there is you can't they are not allowed to post something that can be seen by the general public
[01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:16.780]   So that's good. Oh, okay, or by your friends and followers
[01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:20.060]   But they can send you private messages asking
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:23.260]   That you add them as a friend or contact
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:30.700]   That's hilarious, but they do have to say we're are collecting a debt. Yeah, and you can opt out. So I'm this is all right. This doesn't seem
[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:33.820]   Too bad
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:36.860]   There is a bill which probably will be
[01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:47.500]   Die in the in congress, but how's the senate democrats have reintroduced the stopping Grinch box stopping Grinch bots act
[01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:55.900]   Which cracks down on sca scalper run bots, which buy up things like vidi like graphics cards. Oh man or
[01:55:55.900 --> 01:55:59.500]   PlayStation concert tickets or concert tickets. Yeah
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:05.020]   Paul uh, tonko from new york senator bloomin tharra shummer and lujan
[01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:12.860]   Uh will crack down on cyber Grinch is using bots technologies to quickly buy up whole inventories of popular
[01:56:13.180 --> 01:56:20.540]   Holiday toys and sell them to parents of higher prices, but how do you crack down on transactions bot transactions?
[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:25.500]   Well, I think probably if you have a law that punishes it it helps, right?
[01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:30.460]   You don't you write a press release saying you wrote this bill and you hope you get two votes for it
[01:56:30.460 --> 01:56:34.460]   Right the stop and it's got a good name stopping Grinch bots act
[01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:37.100]   Which is hard to say
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:41.420]   Is it Grinch or drench that'll get the verse newt gingrich
[01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:43.820]   Um
[01:56:43.820 --> 01:56:45.820]   Hey, you should learn statistics
[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:48.780]   I'm just saying it's a useful skill
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:51.420]   Apparently there's a person going around
[01:56:51.420 --> 01:56:56.300]   Uh, his name is Alex baronson. Do you know who that is?
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:57:00.620]   He's a sub stack guy wrote a post
[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:03.980]   Former new york times been living off of fact that he's former new york times
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:09.500]   He's far out on the edge of blackwood bill posted a uh posted a sub stack saying
[01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:15.100]   This sounds scary vaccinated english adults under 60 are dying at twice the rate
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:17.820]   Of unvaccinated people the same age
[01:57:17.820 --> 01:57:26.060]   You know if you don't know statistics you might go okay, but then thank goodness for data scientists
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:33.260]   Because a guy named jeffrey morris has published a rebuttal which says in fact
[01:57:33.260 --> 01:57:39.580]   English adults under 60 who have watched the 1984 ghost busters movie are dying at twice the rate
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:43.980]   Of people who have watched the 2021 ghost busters movie the same age
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:50.220]   Oh boy, and they have a six months pandemics wrongest man
[01:57:50.220 --> 01:57:57.980]   So if you believe that watching the old ghost busters movie is more likely to kill you than watching the new one
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:02.780]   I've got a sub stack uh new something i thought this was a paragraph to
[01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:08.780]   At fritt when i read it i thought well that's silly and then i realized that he'd flam up statistical stupid at the very end
[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:13.100]   He said this is exactly the same statistical error that baronson's making
[01:58:13.100 --> 01:58:20.300]   Nicely done. Yes. I don't understand it myself, but you know statistics
[01:58:20.300 --> 01:58:24.300]   Uh
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:30.140]   Such a nadella sold half of his shares in microsoft. That's a lot of money
[01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:32.140]   That's a lot to sell
[01:58:32.140 --> 01:58:35.660]   But we figured it out on windows weekly thanks to mary joe foley
[01:58:36.220 --> 01:58:38.540]   $300 million with the stock because
[01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:42.460]   The state of washing in your state states he's about to change its cap
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:48.540]   its capital gains rules what role that i guess they didn't tax capital gains before now they're going to
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:50.940]   and uh
[01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:55.820]   The 7 tax for long-term capital gains starts beginning of next year
[01:58:55.820 --> 01:59:01.180]   for anything exceeding $250,000 a year 7 of
[01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:04.060]   300 million is
[01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:06.060]   $21 bajillion so
[01:59:06.060 --> 01:59:09.580]   I can understand now why he's cashing in
[01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:13.820]   Plus he might have a little like he doesn't want to help the homeless or
[01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:16.860]   Or
[01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:18.860]   It's a perfectly reasonable
[01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:26.220]   Tax and you can't write off the tax the state taxes on your federal taxes. All right. That's right. That's right. Don't like that
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:28.460]   We're in a high tax state. Don't like that
[01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:30.300]   Uh
[01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:33.020]   Congratulations to uh our friend anneal dash
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:39.900]   He saved the floppy disk that he got from the prince folks his wife must be ready to kill him
[01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:41.900]   I'm saving all this stuff
[01:59:41.900 --> 01:59:47.340]   Uh, I guess when prince changed his name from prince to the artist formerly known as prince
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:49.900]   with that weird
[01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:50.860]   symbol
[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:53.100]   They sent floppy disks out
[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:55.980]   to journalists
[01:59:55.980 --> 02:00:00.700]   With a font on the floppy disk ahead one character that that's the beautiful part
[02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:03.500]   So
[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:07.340]   So that they could use prince's symbol in their stories
[02:00:07.340 --> 02:00:11.100]   Of course it didn't take long before
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:13.660]   Somebody a British journalist I think
[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:20.620]   Said oh, we'll just call him the artist formerly known as prince and that'll solve that anneal dash had one of these floppies
[02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:26.940]   Uh and uh he brought it over to the folks at ada fruit because he didn't have a floppy drive
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:30.300]   And he got they happened to have a power book 180
[02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:35.900]   To high end 1992 model. Oh, it is missing its ball. However
[02:00:35.900 --> 02:00:40.620]   Somewhat less than somebody played with it. So he less than desirable
[02:00:40.620 --> 02:00:43.260]   Got a like that. Uh, but they were able to
[02:00:43.260 --> 02:00:50.940]   Not only recover it, but then to post it on archive.org. So it is never again to be lost
[02:00:50.940 --> 02:00:56.780]   His purpleness will be very happy. This is the kind of thing that should go on the archive.org
[02:00:57.660 --> 02:01:00.940]   Oh, I just thought this was the kind I think the internet's for yeah
[02:01:00.940 --> 02:01:05.100]   They actually have the image of the three and a half inch floppy that was given to the press
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:07.900]   When he changed his name. Thank you anneal dash
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:13.100]   I think i don't think Brett Taylor might do that Brett Taylor
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:21.180]   And I got to say and I like to I love to end the show with obituaries because people are dying
[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:24.460]   Uh one of the greats and a guy
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:32.220]   I had a huge respect for it named Jim Warren passed away. He launched the west coast computer fair in the 1970s
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:39.820]   Uh, there's a picture which the times did not have I wish they had found it of him by roller skating through the floor
[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:44.060]   At the I used to go to these fairs. He was legendary roller skating around
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:49.580]   Uh on the floor of it. It was the I think the first computer trade show the west coast computer fair
[02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:52.220]   Uh in the 70s
[02:01:52.700 --> 02:01:59.180]   Uh, he was the editor of dr. Dobbs. You know dr. Dobbs dr. Dobbs journal of computer calisthenics in north adoncha
[02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:03.740]   Oh, one of the yeah, I used to subscribe one of the great computer magazines of all time
[02:02:03.740 --> 02:02:06.860]   Uh and uh founded the west coast computer fair
[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:13.580]   Uh steve jobs and uh steve wasniak showed the early apple there in 1976
[02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:20.620]   Here here's steve at his booth at the first west coast computer fair debuting the apple too
[02:02:21.660 --> 02:02:26.780]   When I see i saw this in the rundown yesterday. Oh, whenever it was when I looked at it
[02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:31.420]   I felt bad because i'm like, I have no idea who this person is and
[02:02:31.420 --> 02:02:39.820]   I know i'm not the only person. Oh, nobody does nobody does but it but this is why that why don't these folks get their flowers
[02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:46.060]   While they're on earth, you know what i'm saying? Yeah, well, jim did jim was a great guy and everybody loved jim
[02:02:46.060 --> 02:02:48.300]   He's passed away at the age of 85
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:54.220]   Um, but you know, i'm gonna be dead soon too. So you'll tell the world right? I got you. Yeah, let them know
[02:02:54.220 --> 02:03:01.420]   Um, so I used to think the only real um fringe benefit of working for a newspaper is that your obit would run in it
[02:03:01.420 --> 02:03:04.220]   But they're all dying faster than I am. I know
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:06.540]   shoot
[02:03:06.540 --> 02:03:12.780]   Shoot. I got you covered. He is uh if you if you're interested in the early history of the internet john mark off the great john mark off
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:16.380]   Uh wrote a book called what the dorm house said
[02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:21.180]   How the sixties counterculture shaped the personal computer industry and he did quote
[02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:24.460]   Uh, warren and talked about warren's story in there in that
[02:03:24.460 --> 02:03:29.900]   So if you read these old books about the history of silicon valley and so forth, but uh
[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:32.940]   But I mean even in school
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:41.020]   Oh, they don't teach these names don't come up in school. They always say, you know, steve jobs. They never even said steve wasniak quite honestly
[02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:42.300]   Yeah
[02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:44.460]   You know, why why is that something's wrong there?
[02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:47.420]   Well, I think also got a limited amount of time
[02:03:47.420 --> 02:03:50.140]   Yeah, and I don't think jim warren invented anything that
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:57.980]   There's lots of people like adam osborn and jim marrow that you probably never heard of either who did in fact invent early personal computers
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:04:01.020]   Yeah, that's kind of my job is to remind people
[02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:05.500]   That's certainly one of the things I in fact really one of the reasons I started twit was
[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:11.100]   I wanted to get some of these people on camera. Mm-hmm sit them down talk to them before we never did get jim warren on camera
[02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:15.340]   I'm saying but that was always kind of one of the agendas was to kind of
[02:04:15.340 --> 02:04:18.460]   Oh, it was the famous pr guy to silicon valley
[02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:21.180]   Oh
[02:04:21.180 --> 02:04:23.740]   You know what I mean? Yes, I do know you mean and I just the name
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:27.420]   escapes me
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:33.500]   Shoot shoot shoot shoot that guy doesn't like the word crap is now left the building
[02:04:33.500 --> 02:04:38.780]   No more no more. Let's take a break picks of the week
[02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:42.060]   We're gonna wrap this up in just a moment, but first a word
[02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:47.180]   From cash fly this show is quite literally brought to you by cash flies
[02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:50.860]   CDN content delivery network. We've been using it
[02:04:50.860 --> 02:04:54.860]   Uh practically since twit started in the early days of twit that was the big good under him
[02:04:54.860 --> 02:04:59.900]   How do I get the shows to people in a timely fashion without breaking the bank?
[02:04:59.900 --> 02:05:05.180]   Mad levine of cash like came to me and said I can help and we've been using cash fly ever since in fact
[02:05:05.180 --> 02:05:07.660]   I love them so much because when we we went to them
[02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:10.940]   We were so nervous when we decided to do video of all of our shows
[02:05:10.940 --> 02:05:16.380]   We thought that's gonna triple quite droopled him out of storage and then a bandwidth we're gonna use how soon into making
[02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:21.020]   Twit did you did you add video? Uh probably just a couple oh add video
[02:05:21.020 --> 02:05:26.300]   I thought you were gonna ask about cash fly because yeah, they did audio for well that that was the next but yeah adding video
[02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:28.700]   Why did we do that?
[02:05:28.700 --> 02:05:33.260]   2009 john says john is our archivist so about four years in
[02:05:33.980 --> 02:05:37.900]   And so that's when the real crunch came certainly from a bandwidth point of view
[02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:40.940]   Yeah, I was terrified. I we went to we went to cash fly said
[02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:44.460]   We have something we want to tell you
[02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:50.780]   We're gonna quadruple the amount of bandwidth we're using and they said hey cool. They are so they're such a great partner
[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:57.420]   Now they do streaming ultra low latency streaming and i'm not talking web rtc. I'm talking about real
[02:05:57.420 --> 02:06:00.460]   one second delay or less
[02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:09.020]   And it's just great. They offer an uh, uh, uh, uh, html 5 player. There's an sdk so you could put it on mobile on websites and applications
[02:06:09.020 --> 02:06:14.380]   Uh, whatever platform you want to be on of course cash fly is completely global see those dots

[02:06:32.300 --> 02:06:37.340]   as well as in just thousands of synchronous streams i remember when the first
[02:06:37.340 --> 02:06:40.220]   100 000 viewer
[02:06:40.220 --> 02:06:43.100]   Uh video stream happened and we were just like a gog
[02:06:43.100 --> 02:06:46.460]   100 000 people simultaneously you can do a million
[02:06:46.460 --> 02:06:53.500]   A million plus their platforms designed for transmuxing thousands of streams simultaneously
[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:58.460]   With live failover they can ingest rtmp rtmp s uh srt
[02:06:58.460 --> 02:07:04.460]   All formats to deliver ultra low latency sldp and hls streams and they could do it all simultaneously

[02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:37.580]   Dot com stacy higgen buffam. What's your pick of the week?
[02:08:37.580 --> 02:08:43.020]   This is the fi color
[02:08:43.020 --> 02:08:49.420]   Okay, I don't know if a dog collar is the best thing for a pick of the week, but okay
[02:08:50.300 --> 02:08:55.980]   Is that a dog collar let her finish? What is it? It is a connected dog collar
[02:08:55.980 --> 02:08:58.380]   what
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:05.580]   This is a it's connected to bluetooth on my phone and then it has a gps ability. Oh see I want this
[02:09:05.580 --> 02:09:07.020]   Yes
[02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:11.180]   But always these gps tracking colors have been too big for the doggy
[02:09:11.180 --> 02:09:18.380]   So my dog is 24 pounds this she here. Let's see if she's here. Let's see if you're gonna say earlier
[02:09:18.380 --> 02:09:24.220]   Is she over there? Oh, yeah, she's on her little blanket. There she is. I see her. Oh
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:26.540]   She a little puppy
[02:09:26.540 --> 02:09:29.900]   So she's about 20 pounds and she's mostly fur
[02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:32.700]   and she
[02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:36.460]   Can wear this it is much bigger. I've got her other color here. It's not too heavy
[02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:41.260]   Yeah, it's a little bigger, but it's still she can wear it. That's the point, right? She can wear it. It's not too heavy
[02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:45.660]   Um because don't you always want to know where she is and what she's up to and what do they do when
[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:50.460]   You're not around. I know where she is. She's usually wherever I am. She doesn't go outside
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:54.780]   Does she not go outside? She has a dog door, but she doesn't like going outside without me
[02:09:54.780 --> 02:10:00.380]   She's old too. She used to escape a lot though. It would have been good then, but what I can show you is
[02:10:00.380 --> 02:10:04.860]   She doesn't like going on walks in the morning, but I I'm the app
[02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:10.140]   Oh, see that's what I want to see like I want to see how they walk around where they go. I think that's so cool
[02:10:10.140 --> 02:10:13.420]   That's so cool
[02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:17.660]   Okay, so that's that's how does it get the information back to you?
[02:10:17.660 --> 02:10:21.740]   Um, there's a bridge that plugs in
[02:10:21.740 --> 02:10:28.060]   To my Wi-Fi so it'll either talk to my phone or to that bridge and share data from the collar too
[02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:31.500]   So it saves it and then when they get nearby, okay
[02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:34.220]   So you can't see where she is in real time or can you?
[02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:37.260]   I can actually I can turn on the gps
[02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:42.620]   And see where she is in real time and I get notifications. I'm getting shorter
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:45.580]   It's nice to laugh at short people
[02:10:45.580 --> 02:10:48.140]   That tight shot and I'm like, what are they doing?
[02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:51.420]   Towards the end of the show
[02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:54.380]   I just like to relax the seat is slippery
[02:10:54.380 --> 02:11:00.380]   It just you can't help just slipping down. I didn't notice until I saw it on the camera
[02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:04.940]   Can I see me take my shoe off?
[02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:09.340]   Just like that instantly. I didn't think he reaches down together
[02:11:11.500 --> 02:11:13.500]   Sorry stacey go ahead
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:20.700]   Use it to track your dog. It's stacey. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry
[02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:24.460]   Feel like the child who brings the crappy stuff to show it
[02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:29.580]   It's the other way around you're the adult. We're the child
[02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:38.140]   So it also tracks your dog's sleep and I like this because my dog sleeps with her eyes open which is so
[02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:40.780]   That's creepy. But um
[02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:47.020]   Sleep tracking for a dog. Yeah, so my dog last night slept for 11.2 hours
[02:11:47.020 --> 02:11:50.860]   And she's got 6.2 hours of naps during the day. That is cool
[02:11:50.860 --> 02:11:53.740]   So 17 hours a day. That's good
[02:11:53.740 --> 02:11:57.020]   17. Yeah, so and you get little rankings for your dog
[02:11:57.020 --> 02:11:58.540]   I will say
[02:11:58.540 --> 02:12:03.900]   Note that there are two downsides to this one. There's a subscription because of the cellular component
[02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:10.700]   Okay, that's that's oh there is a cellular convection. Oh, yeah. There. Yes. Oh, sorry. That's when it's that's the real time
[02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:12.700]   Sorry, oh, there's a little bit of a nice
[02:12:12.700 --> 02:12:18.540]   It's yeah, it's so it's a solid. Sorry. There is cellular surface there. I'm like, oh, yeah
[02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:20.380]   Um
[02:12:20.380 --> 02:12:23.580]   So there's a subscription a monthly subscription is it how much?
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:26.060]   Okay
[02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:30.220]   That's worth it. You know what if you love your pup. That's not a big deal. That's fine. Okay
[02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:36.700]   Oh, and what is an L.T. It says it's on l.T. E. M. What is l.T. E cat m? So it's um
[02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:43.740]   It's not is it's not the fat l.T. E. It's the low power long distance. Okay. Yeah, okay
[02:12:43.740 --> 02:12:48.700]   Most l.T. E is long distance, but yes, it says it reaches 30 percent farther
[02:12:48.700 --> 02:12:52.700]   Than normal l.T. E network. So that's cool. Okay
[02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:55.740]   I mean, I'm just reading the website but
[02:12:55.740 --> 02:13:02.460]   And then the other downside to note is that the you know how I talked about mozzilla's privacy net included thing the fi
[02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:10.860]   Tracks all your data and then some it just wants to know where you are so it can tell you things like your pet is not near you
[02:13:10.860 --> 02:13:15.340]   So yeah, it has escape detection. That's so cool
[02:13:15.340 --> 02:13:21.180]   Oh, yeah, when you get it you set a little boundary around your home and it's pretty narrow boundary
[02:13:21.180 --> 02:13:23.900]   It doesn't ever my whole property. Yeah, a geophth. Thank you
[02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:27.020]   And whenever the dog leaves the geophthans I get an alert
[02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:30.700]   Um, which is nice usually I'm with the dog
[02:13:31.500 --> 02:13:36.380]   Whenever I got I want to get a dog now because this is great. I got two
[02:13:36.380 --> 02:13:41.340]   Yeah, how much so battery life you have to charge it every night
[02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:46.700]   Well, so I take my dog's color off at night. Um, usually so
[02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:49.260]   I charge it
[02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:54.220]   I've had it for about a week and a half and I charged it like once a week. Oh, that's not bad
[02:13:54.220 --> 02:13:56.780]   Why do you why do you take it off?
[02:13:56.780 --> 02:13:59.740]   Um, she's got these
[02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:03.260]   All her tags and I know you have to be comfortable. She's
[02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:08.380]   Yeah, and she likes to get under the bed and she gets it's kind of a process to do that
[02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:12.300]   We take the dog's color off. Yeah, okay. Yeah, I never think about that
[02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:17.180]   I've been wanting this forever and we you know, we've tried putting bluetooth tags
[02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:22.940]   Yeah, I've always thought this would be a great product. This is cool 150 bucks, which is not bad
[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:25.580]   It's waterproof
[02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:30.220]   Yeah, and you can let's see the one I just showed you is $112 at chewy right now
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:35.660]   Oh, man. I got a good dog. Oh and it tracks your dog steps if you care for that
[02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:38.540]   And it ranks them
[02:14:38.540 --> 02:14:43.500]   Hold on does it count the four legs and divides by four? How does it count steps?
[02:14:43.500 --> 02:14:47.260]   No, I think it counts all the feet because she walks more than I do
[02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:52.380]   Her feet are weight like I mean, but she's smaller than I am too. Well, yeah, she takes way more steps than I do
[02:14:52.380 --> 02:14:55.420]   Right, but yeah, I don't know of course
[02:14:56.140 --> 02:15:01.020]   This isn't gonna prevent her from getting stolen for instance, but it's just for forgetting lost
[02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:04.060]   Yeah, this is great. I don't think anyone wants to steal my dog
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:09.180]   No, but if they if I got up like I always wanted a you got a cute little
[02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:12.940]   French bulldog the bulldog
[02:15:12.940 --> 02:15:19.500]   They get stolen. Yeah, I'll get a mutt. I'm gonna go there rescue and get a mutt. That's the way to do it
[02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:24.220]   That's the right way. Absolutely. Yeah, and it's a very sturdy color and they come in different
[02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:26.860]   Like you can buy fancier colors if you want
[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:30.860]   Yeah, and clip it in. Okay. Yeah, it looks pretty good
[02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:36.220]   Five t r y f i dot com
[02:15:36.220 --> 02:15:42.380]   Yeah, try if I try five. So there you go in good pick. I mean
[02:15:42.380 --> 02:15:46.140]   Yeah, it is I guess that's an iot device
[02:15:46.140 --> 02:15:51.420]   It's connected to my phone. It's got a freaking cellular modem in it. Yeah
[02:15:52.060 --> 02:15:54.780]   Yeah, you're gonna fight me on this for you? No, no, I'm agreeing
[02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:59.420]   I'm saying it is look at that look on our face. I'm scared. Okay
[02:15:59.420 --> 02:16:02.220]   Scared of her
[02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:07.980]   Mr. Emperor. Oh, no, I guess I do i'll do jeff first for the number and then we'll do it jeff your number
[02:16:07.980 --> 02:16:10.220]   I don't know. I don't much like my numbers. Let's see
[02:16:10.220 --> 02:16:14.860]   Uh, have you been to the mobile phone museum before? No, no, or let's try that one
[02:16:14.860 --> 02:16:19.420]   So all the kinds of mobile phones you'd ever want
[02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:22.540]   Let's have a little run down memory lane is this
[02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:27.740]   Wow, I have a lot. I've had a lot of these. Oh, yeah, you probably have the ball
[02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:30.220]   Yeah, we know and you yeah
[02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:36.700]   There's a phone I I had that was the skinniest thinnest little phone. I'm trying to remember
[02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:41.820]   Who made a J phone there? No, it'll be in that too. It was really cute
[02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:49.420]   Yeah, it was a company that doesn't currently make phones with some Japanese company. I think like san. I think it was a sanio
[02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:56.300]   I think it was sanio. Wow. This is cool. Look at this. Is this do they claim every phone? No, I don't think so
[02:16:56.300 --> 02:17:00.140]   And then and their order seems
[02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:02.540]   Somewhat random it is
[02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:07.980]   So you just a website of the mobile phone museum a charity with over 2100 individual models
[02:17:07.980 --> 02:17:14.860]   Oh, so you could go you could search by brand. Let's see if they have we have over 2,000 unique models in the collection, but some are
[02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:19.340]   Uh, there were still searching for some iconic phones. Hmm. Yeah, this is not
[02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:24.300]   A collection. One of mine. I missed it and you can go by year, which is fun
[02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:27.420]   That's cool
[02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:29.100]   Nice
[02:17:29.100 --> 02:17:30.940]   It's a online
[02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:32.940]   museum history is calling
[02:17:32.940 --> 02:17:39.420]   The official website of the mobile phone museum a charity with over 2100 individual models. Is there a location?
[02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:42.060]   I don't know
[02:17:42.060 --> 02:17:48.220]   You can donate your phones too, which is fun. I bet you uh, I probably I probably could find something
[02:17:48.220 --> 02:17:55.340]   Yeah, you could you oh they really want this one. I remember this one. Remember that spun around? This is their most wall. That was just been run down
[02:17:55.340 --> 02:17:57.420]   Yeah
[02:17:57.420 --> 02:18:03.260]   With 2,000 models, but there's still many iconic phones visit the most wanted page. That's what I want. So
[02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:07.100]   They're unable to stay they stage exhibitions. Yeah
[02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:14.300]   They're not doing right now, but that'll be fun. The tag the tag who are meridiest
[02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:17.260]   the Motorola aura

[02:22:51.340 --> 02:22:53.740]   Um because generally
[02:22:53.740 --> 02:22:57.660]   You have a different love language than your spouse
[02:22:57.660 --> 02:23:01.420]   Totally different and you got to know that so you know how to make your spouse happy
[02:23:01.420 --> 02:23:07.580]   Totally different. Yeah, I love queen prude and I know she loves me, but boy she talks a different language

[02:23:25.580 --> 02:23:28.140]   But what I like about it is
[02:23:28.140 --> 02:23:34.140]   I I don't particularly do a lot of self help books and things because a lot in my opinion a lot of them come off too
[02:23:34.140 --> 02:23:37.180]   Woo-wee and just this one's very
[02:23:37.180 --> 02:23:41.980]   Concrete. Yeah when I picked it up. I read the first chapter. I was like, okay
[02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:48.700]   This is something that I can totally understand and not a bunch of platitudes stuff out, you know, so yeah check it out
[02:23:48.700 --> 02:23:52.700]   Yeah, and if if you know your spouse likes back rubs
