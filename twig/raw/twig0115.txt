[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.640]   Hello, everybody.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.480]   Leo LePorte here.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.680]   And it's about time to talk about Google, the cloud,
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.400]   Facebook, Twitter, all of that stuff.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.320]   And to my left, Gina Trappani from smarterwear.org,
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.040]   founder of Life Hacker, joining us from San Diego.
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.400]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.080]   Howdy.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.760]   How's it going?
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.960]   It's going great.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.960]   I love--
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.520]   We could talk about Apple today, too.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.080]   I love it.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.320]   We could talk about Apple.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.200]   And it makes me love my Android phone even more.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.680]   But I'll get to that in a second.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.120]   That cackle is from the author of Public Parts,
[00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.480]   Jeff Jarvis, buzz machine.com.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.200]   The book Public Parts Just Out Now,
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.280]   Everybody Must Read It.
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.160]   It's about living life in public, which Jeff does in spades.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.840]   To a fault.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.600]   To a fault.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.120]   That's a better phrase than in spades.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.960]   In spades might be confusing.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.960]   There it is.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.960]   Good to see you, Gina.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.480]   Thank you.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.000]   It is reminds at home on the coffee table.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.520]   It's a coffee table.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.520]   It's a coffee table.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   I'm reading it.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.040]   My last book made it into page one,
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.160]   which is the movie about the New York Times.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.440]   The way it made it in was that it was David Carr's rest
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.280]   for his wrist.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.560]   But obviously, I'm better than I'd use.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.120]   That's hysterical.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.200]   But somebody must have done that on purpose
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.280]   to, as a tip of the hat.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.640]   No, a little dig.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.000]   Oh, a little dig, you think?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.480]   I think so.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.280]   It's all right.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.560]   Well--
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.280]   That'd be David Carr's rest rest.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.280]   I'd do it.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   Really?
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.320]   Something you'll share with us here.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.520]   He's curmudgeonly, yeah.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.520]   He is a curmudgeon.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.720]   That is true.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.440]   That is true.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.720]   We are going to watch the entire Apple keynote,
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.960]   thanks to Gizmodo.
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.520]   Are you ready for this?
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.080]   In 80 seconds.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.240]   Is it on-- is the video on here?
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.160]   The video is by Woody Jang.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.920]   Yes, here it is.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.040]   All right, ladies and gentlemen, I give you 80 seconds,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.400]   the entire Apple keynote.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.120]   My first product launch, just 10 years ago,
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.080]   we launched the original iPod here, over 300 million
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.480]   iPods around the world.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.400]   The number one smartphone in the world.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.600]   Cards is an app which lets you create and mail beautiful cards.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.960]   I can't wait to talk about that.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.040]   It's like a joke.
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.720]   By message.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.520]   Reminders.

[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.080]   iTunes match.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.200]   Find my friends.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.480]   All of this is part of iCloud.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.680]   All that's new inside the new iPhone 4S.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.600]   A whole new chip.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.880]   A great new antenna system.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.800]   A megapixel camera with all new optics.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.720]   1080p HD video camera.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.280]   Airplay.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.200]   Vycloud.

[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.440]   Control your music.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.080]   Messages.

[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.400]   Reminders and maps.

[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:57.520]   Weather.

[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.360]   Timers.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.400]   Contacts.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.360]   You can create notes.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.440]   You can search the web.
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.200]   Wikipedia.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.120]   Wolfram Alpha.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.680]   I am a humble personal assistant.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.040]   The most amazing iPhone.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.680]   iPhone 3DS for free.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.320]   And iPhone 4, it's just $99.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.000]   And a brand new iPhone 4S at $199.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.360]   Are we available in a week?
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.400]   Thank you very much.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.800]   Boy, I wish they'd done that version for us.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.920]   Because we got up early.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.560]   We sat here for hours.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.200]   Oh, man.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   It did feel a little low energy, didn't it?
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.760]   Even in that where you chopped it and made it into 80 seconds,
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.360]   it felt like it was just kind of ragging.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.600]   Yeah, I watched it during the entire thing all morning.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.680]   And I was sort of coding.
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.600]   And I had to put on in the background listening
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.120]   what was going on.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.560]   And then I went to lunch and a friend of mine
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.080]   and was like, oh, so what happened at the Apple thing?
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.240]   And I was like, I'm not really sure.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.120]   I watched it.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.200]   I don't know.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.800]   I'm not sure there's the iPhone 4S.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.200]   And she was like, well, what's that?
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.360]   And I was like, it's not really different than the 4.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.320]   Which I have to say, it's unfair.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.080]   I'm really excited about iOS 5.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.080]   I'm excited about that.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.800]   I think there's some really good new stuff in it,
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.000]   new cloud capabilities.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.280]   Excited about notifications, finally kind of catching up
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.000]   to Android.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.320]   And the Siri demo was super cool.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.480]   The cards thing was ridiculous, but the Siri demo
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.320]   was really cool.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.120]   So I'm excited for that.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.480]   Let's test two of the cards for a second,
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.560]   because that just amazes me.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.200]   I was just beside myself.
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.400]   The postal department is dying.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.520]   The stamps are dying.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.720]   They're going to keep it alive.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.440]   What's next?
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.480]   I'm Morris Code.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.920]   I pigeoned.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.440]   And it's a geez.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.400]   I don't-- I really don't understand it.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.320]   It was driving me nuts.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.280]   I mean, there's tons of straight lines in it,
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.360]   but I didn't get it.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.320]   Well, first of all, there are other programs
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.840]   on the iPhone that do do this already,
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.080]   including Andy Herzfeld's.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.200]   And what-- the only thing that baffled me
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.000]   is they spent the first 40 minutes rehashing sales
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.760]   statistics.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.320]   The usual, they always do it, but the 40 minutes is long.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.720]   And then the big first announcement is this.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.200]   The cards you could print from your iPhone,
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.160]   I thought this had better get better fast.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.960]   This is not a good sign.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.560]   The main reason I bring it up on this show
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.720]   is the chief exciting new features for iPhone 4S
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.320]   are, in every respect, something already on Android.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.200]   Am I wrong?
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.600]   Notifications?
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.440]   Well, there's iOS 5, and then there's the iPhone 4S.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.360]   So we kind of have to--
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.280]   you know, this one.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.560]   But you do need the 4S to do the Siri Assistant.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.520]   You do, for sure.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.520]   So--
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.200]   Yeah, but you're right.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.160]   We're talking about software, because hardware--
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.400]   there is-- in fact, it looks like this camera
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.760]   will be the best camera on the phone,
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.720]   with the possible exception of the Nokia.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.160]   Yeah, I was excited about the camera.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.040]   Definitely.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.240]   That's a good hardware.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.560]   Yes.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.960]   And now a better antenna.
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.040]   Nothing wrong with the old antenna.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.560]   Right, right.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.960]   Just-- just-- this one's better.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.000]   But this one's better.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.640]   This one's better.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.800]   We don't want you to think there was anything wrong.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.000]   But we fixed it.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Right.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.520]   But I have to say, it does feel like Apple
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.640]   is not innovating in most respects here.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.120]   This is-- the notifications are straight out of Android.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.840]   There's a little bit of an additional feature,
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.120]   because they're live.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.680]   So you could put live weather and live stocks in there.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.320]   The voice assistant is--
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.520]   we don't have it yet.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.760]   But when we get it, I have to say,
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.600]   it sounds a lot like what Android's had,
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.000]   with its voice search for a long time.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.320]   I could do most of those things with Android, right?
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.320]   Yes, that's true.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.720]   Although it looks a little more polished.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.560]   You know, with the Android voice commands,
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.160]   you kind of feel like you're speaking to a computer.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.240]   From the demo, and I haven't tried Siri,
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.280]   they did make it seem.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.880]   They gave it a little bit of Apple Polls.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.960]   It seems like you're talking to a personal assistant.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:37.720]   And I'll tell you through.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.400]   I don't know how much I'm actually going to use it.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.520]   I was wowed by the demo.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.320]   I don't use voice commands on Android very much either.
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.480]   I just don't drive a whole lot.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.080]   I imagine if I did, I probably would.
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.520]   But yeah, Apple never does things kind of early and half
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:52.840]   asked.
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.760]   It seems like they come late, but then they
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.400]   add a little extra.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.200]   So I think the notifications out of that little extra,
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.560]   Siri looks like it might have a little extra.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.400]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.120]   This is all about sort of parity with what
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.800]   Android has had for a while now.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.440]   The Siri thing does seem interesting, thanks for instance.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:08.920]   Somehow.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.880]   And again, this stuff demos so well.
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.800]   In fact, I use the Android search type, say,
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.560]   listen to Bob Dylan forever young,
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.440]   and then it plays it on Spotify.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.440]   That's a great demo.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.200]   How often do I do that in real life?
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.520]   Almost never, unless I'm showing off.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.000]   And so these things do make great demos.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.440]   But the idea that you could say make it appointment at noon
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.880]   and Siri talks back to you, which is something Android
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.600]   doesn't do.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.480]   And we'll say, you already have an appointment there.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.120]   Would you like me to move it?
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.560]   That was a really cool example.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.680]   If that works, that's cool.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.000]   If that works.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Yes.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.280]   That's a big if.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.520]   Yes.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.360]   I'll be very curious.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.000]   Yeah, I'm kind of bad to myself running along the water
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.800]   and telling my phones or reschedule an appointment.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.480]   Well, that's the thing is how often do you really do?
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.480]   Really?
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.280]   How often do you do that or do that?
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.960]   The A5 processor, I think, is really at a parity only
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.120]   with the Galaxy S2.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.160]   The S2's processor is that TI-X and O's processor running
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.760]   at 1.2 gigahertz.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.400]   The Galaxy S2 has a gig of RAM, which
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.600]   is what we think the iPhone 4S has,
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.840]   although Apple never says.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:20.240]   And the 8 megapixel camera on the Galaxy S2 is quite good.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.800]   Plus it has a bigger super AMOLED screen.
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.840]   They're not changing the screen.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.600]   In fact, they're not changing the form factor at all,
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.960]   which I think is a huge error.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.960]   Because as everyone knows, people buy new phones
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.520]   because they don't want the old phone.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.400]   They don't want to look-- they look stated.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.280]   They're really right.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.120]   They should have new phones.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.840]   Even new colors or something.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.560]   Just put fins on it.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.440]   Because then people will have to upgrade.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.280]   Now, I read an interesting article that actually
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.000]   makes a lot of sense.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.520]   That Apple is now slow playing the game.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.440]   They are going to release a phone that
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.920]   is an upgrade for the two years old folks.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.280]   So this is the iPhone 4 for the 3GS owners.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.560]   Next year, they do the iPhone 5 for the iPhone 4 owners.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.160]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.680]   Because it's a two-year term.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.480]   Now, this kind of-- I think this could make sense
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.000]   that you slow play it.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.600]   But what that shows how backwards the industry is, though.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.680]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.280]   The phones come out.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.200]   The fact that we're imprisoned in two years
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.080]   is just absurd and really hurts the hardware industry.
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.240]   And Apple should have found a way to beat that down.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.800]   I agree.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.760]   But in the past they have, they've upgraded every year,
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.320]   which is still slower than Android.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.840]   But maybe they're saying to themselves,
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.480]   or maybe their research has shown,
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.280]   that consumers are pissed and say, look, I can't afford
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.280]   to buy a new phone every year.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.840]   I will have to buy it every two years when I get that free
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.800]   upgrade.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.440]   That's when I want a new phone.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.120]   So it's 3GS owners who are now looking.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.080]   It'll be iPhone 4 owners who look--
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.320]   I'm sure not motivated to replace my iPhone 4.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.480]   There's no reason whatsoever.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.040]   It's not enough of an upgrade.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.040]   You.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.080]   From this--
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.160]   it's the 3G to 3GS parallel.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.800]   I mean, that took a year, and it didn't change as much.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.800]   The 3G to 3GS.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.920]   It's changed more than that.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.040]   A lot of the changes are--
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.600]   all the changes are under the hood, though.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.320]   I mean, the phone looks exactly the same.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.560]   The only advantage to that, of course,
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.920]   is you can still use all your accessories.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.320]   Your case is all fit.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.600]   That doesn't change, which I'm kind of
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.560]   am happy about that.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.080]   We do now have a dual-core processor.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.600]   So that should be a big change under the hood.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.640]   Screen is identical.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.920]   Here's a great comparison.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.280]   This is from-- this is my next.com.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.400]   Comparing the 4.4s and the Galaxy S2,
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.480]   the screen of the Galaxy S2 is a lower resolution screen,
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.440]   although bigger.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.320]   It's 4.3 to 4.5 inches, but only 800 by 480 compared to 960
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:41.960]   by 640.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.280]   It's not a retina display.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.280]   Now, no 4G on any of the iPhones.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.200]   They claim they're faster now on HSPA+.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.200]   So maybe they'll have parity.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.640]   We'll see.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.360]   They should get all of the benefit of the HSPA+.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.800]   If you have it in your neighborhood.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.960]   Global roaming on CDMA?
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.920]   Yes, because they're using a dual-core chip.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:12.600]   That's something that the sprint and Verizon versions
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.080]   of the Galaxy S2-- actually, there's no Verizon version.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:19.200]   Let's say the Bionic, which is Verizon's top of the line.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.960]   We'll have to see how the camera is,
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.000]   but it looked like the camera might be better on spec.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Certainly, it can do things the other cameras and software.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.840]   Is anybody going to buy the phone
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.400]   based on the camera being a scunch better
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.880]   than another camera on another phone?
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.600]   That's a good question.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.760]   I think what Apple's moving to is don't buy--
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.680]   it's not about phone.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.200]   Don't buy a point and shoot.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.480]   This phone is good enough to be a point and shoot.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.800]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.640]   I'm not arguing with liking it in normal--
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.200]   I don't think they'll upgrade, but I think that--
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.160]   Out of advantage, no.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.200]   I think it's somewhat of an advantage.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.760]   Well, you know, and again, it's very hard
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.120]   to explain, but for instance, the fact
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.720]   that it's ready to take a picture in 1.1 seconds,
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.760]   and it could take burst mode 0.5 second pictures.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.000]   No phone can do that yet.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.120]   No camera phone can do that yet.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.920]   So that's pretty--
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.080]   It's better to go that way than the megapixel fight,
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.920]   which is me.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.480]   I agree.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.440]   They even kind of acknowledge that.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.920]   Storage is a push across the board.
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.160]   Wi-Fi is a push.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.720]   Siri, you know, this table really isn't fair,
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:21.960]   because as I said, Android has voice to text support.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.080]   Which I use for searches.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.520]   And I use it.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.520]   I have to say, I dictate many text messages.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.040]   Really?
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.600]   Because I get tired.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.760]   I get really tired.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.240]   And so the dictation's very good if you know how to do it.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.080]   You have to modify.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.960]   You have to speak clearly.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.640]   You also have to be alone.
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.040]   And you have to be alone.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:42.480]   Staying on the street saying can't do it.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.160]   The O La Porte.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.040]   Now, I'm sure Siri will have that same problem.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.240]   My kids mess with me.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.280]   I'll press the button, start the search.
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:55.400]   And Henry will start saying, trees, fruit, flies, 1, 3, 7.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.960]   He screws with me every time.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.120]   It drives me nuts.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.800]   And basically, if you have young kids,
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.040]   if you have a baby in the house,
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.400]   it just starts crying randomly.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.760]   It's not teenage or friendly.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.360]   Gina, I've got to ask you a question.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.040]   How can you legally live in California and not drive a bunch?
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.600]   It's working at home in California
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.880]   that lets me do that.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:15.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.760]   My commute is down the hall.
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.760]   What do you say?
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.320]   I have a short commute, but I still drive a lot, I have to say.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.040]   Siri Assistant struck me as more akin to a parallel to voice
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.040]   commands versus voice to text.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.600]   Like, it seemed less like a dictation tool
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.800]   and more like a command.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.240]   A command--
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.680]   We have commands.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:32.600]   We can say listen to.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.120]   We can say navigate to.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.000]   I could say send an email.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.040]   I could say send a text.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.200]   I mean, this is--
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.600]   Android has, I would say, 80% of this functionality.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.280]   It's the talk back to me stuff that is different.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.680]   And we'll just have to see how well that works before we--
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.280]   The seerate invitation.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.280]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:50.920]   Yes.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.440]   One of the things they showed, again,
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.680]   as if they'd invented it, is on the keyboard.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.160]   There's a little microphone button.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.200]   And you press it and you can dictate.
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.840]   And I kind of say--
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.560]   Very familiar.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.920]   And Apple is suing Samsung over copying Apple.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.920]   Samsung's already made noise that they may try to stop the 4S
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.480]   because it looks just like Android.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.280]   Well, they're going after them in supposedly in France,
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.600]   which is kind of hilarious to pick that battleground, too.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.960]   I mean, it's good for-- look, it's good--
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.760]   cross-pollinization is good for us.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.040]   So I'm not complaining at all.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.920]   I just think that Apple kind of acts
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.240]   as if they invented this all.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.560]   And it's not the case.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.120]   Well, the other thing, too, is that I use--
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.320]   because I carry the iPhone now--
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:41.000]   I use Google voice on the iPhone in Google Search.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Right.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Right.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.400]   So it doesn't matter whether Apple has it or not.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.280]   I'm using Google's.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:50.080]   Well, in any event, I think the thing that's very clear here
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.200]   is that Apple did not up the ante so much
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.840]   that the hot top of the line Android phones are going to be
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:56.360]   threatened.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.160]   We're going to see the Nexus Prime next Thursday, right,
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.440]   Eileen?
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.640]   Or Tuesday.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.160]   Excuse me.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.240]   So it will be-- the Android Nexus Prime will be out
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.760]   before the iPhone is.
[00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.320]   With it, they've already made clear.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.560]   With a fairly dramatic form factor.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:12.560]   Right?
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.400]   They're covering the screen.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.400]   There's a lot of interest.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.800]   Eileen, who does all about Android,
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.720]   is produces the show.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.360]   It is on the board right now.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.080]   That's who the disembodied voice is,
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.480]   because they have to have a camera on her.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.320]   But Eileen, what are people saying
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.800]   that the Nexus Prime will include?
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.440]   Well, we're not quite sure.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.760]   The teaser video that they posted--
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.560]   and I can see if you can go to that.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.080]   I'll pull it up.
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:32.580]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.400]   Yeah, let's see that.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:33.920]   That's pretty cool.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.160]   There's a real curve to it.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.040]   And there's something on top of it.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.280]   And there's sort of theories that it might be a tablet.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.160]   And phone.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.040]   Or not quite sure.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.160]   I mean, we know it's ice cream sandwich.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:44.920]   And that's the other thing.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.720]   It's ice cream sandwich.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.240]   Do we know how much new stuff is an ice cream sandwich?
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.160]   Well, they're talking about slight modifications
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.600]   to the app drawer.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.720]   And it's going to look very much like honeycomb.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.200]   Oh, you're not seeing that video.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.680]   Here's the video I got right here.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:03.760]   Something big is coming.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.520]   It says Samsung.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.800]   This is on YouTube.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.160]   I don't think they'll mind us playing it.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.200]   In everyday life, some things just go better together.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.560]   Cookies, milk, a better snack.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.720]   News favorite coffee.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.800]   A better morning.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.600]   Gina and Jeff, a better plan.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.760]   Wine, candles, a better moment.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:28.000]   Another perfect combination is just around the corner.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.800]   Get ready for it.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.160]   Something big is coming.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:31.680]   That's it.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.520]   The even bath.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.680]   Holy komole.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:39.360]   By the way, this looks a little bit like what we were thinking.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:39.720]   There you go.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.280]   Let me pause it.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.280]   We were thinking that the iPhone 5 might be.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.200]   It may still be an extra June, curved.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.720]   That's even more curved.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.280]   It would have been a strong-- it would make sense.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.720]   It's curved like your face.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.240]   Very thin.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.040]   Yup.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:54.760]   Wacky.
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.080]   Very wacky.
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.080]   And when you throw it, it comes back to you.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.200]   I mean, who's going to carry it again?
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.000]   I'm just like, wow.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.160]   I was like, step on your punch line.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.160]   That was a good one.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.160]   I didn't step on it.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.360]   Well, actually Google streaming at youtube.com/android.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.960]   So they'll be streaming at 11.30.
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.360]   You know, Samsung currently sells to everybody.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.680]   You can get the Galaxy to us on everybody except for Ryzen.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.880]   And that's only because they've got the Bionic, which
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:19.960]   is very comparable.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.200]   I think they reasonably didn't want to muddy the waters.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   I think the big question mark is, how good is ice cream sandwich
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.760]   going to be?
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.320]   How much--
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.840]   Well, here's what I--
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.880]   I had lunch as you know two weeks ago with Bradley Horowitz.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.200]   And he told me nothing of note.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.320]   But I got the impression that it's going to be a big step.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   And it's going to be a big step for the kinds of things
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.240]   that Google can do with it.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.880]   That when you look at Google+ and other things like that,
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:54.760]   that I think ice cream sandwich will have so many new hooks
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.400]   in it for both Google and for outside developers.
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.720]   Of things you can do.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.400]   Just neat stuff you can do.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.120]   And so it's in advance of that form.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.360]   So what's more important is the software of the hardware.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.600]   And if you can get both at once, is that
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.760]   going to beat iPhone to the iPhone 5?
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.880]   Here's Andy Rubin posting on Google+.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.600]   Thank you, Andy, for finally posting on Google+.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.120]   When we launched Android in 2007, we asked them, kids,
[00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:24.440]   if they had a magic phone, what would it do?
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.400]   And then notice at the end, he says--
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.560]   If I had a magic phone, it would take me to the moon.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.520]   OK, I think we can eliminate that as a rumor for--
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.960]   No, no, not the Google guys.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:37.400]   The Google guys want to go to the moon,
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.720]   so it makes perfect sense to me.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.640]   Ice cream sandwich.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.120]   They sell a baby.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.920]   The first phone on the moon.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.560]   It's on Google.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.800]   It would turn into underpants.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:54.640]   OK, I think that Andy is steering us a little astray here.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.840]   I don't think it's going to turn into underpants.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.640]   I did, however.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.680]   Kids saying they really want their phone to make ice cream
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:02.200]   for them.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.840]   It would take me to the moon.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.960]   My dream food would make cupcakes with sprinkles.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.480]   It would turn into underpants.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.480]   It would go super, super fast.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.080]   Those are the wings.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:22.200]   Help animals feel better to make me into an astronaut
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.000]   and have peanut butter sandwiches.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.400]   Uh-uh.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.720]   We must give you a sandwich place.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.360]   So, make cookies.
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.920]   In 100 vanilla, in 1000 vanilla.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:41.640]   So, they put shoes fit in my pocket and have a keyboard.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.640]   Oh, just pick.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:51.040]   Sounds like me.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.040]   Baby, baby, baby.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.040]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.520]   It would get me anything I want.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.920]   What will your phone do?
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.920]   Ice cream.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:06.680]   It's interesting.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.480]   Ice cream at the end is exactly what--
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.320]   I like that that's a plug for the open hands at a lens.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.320]   Right.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.400]   You know, Android itself or--
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.560]   Well, this goes back to 2007 before the G1 was even out.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:25.240]   So, that's Andy's best indication of what ice cream
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.400]   a sandwich will do.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.320]   So, there'll be a voice command.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.520]   So, you don't make me a sandwich.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.160]   Yes.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.080]   I like it.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:32.640]   I like it.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.160]   And it'll be hard.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.840]   But I figured the iPhone 4s would come with I-tongue,
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.640]   so it could lick your stamps on your card.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.160]   Oh.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.800]   Isn't that just really retro that it's--
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.520]   and they made such a big deal out of it,
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.840]   as if you've been waiting for your phone
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.880]   to send greeting cards for many years.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.760]   You know, I've been involved with the Postal Department
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.480]   on and off in taking strategy.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:54.400]   The thing called Post-Delition 2020
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.520]   was a conference that we helped put together.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.840]   And we had Vince Surf speak.
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.320]   And we also had the head of the Postal Regulatory Commission,
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.640]   Ruth Goldway, who did a little kind of boxing match
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.320]   over issues with Vince.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.040]   And she was setting up there saying that, really,
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.920]   we should find a way to get kids to get back
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.240]   into greeting cards.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.600]   That would help save the Postal Service.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.600]   [MUMBLING]
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.920]   I said, now that Apple saved the Postal Service,
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.320]   next it'll start a newspaper.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.880]   As long as we're talking, Android,
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.720]   we should mention that there is a big security flaw in HTC,
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.000]   the most recent HTC phones, including the Evo Evo 3D.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.240]   We believe the sensation, a number of others.
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.880]   HTC put some logging software on their phone with an update.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.680]   And it turns out those log files,
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.760]   very extensive log files, are available to anybody.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.240]   Not only that, you can get a privilege escalation very easily.
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.680]   HTC says, we're working on it.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.440]   We're going to fix it.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.240]   There's another security flaw on-- it happens to be just the Galaxy
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.760]   S2 on AT&T, where if you let the phone--
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.480]   if the phone has a lock code, you turn the phone on,
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.320]   you see the lock code, you let it go back to sleep,
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.280]   then turn it on again, no lock code.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.360]   So I'm sure fix that as well.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.680]   We should just be to be fair.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.520]   That's one thing Apple has going for.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.240]   There have not been a lot of security exploits on the iPhone.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.960]   I think there is a legitimate-- let me ask you this,
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.720]   do you think it's a legitimate perception
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.960]   that Android is a little more risky than the iPhone?
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.760]   I do.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:28.680]   I do, actually.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.600]   I mean, I think that it's a legitimate perception
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.080]   to say that it's more secure and less secure.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.040]   Like, by virtue of being open source
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.720]   and having the ability for third parties like HTC
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.120]   to build a layer on top of it, it opens up a little more risk
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.040]   because all the code isn't closed and completely vetted
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:47.880]   by Google.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.080]   So in one way, it's more secure because there are more eyes on it.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.720]   And in other ways, it opens up more risk.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.720]   So I kind of take it like it balances out in the end.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.360]   This security flaw, this HTC security flaw, really bummed me out.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.000]   Because these apps are just asking for permission
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.120]   to connect to the internet.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:04.640]   That's it.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.840]   And they get everything else.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.760]   Right, which basically every app asks for.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.080]   And it's one of the lowest security--
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.920]   I mean, this isn't personal data.
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.720]   And it gets access to this log.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:15.120]   And this log is generated by the HTC layer that
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.240]   goes on top of the Android core.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.840]   So it was a bummer.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.240]   And I think that because of the press that Android security
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.400]   vulnerabilities gets, I think that there is a perception
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.680]   that Android is less secure.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.720]   Similar to the way that Windows seem less secure
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.920]   or sort of malware-laden as compared to the Mac.
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:37.160]   But I don't think that's actually the truth.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.920]   I think that the benefit of open source is more eyes.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.560]   So a little more security as well.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.280]   I mean, given the choice between open and closed source,
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.560]   I will always go open source.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.080]   Even though there's maybe some perceived chance of--
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.480]   And the other problem is I think there's this feeling
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.560]   that because Apple vets everything
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.480]   it's safer, or Amazon vets everything it's safer,
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.600]   you cannot do that good a job of vetting.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.640]   You cannot-- unless you have the source code
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.760]   and you spend a good deal of time with it,
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.560]   you can't say with any assurance
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.680]   that there's not malicious software in there.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.080]   You just have to hope.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:14.760]   Exactly.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.280]   So Apple's not making it more secure
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.880]   by approving all the software.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.520]   That's-- I think that's amiss.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.800]   Yep, I agree.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.000]   I don't think it was an elistron up,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.200]   but Google paid $100,000 to get people to go and reward them
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.640]   for finding bugs.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.280]   And it's clearly economical.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.120]   I mean, that's not even a head count, especially
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.560]   not for them.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.280]   That's a good point.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.600]   That's not even one person.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.920]   You know, not far from it.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.200]   And I think that crowdsourcing that being open
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:42.080]   so you can do it makes a big difference.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:42.800]   Absolutely.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.760]   And as somebody pointed out, as long as they--
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.800]   there is a kill switch on both phones, which there is,
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.680]   that if a malicious app is discovered,
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:55.080]   it can be terminated remotely, which they can and has happened,
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.400]   at least on Android, that's the most important thing.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.400]   Because this stuff does out.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.200]   It's only a day or two before you--
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.680]   people, researchers, or whoever,
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.280]   start seeing strange activity on the phone
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.560]   and say, hey, wait a minute, hold on there.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:09.840]   Right.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:11.520]   This is a huge community with--
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.680]   so these switches are in place.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.280]   And this is a huge community of people watching
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.520]   and using this platform, right?
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.800]   So there are no known apps that are taking advantage
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.560]   of this HEC flaw.
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.400]   But as soon as become one becomes--
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.000]   the flaw is there and it was discovered,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.080]   but no apps are taking advantage of it.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.880]   The moment that an app does start to take advantage of it,
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.520]   it will get killed.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.160]   People are watching now, right?
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.600]   Because people know.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.920]   Let me ask a question.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.640]   Go ahead.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.120]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:35.880]   The kill switch.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.560]   Who has the authority to pull it, the manufacturer or the telco?
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.240]   Well, the Apple's case, Apple.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.240]   OK.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.520]   What about Android's case, I believe, everybody, right?
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.000]   It's the market.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.240]   From what I understand, it's the market.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:49.760]   So Google.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.360]   Yeah, Google.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.080]   Yeah, so Google.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.720]   Which was more comfortable than an Egyptian telco
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.000]   with Mubarak in charge.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.520]   Yes.
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.040]   I think that's really important.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:05.560]   And there have been exploits on both platforms.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.080]   We haven't yet seen anything really horrible.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.360]   It's just a matter of time.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:10.800]   I feel like--
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.320]   Right.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.720]   I mean, Apple had that problem where they were logging location
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.520]   data for a really long amount of time.
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:15.880]   I mean, it's had--
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.200]   Probably for similar reasons as HTC.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.720]   Yep.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.360]   And Apple's had to use the kill switch in the past.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:28.480]   Apple's had to-- had had a login issue with the security code
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.480]   logins.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.680]   So I mean, there's nothing perfect.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.840]   So I think maybe it's a fool's paradise to assume that, oh,
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.240]   my system's safe.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:39.080]   Even BlackBerry, which is famous for its security,
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.440]   is not safe.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.160]   No, no.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.280]   No system is perfectly and absolutely secure.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.600]   This is just a different approach.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.640]   Apple takes a little bit more top-down approach.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.080]   Google takes a more--
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:51.160]   depending on the community, peer-to-peer kind of approach.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.000]   And I think both work to some degree.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.840]   And sometimes there are problems.
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.160]   There are vulnerabilities.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.960]   But the question is, how quickly are they addressed,
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.520]   and how are they addressed, and are the mechanisms in place
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.680]   to address them quickly and fairly?
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.840]   Exactly.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.720]   You're watching this week's Google, Gina Trapani,
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:11.960]   Jeff Jarvis, Leo LaPorte.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.200]   We're going to talk about Motorola.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.440]   There's Motorola in the news.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.640]   But before we do, I'd like to talk about carbonite.com.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.040]   The right way to back up, because it's automatic,
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.080]   and it's off-site.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:21.960]   And you need it.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.880]   And if you're not using it, you better
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.320]   get on over to carbonite.com right now.
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.080]   And sign up for the two-week free trial.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:30.920]   They have two versions, by the way.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.160]   A home version, which allows you to back up everything
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.680]   on your internal drive on single computer.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.560]   And that's for $59, by the way, for less than $5 a month.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.040]   And then there's a business version for people
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.680]   who have multiple computers, multiple drives,
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.800]   and that you pay basically for the amount of data you store.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.560]   You could try them free right now if you go to carbonite.com.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.520]   Automatic backup, completely secure, 128-bit SSL
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.120]   uploading. You control the encryption keys,
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.080]   if you want to encrypt, so it's safe there.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.120]   It is cloud storage.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.960]   So you can log on to your carbonate account on any computer,
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.120]   on your smartphone, on your Android phone, your tablet.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.040]   And there's your stuff.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.360]   You can download it, put it on your system.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.600]   It restores a snap if disaster happens.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.920]   Your data is always protected.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.280]   That's what I'm looking for in a backup solution.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.480]   Try it free for two weeks.
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:24.400]   Go to carbonite.com and use the offer code Twig.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.240]   If you decide to buy, use Twig again,
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.200]   and you'll get two months free, 14 months for the price of 12.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.800]   Carbonite, you got to back it up to get it back.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:36.840]   Please, don't be one of those people who calls me.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:39.720]   I get these calls every week on the radio show.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:44.040]   Leo, my hard drive just crashed, and I don't have a backup.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.560]   What do I do?
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.160]   You know, it's hard not to go, I told you back,
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.760]   get up.
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.120]   Carbonite.com offer code Twig.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.920]   There's no excuse.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.840]   It happens to actually-- this is one that happens a lot.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.880]   It seems to happen with iPhone users more.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.560]   Somebody called me and said, my dog just died.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.480]   I said, oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.920]   He said, well, I have all these pictures of the dog
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.440]   on my iPhone.
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.840]   And the iPhone died, too.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.320]   I said, oh, I'm sorry, but you were sinking regularly, right?
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.760]   He said, no.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.960]   See, you don't have a backup of what's on your iPhone?
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.440]   No, it's all on the iPhone.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.600]   And I felt so terrible.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.160]   Yeah, that's sad.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.760]   And that-- I mean, Apple's smart.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.200]   When you plug in the iPhone, it backs it up immediately.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.160]   There's nothing comparable on the--
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:27.840]   Yes.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.200]   When I'm in a rush, iPhone starts up,
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   and it takes forever.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.760]   And I told all the time you say no.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:35.260]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.280]   But you don't do it every time.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.360]   No, no.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.200]   I'm a very impatient man, Leo.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.280]   I'm very busy.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.320]   I have places to go people to see.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.360]   I can't wait around for this.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.280]   Well, with iCloud, you won't have to wait.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.520]   Don't get to tell me I told you so very soon.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:55.240]   Hey, what do you use?
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:00.120]   I use titanium on the Android, but I have to root it.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.920]   And the nice thing about titanium backup,
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.320]   and highly recommended if you haven't used it,
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.800]   if you have a rooted Android phone,
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.520]   is it only back up, backs up all your apps.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.680]   It backs up all your settings.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.160]   So when you do a titanium restore,
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.840]   it says, say you have to refresh the phone
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.120]   or put a new ROM on it, it all comes back.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.440]   And all the passwords are still there, all the settings.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.280]   Isn't that great?
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.520]   I love it.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:25.080]   Titanium backup.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.600]   Did we lose Gina?
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.920]   Did she rush off to download it?
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.120]   She froze.
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.120]   She ran off to install it.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.600]   I was trying to elegantly recall her, but--
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.880]   But you did to be earlier, Eileen.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.120]   I appreciate the elegance of that.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:35.640]   Wow.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.160]   All this is happening behind the scenes.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:37.960]   It's blowing my mind.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.600]   I was suddenly off the air, then I was back on in an instant.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.760]   I said, wow, Eileen, it's so smooth.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.280]   She's good.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.320]   You have to be like an octopus at that TD.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.520]   She's very good at it.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.120]   There we go.
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.040]   Hi, Gina.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.960]   Sorry, Skype, beach balled on me.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:51.840]   OK.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.160]   You must be using a Mac.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.600]   Hi, yeah.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.680]   Pinwheel, beach ball.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.360]   I can't believe I had that.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.800]   I mean, the blue screener there is a beach ball death.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.240]   Hey, at least it's happier.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.760]   Right.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.520]   So--
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.280]   There's an effect on--
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.960]   It hypnotizes you.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.920]   I'm hypnotized.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.640]   Motor-ru-gle.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.360]   Google has said-- and this is Eric Schmidt talking in an interview
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.880]   on Bloomberg TV--
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:22.320]   that they are going to make handsets with Motorola
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:24.520]   if the acquisition goes through.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.720]   But that other manufacturers should have nothing to fear.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:29.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.600]   Oh, I'm sure that'll reassure them.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.320]   The Android ecosystem says Eric Schmidt is the number one
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.200]   priority, and we won't do anything with Motorola
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.880]   or anybody else, by the way, that would screw up
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.120]   the dynamics of that industry.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.000]   Well, that makes sense.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.280]   We need strong, hard competition among all the Android players.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.720]   We will not play favorites.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.520]   Well, wait a minute now.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.960]   Eric is so good at this.
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.640]   OK, listen carefully.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:58.240]   We will not play favorites in the way people are concerned
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.000]   about.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:02.640]   Right.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.560]   What?
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.600]   However in ways you never thought of--
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.320]   We'll figure out.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.760]   So hey.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:08.960]   Well, here's an example.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.960]   One of the ways Google plays favorites
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.880]   is hidden API calls, right?
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.840]   We know they're hidden API calls that are not published.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.360]   They're not public.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.440]   But Google uses them.
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.640]   So that's playing favorites.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.960]   But people aren't concerned about it because they don't know it.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.680]   Well, you play fast forward.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.960]   You're going to get--
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.280]   presumably it goes through with all that.
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.880]   And everything's well, that big deal.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:31.320]   Play fast forward five years the next time Eric Schmidt's
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.400]   sitting before he sent it again.
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.280]   Right.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.720]   We didn't play favorites in the way you're concerned about.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.120]   He says, from our perspective on the patent issue,
[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.040]   we will end up having enough patents
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:45.200]   that we can end up with a rough truce with everybody else.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.720]   This is huge, which is how it's done.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.040]   That's been the pattern in all other industries.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.400]   I expect something similar in ours.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.840]   We're actually very happy with Motorola.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.160]   The fact they also had one of the best patent portfolios
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.680]   was certainly a component of our decision,
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.960]   but not the only one.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:06.600]   So he's basically saying we bought them for the handsets too.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.320]   I just wish that he would have said,
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.440]   we bought them for a defensive patent portfolio.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.080]   Our priority is protecting Android and the port--
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.000]   the patents had everything to do with that.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.120]   And oh, yeah, sure.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.640]   We'll have a little subsidiary that makes handsets too.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.760]   I wish he'd said that too, but he's being honest.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.440]   That's Eric's flaw, isn't it?
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:26.240]   You think that's it?
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.560]   I think Eric's-- when Eric talks,
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.960]   I don't think he's not as adept as one would hope
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.000]   or as one would expect for a chairman of the board
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.720]   at spinning.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.760]   Is he?
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.360]   He's not a good spinner.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.920]   Yeah, yes and no.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:49.520]   I think the problem is that he presumes the world is too smart.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:51.120]   He cuts ahead on things.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:51.640]   I get it.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.720]   I actually think he's not a bad spinner.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:00.040]   Yeah, he has his, you know, Schmittarian quotes
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.000]   that amuse us all.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.760]   And he, as he said to me, is death by Twitter.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:05.720]   Yeah, that's an issue.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.520]   But I think that in a way he does--
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:12.680]   you know, he has a way-- it's rather a professorial.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.240]   When people say, it's Google too big,
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.560]   and he says, well, who would you want to run it?
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.760]   Us or the government, right?
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.240]   It's very socratic method.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.880]   He doesn't just come out with a line.
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.480]   He tries to push you into your own logic.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.240]   That's where I guess I'm premised there.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.160]   That makes actually-- that's great.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.280]   I think that's a little googly, right?
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.160]   I think Google.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.440]   Very much so.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.440]   And I like that about Google.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.440]   Everything is a puzzle.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:38.320]   Yeah, but I guess I'm an intellectual too.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.280]   So I kind of like that.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.960]   I hate the-- I hate spin.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.920]   I don't want to be spun.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.400]   And I love the socratic method.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.840]   Make me think, Eric.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.800]   Make me think.
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:55.040]   What is PhoneGap, Gina Trappani?
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.000]   PhoneGap is a wrapper for mobile operating systems
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.560]   to run HTML5 web-based apps as native apps, basically.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.600]   So it lets you build an HTML5 JavaScript CSS app
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:10.200]   and then bundle it up with PhoneGap.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.440]   And then suddenly you've got an app
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.040]   that you can deliver through the Android market,
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:15.600]   install natively on Android, and on iPhone.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.040]   And I believe probably other mobile operating systems,
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.720]   maybe even Windows and Blackberry, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.080]   So it's a really good way.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.320]   It's a kind of right-wants-get-a-native app
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.720]   on any mobile OS.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.080]   And it works with Dreamweaver.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.960]   So this kind of makes sense because Dreamweaver
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.960]   is an Adobe product.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.840]   Adobe just bought them.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.240]   Yes, smart move, smart move.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:41.800]   Gina, question, if self-serving question.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.080]   If we were to teach journalists who
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:45.800]   want to stay around longer, certain technologies,
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.360]   and one that would allow them to do essential development,
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.680]   probably knowing they're the content business,
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.800]   what do we teach them?
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.640]   HTML5, Java.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:56.200]   Oh, God.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.720]   I would hope you wouldn't have to be a developer
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.200]   if you're going to be a journalist.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.840]   I agree, but there's a push on that.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:03.560]   There are people who want to create Frankenstein monsters
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.760]   and that that's what we need.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.560]   I've fought it hard.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.680]   I've said, no, no, no, no, no, you're the boss.
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.080]   You're the one who specs and you get somebody to do it for you.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.680]   But it's so hard to find development talent now.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.400]   And there's a push on some people.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.680]   I think if you're a journalist--
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.200]   Look at this.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.240]   Look at-- I'll give you a strong argument.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.000]   Look at TechCrunch.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.720]   It runs on WordPress.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.240]   I think if you're a journalist,
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.600]   folks stick to your knitting.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.840]   Focus on what you do, which is journalism.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.240]   There's a content management-- a canned content management
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.040]   system out there that you can use.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.960]   There's Drupal-- I mean, maybe.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.680]   I don't know, Gina.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.640]   I won't speak with Gina.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.720]   She's an actual developer.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.800]   But I just think that's a lot to say, oh, learn HTML5.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.240]   I think if anything, find a content management system
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.080]   you like and can work with.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.880]   But I don't think you need to learn HTML5.
[00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.640]   Gina, am I wrong?
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.920]   Yeah, I see your point.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.360]   I mean, my answer is absolutely going
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.760]   to be learn web technologies.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.560]   Don't learn a system OS-specific technologies.
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.520]   So I would have said HTML5 and JavaScript.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.000]   But then again, I mean, it depends.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.040]   What are you trying to teach your students?
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:07.200]   I mean, are you-- you're trying to teach them to innovate,
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.280]   to come up with new ways to present content
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.720]   and new ways to interact with content.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.240]   Right, and it's not always content, by the way.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.320]   It can be services.
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.560]   It can be things that work with people.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.120]   And what I really have to learn about to teach them
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.000]   is how to prototype.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.680]   Right, exactly.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:23.160]   You want to teach them how to spec and prototype
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.840]   and how to work with developers to make those things happen.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.240]   But I agree with Leeu.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.240]   And I think it's probably unrealistic to ask journalists
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.240]   to both create content and then create the tools that
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:33.280]   deliver that content.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.640]   I think data visualization is really important and huge.
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:37.280]   Really important.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.600]   So I think journalists, young, upcoming journalists,
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.400]   and bloggers should know the Google Charts API really well
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.080]   and be able to create charts based on data sets that
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:46.840]   are freely available.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.480]   In fact, we have a story about some smartphone data
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.760]   that we'll get to at some point.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:53.960]   So I think that kind of thing is super important.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.200]   But yeah, I think you're right.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.520]   Rather prototyping and then communicating
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.480]   with development teams.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.240]   Hey, I worked at Gawker for years.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.960]   We had an in-house tech team that wound up
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.320]   building out our own CMS.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.040]   Because we were trying to innovate in this space.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.840]   I mean, WordPress is great, but I
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.880]   know that TechCrunch and Gigahome,
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.880]   that they have custom plugins built for that stuff too.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.440]   So if you're just looking to publish content,
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.320]   yeah, an available CMS right off the shelf,
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.200]   totally going to work.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.120]   But if you want to teach your students to innovate
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.680]   and come up with new ways to deal with that content
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:25.360]   or deal with services, then yeah,
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.320]   I think it's about rapid prototyping
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.480]   and communicating with developers
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.320]   to create those things with something.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.680]   I think Kevin Marks also says in the chat room,
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:36.440]   and he's right, the other thing that we have the challenge
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.160]   to teach, I didn't mean to go off on this event,
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.000]   but as data journalism.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:40.840]   That's what I think.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.160]   Yes.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.200]   And really understanding that.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.560]   I think you have a limited scope.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.720]   I mean, you can only learn so much, right?
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.080]   So your primary thing is to become a good journalist.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.560]   But in learning to be a good journalist in the modern era,
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:53.760]   you also have to learn things like how to dig through data,
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.680]   how to use data, how to visualize data.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.080]   I don't think you should worry so much about how to present
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.640]   what you're doing or how to create a platform
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:02.360]   for what you're doing.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.520]   I would hope that there'd be people who specialize in that
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.920]   that you could work with.
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.280]   Right?
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.720]   I mean, there's only--
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.080]   I partly also say that from my own experience,
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.720]   because what we look for, what I'm always looking for
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.280]   is a person who can be a journalist and understand
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:16.880]   technology.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.360]   And that's far and few between.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.840]   It's weird that we have students who are constantly
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.000]   pressuring us to teach them more technology.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.920]   And so I'm trying to unfreeze myself and figure out
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.040]   what that might be.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:37.040]   You see me right now in contemplative Jeff Jones.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.240]   I'm thinking very hard and can talk at the same time.
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.200]   It's really quite a skill.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:45.360]   Now I'm frozen.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.280]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.560]   Yeah, I mean, boy, it's a--
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.080]   who knows?
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.520]   It's a whole brave new world for not just journalists,
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.640]   but for any kid going to college right now.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.840]   And so I don't think it hurts to know technology,
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.760]   but not everybody's going to have a--
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.800]   Well, that's kind of where Jake is.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.720]   Jake is thinking now not of majoring in computer science,
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.200]   because he kind of thinks, well, I kind of know enough
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.520]   to make some stuff and branch out.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.920]   And he's taking Pauli's eye and--
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:12.920]   Good on him.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.440]   --and--
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:15.240]   I mean, my son's interested in music.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.160]   And of course, what is he learning electronic music?
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:21.800]   So technology might be the canvas for a lot of stuff
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   that you do.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.600]   But I do also think there's some people who just don't take
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.280]   to technology.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.520]   And I'd hate to think that those people
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.520]   won't have a place in the future.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:31.440]   True.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.880]   That's scary.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.120]   Ah, to have--
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.200]   There's got to be a Picasso out there who just
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.960]   come on to put paint on canvas, right?
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.640]   He'd be using an iPad like you don't know it.
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.400]   Actually, I wonder.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.440]   That's really interesting.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.440]   But what would he be using Photoshop
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:47.760]   to mangle ears and clocks and things?
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.160]   I don't think so, but I would be my best guess,
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.280]   but I don't know.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.760]   I think that he was very tactile.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.880]   Ah, true.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.320]   I don't know.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:57.160]   That's a good question.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:01.000]   A lot of artists that I know are working with their hands.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.320]   And this is not working with your hands, whatever it is.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:07.000]   It's working with your noggin, maybe.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.760]   Would Picasso use a whack-um?
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.960]   We'll have to ask.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.520]   You know who wrote the book on Picasso's eye on a Stostnapulis
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.040]   oftenton?
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.760]   She could tell us.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.200]   Really?
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.480]   Yeah, she wrote a very big bio, not a very good one,
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.440]   but a very big bio of Picasso.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:23.200]   That's when I met her.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:24.720]   I met her.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.200]   Really?
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.960]   Before she was a Huffington.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:27.400]   Wow.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.360]   She was a Stostnapulis.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:33.200]   Sometimes--
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:33.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:34.960]   That took us way off.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:35.440]   Sometimes not.
[00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.320]   It's just not good to know stuff.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.080]   Gingerbread has a growth spurt.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:47.000]   38.2% of all devices now are running gingerbread.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.440]   This is actually very good news.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:51.520]   You still see Android 2.1.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.880]   You still see a little sliver of 1.5 and 1.6.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:59.240]   But now I would say almost 75% of all phones
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.480]   are running at least Frojo.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.160]   45% Frojo.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:07.640]   38.2% gingerbread.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.720]   And honeycomb total of less than 2%.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:13.520]   Oh, the gingerbread man has hit puberty.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:14.280]   Yes.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.240]   He's had a growth spurt.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:20.160]   Voice is changing, killer for fuzz on the chin.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:25.160]   And then just as soon as he gets comfortable with his new hair,
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.120]   ice cream sandwich comes along.
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.240]   Mashed by the sandwich.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:29.240]   Smushed.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:30.440]   Smushed.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.000]   Got smushed by the sandwich.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.720]   No, but this is a big problem.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.000]   I have to say, and this is one thing that Apple just
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.960]   doesn't have to worry about is these--
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:46.360]   How many versions-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 versions
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.640]   of Android out there?
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.640]   At least.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.440]   It's a lot of versions.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.280]   And it's a pain in the rear for developers
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.200]   to make sure that your app is compatible across all of those.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.760]   Let's put it this way more.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:58.440]   More phones have cupcake and donut on them
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:00.160]   than have honeycomb on them.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:00.920]   Oh.
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:02.320]   Mm.
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.480]   That's terrible.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.000]   Sorry.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   And people with cupcake and donut can't do nothing.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.120]   No.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.920]   He Claire is 11%.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.160]   That's Android 2.1.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:18.280]   That's just-- that's a problem.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.240]   And I kind of blame the answer to manufacturers.
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.720]   I think that's exactly why Google bought Motorola
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.360]   is to say, look, dudes, you can't--
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:27.840]   I don't know.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.120]   Maybe they don't have enough horsepower.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:29.680]   I don't know.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.080]   Leo, is that really their fault or is it
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:32.840]   in the architecture?
[00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.960]   They don't have a choice.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:39.000]   It's an open hand-set alliance, baby.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.440]   Well, it's going to be an 18-month turnaround, right?
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:43.160]   From here on in, basically, they said--
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:44.240]   That's what they say, yeah.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:46.560]   That if you're going to have the Google logo on your handset,
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.840]   you've got to update over 18 months.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:49.120]   So that's reasonable.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.640]   And I actually think that that's an interesting point
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.680]   that you made, Leo, is that Motorola always
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.880]   has the latest update to Android.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.080]   That's a little bit of a motivation for everyone else
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:58.360]   to catch up sooner.
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:00.160]   And that's-- OK, that's-- I think that's
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.400]   where Eric's Weasel words come from--
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.680]   is, well, we may do things that you wouldn't conceive of.
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:08.880]   One would be, just make sure that Motorola handsets
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:11.400]   always have the latest version of Android on them.
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:12.920]   Right.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.560]   Which just means you've got to do it, too,
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:16.240]   or you're going to be lost.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.040]   And that is kind of anti-competitive,
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.400]   but it's really not.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.760]   It's just pushing people.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.840]   Not as long as-- no, it's not as long as everybody else
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:23.440]   can do it.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.640]   They could do it, exactly.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.800]   Right.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:30.040]   So one thing that the iPhone 4s did not have, no surprise,
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.960]   NFC.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.400]   Google Wallet is--
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:41.680]   According to PayPal, of course, PayPal might have a little
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.680]   ox to fry in this.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.120]   They filed a lawsuit against Google,
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.600]   and two former PayPal executives
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.120]   were in charge of mobile payments at Google,
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.560]   saying misappropriation of trade secrets, breach
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.720]   of fiduciary duty.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:46:00.080]   Those allegations were thrown out.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.120]   But it does tell you that PayPal is kind of a little nervous,
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.200]   I guess, about Google Wallet.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.080]   I don't think they need to worry so much.
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:10.800]   It's going to be a while before NFC takes off.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.920]   There's only one Google phone on one carrier that supports it.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.360]   Should Google buy-- should somebody who should buy square?
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:19.280]   Ah.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.200]   Ah.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:20.800]   Well, Square's--
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:21.200]   Good question.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:22.600]   --you know, and this is another company that says,
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.160]   forget NFC, Square's better.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.680]   But then what they have instead, though,
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.880]   is taking through the infrastructure of being
[00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.360]   a merchant and exchange and things like that.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:33.000]   Right.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.600]   They're building an infrastructure that could conceivably.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.160]   Exactly.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.480]   Whatever the hardware doesn't matter, then.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:44.360]   By the article on Business Insider says
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.880]   that strippers are now using Square.
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:53.080]   Well, there was a great column today.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:56.760]   I think it was-- oh, god, it was a Politico.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.560]   Female reporter went to a strip bar in Washington
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.800]   to look at what the implications of the end of the dollar
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.640]   bill and the--
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.080]   Oh, my god.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.080]   --of the creation court.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:06.040]   Oh, my god.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.040]   Did they have Square down there?
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.880]   Well, the problem is that how do you
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.080]   put Square in a garter belt?
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:15.920]   It's easy to swipe.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:18.760]   The guy at the strip club said that he's
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.920]   collected millions of single dollar bills over the years.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:22.880]   That's how it's been there.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:23.380]   Yeah.
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.360]   You don't want to know where those bills have been either.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.320]   Wow.
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:32.560]   Kindle pre-orders according to a leaked report
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:39.040]   were very strong, 95,000 in the first day.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:42.720]   Amazon, according to this sales report that was leaked
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.760]   to Cultivandroid, has sold a quarter of a--
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:52.360]   or pre-ordered, a quarter of a million fires in five days.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.800]   That's pretty good.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.880]   Pretty good.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.240]   Pretty good.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.080]   Not surprising.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:48:00.400]   Not iPad 2 sales pace.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:05.120]   iPad 2 sold 2.5 million in the first month.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:05.960]   So--
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:08.960]   This is the first month since it was available right now.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:09.680]   It's close, though.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.120]   It'd be $1 and 1/2 million in a month.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.200]   So that's pretty close.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:12.760]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.600]   Well, you don't have the cult thing.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.760]   It reminds me of the--
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.960]   I was thinking about this today.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.320]   Just a slight diversion.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:19.640]   Yes.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.480]   No, divert away because I'm bored.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.280]   I--
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.920]   That's not a good sign.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:25.840]   Uh-oh.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:27.040]   We better start with up, Jeff.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:27.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.120]   And if I'm bored, I could tell you the audience is bored.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.200]   You don't want me to spice it up.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:35.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.480]   I'm at the creepy line all the time.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.360]   I live on the creepy line.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.280]   He lives on the creepy line.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:40.920]   Where was I going?
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:42.560]   Oh.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.960]   It occurred to me that I couldn't ever
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.000]   imagine this week at Amazon.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:46.680]   No.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.120]   Although.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:47.920]   Right?
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.240]   And Amazon's an important company.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.960]   They're doing a lot of amazing things.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:55.800]   But what is it about the brand and--
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   um--
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:02.160]   position of Amazon that just obviates that?
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:05.080]   They just don't have enough interesting, like consumer--
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.320]   product interesting consumers to talk about.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.160]   Although I think probably developers, engineers,
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.520]   would be interested in a lot of the services.
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:16.760]   Yeah, you could talk about three EC2, kind of
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.520]   infrastructure-y enterprise.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.960]   You could do an Amazon deal of the day show.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:21.960]   Or--
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.480]   Right.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:24.200]   In a sense, Gina, they talk to consumers.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:29.840]   As consumers, more than Facebook or Google or Android.
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:30.360]   Pardon me.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.360]   I mean, right?
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.720]   I mean, I'm not pushing for it.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.040]   I don't think it would work either.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:38.040]   But it's weird that Amazon never saw itself in that position
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:40.720]   of having a direct relationship, I think,
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:46.080]   with having a bond of brand with its people.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:47.480]   Right.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.360]   It's basically-- Amazon is a shopping tool.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:50.880]   It's a cash register, essentially.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.040]   I mean, the Kindle is just going
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.040]   to be another thing that they sell on the site.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:56.320]   And I have to say, I think that the sales are going to go
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.000]   a lot higher once it is available.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   Well, maybe that's not true.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.920]   Because it's on the front page of Amazon.com now.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.400]   But just the power of being--
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.240]   of the promotion throughout the Amazon.com site
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.320]   is so powerful.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.480]   Because people go to Amazon to shop and spend money.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.440]   And when I did, I-- you know, sure.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:12.560]   I mean, the other reason it didn't sell huge--
[00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:13.800]   I mean, it's sold huge, but it's not
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.720]   going to have that same kind of sale as the iPad, obviously,
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.440]   is it is the opposite of an early adopters device.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.640]   Interesting.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.440]   So you're at my side from you, Leo.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.800]   Anyone who has an iPad, I don't see any reason to buy.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.560]   And I won't want one, too, because it's a toy.
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:27.920]   No, you don't need both.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:29.400]   I don't see any reason to buy a fire.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:30.120]   You don't need both.
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.160]   I think that the-- and I actually said
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:34.520]   that I don't think it's going to hurt the iPad too badly.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:38.520]   But I do think there's a fraction of the potential new iPad
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.840]   owners who will buy a Kindle Fire instead.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:42.960]   Yeah, I agree with all that.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.440]   But don't say you're not going to have a rush.
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.160]   It's not going to be this--
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.240]   No, I agree.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:47.920]   I agree.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:49.560]   I think that-- in fact, it probably
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:53.800]   doesn't hurt iPad until the next iPad's out.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.520]   Right.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:56.440]   I mean, I would say everybody wants an iPad.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.160]   It's probably a bought one.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.840]   Do you think there's going to be a 7-inch iPad?
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:02.040]   No.
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:02.560]   But there might be--
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.520]   Steve's legacy will live on.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.000]   Yes.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.520]   But there might be a 10-inch fire.
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:09.200]   Yes.
[00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:09.700]   Yes.
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.280]   Yeah, they made the Kindle DX, which
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.520]   was such a specialty device.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.320]   It didn't do that well, because people
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.720]   didn't want a big clunky thing.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:18.520]   In fact, you might make the case that the fire is too big
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:19.880]   and heavy as is.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.680]   The backlit color heavy.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.000]   It's not a good reader compared to the Kindle.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.280]   Here's another question for you.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.680]   So I screw sandwich comes out.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:30.520]   And let's say it does have lots of-- whoa, e-things.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:33.040]   But you're not going to get it on the fire.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:33.320]   Ever.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:33.800]   You won't.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:34.720]   That's right.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:35.880]   Because it's not Android.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:36.880]   It just--
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:37.360]   Right.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:37.560]   Right.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:38.520]   They never said Android.
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:41.000]   They never said Google.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.840]   By the way, I've just learned Android now
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.720]   has an app for printing postcards.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:49.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.720]   I think I won.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.000]   I think I won.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.160]   But even in this Apple's stole, postcard on the run.
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:01.320]   Design and mail real postcards from your Android device.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.960]   There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.200]   One of many.
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:07.440]   It's one of many.
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:09.640]   I have one family member, a cousin in New York,
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.120]   who is not online at all.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:15.840]   And what I would want from iOS is just to automatically
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:19.000]   prompt me for a photo to send her a card through that app
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.320]   once a year for her birthday.
[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:21.240]   Isn't that a good idea?
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.640]   That's what it should do.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.140]   Yeah.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.360]   For that one person who you actually still send a send card--
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.840]   I mean, does everybody have one-- do you guys send cards?
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.160]   Twit sends--
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.640]   Twit sends Christmas cards.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.440]   Yes, it does.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.840]   But I wouldn't do it for my iPhone.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:34.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:35.720]   It's a long list.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:38.440]   It would take a little while.
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:39.360]   No, I think I'm--
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.960]   No, I'm not going to send cards.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.080]   That was the year maybe my mother would I send a card
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.520]   to my mom happy birthday mom?
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.280]   No.
[00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.120]   I don't do cards.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.320]   My in-laws do them.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.640]   But there are always those flowery ones.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:57.720]   My mom even, who is 77, actually she'll be 79 next January.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.720]   My mom--
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.080]   She just skipped the earlating.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.240]   How'd she do that?
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.480]   Well, she was born in '33.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.560]   I'm doing the math.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.240]   She's 77.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:06.480]   No, I thought she was 77.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.440]   She's actually 79.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.280]   Oh, I should be 79.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.160]   OK.
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:10.240]   She sends e-greetings.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:12.160]   She hasn't sent-- well, maybe she
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.680]   sends to my kids' physical cards.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.880]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.000]   It's physical cards?
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.640]   Grandmothers to grandkids.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.000]   And they put a dollar bill in there.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.680]   And that's the only people.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.280]   And they can't do that with an iPhone.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:25.800]   It's true.
[00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.560]   So that's--
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:27.040]   PayPal.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:27.560]   PayPal.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:28.600]   They can put PayPal in there.
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:32.080]   You know what I said, Mom, for her birthday?
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:35.120]   I sent her an electronic greeting from Netflix
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.800]   that says, happy birthday.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.080]   Here's another year of Netflix.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:42.520]   And Mom used the code to get a freebie of a month at Netflix.
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.120]   Yep.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:46.000]   And frankly, that's the card.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.760]   But no, it's not made up.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.160]   It's true.
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:51.360]   I started this when Netflix was just DVDs.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.760]   I started this when maybe five, six years ago.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.000]   She did not have a DVD player.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.680]   So for that birthday--
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.240]   I think for that Christmas-- because her birthday's
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.120]   January 2.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:01.280]   So for that Christmas, I sent her a TV
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:03.280]   that had a built-in DVD player.
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.160]   And then I got her.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.920]   On January 2, I sent her a year as an Netflix.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.280]   I have to say, last year, she said,
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.040]   honey, because Netflix raised their price,
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.280]   it's only going to go for nine months.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.200]   But you know what?
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.680]   I don't want the discs anymore.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:18.520]   I'm just going to do the streaming.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.520]   And now it's like 18 months.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.400]   So it's only $7.99 a month.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.120]   It's actually-- it's a really cheap present for my mom.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:27.360]   And it gives and gives and gives,
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.880]   because she watches movies like crazy.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.480]   Netflix is fantastic.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:32.480]   Great movies.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:33.680]   I missed "Elegie" last year.
[00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:36.480]   The Philip Roth novel that Ben Kingsley and the Penelope
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.160]   Cruz-- very good movie.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:38.920]   Really enjoyed that.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.680]   Was watching that last night.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:41.720]   Swingers.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:42.560]   That's a great point.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:43.480]   It's had a classic movie.
[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.760]   Whoa, what happened?
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.280]   I opened a new tab.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.720]   See, there's Netflix App and Chrome, which I really like.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.760]   You can also watch Netflix.
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.920]   Of course, besides watching it on your computer, on your iPad,
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:56.080]   your Android phone, all the Android phones now,
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:59.000]   they basically rolled it out to everybody, all the tablets.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.720]   I think except for those that have cupcake or--
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.960]   Yeah, if you're running a claire,
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.080]   sorry, you're out of luck.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.360]   Get a new phone.
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:06.960]   It's worth it for this, for this.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:09.160]   Good wheel hunting, the office.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:12.960]   Oh, see, and you see 30 Rockin' Office, new episodes.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.680]   And this is all instant and unlimited and just $7.99 a month.
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.520]   And when I say it that way, you're probably
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:21.120]   thinking $799 a month because it's worth that much.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:25.320]   But no, $7.99 a month for Netflix.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:27.120]   If you're already a Netflix member, just check it out.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.520]   If you're not, try it out for a month free,
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.200]   Netflix.com/twit.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:33.800]   And do share this with your friends and family.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.680]   Make sure they use the--
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.280]   Oh, some new Woody Allen movies just coming in.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:41.720]   Netflix.com/twit.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:45.160]   Give it a try today.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:49.000]   You know, I think with this new Galaxy S2,
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.600]   the big 4 1/2 inch screen, I bet
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:53.600]   you Netflix would look pretty good on there.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.120]   Pretty good.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:57.120]   The camera is great on that phone.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:57.840]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.200]   You love that camera on the phone?
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:04.440]   Oh, I was just saying, I've watched Netflix videos on my phone
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.320]   and it looks great.
[00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:06.680]   It's just gorgeous.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:10.440]   Yeah, it's that super AMOLED screen.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:11.760]   It's not all resolution apples.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.000]   Sometimes it's just deep, rich color.
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.240]   Hashtags on Google+?
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.520]   Did you see that?
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.640]   I thought about Jeff.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.480]   Yeah, I'm very happy.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.520]   I always remind myself, just a specialized form of search.
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.400]   And in fact, Jeff, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.040]   but the hashtag there doesn't--
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.400]   it doesn't turn into a link if you put a hashtag on your post,
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:29.760]   doesn't it?
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:30.240]   No.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.120]   And yeah, I mean--
[00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:32.240]   That's kind of weird.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.520]   It needs to go a little bit farther.
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.280]   But I think it's so important to do.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:39.400]   I wrote a piece this week that the Occupy Wall Street
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:42.200]   is the first hashtag revolt.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:43.200]   Right, man.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:44.280]   People gathered around.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.120]   People were frustrated because it doesn't have clear demands
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.800]   and a clear spin.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.160]   But that's the point of it.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.360]   No one owns it.
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.800]   So first really distributed revolt.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:59.000]   So what you do is you type #OccupyWallStreet in your search
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.480]   and then you get all of the--
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.160]   Wall Street spelled out, I hope.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.720]   Oh, golly, let me do that right.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:05.920]   Actually, both worked.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.280]   So both work at no WS works too, which is--
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:12.080]   Yeah, Google's doing something interesting with this.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.200]   They're obviously parsing it a little bit.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.840]   And of course, you can save the search
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.760]   and then start to follow that search.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.040]   Oh, I like that.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.600]   Yeah, well, up on the top it'll let you save it.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:21.800]   Save.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.560]   So it becomes a spark.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:26.280]   And now spark is a mix of news and conversation.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:27.760]   Right.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:28.960]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:29.880]   So what's always--
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:31.200]   I don't understand anything.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.320]   Yeah, how is this different?
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.680]   Or is this just regular search?
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.800]   Is this just people using hashtags and then Google--
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:36.800]   People using hashtags.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.840]   Pretty much it.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.720]   So it is in a feature that's been added.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:40.480]   But yeah, not really.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:41.120]   OK.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:41.640]   Interesting.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:44.160]   So Twitter's culture is coming over to Google+.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.360]   Very interesting.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:49.360]   I like it that Google, instead of using @usedplus,
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:53.920]   it's like when Google first came around,
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:54.960]   we actually used this--
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:58.240]   Jesse Dvorak would use this as a way to test somebody's tech
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.000]   savvy.
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.160]   He'd say, what do you use to search?
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:03.520]   And if they said altevistig, and if they said Google,
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.840]   you go, oh.
[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.600]   And it's like, yeah, what's your email address?
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.640]   al.com or gmail.com?
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.640]   You know, it's like that.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:13.680]   Well, hey, what's your handle?
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:15.600]   Plus, Gina Trapani?
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:16.480]   Or @.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:18.680]   @china trapani?
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:21.480]   Oh, I still love Twitter, though.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:24.480]   And the @ really goes back to IRC, right?
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:27.000]   Yeah, or email itself, right?
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:27.760]   Email itself.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:33.160]   The space in Google+ to express your handle
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:37.040]   on the outside world, because there's a space in it.
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:37.540]   Yes.
[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:38.760]   Which is a little weird.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.260]   Right.
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.120]   I'm glad they have a space.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.360]   The space is great.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.320]   But it's not how we killed spaces.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.920]   This is-- I almost don't even want to report the story,
[00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:48.800]   but I will from CNET.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:52.200]   Google, Managements, Public Use of Google+,
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.240]   no posts ever.
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:59.880]   All of the yellow people here, red, no account at all,
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:04.120]   active green, minimal use blue.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.800]   This is a good looking chart.
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.400]   And I love how they use the Google colors.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:13.680]   So Vic Gundotra, of course, has published 150 times.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.240]   Sundar Pichai of Chrome, 58 times.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.280]   Those are the top two.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:18.600]   But then there's all sorts of people,
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.400]   including Eric Schmidt.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.120]   Never.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.680]   Never, as opposed to it.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:24.880]   He doesn't even have an account on Google+.
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:28.640]   As far as we know, Larry Page has posted seven times.
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:33.760]   Andy Rubin, eight times, Sergey Brin, 15 times.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:36.000]   Don't you think they should be forced to eat their own dog
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.280]   food?
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.240]   Or no.
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.480]   Who forces them?
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:40.960]   They're the bosses.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.560]   Oh, good point.
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.280]   No one forces them.
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.720]   You know, it's an interesting reflection.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.320]   I think that this just kind of proves
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.280]   that social is not in Google's original DNA
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.160]   and in the DNA of upper management.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.600]   It sounded like this--
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.320]   I think that the Pushtourd Social came from the bottom.
[00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.840]   And actually, the story behind it is that there was this big meeting
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.840]   where people got together in little groups
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.560]   and brainstormed.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.840]   And this one engineer, kind of low level engineer,
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.680]   kind of had this huge rant about Facebook
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.440]   and social and how important it was.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.400]   And then I think Vic heard that and asked the engineer
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.840]   to stand up and tell the whole room.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.760]   So I think it kind of came from the bottom.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.200]   And I think the fact that the executives
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:21.520]   don't use Google+ with the exception of Vic and Bradley
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.800]   is kind of reflective of that.
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:24.800]   Also, they're busy.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:27.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.440]   Well, here's the other thing.
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.960]   If you don't have anything to do,
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.160]   there have something to do.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.000]   We're just sitting around.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.240]   Here's the problem for them.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.200]   Lawyers would probably have to read what they wrote.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:38.840]   Right.
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:41.320]   Life is kind of different, I think, when you're at that level
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:41.880]   of the company.
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.280]   I know, that's sad.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.040]   But it is sad.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:44.560]   It's true.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.280]   But then again, then again, if you're the Mark Benioff
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:50.120]   kind of in the world or people like that,
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.080]   then you just say what you think.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:52.520]   Right.
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:55.440]   And if Google were a little more human in that way,
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.280]   it wouldn't be bad.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.080]   Just see that Larry Ellison fired Mark Benioff
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.520]   from the keynote today.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.960]   And then Benioff did the keynote across the street.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.200]   Hit the hotel.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:04.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.240]   And by the way, thank you, Mark.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:06.760]   Plugged--
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:07.960]   Oh, Google.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.200]   I mean, plugged public part.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:09.920]   Did he really?
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.040]   At his talk?
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.480]   Awesome.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.640]   Sounds like that.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:17.800]   At the same time today, we had Mark Zuckerberg insisting,
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.600]   I use Facebook all day.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.160]   Oh, that was a story that was out there.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.800]   I believe he does.
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:24.720]   Why wouldn't he?
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:25.520]   He says--
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:28.080]   He posts public posts his profile?
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:28.440]   He does.
[01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.280]   Now you can follow him.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:29.760]   Yeah, you can subscribe.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.760]   I subscribed to him.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.040]   He posted the other day.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:35.840]   I just celebrated my 10,000th day alive.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.520]   So I looked up.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:40.400]   And I've had 20,000 and 30 days alive.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.400]   I missed my 20,000th day alive.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.880]   With September 1st.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:50.200]   Did you regain your time lost when you left Facebook?
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.400]   Time lost.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.080]   Didn't you leave Facebook entirely for you?
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:53.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.320]   None of that was preserved.
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:55.920]   It was gone.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.640]   That's all gone.
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.080]   Oh, why?
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.520]   I don't care about that.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.120]   I didn't-- there wasn't that much stuff up there.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.360]   I am trying to figure out, because I did set up the timeline.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:03.280]   You know, there's a little hack.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.720]   Make yourself a developer set up an app,
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.960]   and you can have a timeline.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.160]   So I did set up the timeline.
[01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.400]   I actually really like it, which tells me
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:12.280]   it's going to be a flop.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:14.800]   By the way, because we like buzz.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.000]   I love it.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.640]   It's like you buzz wave.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.360]   I love it, which means that normal people will hate it.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.960]   But I just think it's so cool.
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.920]   It puts together all your activities.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.480]   And so you can now start to--
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.480]   I showed you this last time.
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.040]   I mean, I put my baby pictures in.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.120]   But I'm trying to figure out how to put other stuff in there.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.240]   And I can't quite figure it out.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.080]   But I actually want to spend a few hours just filling out
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:39.640]   this timeline.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.920]   That just shows how good a nerd I am.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.160]   You're a digital scrapbooker, Leo.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:46.640]   It is.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.320]   It's digital scrapbooking.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:49.480]   It totally is.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:53.640]   You need some sparkles and some cutout hearts, foam hearts.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:54.640]   It's a stick in there.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.040]   It's common to see.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.520]   You need a Google+ convention.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.640]   You know what they need?
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.400]   It's stickers and stamps.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.000]   Yes.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.440]   They should really do that.
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.520]   What was-- I guess they stopped doing this.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.680]   Remember you could buy virtual gifts for real money?
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.200]   Yes.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.800]   You can send to people on Facebook.
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.320]   That's gone, isn't it?
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:14.920]   I think so.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.240]   They ought to bring that back.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.040]   Either that or no one's given me one.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.920]   No, I think it's gone, which is really crazy,
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.040]   because they must have made a ton of money on that.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.320]   Susan Care, who did the original Mac icons,
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.520]   was designing little gifts.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.520]   They should do that for the timeline.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.120]   I'd buy some.
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.360]   It's my birthday stamps.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.720]   You feel like you've got to buy somebody else the gift.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:38.240]   Good night.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.480]   Good night.
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.040]   What's worse?
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:43.440]   The cards are the gifts.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.440]   Oh.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:44.920]   I don't know.
[01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.840]   M5GMS me in the chatroom.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.760]   Are you going to put all your ex-girlfriends in your timeline?
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.200]   I am.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:50.760]   Really?
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.320]   Yeah, I already have one ex-girlfriend on my timeline.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.720]   My first girlfriend.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.920]   Wow.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.600]   Oh.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.040]   That's it.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:58.440]   I'm stalking Leo.
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.080]   Well, I know it's not done yet.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:00.580]   OK.
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:02.320]   I want to have it all done by the time it rolls out.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.720]   I guess it's actually delayed.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.240]   Did you see this?
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.720]   They're getting sued.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.240]   I think they didn't beat that down.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.240]   I have to sell some update on that.
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:08.720]   Oh, they did.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.720]   OK, so now they're going--
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:10.120]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.240]   I'm not sure.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.160]   The timeline trademark-- you know, who could sue them,
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:15.420]   though.
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:17.820]   They're about eight companies that we're doing almost
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:20.840]   exactly the same thing, where you upload your stuff,
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.560]   and it makes a timeline of your life.
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:24.060]   Yeah.
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.120]   Oh, well.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.200]   Well, if they start patenting our lives,
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.200]   we're a little problem.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.400]   Yeah, I know kidding.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.640]   Marissa Meyer, why did she take a job at Google?
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.000]   It was 1999.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.640]   She was a young engineer.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.560]   Wing offers from several startups during the dot com boom.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.400]   She liked Google because, among other things,
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:43.240]   she'd be the first woman on a team of merely eight people.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.160]   Um, she also got cheers when she visited another startup,
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:51.400]   where there were 48 males.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.360]   Can you believe that?
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:54.240]   Hey, baby.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.280]   Hubba, hubba.
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:55.840]   You're hot.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:56.880]   Yeah, geez.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.960]   Wow, it's like I'd rather be on a team with eight dudes
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.560]   instead of 48 dudes.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.560]   Nice.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.680]   Hi, yay, yay.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.180]   Aw, yeah.
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.000]   But the real reason-- and this is--
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.920]   On behalf of all men, Gina, I'm sorry.
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:08.520]   Yeah, it's OK.
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.840]   You apologize.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.720]   I give a blanket apology to every woman in the world.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.760]   Just blanket apology.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.680]   It's not our fault.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.680]   We've got-- we're poisoned.
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:19.520]   Our brains are poisoned with testosterone.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.040]   Just-- yeah, just blame the testosterone.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.280]   It's not our fault.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.920]   You know, we try.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:25.560]   Try.
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.960]   We try, but we have no choice.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:29.920]   It's like hair growing in the ears.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:30.720]   Exactly.
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.000]   It just happens.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:32.880]   It just sprouts there.
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.160]   We can't help it.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.720]   It's the testosterone speaking.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.800]   She was at a summit, Fortune Magazine's most powerful women's
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.600]   summit in La Laguna, Gala, California,
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:45.560]   on Monday with Lulu Lemons, CEO, talking about why
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:46.560]   she took a job at Google.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:50.280]   But she says, the real reason I took a job at Google,
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:56.160]   I thought it had a 98% chance of failing.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.280]   It turns out that the 2% odds of success
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.480]   were far greater than what she thought others would have.
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:03.760]   In other words, she thought they were likely to fail,
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.600]   but the least likely to fail of all the places she visited.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.680]   Yeah, she came up with an algorithm, didn't she?
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.200]   Did she kind of come up with a decision table
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.640]   where she had all these different factors,
[01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.120]   including the possibility of success?
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:14.560]   And then just leave.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.640]   She would.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:16.680]   OK.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.440]   That makes complete sense to me.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.720]   It's very logical.
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:22.560]   The key to success is often failure.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:23.600]   It's totally fine if failure.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:24.760]   You just have to fail fast.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:28.280]   Google focuses about 70% of its time on its core business,
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.280]   20% of its time on related businesses,
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.480]   that leaves 10% of its time on far-flung ideas.
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:35.200]   The key to is devoid investing too much time and resources
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.480]   into any idea before it's proven to be successful.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:42.960]   They're such an engineering driven company, aren't they?
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.040]   Yeah, they can't help it.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.280]   Speaking of not being able to help it,
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.680]   that's so much better.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.640]   You know, she said, of course, in the Stephen Levy book
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:54.800]   is because Larry and Sergey were Montessori kids.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.640]   Yes.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.000]   That's the other reason.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:57.760]   I don't buy that.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:02.320]   Now, this is an interesting story.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:06.640]   Google wants to do ad circulars.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:11.640]   Apparently, there's demand for this among some Google advertisers.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:14.080]   You've got to feel sorry for newspapers.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:14.920]   They wanted to--
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.720]   They wanted to get bits.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.680]   Just hit them where it hurts.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.600]   Of course, almost all newspapers
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:23.200]   were basically invented to deliver full-page ad
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.160]   circulars to people.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.920]   It's the only reason to still print.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.280]   In the economics of newspapers, you
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.160]   see some papers are trying to think about going down
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.240]   a one or two-day frequency.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:33.600]   And the reason that they're doing that
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.640]   is not because there's only news today's week,
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:38.040]   because that's when they distribute what are called
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:40.920]   freestanding inserts, coupons, circulars.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:46.000]   And I remember in the Chronicle, the big moneymaker
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.600]   in the San Francisco Chronicle for years,
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:51.880]   you'll remember this, Jeff, next to Herb Kane was Macy's.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.920]   And Herb Kane had a little thin-skinny column
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:55.600]   that everybody read, because he was
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:56.960]   these San Francisco colonists.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.840]   And he even would refer to the Macy's ad,
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.400]   because he knew there's always a big Macy's display ad
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.520]   right next to me.
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:07.160]   And he was the sugar, the honey, to bring people in
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.480]   so that they'd see the Macy's ad.
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.200]   If I told this story before, stop me.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.000]   That's a blanket rule of permission.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   No, no, no, no.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.680]   When I worked for the Daily News, after I came back
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.840]   to Mistreik in New York, coupons are controlled by Rupert
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:21.800]   Murdoch.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.480]   And the two of them, Robert Maxwell, who
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.960]   bought us was a robber baron of his own sort,
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.320]   were at a huge feud.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.840]   So we had no coupons.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.760]   When they finally reached peace, the week
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:35.840]   that the paper came back with coupons, our circulation,
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:39.040]   that week alone went up 120,000.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.640]   So people weren't buying the news and all the stuff
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.120]   I was working for, they're buying the coupon.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.000]   It's fish wrap and coupons.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.360]   Bird-kid liner.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.720]   And coupons.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.280]   So now, if Google gave-- there'd
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.520]   been other efforts to figure out how
[01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.160]   put coupons and circulars are online.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:56.720]   How do you find out what's the target and best buying such?
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.760]   But if Google can help them really figure it out
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.800]   and recognizes the business proposition, which
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.360]   is that the circular is a media property where
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.720]   manufacturers pay to be.
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.920]   And if they can enable those kinds of companies
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.760]   to make money on it and make sales through it,
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:14.880]   that is going to be the last straw for a lot of newspapers.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.400]   Though I've said it before, but I think it's going to hurt
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:17.840]   the bad thing.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:21.480]   Supposedly, you'll start seeing it today.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:25.200]   They're working with the two biggest buyers of full page ads
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:28.240]   in newspapers today, Macy's and Best Buy.
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:30.240]   And they're going to have web circulars.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:34.680]   They're going to look like the full page ad inserts in newspapers.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.160]   Oh, man.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:39.880]   You just kind of-- it just starts to hurt after a while.
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.720]   Yeah.
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:45.200]   New Google Doc for Androids, three column redesign
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   and more functionality.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.680]   That goes along with the Google Docs redesign.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.440]   We were talking about before the show began,
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:53.760]   because we use Google Docs for the show.
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.760]   And I was just noting that in Google Docs,
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:00.840]   the spreadsheets now look like their little gifts,
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:03.480]   the wrapped Christmas presents.
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:08.160]   Oh, this makes me happy when I see that.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.520]   It's a present made of data.
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:10.560]   I actually like the new design.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:11.800]   This is kind of--
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.080]   It's going to go along with a new Gmail design.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.240]   All this stuff is going to start looking like this.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.080]   I don't know how you'd characterize it.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.560]   Cleaner, equiratory, regular.
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:24.960]   It's-- I called it-- Google Voice just got this redesign as well.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.400]   And I called it Tapable on Twitter.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.240]   And that cuts laughed at me and said
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.480]   that that could be taken a lot of different ways.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:31.980]   No.
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.640]   It means you want to tap it, right?
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:35.440]   OK.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.920]   Clearly.
[01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:37.920]   I'll tap that.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:39.560]   The thing you want to tap online.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:42.920]   No, it's the tablet thing.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.120]   Everything has to be touched.
[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:44.760]   It's touch and face.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:45.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:45.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.000]   So big, bigger touch targets and cleaner, separation,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:48.600]   white space.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.440]   It's a good thing.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.520]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:52.680]   I just got this text.
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.080]   Hey, I got the money I needed.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.480]   I just got a Google Voice spam.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.480]   Google Voice spam?
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.680]   Block that sucker right now.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.720]   How do they do that?
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.080]   Pastards.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:05.600]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.680]   Let me just make sure it's not real.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.840]   Hey, I just got the money I needed.
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:12.880]   They approved me for $1,500 at 1HRloansight.com.
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.440]   Check out their site, too.
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.320]   Respond no to end.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.720]   Now, kids do not respond.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.120]   OK?
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.480]   Do I have to tell you that?
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.480]   Not us, but right now it's not a response.
[01:11:25.480 --> 01:11:26.480]   Do not respond.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.400]   Do not respond.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.360]   You block.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:28.880]   Block.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.440]   Block, but do not respond.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:36.560]   Google and AOL both got my hopes up.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.880]   Google is apparently paying $100 million
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:41.760]   to producers for new YouTube content.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.560]   AOL says they're doing a similar amount of money
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:48.880]   for to video producers, for original content,
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.160]   specifically for YouTube or AOL.
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.280]   I'm ready.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:55.920]   Well, OK, Leo.
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:56.680]   All right, Leo.
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:57.200]   All right, Leo.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.320]   You know who they're going to?
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.480]   Tony Hawk.
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.240]   And Shine Reveley.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.920]   That's the company that makes the office an ugly Betty.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.200]   Other expected partners.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:12.480]   All the big names, IAC, DECA.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.800]   That's what disappointed me.
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:15.400]   I mean, I understand why they're doing it.
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:16.480]   I get it.
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.480]   They want to grab the marquee names.
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.920]   And there's a war going on over that.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.360]   But I don't want this to be--
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.960]   Let's have some original content.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.200]   Yeah, I don't understand.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.520]   This is the platform for every regular person to make content.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.240]   And this deal is asking people who prefer
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.280]   create content for TV to make it on this platform.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:39.920]   Yeah, I mean, I guess the theory
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:42.240]   is they don't need to get regular people to do it.
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.920]   They'll do it.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.960]   But in order to get the big name producers
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:49.560]   to make high quality premium content,
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.360]   I have to say, I mean, this doesn't surprise me.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:53.400]   We've had some conversations with some of these companies.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.800]   And they don't want us.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.560]   Leo, would you do something like this?
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.080]   Well, what do you mean do something like this?
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.320]   If they said, here's $5 million, would you
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.600]   produce some content for YouTube?
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.520]   Hell yeah.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.640]   Why wouldn't I?
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.880]   Well, I mean, as opposed to running your own outfit where
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.160]   you--
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:10.320]   Well, I'd still run my own outfit.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:10.880]   I don't think they're--
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:11.480]   So that's the thing.
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.800]   They still use to own your stuff.
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:15.680]   I don't think Shine Reveley's suddenly a Google property.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:16.200]   No.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.800]   They're just saying, if we give you some seed capital,
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:21.720]   because I think the presumption is, you guys can't sell ads
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:22.200]   on this stuff.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.440]   You're not going to make money on it.
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.040]   So we'll give you the money that you would have made--
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:29.680]   Well, actually, it's an advance against Google Ad sale.
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:31.400]   So that's all it is.
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.800]   They're up fronting the capital.
[01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:35.520]   It's like, kickstart for TV.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:36.840]   They're up fronting the capital.
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:39.360]   And it's a book's the same way.
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.960]   It's an advance.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.680]   And Google's going to lose money on that,
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.040]   but it's going to draw people over.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.680]   And it's going to motivate them around.
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:49.880]   So what do you think they want besides marquee names?
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:50.840]   And of course, you are one.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.160]   But what do you think they want?
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:55.120]   They want mainstream traditional mainstream production
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:57.440]   to start moving to the internet.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:57.800]   Really?
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.520]   The 20-minute sitcoms.
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:00.440]   No, they want 10.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:00.960]   They want five.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.560]   They want 10 minutes.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:07.080]   They want funnier dye stuff is what they want.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:07.680]   That's OK.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:08.800]   I understand.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.040]   The Twitcom.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.440]   And see, we're not--
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.840]   You're just not-- in fact, for me--
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:16.440]   I'm telling you, I'm telling you, Devorak,
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.720]   there's a sitcom in that man.
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.040]   We talked with YouTube Live.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.720]   They didn't even know who we were.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.920]   They had no idea who we were.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.680]   That's crazy.
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:26.680]   They said, what is it that you do?
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.240]   In fact, we had several conversations.
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.920]   And at each time, I talked with the same person.
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:33.680]   I had to explain what it is we do.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.240]   He had never seen it, never heard of it.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:36.760]   Let me guess.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.440]   They hired this person from Warner Brothers or something.
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.760]   Yes.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.680]   Bingo.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:41.680]   That's crazy.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.360]   The reason why I asked earlier about whether or not
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.760]   you would do this, Leo, is because you are able--
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.480]   you don't need the seed capital, right?
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.600]   Like, you've got a sales team and you're already supporting
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.120]   yourself in the back.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.600]   You're not just trying to revelate,
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:52.920]   it's free money.
[01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:53.440]   Right.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.160]   I understand that.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:54.880]   I understand that.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.440]   If they said, well, we would like something
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:59.360]   that conforms to our needs, whatever that is,
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.440]   five minutes, fast-paced.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:05.600]   I'm sure I'd produce something for them.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.720]   Doesn't matter.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.040]   The Supreme Court of their--
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.080]   Their own--
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:10.880]   I know.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.080]   It's not even their loss.
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:14.880]   It's not even I'm on not even--
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.840]   I only mentioned-- and I'll bring it up to say, oh, I'll pour it.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:21.360]   I just merely want to point out this is what they're looking for.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.680]   They're not looking for any of the stuff that is produced--
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.640]   I guess they're throwing money into angry orange
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.960]   and Fred Figglesworth.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:32.480]   So there's stuff original YouTube content
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.720]   they're throwing money into too.
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:35.840]   You got to attract the kids.
[01:15:35.840 --> 01:15:37.800]   I don't attract the kids.
[01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.480]   Supreme Court left in place a ruling
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:42.240]   by a New York Federal Appeals Court, which says,
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:47.960]   "Song downloads are not considered public performances
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:48.960]   under copyright law."
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:49.520]   Yahoo!
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:53.200]   And real networks were in litigation
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.000]   with the American Society of Composers,
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:55.880]   authors, and publishers.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.840]   You know them as ASCAP.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.880]   Over royalty payments.
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:05.960]   ASCAP said, you owe us as if this was a public performance.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.880]   And Yahoo! said, no, we don't want
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.600]   to pay that higher rate.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:15.000]   We want to pay the download rate.
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.600]   Supreme Court reviewed and agreed.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:23.200]   Said, we're not going to hear the appeal.
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.080]   So that settles-- that case is done.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.080]   View.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.240]   Whew.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.040]   They won't have to-- I guess they'll have to--
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.440]   the second circuit rejected the lower court's method
[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.440]   of computing royalties, meaning now they'll
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.680]   have to come up with a new formula.
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.560]   So it's still could go.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.560]   What is a public performance of music online?
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.360]   That's the question.
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:43.560]   Is music streaming?
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:46.760]   Is Pandora a public performance?
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:51.480]   Do songwriters need royalties for streaming?
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.920]   I look, I support songwriters, absolutely.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.280]   Yeah, but as always, it's trying to use old metaphors
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.440]   in a new world.
[01:16:59.440 --> 01:16:59.920]   Right.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:00.840]   That's what doesn't work.
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:04.280]   You've got to figure out what the essential needs and benefits
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.000]   are in the competitive landscape, and then
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.480]   do something about that.
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:09.440]   Oh, I said AOL and Google.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:13.400]   But Yahoo and ABC News also have a distribution packed.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.280]   I don't get that one at all.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:19.040]   They're going to air Good Morning America on Yahoo.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.880]   Whee!
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.160]   Can't you just watch it on TV?
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.000]   I don't understand.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.280]   OK, I'd either.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:27.720]   Well, this is a classic case where ABC gets all happy
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.840]   as they get Yahoo's firehotes.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:30.360]   Right.
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.560]   As if traffic is a commodity that you're
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.600]   going to just shove around, which is awesome.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.400]   Interesting.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.600]   They're going to report their traffic together.
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.600]   Right.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:43.080]   What's also odd to me is that ABC lashes up with Yahoo,
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:45.360]   just as its fate is extremely uncertain.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.680]   What if it got bought by News Corp?
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.400]   Oh, Fox, yeah, ABC.
[01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.800]   They like each other.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.200]   There's no love.
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.760]   No problem there.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.400]   All right, let's get our tip, our number,
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.760]   and our tool of the week starting with you.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:01.360]   Gina Trapani, I'm just checking to see if you were frozen.
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:01.960]   Not frozen.
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:02.960]   You're a tip of--
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.720]   We have to keep moving all the time.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:05.880]   Yeah, just to make sure.
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:07.320]   Not frozen.
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.200]   This is a pretty cool tip that was new to me.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.280]   I'm giving credit to the Google operating system blog
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.960]   for unearthing this one.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.080]   You know how, in your browser, if you click on a link,
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.120]   especially in Google results, the link
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.960]   turns purple because it's a link that you visited already.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:21.560]   Right.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:24.320]   That's kind of been a standard since the internet was born.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.960]   Yeah, that's been a standard in browsers forever.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:30.400]   Well, if you have web history turned on in Google Search,
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:33.120]   those purple links will show up if you visited a page
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.160]   on any computer.
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.080]   So if I visited a page on my laptop and then I go on to my desktop,
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.120]   it'll show that purple link, which is pretty cool.
[01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.120]   And the other thing that you can do if you have web history
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.440]   turned on is you can--
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:46.040]   you know when you find a page on Google,
[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.680]   and then a few weeks later, you're
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.120]   like, oh, that page I was looking at,
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.920]   and you know that you visited it,
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:54.480]   but you can't find it again, you can actually filter or limit
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.640]   your search results to pages which you have already visited.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.920]   So if you do a Google search on the left side,
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:03.480]   on the left hand column, there's a link, more search tools.
[01:19:03.480 --> 01:19:07.040]   And you can say, just show me pages which I have already
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.040]   visited.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.080]   I think that's the wrong screen.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.120]   Yeah, so go to--
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:12.120]   What would we do?
[01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:13.200]   Let's see here.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.680]   If you have web history turned on,
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:16.200]   you do need to have a history turned on for us.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:17.160]   I love that.
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.680]   So should I do a search?
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.200]   Yeah, just do a search for something
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:21.880]   that you've searched over for.
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.680]   I've searched for Gina and Trapani many, many times.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.560]   And see, it's purple because your blog I've been there.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.040]   Right.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:28.540]   Right.
[01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:31.060]   So on the left hand column, if you go down to,
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:34.060]   I think it's more search tools, there's
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:35.900]   a visited pages link.
[01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:36.580]   Click on that.
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:37.700]   And not yet visited.
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:39.420]   So these are the ones I've been to.
[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:41.740]   Yeah, so these are just the links which you have visited
[01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:42.900]   in your show to web history.
[01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:46.820]   So these are your sites that I haven't been to yet.
[01:19:46.820 --> 01:19:48.540]   Well, that's not true, but--
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:52.220]   Yeah, so it's a neat tool if you've found the link weeks ago
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.820]   and you're trying to find it again.
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.020]   And it's not your local web history.
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:55.940]   I've been dying for that.
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:56.780]   That's fantastic.
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:20:00.260]   So these are the ones you went to last time.
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:00.620]   Yeah.
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:01.140]   Right.
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:01.980]   Cool.
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:05.420]   Yeah, so just another way to filter results.
[01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:07.780]   This almost convinced me to turn web history back on.
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:08.780]   I've had it paused for a long time.
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:10.660]   Oh, you don't use it.
[01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:15.620]   I stopped using it at some point in some sort of un-jarvous
[01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:17.220]   like privacy fit.
[01:20:17.220 --> 01:20:21.300]   I think that might turn resume back on, because this is useful.
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.020]   And listen, Google's tracking it either way.
[01:20:23.020 --> 01:20:24.580]   I might as well get the benefit of it.
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:26.460]   This is one of the benefits of Google
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:28.820]   holding on to my web history is that I can filter searches that way.
[01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:30.540]   That's why I leave it on.
[01:20:30.540 --> 01:20:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:33.220]   Yeah.
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:36.900]   Now it is time for a number from Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:40.580]   Well, Repler, which is a, I don't know,
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:43.460]   some kind of job company according to Forbes
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:45.460]   and Cashmere Hill, their privacy person,
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:48.620]   says that 91% of employers in this survey
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:51.060]   say that they do indeed go to social networking sites
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:52.580]   to screen job applicants.
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:53.380]   Wow.
[01:20:53.380 --> 01:20:55.300]   And this is going to scare you for a moment.
[01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:58.780]   69% of those surveys said they had at some point rejected
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:00.340]   someone for that.
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:04.860]   However, 68% said they'd also hired someone
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.260]   because of what they saw.
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:09.980]   And so why were people fired?
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:11.500]   Is it the classic holding a drink?
[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.740]   Well, 11% idiots do say that.
[01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:15.860]   But the most common reason to reject someone,
[01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:18.460]   because what they find is they lied about their qualifications.
[01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:20.020]   Yeah, well, that's reasonable.
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:21.420]   The employer gets to do things.
[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:23.700]   Are they made discriminatory comments?
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:26.780]   Or they demonstrated poor communication skills?
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:27.620]   You know?
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:28.620]   It's what you--
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:29.900]   It is, yeah.
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:30.740]   It is.
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:31.580]   Like, did I just need?
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:32.740]   I can do it as evidence.
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:34.980]   (laughing)
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:39.380]   You know, post content about them using drugs
[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:41.660]   or about them drinking.
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:43.660]   I think that's none of their business.
[01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:47.140]   And I hate that people are gonna be able to put up
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.260]   a picture of them holding a beer.
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:49.100]   It's ridiculous.
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:50.020]   This is the boss doesn't drink beer.
[01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:52.100]   That's where society's all screwed up.
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:52.940]   Right.
[01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:53.780]   It's critical.
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:54.620]   Right.
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:57.060]   So keep your Facebook profile page.
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:59.460]   Don't be worried about just being okay for grandma
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:00.740]   or for your boss.
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:03.420]   But don't be stupid remains the basic rule of life.
[01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:07.500]   And would you really want to work for a company
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:09.260]   that didn't want you less than a person?
[01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:10.100]   Exactly.
[01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:11.660]   That's what another Forbes columnist said.
[01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:12.820]   I think she was exactly right.
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:14.700]   You don't want to work with that kind of company.
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.540]   If that's gonna be a big deal for them,
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:19.380]   that you were dancing around naked at Burning Man.
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:21.220]   (laughing)
[01:22:21.220 --> 01:22:22.060]   Come on.
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:24.620]   I definitely hired editors and interns
[01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:26.700]   because of their social media presence.
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:27.540]   Well, that's true.
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:28.380]   That's true.
[01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:30.340]   Did you reject anyone 'cause of what you saw?
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:33.140]   No, actually.
[01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:35.780]   I mean, I would just way favorably
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:37.180]   people who had a strong online presence.
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:39.140]   I mean, the job was a blog editor.
[01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:40.900]   So I wanted someone that I knew had good writing skills
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:42.820]   and knew how to handle him or herself in a situation,
[01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:44.740]   in a common situation or in a conversation online.
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:46.100]   So it was part of it.
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:47.340]   But no, I never not.
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:49.260]   I mean, there are people who I befriended
[01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:52.420]   because they had a kind of a cool, normal,
[01:22:52.420 --> 01:22:53.420]   kind of like-minded, you know,
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:56.140]   I said this is a person as a kindred spirit
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:57.380]   from their social media presence.
[01:22:57.380 --> 01:22:58.740]   And there are people who I've just not engaged
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:00.260]   'cause they seem kind of creepy online.
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:02.060]   So I don't know that that might be,
[01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:03.060]   that might be kind of a direction.
[01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:04.940]   But I've never, I've never not hired someone
[01:23:04.940 --> 01:23:07.140]   because of their social media presence.
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:08.860]   I, you know, I have to say when we hire somebody,
[01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:10.540]   we certainly would pay attention to the fact
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:12.100]   that if they didn't have a webpage,
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:13.900]   a Facebook page or a Twitter account,
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.620]   we'd kind of wonder, well, is this person
[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:16.940]   even right for us, right?
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:19.580]   - Well, I went to a Davos thing yesterday
[01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:21.420]   and there was a session about trying to get talent
[01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:23.060]   and programming talent and a good discussion
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:26.260]   with Sean Parker and Tim Armstrong and some other people.
[01:23:26.260 --> 01:23:30.340]   One of the other people said that he told the story
[01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:31.620]   of a guy who was hiring people
[01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:33.140]   and interviewing them on his birthday
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:35.140]   and four people walked in and one of them said,
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:36.500]   "Happy birthday."
[01:23:36.500 --> 01:23:39.020]   And it just showed off that the person did their research.
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:39.860]   That's all it is.
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:40.900]   They looked him up.
[01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.900]   - That's the sixth sense, yeah.
[01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:45.180]   - He always respects someone who finds a way
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:48.940]   to sneak in some reference to having read a blog post
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.100]   or the person they hope is involved.
[01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:51.300]   - That's interesting 'cause that can,
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:54.260]   I've met people that that creeps them out.
[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:58.500]   Where they go, "Oh, were you looking me up online?
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:23:59.980]   "Maybe that's old."
[01:23:59.980 --> 01:24:01.260]   - Oh, see, that's interesting.
[01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:03.980]   I find it to be an evidence of the person
[01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:05.700]   just being perceptive and paying attention
[01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:06.940]   and wanting to impress.
[01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:09.140]   If it's something that I wrote publicly, you know,
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.820]   and recently, and someone says it to me in conversation
[01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:14.020]   in a professional context, I'm like, oh, you, you know,
[01:24:14.020 --> 01:24:17.100]   you either follow my stuff or you cared enough to look it up.
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:18.420]   - Yeah, that would be flattering if you,
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:20.980]   yeah, if they read your articles.
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:23.180]   But if they knew who your third grade teacher was,
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:24.300]   that'd be a little weird.
[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:25.500]   - That would be right.
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:26.780]   Well, I mean, if that was the thing--
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:28.180]   - And percities right on the edge there,
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:29.300]   that's pretty personal.
[01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:31.780]   - Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:33.260]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.540]   But if you're friends with someone on Facebook,
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.020]   you know it's their birthday if you've logged in
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:36.860]   to Facebook. - Yeah, sure.
[01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:38.180]   - That's just, you know, it's kind of front and center.
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:39.220]   - But if they've let you be their friend,
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:41.620]   now the subscription thing muddy's the water though.
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:42.460]   - Right. - But this is all
[01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:44.300]   what we're trying to do is find our new norms
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.460]   as a society. - Right.
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:46.820]   - I think that's where I draw the line.
[01:24:46.820 --> 01:24:48.180]   If you wanna look me up and read about my
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:50.060]   professional credentials and know about that,
[01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:51.580]   that's great, you're doing your homework.
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:54.980]   If you wanna know what my kids' names are, that's great.
[01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:55.820]   - Right.
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:56.900]   - Yeah, you got a point there.
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:58.500]   - That's creepy if somebody you don't know comes up
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:24:59.580]   and says, how are Henry and Abby?
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:01.060]   It's like, huh?
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:03.140]   - Yeah, okay, I see that.
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:06.660]   - Yeah, that would be my feeling anyway.
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:10.180]   My tool of the week is something very useful.
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.220]   If you like to silence your phone as I do,
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:14.860]   if you go to meetings or you're on the air
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:16.940]   and whatever it is that you don't want the phone to ring,
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:19.620]   and yet there are some numbers you really need to have ring.
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:22.260]   This is a tool I've been using for some time now.
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:25.860]   It's on the Android market called semi-silent.
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:28.220]   You can designate certain numbers that ring no matter
[01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:30.980]   what the silence settings are on your Android phone.
[01:25:30.980 --> 01:25:33.380]   There's a free version and there's a paid version
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:35.700]   that eliminates ads, free version works just fine,
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:36.900]   and you don't see the ads all the time,
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:40.780]   just when you're running the app, semi-silent.
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:42.420]   I like it a lot.
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:43.340]   - Cool, that sounds good.
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:45.220]   - Yeah, it's really, you know,
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:49.340]   if you don't want to miss somebody's call
[01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:52.540]   that you're expecting, but you want to have your
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:53.660]   phone quiet, this is good.
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:55.100]   And I'm gonna give you a second one, a freebie.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.580]   This is called Scribble.
[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:58.940]   I'm trying to remember where I saw this,
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:00.900]   but it's very an interesting idea.
[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:04.980]   So you want to set your Android phone for battery usage.
[01:26:04.980 --> 01:26:06.380]   You want to set it to turn the screen off
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:07.540]   in the shortest amount of time.
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:10.020]   The shortest is 15 seconds on Android.
[01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:11.020]   But the problem with that is when,
[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:12.540]   inevitably, if it's 15 seconds,
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:14.500]   when you're doing something,
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:15.460]   it'll turn itself off.
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:18.620]   You're watching a YouTube movie and it goes black.
[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:20.780]   Scribble has a very interesting idea.
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:23.260]   It was from one of the hackathons.
[01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:26.940]   It watches the orientation of your screen,
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:28.500]   like how your phone is being held
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:31.180]   and doesn't turn off the screen if your phone's tilted.
[01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:35.100]   So if you're watching a movie or using the phone
[01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:37.020]   to play Scrabble, which I've been doing,
[01:26:37.020 --> 01:26:39.820]   you can set the screen,
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.740]   turn off to be the shortest possible.
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:45.420]   But it does a very good job of keeping the phone awake
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:47.540]   as long as you're handling it.
[01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:49.540]   The minute you put it down, it's done.
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.260]   - It's a great cover. - Yeah, I think it's a really good
[01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:53.900]   idea, it's called Scribble, S-C-R-E-E-B-L,
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:57.340]   short for, I guess, Screen Blank or something like that.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:58.780]   - Or a word we could find.
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:27:02.420]   - Yeah, it's a word we could find that wasn't taken
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:03.620]   by anybody else.
[01:27:04.580 --> 01:27:07.980]   - Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org, she blogs there.
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:09.860]   She's also, of course, the author of ThinkUp,
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:13.700]   a great application that he's used to call information
[01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:17.100]   out of Twitter feeds, ThinkUpApp.com, right?
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:19.740]   - Yes, a new release tomorrow with Google+,
[01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:20.900]   9 a.m. Pacific tomorrow,
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:22.340]   download the new release of ThinkUp.

[01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:35.620]   - Gina, can I get back on your server?
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:36.980]   - Absolutely, let's get that set up.
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:37.820]   In fact, we're doing some maintenance on--
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:39.900]   - I just feel like I'm dumb, but thank you.
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:40.820]   - Yeah.
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:41.660]   (laughing)
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:42.820]   - I'll get you set up for sure.
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:44.340]   - That's awesome, awesome, awesome.

[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.420]   - I'm going to college, kill me, yeah.
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:47.500]   - Yes.
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.540]   - He killed your brain cells.

[01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:55.380]   and of course, the new book you must get,
[01:27:55.380 --> 01:27:57.460]   go right now to the bookstore.
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:27:59.580]   That one down the street that still sells paper books
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:01.780]   and pick up public parts.
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:03.780]   It's awesome.
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:07.580]   Kevin Marks coming up this afternoon on triangulation.
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:08.420]   - Wow.
[01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.180]   - I should have teased you, I should have said,
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:13.740]   do we know anybody who invented podcasting two years
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:16.340]   before Adam Curry and Dave Weiner,
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:19.820]   who created QuickTime at Apple Computer,
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:21.500]   who went to work for Technorati,
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:23.460]   where he was a chief engineer,
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:24.780]   who went to work at Google,
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:27.340]   where he was in charge of micro formats and profiles.
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:29.100]   Do we know anybody like that?
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:31.620]   Yes, we do, and you've probably heard him many times
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:32.620]   on this show, can we watch?
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:33.820]   - And he's watching us right now.
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:36.660]   - He is, and the only reason I didn't pull him on this show
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:38.540]   is 'cause we're gonna talk to him for a while.
[01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:39.380]   - Wow.
[01:28:39.380 --> 01:28:40.220]   - I've wanted to do this for a while
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:42.020]   'cause he's on many of our shows,
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:43.460]   but to sit down and talk to this guy
[01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:46.180]   who has really been so important to technology
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:47.540]   for so many years will be a lot of fun.
[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:49.620]   Currently, he's at salesforce.com,
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:54.460]   but Kevin Marks joins us at 4 p.m. for triangulation.
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:57.020]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:58.100]   - Yes, take care.
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:28:59.700]   - Bye bye, we'll see you next time
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:00.900]   on This Week in Google.

[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:13.060]   (upbeat music)
[01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:15.640]   (gentle music)
