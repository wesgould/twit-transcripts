[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.160]   I think it's going to be a little bit of a Twitter today.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.160]   Stacey Ginkinbotham.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.280]   Stacey Ginkinbotham is here.
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.760]   Your name has too many syllables for me.

[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.240]   I kick a Stacey on the Twitter.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.240]   Hello Stacey.
[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.840]   Hello y'all.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.680]   I missed you.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.320]   Were you gone again last week?
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.320]   Yeah, Leo, you and I were the only ones working hard.
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.520]   You know, the two of them just take off.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.360]   I see you'll missed me too.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.360]   Excellent.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.360]   Thanks to you too.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.760]   Anyway, welcome back.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.000]   I want to know that I was here.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I was working.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Jeff just disappeared.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   And he's still here.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.480]   You know, oh, well, I don't feel like it's done.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.320]   We try to get rid of him every week.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.320]   We can.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.320]   You don't.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.320]   You can't.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.480]   He is officially the Leonard Tom Professor for journalistic
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.320]   Innovation at the Craig Newmark.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.880]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.880]   Hello, Jeff.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.880]   Hello.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.640]   And Pruitt is also here.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.960]   I know you had the week off.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.960]   Yeah, I wasn't here.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.960]   Was it your birthday?
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:50.960]   No, sir.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.960]   Just for fun.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   It was just for fun.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   I'll just put that in.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.960]   Oh, that's right.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.360]   You lied and said it was his birthday.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   We all believed it.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.520]   It was my birthday.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.240]   Anytime anybody takes vacation here at Twitter, I say it's their birthday.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.240]   I guess that way.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.240]   That was it.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.240]   Next week is my birthday.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.240]   Yeah, see?
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.240]   Should I take next week off?
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.320]   I take next week off because actually I think you are anyway.
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.880]   I think that was the plan, wasn't it?
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.880]   Yeah, that sounds right.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.040]   Because I think Kevin Marks is coming in next week.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.040]   No, I'm out next week.
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.040]   Oh, you're out.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.040]   I'm out next week.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.040]   Okay, that's right.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   Kevin Marks is coming in next week.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.520]   Attempt to see a track meet with the hard heads and a little weirdo.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.200]   Kevin is unhappy about the edit button and he'll explain why next week box.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.760]   I can do a little bit of that this week.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.960]   He's also going to be on Tech News Weekly tomorrow to explain that.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.080]   But before we get into that, I want to just congratulate you for listening to this show
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.960]   because did you know, according to the Guardian, podcast listeners are likely to be more curious
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.720]   and less neurotic?
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.720]   This is research.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.720]   What about hosts?
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.720]   No, though, with the opposite.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.960]   We're neurotic so they don't have to be.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:03.760]   This is from a study at the Queensland University of Technology, I guess in Australia, survey
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.800]   of 306 peoples from more than 10 countries on their podcast listening habits on a podcast
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.680]   listeners, those who scored more highly on the trait of agreeableness were more likely
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.880]   to form parasocial relationships with their favorite podcast hosts.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.960]   I think that happens right now.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.120]   Parasocial relationships associated with listening for longer and listening to podcasts by known
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.120]   hosts.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.960]   The more you listen, the more you socially engage and feel like the favorite host is a
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.960]   friend.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   There you go.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.720]   Also, also, I should point out.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   Podcast listeners less likely to score highly for neuroticism, the tendency to experience
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.080]   negative emotions.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.280]   And oddly enough, that's quite different from social media use.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.440]   There's a positive association between neuroticism and social media.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.760]   Of course, negative emotions.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.280]   That's what social media is all about.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:10.240]   Of podcast listeners, though, much less neuroticism, much more perceived intimacy, finding that
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.880]   people felt more empathetic and persuadable in hearing podcasts through headphones compared
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.720]   to through speakers.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.160]   That's why our ads are our are our dupes themselves.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   Well, you're no, they're not dupes.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.960]   They're more curious.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.240]   Stop it.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.040]   And more op podcast listeners, people.
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.320]   No, people who listen to podcasts.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.840]   This is the headline.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.920]   Our more likely life and have to have one curious, more open to experience and less
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.520]   neurotic on average.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   Thank you very much.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.000]   Congratulations.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.440]   Because you're listening.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.360]   Maybe you didn't know that to a podcast right now.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.480]   So you, yes, you used to be a good person.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.000]   Yeah, that's why I changed the name so that you could be less, you could be more angry
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   about it.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Less neurotic.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.560]   I wonder if there's a conversion of the folks that are super, super active on social media
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.840]   and then you get them into listening to podcast.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.200]   And they do less social media?
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   Will they do less social media?
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.200]   I hope so.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   Less neurotic.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.120]   I wonder if there's a study in place for that.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.120]   You have.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.560]   Some people you hear, I don't, I can't listen to podcasts.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.560]   I don't get it.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.240]   They rather watch Netflix or they can only handle 140 ideas at a time.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.880]   I would rather watch Netflix than listen to a podcast.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.880]   Really?
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.880]   Depending on what's on Netflix.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.760]   Well, nowadays on Netflix, it's mostly shows about podcasts.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.160]   Oddly enough or hustle culture or something.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.320]   I was about to say no, I've got, I've got Bridgerton.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.320]   Okay.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.320]   Okay.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.320]   I'm going to go to the podcast.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.120]   I had David Weiner in our class this week.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.120]   Sorry.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.120]   Oh, nice.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.120]   So Dave was, was speaking to our class this week, we had him go through the history of
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.120]   podcasts.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.600]   And of course it started with Adam Curry.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:58.600]   Thank you, Adam Curry, MTV star and Adam was talking to stars a big radio.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.600]   Everybody didn't have MTV.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.600]   He's a VJ.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.920]   He looked like a star.
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.920]   He did though.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.800]   So Dave said he almost missed it.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.960]   He wasn't listening enough to Adam.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.240]   Adam had to say, I want radio on and Dave was saying, you can't get sound.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.240]   It's too slow.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.600]   No, it's not going to work.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.160]   And then he thought about it and thought about it.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.760]   Oh, no, I get it.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.120]   You can download it and then you can listen when you want.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:31.520]   Adam was encouraging Dave, who was one of the authors of RSS to add one little feature
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:38.440]   to RSS, the ability to include a binary file in the RSS feed.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.480]   So instead of normally what it is, is the text from your blog, right?
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.440]   But in addition, that one little thing that said, oh, and there is this binary blob associated
[00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.840]   with the RSS feed, that blob is this show.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.720]   Congratulations.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.000]   So yeah, thanks to Dave Weiner.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.200]   We have an Adam Curry who is often called the pod father for this.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:03.920]   Adam wrote a very early podcasting client that read RSS feeds and downloaded the audio,
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.560]   which was super seeded because it was just a kind of experimental lab effort.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.920]   Dave also said it took time, interestingly, he said what he wanted more than he else was
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.560]   users because people weren't doing it.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.880]   They thought, oh, you're Adam Curry.
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:16.880]   He's a VJ.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.880]   He knows that was professionally.
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.760]   And a few things that were out there were like that.
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.680]   And so Steve Gilmore was kind of podcasting in a sense before then.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.280]   And then he said that Dave said he just went on and just kind of turned on a mic and just
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.920]   started talking and wanted people to realize anybody can do this.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.920]   Right.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.920]   Well, how does he feel now?
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.920]   Yes.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.880]   Yeah, because today's standard because everybody's doing podcasts.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.320]   Now, as long as you have fun.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.280]   Yeah, the students did.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.560]   He's, I think that that he says that that I don't want to quote Dave here.
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.560]   I'm sorry, Dave, if you're watching.
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.320]   We'd love to have you on so we can quote you directly.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.120]   But just to answer your question, I think that he cares about the structure of it.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.480]   If you can listen anywhere and that's why Spotify and Rogan, his view clearly is not
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.320]   podcasting at all.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.320]   Good point.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.600]   Nor is YouTube.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.560]   But they're complimentary.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:14.000]   I don't think it may not be podcasting, but it's the idea to me.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.360]   And this is why I never liked the word podcast.
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.480]   The idea really is just it's content over the internet.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.720]   The audio, video text doesn't really matter.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.360]   It's internet distributed content.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.240]   And it is important that anybody can do it.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:34.800]   You know, shortly after that happened, that happened in, I think, September of 2004, in
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.240]   October of 2004, I put my radio show on a R and RSS feed as a podcast.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.720]   And I think Dave's right is that because it was, it would tended to be, you know, professionals
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.400]   initially who had the gear and the, you know, the content to put out.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.080]   Although, you know, I have to say, Adam's show was, he sounds professional, but it wasn't
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.080]   a radio show.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.480]   It was the daily source code.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.440]   It was just, you know, him talking.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.680]   He said, one of the first people to do was Chris Leiden, who was a WGBH Boston who really
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.680]   always sounds like he's NPR, even if you're just sitting with him in the conference.
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.680]   And PR.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.680]   So that kind of intimidates people.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.680]   Yes.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.680]   I think Chris actually was one of the very, even before maybe RSS.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.200]   He was doing that.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.080]   And there was IT conversations.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.320]   There were, yeah, the early days, but it didn't take long before.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.320]   Well, it did.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:28.000]   It took a decade truthfully before people really caught on to it because it was hard.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.280]   And that's why it was called a podcast.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:34.240]   You had to have an iPod and a program to download it and then put it on your iPod for
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.240]   it to be a podcast.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   Well, it preceded the iPod, right?
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.440]   I mean, podcasting preceded the iPod, I think the name.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.440]   No, it did not.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.440]   Hold on here.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.200]   iPod came out in 2001.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.200]   Podcasting 2004.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.200]   Oh, OK.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   All right.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   So it did not.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   And that's why it was called a podcast.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:59.520]   And you'll see some people doing kind of a retroactive play on demand is what POD stands
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.000]   for us, not what it stood for.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.360]   No, I was putting it on your iPod.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.560]   I know I was there.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.560]   But yeah, yeah, good.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.560]   I'm glad you had him in.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.360]   I think that's a really, he was really, really enthralled to students because his
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.960]   is a guy who's built so much.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.680]   This is a class Doug Rushkoff and I are doing and redesigning the internet.
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.680]   Oh, neat.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.200]   Trying to get the students to understand the agency and responsibility to do so.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.520]   We have just so you know, we invite Dave on pretty much weekly.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.960]   And I've known Dave since the very beginning.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.080]   Dave said he'll do anything for you.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.600]   Yeah, he's a great guy.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.120]   So the big story of the week though is none of that none of the above.
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.600]   It turns out, no, no, there's no tick to no.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:51.480]   To that starting in January, Elon Musk quietly started buying up shares of Twitter.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:59.000]   And it finally became public last week that he had bought 9.2% of Twitter outstanding
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.920]   Twitter shares becoming the biggest stakeholder in Twitter by far.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:11.080]   Jack Dorsey, who just left his Twitter CEO, only has 2.7%.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:18.880]   So $2.9 billion later, Elon Musk has 73 million shares.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:24.840]   This is a filing that was made March 14th since Elon has updated the filing, which is
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.600]   kind of interesting.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.600]   Maybe I don't know.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.120]   Maybe he thought maybe it was a little sloppy.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.600]   I don't know.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:39.000]   He's reclassified himself in the filing as an active investor.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:50.520]   And of course, shortly after this, the CEO of Twitter, Prasag Agrawal announced that
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.640]   Elon was going to have a board seat.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.080]   He took a seat on the board.
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.760]   Now I think there's a reason why.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.000]   When you're on the board, you can only buy up to 4.5%.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.680]   They prohibit you from becoming an owner.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.680]   Okay.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.680]   Well, he's limited to 14.9%.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:08.680]   Did I say five?
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:14.120]   Yeah, he already has for 9%, limited to 14.5%.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:22.720]   So because I think this is a bear hug, I think that what this really was, was we don't want
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.440]   him, we think he might be actually angling to buy Twitter.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.800]   He has the money easily.
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.800]   Oh yeah.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.440]   Hundreds of billions.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.800]   And by the way, he's already made money.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.640]   Twitter's stock price went up 27%.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.800]   After he did this, if he were just interested, and by the way, that's how Elon must use Twitter.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.240]   Yeah, to pump stock.
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.240]   Pump it up and down.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.160]   If you were interested in just making money, yeah, he could have dumped it, but he didn't.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:55.080]   And I honestly think this is on the whole on the heels of Elon's saying, well, I think
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.280]   Twitter, you know, free speech, should we make a new Twitter?
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:03.880]   Because there's not enough free speech on Twitter, which is ironic because no one's healed him.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.920]   I guess maybe he's thinking of the former president?
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.520]   I don't know.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:15.680]   Then on Monday, he put up a poll that said, do you want an edit button?
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:21.600]   Although it was tongue in cheek because as you might notice, the poll misspelled yes and
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.440]   no.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.760]   So in a way, it's like, see if we had an edit button, I could have fixed this.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.760]   But look at that.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.440]   73.6% yes.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.560]   Four million votes.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.440]   This followed Twitter having said on April Fool's Day that they were working on yet.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.760]   Well, and in fact, they said, no, it wasn't in April Fool's.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.680]   We've been working on it for a year and we're going to do it.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:45.160]   So this is a big week for Twitter news.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.000]   Can you go over to timetable again?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.920]   Was the board seat offered?
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.880]   That was after he bought after nine points.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.160]   I pre announced he bought.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.440]   So what did somebody say yesterday?
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.240]   Keep your friends close and your enemies closer, giving them a board seat.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.960]   This dude should not get any.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.560]   This pisses me off so much.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:09.160]   I'm like, this is just a person who behaves badly, who behaves unethically.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:11.920]   People venerate him.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.120]   It drives me absolutely up the wall.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.000]   Just from a standpoint of what is he really have to offer?
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.440]   Do you want someone on your board who is going to possibly taint your brand and do things
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.760]   that are illegal?
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.760]   I like Twitter.
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   I wish they didn't bow and cow-tow to this sort of play acting and bad behavior disguised
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.960]   as I'm just kidding.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.560]   Like, ah, ah.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.560]   How soon do you think we'll see some SCC?
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:42.880]   Do you think we're in a situation of mine?
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.880]   Sorry.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.120]   I think, yeah, I don't know what, what did you ask?
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:51.920]   I was saying, how soon do you see an investigation happening from like the SCC or someone?
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.520]   Because it just seems weirdly time.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.640]   I'm sure the SCC is going to do something.
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:03.320]   Elon is doing a great job showing how little teeth the SCC actually have.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.000]   Or maybe it's just their willingness to go against him.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.760]   Well, I don't think there's any law he's broken at this point.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:09.760]   You don't think so?
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.760]   No.
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.760]   It's just ethically.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.360]   You're allowed to buy shares in a company you like.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.360]   Yes.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.400]   Warren Buffett eats a, you know, McDonald's every morning.
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.160]   He has an egg McMuffin.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.480]   He is also a major shareholder.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   Not illegal.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.480]   Right.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.480]   I like McMuffins.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.800]   I think I'll buy some stock.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.560]   Well, that's, that's his MO.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.800]   But from a ownership perspective and when some of this was reported, I believe there are
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.960]   questions about that.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.960]   Oh, really?
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.160]   That's the securities issue.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.160]   Okay.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.240]   And Neil Dash agrees with you.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:48.120]   He said when he saw the tweet from Prague Agra wall saying that Mr Musk is on the board,
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.880]   he said, yeah, that's bad.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.360]   I wish they would have taken any of the many other suggestions of active users who could
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.800]   have been added to the board over the years, including those who are developers or experienced
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.160]   creators of healthy communities.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:07.480]   Neil who's great has a point, which is Twitter has had a very checkered history of developers,
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.320]   mostly negative.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:15.320]   And yet it's the developers and users who have pushed the platform along.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:22.760]   If it worked for Chris and his hashtag, right?
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   Chris, what's this?
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.760]   I can't remember his last name now.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.240]   Who invented the hash.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   Sorry?
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.240]   Lucina.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.240]   Lucina, right?
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:33.520]   Chris, who invented the hashtag was users who created the ad reply.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.480]   That was an ad hoc solution that Twitter eventually incorporated.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.720]   The Twitter would be very different platform.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.080]   So I think a Neil's is absolutely right.
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.560]   But money talks.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.640]   I think Stacy's really right here too.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:52.000]   I think Twitter was kind of stuck in a bind and it's a bear hug and that's all true.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.200]   But it doesn't look good for the company because they do this and they're going to allow someone
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.320]   to bully them.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:08.480]   My fear about this is that it's this fake free speech cancellation talk where they're
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:13.440]   going to be compelled to carry noxious speech.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.960]   And that's going to create and I mean, you think you're probably on social media now.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:22.120]   Imagine if they were forced by a billionaire or by right wing government, either one,
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.560]   both of which are talking about this, of saying you must carry hate speech.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.560]   You must carry.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:33.320]   According to Mike Isaac at the New York Times, Twitter was already discussing having must
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:37.600]   be a more active participant, according to two people with knowledge of the conversation.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:38.960]   Why do you believe that?
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.560]   Why do you believe that?
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.200]   Well, because he has 80 million followers and tweets several times several dozen times
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.200]   a day.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   That's not the real Twitter.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   You know, the real Twitter uses their platform to break the law.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:58.360]   And he also seems to embody what is most noxious about the platform and the terms and the way
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.080]   he uses it.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.000]   Casey Newton, people engage with him.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Call Zeline Musk a mischievous trickster God.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.640]   I mean, in a way he is.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.320]   Puckish.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:18.360]   Yeah, in fact, Casey says, I likened it to Loki buying an ant farm.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.640]   That's exactly what it is.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:28.160]   So it's, you know, so this is interesting because Casey Newton, known as platformer newsletter,
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.280]   talks about the timeline, which actually if you need this timeline to take it all into
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.440]   context.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.400]   So you remember that Elliot management, which was an activist investor group, took a four
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.840]   percent stake in Twitter two years ago.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.560]   And at that time they were very unhappy with how Twitter was doing and they wanted Jack
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.120]   Dorsey out because the stock price was stagnant.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.120]   User growth was stagnant.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:20:01.480]   Elliot, the activist investors, left the board a year later, according to Newton, apparently
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.840]   satisfied with Twitter's progress.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.880]   But as a condition of leaving, set aggressive goals for the company, grow the user base
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:14.200]   by 100 million people, accelerate revenue growth, gain market share as a digital advertiser,
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.200]   none of which Jack Dorsey was able to do.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:22.280]   Casey thinks, and I think this widely agreed that that's why Dorsey left, is that he could
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.400]   not make the changes Elliot wanted.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:34.080]   And of course he put a Twitter's CTO in charge, Pargrowal.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.720]   And Arguewal has done nothing to, by the way, hit those marks either.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.640]   In fact, it lost money.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.720]   But he's only been, how long has he been there?
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.520]   Well, more than a quarter, a couple of quarters.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.120]   He's lost money in the last quarter and added six million new users during his tenure, not
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.680]   a hundred.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:58.760]   So that's Casey saying Twitter remains vulnerable to activist investors who might work to force
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:20:59.760]   out Agrowal.
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:06.000]   But then we get into this attention economy and what do you want to build?
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.720]   So if Twitter wants 100 million users, the easiest and fastest way to do that is to engage
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.560]   people with trollish behavior, right?
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.560]   Is to piss people off.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.800]   It's kind of the Facebook playbook.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.760]   So is Twitter saying with this, they're planning on going down that playbook because
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.200]   growth at all costs matters?
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.720]   That's what it looks like.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:32.920]   Well, again, quoting Casey, Musk's presence on the board will help them fight off activist
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.880]   investors because now he has such a big stake and he's on the board.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:44.720]   He can, if single handedly say to the shareholders, I will beat Elliot's offer or anybody else's
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.800]   offer.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:52.240]   So his status is both the platform's largest shareholder and most influential board level.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:58.080]   Let member will likely give him soft power that exceeds his technical authority.
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:02.160]   It did help the stock price up 27% so shareholders will like that.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.880]   And it by the way, it's continuing to go up.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.240]   It wasn't just a bump.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.440]   It's continuing to go up.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.040]   Casey thinks that he might be right that Musk is a supporter of the decentralized platform
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:18.720]   that Dorsey was talking about before he left and Agro wants to do the Fediverse.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.320]   That would be interesting.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.320]   No, that would be interesting.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.040]   If a loose guy happens, then that makes me very happy.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:29.040]   And that would be one way to answer that criticism of censorship as well.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.240]   Just as on Mastodon, anybody can...
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.880]   Beach is a party layer.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.960]   So if that GAB is unmasted on, truth social is running unmasted on.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.560]   It's not part of the Fediverse, but it's running on the Mastodon software.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:48.000]   So the most important thing though is that Musk's really kind of first official act as
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   a board member was to put that edit poll button up.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.760]   And Agro wall said, "Okay, we got an edit button."
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:03.320]   So the edit button will roll out, I think, over the next few days.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.920]   But there's been some complaints about that too.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:12.160]   In fact, my wife asked me, "Well, I know you're going to play devil's advocate on twig today."
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.160]   So what's your real opinion on the edit button?
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.680]   Yeah, here it comes.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:20.000]   But I'm going to wait in here, guys, what you all say.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Well, Twitter is...
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Go ahead and say...
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.240]   Sorry, Twitter has always pointed out that the edit button makes it hard for people.
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.600]   You can go back in and change what you said, which is an Athometa kind of what the platform
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.160]   was designed to do.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.960]   Yeah, Lisa said, "Facebook's got an edit button.
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.200]   My blog has an edit button.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.440]   Why shouldn't Twitter have an edit button?
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.440]   What do you think?
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.600]   I'm sort of half and half on this.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:49.200]   I like the premise of it not being editable because of context and things of that nature.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:54.480]   But at the same time, I use Twitter blue, and I enjoy that aspect of, "Oh crap, I have
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   a typo in there.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.840]   Let me fix that real quick and then hit send."
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.840]   Right.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.840]   Well, and that's not really an edit button.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.280]   The edit has that too, and I do too.
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.720]   Yeah, it's just a wait.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.720]   Look at it again.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   You got 30 seconds.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   But that's good.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   I think to me, that's a good solution.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   I dig that.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.720]   I can't look at it.
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.040]   Twitter blue folks will get the first shot at the edit button.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.040]   So keep an eye.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.000]   Am I the only person still using Twitter blue?
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   I still like it.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   No, I still use it.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.240]   We're all Twitter blue members.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.240]   There are also Twitter blue subscribers.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.000]   We're all blue.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   What about you, Jeff?
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.840]   Edit button, pro or con?
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.080]   So a few thoughts.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:34.120]   One is I think that an edit button with no record of it is a mistake because it's another
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.120]   tool for disinformation.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:41.280]   So the button that shows you clearly what has been changed, I think has real benefit.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.640]   It could say I made a mistake.
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.160]   You can say I'm stupid and I made a typo.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.160]   But here I am.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   I recognize that.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.160]   I think that would actually improve the ethic.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.160]   How would you show them?
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.160]   Same way you would.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.160]   Same way you do it in size.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.400]   You can do a cross out or you can do a different color for Addy.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:00.840]   So maybe I would argue that that's kind of what Twitter has right now.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.240]   You just do another tweet saying, sorry, typo and you do another tweet.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.480]   It has to be in your real tweet.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.400]   It has to be in your real tweet.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.400]   In context.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.400]   So let me keep going.
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.160]   Now I wonder if you could do an alt text.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.320]   Yeah, you could across out.
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.320]   Would that work, Jeff?
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.000]   Yeah, I think there's a few options here.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.960]   So another thing that I product guy at Twitter came on today is give me suggestions.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.680]   So I wrote like four tweets suggesting things.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.740]   I think another way to look at this is as an update, not an edit that I could attach
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:36.680]   something to a tweet and say oops, I made a mistake or here's a fix or whatever.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:42.620]   The problem I think that they're facing here is the architecture of it that RSS, the tweets
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:45.520]   go out and they're out of the control of Twitter.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.520]   They're on somebody else's reader.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.380]   Now Twitter got a lot of that, but it still has that.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:54.620]   I think that essential RSS architecture, not calling RSS not exactly where it's out there.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.140]   And especially if you go to blue sky API, things are in a federated world where they're
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:25:59.300]   stored in 100 places.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.800]   Are you going to have to update it in 100 places?
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:07.780]   That becomes a technical challenge, I think, which is really interesting to consider is
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:13.240]   so there's one is there's the transparency and truthfulness challenge of not being used
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:19.280]   for misinformation and try to fool us into thinking somebody said this, but they didn't
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.280]   say it gets critical.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.480]   But the second then is the technical challenge of how would you implement this?
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.120]   And I don't think it's as easy as people think.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:32.320]   I like to edit tag showing up on there just as if I were looking at Slack and someone
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.520]   typed something to me that they had a typo and they go in and fix the typo and it shows
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.280]   edit right there.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.280]   I get it.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:46.640]   The thing Twitter would tell you is that it's not designed to do that.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.360]   It's exactly as you said, Jeff.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.160]   Once a tweet goes out, Twitter in effect loses control of it.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:57.480]   So any edit is going to be imperfect because we can't fix what's already happened.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:03.440]   So an update would have to go back, get that tweet and amend it.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.000]   And that's just not the architecture at all.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.800]   I think there's also the sociological issue, which is what is Twitter?
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   It's not Facebook.
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.120]   It's not a blog.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.760]   It's real time.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:19.720]   And so when you say something, you say it and it's out there and it's done.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.520]   And it's not editable because it's in effect live.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   Okay.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.840]   Should you say it's not a blog yet?
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.920]   There are many people that try to use it as a blog.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.920]   Well, maybe they're misusing it.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.240]   Microblog with that whole thread and feature.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:36.200]   I think the real issue kind of comes down to how you think of Twitter.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:42.320]   And I think because, for instance, politicians use it, which makes it a matter of record,
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.920]   you can't have that's really a big problem with this editing the past.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.920]   Official account.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.920]   It's an official account.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.920]   Whether you like it or not.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.920]   It's a company too, actually.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.840]   It's become an official account.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.280]   So I am dead set against it.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.120]   I think it's a huge mistake.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.000]   It's not what Twitter is all about.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.280]   And if you want that, put it on Facebook, put it on LinkedIn, put it somewhere where
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.280]   you can't edit it.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.440]   But Twitter is a lot.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.640]   It's about being live in real time.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:09.480]   Now Kevin Marks, and we're going to have him on next week and he'll also be on T&W tomorrow.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.560]   So I'll let him speak for himself.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:16.720]   But on his kevinmarks.com blog, he raises another very interesting issue.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:22.040]   For time, Twitter has changed the way you embed a tweet on your blog.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:26.320]   In the past, people would copy and paste or they would take a picture, a screenshot of
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.720]   it and put it on their blog.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.560]   Twitter doesn't want you to do that.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:33.120]   In fact, probably says somewhere deep in the terms of service, you're not supposed to do
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   that.
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:38.600]   What they want you to do is embed and effect a JavaScript linked back to Twitter.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.800]   So that the, that, and in a way, it's a good thing to do because it authenticates it.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.120]   It says, no, no, here's the tweet.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.120]   You can see it's the same.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.480]   I haven't modified it.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.920]   But, but Kevin says, with all the fuss about Twitter's promised edit button and how they
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.320]   might design it, we're missing a disturbing development, Twitter is using its embedded
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:02.280]   JavaScript to edit other people's sites.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.680]   So this is different from an edit button.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.200]   This is a whole separate problem.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.120]   Well, but an edit button would in fact require this.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.520]   It doesn't, how is it implemented, but it could, yes.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:15.040]   Because otherwise, if it implemented, so it didn't tell you that it's been edited,
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.440]   that would be a problem on your site if you did it to prove something.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.440]   Right.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.840]   And if people are using copy and paste or screenshots, edit all you want.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:26.960]   It's, it's not going to change on those websites.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:32.160]   So, and Twitter's strongly encouraging you, you not to do that, to use the JavaScript,
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.680]   which would be kind of a requisite of having an edit button.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:40.360]   You can't edit it unless you can kept, yank bank all of the versions of that tweet that
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.440]   exist out in the universe, fix them and put them back out there.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.920]   And that's the only way you could do this is with an embed, not with a.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.400]   This is tweet, have a URI.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.800]   It does.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:55.160]   So in that case, I could imagine implementation where to go to Ann's point about the, you
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.880]   know, hey, this was something was changed here, button.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.880]   There's an update to this, in a sense.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:04.040]   If you could attach that, then you'd have to require clients to show that.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:09.280]   But for a given URI, there is an added piece of data that says, you know, a bit that says
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.280]   on off, this has been updated or not.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:18.480]   So, there's a long article on Kevin's blog, which I recommend.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:22.000]   And this is, this is, I'm going to show you the screenshot from his blog.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.680]   An example of why this is a bad thing.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.480]   These are tweets from Donald Trump.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:31.760]   If you show my screen, these are tweets, the war on.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:40.000]   So this is an article from Vox about the war on James Comey quoting tweets from Donald
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.320]   Trump, except that that's a blank box because those tweets are gone.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:50.360]   And to come with plain text above the embed.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.800]   This is what the embed looks like now from Kevin's.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.000]   You get a block quote.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.480]   You do get this text, but then you also get the H ref and then the JavaScript renders it.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.240]   There's the JavaScript there that renders it.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:08.160]   The H ref is that link, as you said to the canonical actual tweet.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.600]   That's important too, by the way.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.680]   If you don't have that link, then there's no way to verify on the Twitter site that what
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.000]   you're saying is true.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.240]   If you use the embed though, you get these embeds like this, which are pretty and most
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.120]   sites use them now.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.520]   But it has the negatives, as you can see, of disappearing once that tweet has disappeared.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.680]   And by the way, it doesn't just have to be Twitter banning somebody.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.440]   It could be just Donald Trump taking those down, which he did in fact.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.720]   So now, by the way, this is the cited text.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.520]   This is how that article could look, which is the original tweet content.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:50.920]   So I think if you're going to consider Twitter an important part of the public record, that's
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.440]   another reason not to allow editing.
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:59.200]   Is your real opinion or your this is what I told Lisa.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.200]   I said, I was maybe a little salty.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   We confirmed that.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   That was a little salty.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:10.200]   I don't want Leo editing his opinions.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.200]   I said, and tweets is a terrible idea.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   I understand why users want it because there's a typo or I said some people look at it.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:19.200]   You look like an idiot.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.200]   That's why I would want this because of the typos, but I get it.
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:27.200]   I'm thinking about people that are harassed and they need that record.
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.200]   The show say, Hey, I was harassed by this person on Twitter.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:33.920]   I like that best, the harasser.
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:39.920]   Would you say Elon Musk might be somebody who would benefit from editable tweets?
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.240]   What does the SEC is investigating those tweets?
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.200]   There's no record of those tweets.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.960]   The effect has already been felt.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.320]   He says, I'm all in on Dogecoin.
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:51.320]   Dogecoin goes up.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.800]   He sells his Dogecoin.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.200]   And then it's a Twitter deleted tweet.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.800]   I think Twitter should be a permanent record.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.200]   It's a live, just like our live stream is a permanent record.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.200]   It's live.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   Now we edit.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.720]   Actually, we had it.
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:09.960]   I'll give you a little inside baseball because we had an issue last week where one of our
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.400]   hosts said, Can you cut that part of the show out?
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.440]   Because I said something I wish I hadn't said.
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:21.040]   And without asking me, our editors, because they respect them, took it out.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.680]   And I hit the ceiling and I sent them a number of links.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:30.960]   Jeff backed me up on this and you two stay so you're both trained journalists.
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.960]   We've said?
[00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.960]   No, you're trained journalists.
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.960]   Journalists.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:39.920]   Once it's part of the public record, you can't just amend it.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.160]   At the very least you have to put...
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.160]   You can amend it.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.160]   You just can't erase it.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.160]   Right.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:49.800]   So you at the bottom, you have to say correction, right?
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.280]   Something like that.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.960]   I will say so with blogging, it's changed a little bit.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:59.240]   Even like venerable publications such as Fortune.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.720]   If you do like, what is an accepted typo?
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:07.680]   So not a misspelling of someone's name, but if you put like...
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.680]   I don't know.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:09.680]   You just like spell it out.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.680]   No instead of all.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.680]   I would worry.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.680]   You're wrong.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:14.680]   Or yeah.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.680]   Those kind of things you can correct without...
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:20.080]   We would correct typos without making a fuss over it.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.080]   But we never...
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.960]   If that typo was in someone's name, that's a little bit more.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.960]   Context.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:31.080]   So what I did is I sent the staff this from the University of Southern California Annenberg
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:36.240]   School, their online journalism review, an article rewriting history, should editors
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:39.520]   delete or alter online content?
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.400]   And I think it's kind of a very good example of what happens and why it shouldn't happen
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.640]   and how it should be handled appropriately.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.480]   It's a very good long piece.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:52.320]   So do you think the right to be forgotten is wrong?
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.200]   So that's an interesting question.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.560]   I'll tell you why I think it's wrong, which has nothing to do with this, is it doesn't
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.120]   go to the source.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.040]   It doesn't go to the original article that you're trying to get rid of.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.360]   It goes to Google.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.840]   Why is it Google's responsibility?
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.360]   They're just the search engine.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.360]   It should be the...
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.360]   If you don't like what somebody said about you in the past or you want to bury it, you've
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.560]   got to go to the search engine.
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.200]   So that's what's wrong with that.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.960]   I'm curious to hear what Stacy's victory says about this, but all of you, there was a
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:26.080]   discussion on Twitter recently with journalism ethics people, believe it or not, they exist.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.600]   And about the idea of basically doing right to be forgotten with newspapers, that someone
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.240]   comes and says, "Listen, I was arrested 30 years ago for something that comes up in search.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.240]   I want to go to the source.
[00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:40.720]   I want to go to the newspaper and I want this taken down."
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:41.720]   What's your...
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.600]   And I've lived a perfect life since then.
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.040]   I made a stupid mistake 30 years ago.
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.040]   No.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   What do you say?
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.040]   No.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.040]   Okay.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.760]   This is actually one of the things that I think is really important.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:59.280]   And I would love to see legislation actually on this, which is under a certain age, maybe
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.560]   18, maybe 21, I think you should be able to do it.
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.520]   And I say that as I feel like kids...
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:07.520]   That's enshrined in...
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.520]   Hold up.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.240]   I know, but it's not.
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.720]   On social media, it's not the case.
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.680]   It is among law and the law, of course.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.680]   Right.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:18.680]   So I think that's okay.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:23.840]   30 years ago, if you ran over someone's cat and someone wrote a story about it and you
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:29.680]   now want to work for the SPCA and your name comes up as a cat killer, I'm sorry, buddy.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.680]   It was very elaborate there, Stacy.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:34.360]   I was like, "That was quite a yard."
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.360]   You just told me.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.360]   I didn't want to...
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.360]   I didn't want to...
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.360]   It's very specific.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.360]   That is.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.360]   It is.
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.600]   I was just trying to think of a crime that wasn't...
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.680]   I mean, it was bad, but if you have a dog not a cat, it's even a bit of a rush.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.440]   You can confess to it.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.600]   No, no, there's no history of cat murdering.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.600]   I just...
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   I don't want to...
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.600]   No, I agree that...
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.600]   Sorry, sorry.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.600]   This is...
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.600]   This is...
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.600]   Miners is something completely separate.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.600]   Make it a good point.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.600]   But miners is something completely separate.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   Yes, of course.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.600]   But what if you...
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.560]   And by the way, the law does have also provisions for expunging your record even as an adult,
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:07.560]   but not the newspaper.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.560]   That's the law.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.560]   But not a newspaper.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.880]   The law can't tell the newspaper to do it.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.880]   But it's interesting that we do...
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.680]   And there is a category right now about mugshots.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.680]   So if you get arrested and have a mugshot, those can be published online and follow you
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.120]   forever, even if you're not convicted of crime.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.840]   So then the burden becomes on you to explain what happened.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:33.120]   And there are people who are like, "Is that really fair?"
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.720]   I honestly think the public record is a public record.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:37.720]   But I...
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.720]   I agree.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.640]   I think they're also extenuating circumstances.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.320]   And there's history.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:47.600]   Maybe there should be a statute of limitations on social media posts.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:53.560]   Honestly, every social media network lets you delete stuff.
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:57.720]   And some people go through and delete all of their tweets just as a matter of hygiene.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.600]   I do that.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.880]   I deleted everything except for the last two years or something.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.480]   Just a matter of hygiene.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.440]   Not because the problem is that looks like a guilty action.
[00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:15.360]   So in journalism, your lawyers will tell you, for notes, for example, whatever note-taking
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:21.000]   strategy you have actually, they're like, "If you have to have a strategy and stick
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.800]   with it so you don't appear guilty.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.160]   So my strategy is to keep my notes for two years and then dump all of them."
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.600]   But you have to be consistent.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.600]   That way, yes.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   And so that...
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:36.240]   I mean, if you're consistent with your tweet deletions, then you're fine.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.800]   But if you suddenly wake up one day and...
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:44.720]   Here's what I also sent our staff from the Globe and Mail, which is the big Toronto newspaper.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:50.840]   The Globe and Mail generally does not unpublish content or remove details such as names from
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.520]   our websites and archives other than for legal reasons.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:59.040]   But it does correct and update articles as necessary if there's a significant factual
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.040]   area.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.680]   And there is, though, and interestingly, there's an appeal process and you have to make it
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.680]   in writing to the public editor and then a committee of editors and lawyers will review
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.680]   the request and they'll be response.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:16.960]   I think it's probably a good idea to have some sort of appeal process.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:20.720]   Because there are cases where you shouldn't...
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:29.040]   There's stuff you did when you're 20, maybe you're a legal adult, but you're 65 now and
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:31.280]   that cat would deserve to be killed.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.280]   And...
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:33.280]   What?
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:36.440]   No, just be oddly specific once again.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:42.000]   Well, here, I'll give you an example of something.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:49.440]   We actually, on my blog, we unpublished a story for the holiday weekend not too long
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.440]   ago.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.520]   That was President's Day weekend, I believe.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.920]   And we had published something.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:40:00.720]   It went up on the site and then I got a frantic email from the CFO of the company.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:04.160]   It was like, Stacy, you published this, it's so wrong, you could burn someone's house
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.160]   down.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.800]   So it became a safety issue.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.720]   And I was like, okay, well, I can't...
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:10.560]   Keep the cats in the front.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:15.120]   I can't delete the story because we don't unpublish up, right?
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:18.800]   He's like, I was like, so I need to fix it, but I need to know how to fix it.
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   So...
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.400]   And he's like, I'm getting on a plane, I can't.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:27.920]   And so what happened was for there, I actually unpublished the story for like a day while
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.120]   he got back to me with it.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.440]   And I hated doing it, but I was also like...
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.440]   You don't want to...
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.440]   I don't want to burn anyone's house down.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.920]   Yeah, you don't want to cut house fires either.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.520]   And it's fully in your power to do something.
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:46.280]   Right, but it was, I mean, it's an off use case and we basically rewrote the entire story
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:51.840]   and then had to append an update that was like, hey, we screwed this up, blah, blah, blah.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.760]   And it's horrifying when those things happen because you're like, oh, I screwed up, but
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.440]   at the same time, you...
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:40:59.440]   I don't know.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:05.160]   The point is, by the way, Patrick Delahandy, who was our engineer here and our coder and
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.080]   knows these things says, you can delete it, but all you're deleting is, this is in the
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:10.240]   Discord.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.800]   All you're deleting is the public record.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.520]   Twitter can still see deleted tweets.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.640]   So if the law enforcement wants to see them, they're still available.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.960]   I do think the fact that Twitter allows deletion is a, that's a form of editing.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.200]   I mean, that's just deleting it.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.200]   So...
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.640]   They also tell you that, like, you'll see that the response to this has been deleted.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.880]   So they tell you that something has been deleted.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.880]   You can't...
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.880]   Not a full tweet.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:38.440]   So if I just do a tweet...
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:41.280]   No one responds to it, sure.
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.280]   If there's a response, you're right.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.400]   You have to say this has been deleted by you.
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.800]   That's probably why Twitter keeps a copy of it, kind of think of it.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.800]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:50.800]   That's right.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:54.200]   But if there were no responses and I delete something, if a tree falls in the forest and
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:59.480]   there's no one there to hear it, it doesn't, it's gone effectively, except for Twitter.
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.480]   Yes, except for the...
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:02.040]   And I just want everybody to know.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.040]   I did it.
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.600]   I have never murdered any cats, ever.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:07.600]   Dogs are so short.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.600]   Me too.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   I have never murdered any cats.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.600]   I did.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:14.560]   I did once run over a turtle while driving to Austin.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.560]   Thank you for your tutorial.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:20.160]   And bearing your soul on our show for that, that's good.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:26.640]   So now, actually, now that people are mentioning this thing, if you allowed deletions, why wouldn't
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.640]   you allow editing?
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.080]   Well, because I think you shouldn't allow deletions.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.040]   I come to think of it.
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.880]   Isn't the theory of editor is this is the live real time screen?
[00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:41.000]   No, no, you have to allow deletions, like, because if I can't credibly edit something,
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.680]   like if I put that tweet, like my Burn Your House Down story, if I had done that, it would
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.640]   tweet, I can't edit it in the tweet.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.160]   And so what if someone retweeted the inaccurate information?
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.960]   That's why you have deletions.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.960]   Okay.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:58.360]   And, okay, it's interesting question.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.600]   It's just still an edit.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:05.640]   So it really is Twitter, a kind of a special kind of social media.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:10.320]   And I've always thought of it as kind of a real time social media, but, but, okay, let's
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.560]   look at Facebook.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:17.680]   Facebook is still pretty diagram big and active all day long, yet they have these edit functions
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.320]   and people put all kinds of outlandish information on that.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:28.800]   I think the reason is that feature that your Facebook post lives only on Facebook, right?
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.440]   Yes, it's a lot easier.
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.040]   Really?
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.880]   There's no third party clients.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:41.520]   There's no, uh, adding allow you to like, because they don't have to go back to Facebook.
[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.720]   Oh, I didn't put a link to it.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:44.720]   Didn't know that.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.720]   Okay.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.720]   I don't use Facebook either though.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.720]   Yeah, I don't either, but I think that's the right.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.720]   So that's the right.
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.080]   And that makes sense because that means, uh, there's no cost to it.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.520]   There's no, yeah, there's no cost.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.080]   They, you know, they change it and they change it and that's changed forever.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:02.480]   There's no change to think Kevin's problems raised to here, which is that if these things
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.680]   are going to disappear, I saw journalists say, well, what's going to happen is newspapers
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.680]   are going to stop embedding tweets.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.880]   And instead they're going to do screen graphs.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.480]   Screen graphs, right.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.520]   And that's an ethical problem people have because it doesn't include the link back.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.520]   You can't see the original.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.800]   Well, you could make it a link.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:21.040]   You could make a screen grab plus a link, right?
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.040]   That's easy.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.440]   That's no, but that's a good one.
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.800]   A lot of effort to do that.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.240]   No, no more effort than a screen.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.360]   It is journalists are notoriously in a hurry and lazy.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.440]   I'll give you that.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:36.600]   And I have to, I was just looking to see how far back my Twitter stream goes.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:40.120]   I did delete the first six years, but it's start, but 2012 is here.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:45.040]   So I guess I better get, I didn't, I'm not consistent.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:46.760]   That's my oldest tweet.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.920]   Now I kind of regret deleting my first tweet.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.920]   Or was your first tweet.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.480]   It's in the Library of Congress.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.480]   That's the other thing.
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.480]   That's another thing.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.480]   It lives forever, doesn't it?
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.480]   As in the public record.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:58.480]   In an ad archive.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.480]   That's interesting.
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.480]   You're a public record.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.480]   You're a public.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:05.120]   We, I wrote about this in public parts long ago is what we have to do as a society is
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.120]   learn to be more forgiving or stupid mistakes.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:09.600]   Ah, they're not there yet.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.600]   I don't know.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:15.000]   Again, I still think about like the harassment side of things and especially when it comes
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.840]   to teenagers or whatever that are using social media and they get some harassing message
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:28.160]   from another teenager and they go to report it and that other teenager is like, well,
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.160]   it doesn't exist.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:32.200]   I deleted it, but yet I have a screenshot of it.
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:35.600]   It's, there's got to be a line somewhere where we can keep this stuff and keep people
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.600]   safe too.
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:38.600]   Indeed.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:43.040]   Now I wanted to leave all my old tweets.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:44.040]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.800]   I thought you wanted to keep them like 20 seconds ago.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.360]   You said you wanted to keep them.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:52.880]   That's until I read them and they're like, Oh geez, how do you go about, how do you go
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.040]   about mass delete and tweets?
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.040]   That's such a script.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.040]   It's a script.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.720]   You have to, it's a script because there's no built in tool to do it.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.720]   Oh, okay.
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:05.080]   So yeah, in effect, it has to load and delete, load and delete, load and delete.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.080]   Okay.
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:07.880]   It's not a very good system.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.280]   Twitter does not keep you any way to do that.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:17.840]   So like delete direct messages, I have direct messages that I try to just clean up.
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.840]   Yeah.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:23.400]   But it's a pain in the butt just to delete those.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.680]   So can I ask a question?
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.680]   No.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.120]   So come blue now.
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:33.280]   Get you started anyway.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.800]   You're canceled, Jeff.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   You are just can't.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.400]   You are so canceled.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.840]   Sorry, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:42.560]   I'm not sorry.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:46.120]   Go ahead, sir.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.960]   Killer.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:53.200]   I think you have, that's a chilling effect, I think.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:54.200]   It is.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:55.200]   It is.
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.200]   I'm chilling.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.200]   Tensor ship.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:58.200]   Come on, Jeff.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.200]   Go ahead.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.200]   That's the question.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:06.720]   So architecturally, if you think about blue sky or you think about discord or mastodon,
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.800]   and you want to kill something, you're going to get in trouble for it.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.400]   You were wrong, whatever.
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.960]   Is it harder?
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:16.960]   Is it impossible?
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.120]   Do you have to kill it 100 places?
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:23.040]   What is the architecture of these of these federated distributed things look like?
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.840]   Just the things that we already have.
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:29.640]   If it's truly federated, you can't get rid of it.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.480]   I don't know if Twitter still has that architecture though.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.160]   So like when you were talking about that, I was like, Oh, I mean, do they still have
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:36.160]   that?
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.160]   I really thought they were architected.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:41.360]   So isn't TweetDeck a client separate client?
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:46.240]   Yeah, but you can, I mean, you can control things like, is it truly federated or are
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:47.720]   they just serving up an API?
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:48.720]   Well, there are third party.
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:49.720]   There's something up an API.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.440]   TweetDeck is a bad example because it's owned by Twitter.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:55.360]   Yeah, but let's say a third party client.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:00.160]   Yeah, they're getting, I don't know because, you know, one of the reasons I like third
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:04.040]   party clients is because I get the chronological feed and I don't get ads.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.720]   So yeah, I guess they're using the API, but they're just getting the tweets.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:11.920]   So then because once you reload the API, once it's deleted, they would get it because that's
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.920]   not actually better.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.520]   I mean, an API isn't federated.
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.840]   So that's, I just don't know though.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.280]   So I can't really say anything.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.120]   Otherwise it'd be like, just theoretically of what's the world we want?
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:25.160]   I may ask it differently here.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.480]   Do we, because Leo's, Leo's arguing spontaneously for the, it's the record.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.480]   You said it in public.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.480]   That's it.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.480]   Live with it.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.480]   It's there.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.960]   You put it on something like the blockchain.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:38.800]   And I'm not always the blockchain is notalations.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:46.280]   So, well, and if you try, like even if you deleted it on a client side, you would have
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:49.960]   a record of it being that's still accessible, right?
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:50.960]   So that's scary.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.040]   But if you made it harder to find, I don't know.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:57.560]   I mean, it really depends on the tool sets that we have available to access it, right?
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:04.340]   Because in some cases it'd be like the equivalent of saying, hey, like if back before the internet,
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:10.240]   if I murdered a cat and the newspaper wrote an article, eventually that article makes
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.180]   it back to the microfiche section and nobody really looks it up, right?
[00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:18.360]   On the internet, that's not the case because the microfiche is just a search away.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:23.640]   So if you had something that was like on a blockchain, but not accessible, it's still
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:28.760]   be available to people who knew how to look, it just wouldn't be available to like someone,
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.440]   some random person who's Googling your name.
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.200]   Does that make sense?
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.360]   But these are important.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.960]   This is to your point often Stacy about, but we got to talk about it before we do it.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.560]   These are important decisions to be made, design decisions to be made about what we think
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.880]   of the public record.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:51.480]   And as a journalist, I generally agree with Leo that it's out there, it's out there.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.560]   And I don't like right to be forgotten for that reason.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:01.800]   But you have an exception for young people, the convenient exception for a mistake being
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.760]   made, there could be an exception for being found innocent.
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:12.360]   Honestly, if you're on Twitter, I think I would like to see it be part of the deal that
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:16.440]   if you're on Twitter, you know what you're doing and you're handling a loaded gun, we're
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.760]   just giving you a loaded gun.
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:21.360]   If you shoot yourself in the foot, you shoot yourself in the foot, not my problem.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:25.920]   Yeah, then there's the same aspect of Twitter giving you the option of protected tweets
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.920]   too.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.920]   Like what is, what is this?
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.200]   What's the word?
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:34.480]   You can't, can you protect a tweet or just your whole account?
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:35.480]   You can't.
[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.280]   Well, it's your whole account, but I mean, you still use this public platform.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.320]   Although you can't tweet this platform.
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.600]   Only people mention this tweet.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.200]   Oh, that's only they can respond.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.200]   That's reply.
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.200]   That's for replies.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.280]   Does an account that's not public anymore?
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:51.240]   They just totally lock it down, which I have done.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:54.000]   And so are they allowed to delete their tweets?
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   Are they allowed to delete their tweets?
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   And then what's?
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.560]   I mean, it's a lot of different.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.400]   That's a good point.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:05.240]   Because they're protecting it because they want it to be so-called private, right?
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.560]   I don't think Twitter should allow private accounts.
[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:11.000]   Well, maybe it has waited, by the way.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.640]   Yeah, she's been on Twitter.
[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:13.640]   Oh, is Lisa tweeting?
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.640]   Yeah, she's tweeting.
[00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:19.160]   Being subtweeted now, she waited and she said, if you can delete a tweet, then you should
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:20.480]   be able to edit it.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.480]   Just show them before and after.
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:24.400]   Limit it to one edit.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.400]   That would work for me.
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.400]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.400]   Oh, that's good.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.320]   One edit with a record and show the before and after.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.320]   So yeah, I was an idiot.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:37.120]   I made a typo or I learned a lesson or I was wrong or I don't want your cat house to burn
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:39.720]   down or whatever.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.080]   Good for Lisa.
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.080]   That's the right answer.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:46.320]   You better believe it.
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.920]   Says her husband.
[00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:55.920]   I love the tweet and response from the VP comms at Substack.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.400]   Did you see this whole story?
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:58.400]   I put that up there.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:05.840]   So Lula Ching a survey who is the Vice President of comms at Substack, tweet Substack is hiring
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.040]   dot dot dot.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:11.480]   If you're a Twitter employee who's considering resigning because you're worried about Elon
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:19.680]   Musk pushing for less regulated speech, please do not come work here to which on Substack
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:20.680]   Alex Perini.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:25.880]   I don't know if you've seen this response as VP of comms for the newsletter company.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:31.920]   It's really important to make sure everyone associates our brand with being a huge unaccountable.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:33.920]   Dipstick.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.640]   Dipstick.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:44.080]   So this is obviously a parody post on Substack well written by Alex.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.680]   He says, and this is saying is in her voice, and not to brag, but I think I'm pretty good
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:52.440]   at my job, which is why so many people understand our company is about conflating the conflict
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:57.880]   of the concept of free and open debate with being a brain jackass all the time.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:02.840]   One way we get this message across is by having a bunch of brain jackasses on our platform.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.560]   But as a comms professional, I assure you, this is not.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.560]   Enough.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:10.880]   There were a bunch of brain jackasses on blog spot, but no one ever thought of that as a
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:16.680]   platform specializing in bringing jackasses and making my job even harder.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.520]   Our platform is not exclusively home to bringing jackasses.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:25.600]   Lots of thoughtful, intelligent, conscientious people use our platform and even rely on
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.080]   us for their livelihoods.
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:31.520]   My job is to make sure no one in the broader internet using public associates the work
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:34.600]   of those people with our corporate brand.
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:38.440]   Every day I log in with one mission to ensure that people understand that we here at the
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:46.200]   newsletter company do not just provide a platform for dipsticks and trolls, but that dipsticks
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.560]   and trolls are an essential part of our corporate culture.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:54.760]   Anyway, it's a very funny parody of this.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:55.760]   I don't know.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:54:00.200]   And he'll dash killed his sub stack account because of that because of the tweet, the
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:03.400]   Lulu Chang original tweet.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.400]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.400]   So what?
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.640]   So why did he kill his account?
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:07.640]   So why is this legit?
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:11.840]   He wouldn't say because he just he didn't even he referred to it only as a sub.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:12.840]   He subtweeted it.
[00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.800]   Oh, they didn't give the full rationale.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:19.440]   But I think there's always been a lot of criticism of sub stack because of the kinds of people
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:24.280]   they intentionally pay to be on a sub stack.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:29.480]   They like Twitter apparently seem to have what this Hank Green responded to my tweet.
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:33.440]   I said sub stack reveals its essence layer by layer Hank Green responded, disagreement
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:38.040]   is not tolerated on our pro free speech.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:49.920]   Honestly, if if Elon Musk really does start to direct what happens to Twitter, I think
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:52.520]   the real risk is that it will be the end of Twitter.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:53.800]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:54.800]   He could ruin it.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:55.960]   And maybe that's his desire.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.040]   Maybe it's maybe it's Peter Teal time.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.480]   Maybe this I mean, that's the other thing about this.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:01.200]   This is this is very rich people.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.000]   This is part of what Stacy said earlier too.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.440]   It's rich people, rich boys who could throw around their weight.
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:12.360]   And I just finished an amazing book called the newspaper axis about the six press barons,
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:19.160]   Hearst McCormick, Rothermere, Patterson Patterson, and one other I've always knew I forget who
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:21.000]   supported Hitler who's supposed to have a swash.
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.680]   I was going to ask was that a swash?
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.920]   The guy just saw on there?
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:24.920]   Yep.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:28.920]   This is about World War II and supporting in some cases supporting Hitler in some cases
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:33.480]   supporting fascism and in most cases opposing the entry into World War II.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:38.360]   Terrible anti-Semitism out of the New York Daily News for example.
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:43.840]   So those were rich people who could own the barrels of an ink and could do what they wanted
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:44.840]   to.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:49.840]   So the issue here I was called by the financial times about the story today.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:52.320]   The issue to me too is not so much about censorship.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.960]   It's about compelled speech.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:59.240]   What we're going to find is if Elon forces Twitter to carry things that Twitter in its
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:05.080]   own ethical standards would otherwise not under the guise of free speech, then it's
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.960]   compelled speech and it's not free speech and it's going to ruin the environment for
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.360]   all of us, that's what I worry about.
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:11.360]   What did Dorsey have to say about this?
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.840]   So we go to also to Jack Dorsey.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:16.600]   Yeah, so I was going to ask what did Dorsey have to say about all of this because he was
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:22.560]   tweeting here recently about the platform and how he seems to have a part in all of this
[00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:26.080]   I wonder if he knew what was going on here because what he regretted in that, it's a
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:31.320]   good question now, is he regretted helping to create a centralized rather than decentralized
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:32.320]   internet.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.440]   I thought that was such an interesting tweet in the summit.
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.160]   We talked about that on the Sunday.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.560]   Do you think he kind of knew ahead of time what was going on?
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:41.160]   He must have had to.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:44.160]   I think this is a problem with centralized is you can take over centralized.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.080]   You can't take over decentralized.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:51.200]   You can fill it with crap, but you can't take it over to our prior.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.360]   So do you think one of the things Musk might do, for instance, is reinstate Donald Trump's
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.120]   account?
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.320]   That's what I fear.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.320]   Be good.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:01.320]   You know what?
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.320]   Be good for business.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.680]   That's why the stock went up.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:04.680]   Yep.
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:05.680]   Be good for business.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.680]   That's probably what the market was thinking.
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:07.680]   All right.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:08.680]   Well, who's next on the board?
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:11.120]   Rihanna, she's got 80 million followers.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.520]   She's going to be on the Twitter board next.
[00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:14.880]   I would enjoy that actually.
[00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:17.040]   She'd do a better job, honestly.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.200]   All right.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:19.840]   Let's take a little break.
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.200]   Rihanna versus Elon Musk.
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.200]   Bring it.
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:25.000]   I'd like to see that.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.640]   Rihanna versus Donald Trump.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:27.640]   Bring it.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:29.640]   Boy.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.640]   More to come in just a bit.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:35.720]   Oh, let me just before I do that, let me read the, because we were referred to it.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.000]   We didn't say what the tweet was from Jack Dorsey.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.760]   This was on April 2nd.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.120]   So this was four days ago.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:47.360]   By the way, he by then might well have known that Elon Musk was buying up stock because
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.560]   that was reported on March 15th.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:54.760]   The days of Usenet, that was the, the kind of the open message boards and the only days
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.240]   of the internet, IRC.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:03.480]   We still use that, by the way, as our general, the web, even email with PGP were amazing.
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:09.480]   Centralizing discovery and identity into corporations really damaged the internet.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:13.320]   I realized I'm partially the blame and regret it.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.560]   It's kind of an elegy.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.560]   It really is.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.560]   It's really is.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.560]   Wow.
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.560]   Wow.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.520]   So it might be, you have a message, Leo.
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:24.360]   I just noticed you have a message that could be very important.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:25.360]   Wherever.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.560]   And I always read those messages.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:27.560]   Is it my wife?
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.560]   Very important.
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.560]   Do I, am my wife calling me?
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:31.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:36.160]   And I went, hold on a second.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:38.320]   How do you see, what do you mean a message?
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.320]   How do you see that?
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:40.320]   I don't understand.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.320]   I love that little little mailbox.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:42.960]   It says message and had one.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.960]   He taught how much he did.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:44.960]   Oh.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.960]   Someone said he knew a direct message.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:46.960]   That's very important.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:47.960]   He couldn't be.
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:48.960]   He wouldn't even lottery.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:49.960]   Yeah, no.
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.760]   At least they wanted to know we're going to have for dinner tonight.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:53.760]   All right.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.760]   All right.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.800]   No, she does not message me on Twitter, by the way.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.800]   We're not that.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:58.800]   We're not animals.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:58:59.800]   No.
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:02.760]   She just comes and yells at you from about telling me to be away.
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:04.400]   Just right over there.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.400]   Hey.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:07.400]   She's home, working from home right now.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.640]   Oh, my joke interrupted.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:13.040]   Do you think that the Jack's right, that the centralized internet was?
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.040]   I think there's a lot.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.760]   You know, we talked about this on Sunday.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:19.280]   I made a good panel on Twitter for this.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.040]   There's a lot of nostalgia about the good old days.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.520]   I look back.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:25.880]   I look back at the early days of Twitter with great nostalgia.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:27.640]   But then I realized kind of it late.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.000]   It's just because it was just me and my friends.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.320]   And you were number one on Twitter.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:33.320]   Again.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.160]   It was a small group.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.960]   It was just, you know, that's why it was fun.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.160]   It was just us.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.960]   No, we haven't gone to dad yet, Miss Stacy.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:42.960]   I know.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.760]   I'm like, what is happening?
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:49.760]   This is an ad for truth social, Stacy.
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:50.760]   We're talking about.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.760]   No, it's just terrible.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:52.760]   I'm like, okay, go, go.
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:53.760]   Did you get a waffle or not?
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:54.760]   I did put it in the toaster oven.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:55.760]   Nothing important.
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:56.760]   Nothing important happened.
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:58.760]   Do you remember, though, Jeff?
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:09.760]   I don't remember if it was '96.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:14.200]   It was called the summer of AOL, where we had the internet to ourselves.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.360]   And then America Online announced that they were going to give everybody an AOL access
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.040]   to the internet.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.800]   And all of us were going, oh, crap.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.040]   No, no, we don't want dad.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.040]   Oh, God.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.520]   Real people are coming.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.520]   So I'm going to stop.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.520]   We were all stopped.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.520]   Wow.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.920]   So there's a certain amount of snobbery when you say.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:32.760]   And again, I'll recommend this last week.
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:36.720]   Bamboozled with the revolution, which is kind of the story of that, is big media coming
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.320]   in and making the internet ruining it.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:46.780]   So I just face it, any social group is best when it's small, and it's friends and people
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:47.780]   you like.
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.780]   And it's always going to be better.
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:51.560]   I remember they said that about Instagram coming to Android.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:52.560]   Oh, wow.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.560]   Right.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:55.560]   That's right.
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.560]   That was a classic thing to do.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.040]   Hey, that's exactly right.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.040]   That was your right.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.560]   I forgot about that.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.040]   Our show today, Go Get Your Waffle.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.800]   Our show today brought to you by Stacy, not the rest of you.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.680]   You stay right there in your chair.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   Crap.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:16.440]   Brought to you by Melissa to ensure your business as a success.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.640]   You need to have good records, right?
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.280]   Records of your customers, records of your suppliers.
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:26.240]   You need to be able to contact people with the right phone number, the right email, the
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.240]   right address.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.040]   Well, here's the bad news.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:34.480]   Your data is withering away even as we speak.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.720]   People move addresses change names change emails change.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:38.720]   Phone numbers change.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:44.400]   That's why you need Melissa, a leading provider of global data quality and address management
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   solutions.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.640]   37 years they've been doing this.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.080]   I think that's probably means that they go back to the zip plus four days.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.040]   Remember, you'd enter in the zip code and they would tell you, well, what's the plus
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.040]   four?
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:58.840]   Something like that or even maybe just zip codes.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.720]   But over the time they've become much more than just zip codes.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:10.120]   You can verify addresses, emails, phone numbers, even names in real time with Melissa.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:15.960]   It's a global address verification service that works in 240 plus countries and territories.
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:18.320]   I think it's kind of amazing.
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:24.160]   More than 10,000 businesses call Melissa the address experts and a renewal rate of 92%
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.960]   says, yeah, people are pretty darn happy.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.600]   Maybe it has something to do with the fact that the typical return on investment for Melissa
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.000]   customers is 25%.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.640]   By the way, big year last year, they had a record at Melissa.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:43.760]   They capped off the year by reaching a milestone 30 billion with a B North American address
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.200]   lookups in the year.
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.960]   That's the most in its history.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:50.840]   I bet you'll beat that in 2022.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:54.000]   Melissa can also eliminate duplicate customer information in your database.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.400]   That can be almost as bad as having the wrong information.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:01.320]   Said two catalogs as the same address, ahh, waste of money, waste of time.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.320]   And frankly, it annoys the clients, your customers.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.880]   Melissa's data matching helps eliminate clutter and duplicates and ensures the accuracy of
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.880]   your database.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.680]   They can do batch address cleaning.
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:15.040]   In fact, you can even upload it to their FTP site and then download it.
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.040]   That's one way.
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.040]   One of many ways you can use Melissa.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:22.240]   You can also do it on prem with your own client right there on your own computers.
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.640]   There's a web service.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.600]   There's software as a service.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:32.000]   You can even have an app on iOS and Android to do address name and other lookups.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.440]   That's a good name for it is lookups.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.440]   Lookups app.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.640]   So go ahead and get that on your device.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.240]   A lot of people use Melissa for identity verification.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:45.160]   It's got a security impact too.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.960]   You'll reduce risk and share compliance.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.800]   Keep customers happy by making sure they're the right person.
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.800]   They're the actual customer.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:55.400]   You can do geo coding, convert addresses into latitude and longitude.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:00.880]   And you can remove up to 95% of bad email addresses from your database.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.880]   And don't worry.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.720]   Your data is absolutely private and secure.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.520]   Melissa knows that's important to you.
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:11.320]   That's why they continually undergo independent security audits to reinforce their commitment
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:15.240]   to data security and privacy and compliance requirements.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:20.920]   They are SOC 2 HIPAA GDPR compliant and great support from really nice people.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.760]   In fact, if you sign up for a service level agreement, you can get 24/7 support from their
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:28.400]   global support center.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.960]   Melissa goes above and beyond.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.280]   They're really great.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.800]   Data quality magic quadrant.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.800]   Second year in a row from Gartner.

[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.080]   quality software.

[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:08.200]   Thank you, Melissa, for supporting this week in Google.

[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.160]   Melissa.com/twit.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.160]   TWIT.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:18.720]   Thank you, Melissa.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.080]   What kind of awful ego?
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.640]   Lego, my ego?
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:24.360]   She's muted.
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.680]   She didn't want us to hear the whole bunch.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.720]   Instead of a waffle, I am doing a...
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.680]   What are they called?
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:31.680]   Stroop awful.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.680]   We'll see in a second.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.680]   A now cake?
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.680]   It's a fun, fatty cake.
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:37.680]   Protein cake.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.840]   Love our new June oven, by the way.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:40.840]   Protein cake.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.840]   Protein cake.
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.840]   Yeah, they're like cognac.
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.840]   So, nasty.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.840]   Perogi?
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.560]   You'll see it a second.
[01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.240]   They're going to come...
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.400]   I'm getting a delivery once it's finished.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:56.480]   I used to get a perogi every day before work.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.080]   So, somebody said you're starting to look like a perogi.
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:03.280]   That's a nice little minor.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.600]   Mine is my own business.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.240]   No, I'm really cut off all perogies.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:14.440]   I mean, it is the best carb loading option there is.
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:18.280]   Well, when you put it that way, maybe not...
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.280]   Like potato?
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:20.280]   Potato.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:24.720]   You know, wrapped in pastries.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:28.640]   Jose Andres, who is in Ukraine right now, I guess, to help.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:30.560]   He's been pulling, I think.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.560]   Oh, he's in Poland?
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.560]   Okay, but he's helping out.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.720]   I think, well, maybe he's been in Ukraine too.
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.720]   I'm not training people.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.400]   He was in Ukraine, but I think he may have rushed by now.
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.200]   He was using Apple Maps, apparently.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:45.040]   He said Apple Maps keeps sending me into a Russian controlled territories.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:53.400]   No, I think that that's asking a lot, given that the changing status as they come back,
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:57.000]   go back and forth to say, "Apple Maps, you should know that you're routing me through
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   a Russian controlled territory."
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.600]   You might want some better intelligence than that.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:09.840]   Apple did not immediately respond for comment.
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:17.760]   He did say that he likes to use translation technology built into WhatsApp.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:18.920]   Google's even better, isn't it?
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:19.920]   Oh, actually, no.
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:20.920]   You know what?
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:21.920]   That's it.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:25.360]   He says he wants to see language translation built into WhatsApp, so it doesn't have to
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:28.360]   keep going back and forth with Google Translate.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:34.320]   So I've been reading Telegram, the Ukrainian government Telegram account, which of course
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.320]   is not in English.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:40.760]   I wish it hadn't translated, because I just have to do paragraph in a time.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:46.240]   I actually really like Telegram, but I don't know.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.600]   It's this majoring of what?
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.600]   Ehhh.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.600]   Encryption.
[01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:55.200]   They don't have encryption except for group chats, and you have to know how to turn it
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.120]   on, and it's not very good.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:01.760]   And then there's also this issue of it's a Russian, you know, Pavovol Dorov was Russian.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.120]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:04.800]   Yeah, I mean, he's living in Dubai now.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:09.600]   But in fact, you could make the case these anti-Russian because they forced him to sell
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.600]   his prior companies.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.600]   I was going to say you might be, I mean, don't paint Russians.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.800]   Just because he's from Russia doesn't mean he's pro-Putin.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.160]   You kind of can't tell what's the thing about.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.360]   You can't tell.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:22.320]   Fortnite, good on them.
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:30.400]   They raised $144 million for Ukraine relief by pumping all their profits for two weeks
[01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:31.400]   for them.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:38.160]   And then into all the proceeds, along with those, by the way, from Microsoft to humanitarian
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:41.240]   efforts following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.760]   $36 million is the first day alone.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:46.760]   That's amazing.
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:47.760]   How are we?
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:48.760]   We're amazing.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.520]   It is amazing.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:58.600]   League of Legends developer Riot Games raised $5.4 million by selling a, I guess, in League
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.960]   of Legends, probably DLC and stuff.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:03.920]   A bundle of nearly 1,000 games on HIO.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:04.920]   That was pretty amazing.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:05.920]   I saw that.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:13.680]   They ended up taking in more than $6 million for Ukraine relief in 24 hours, $10 minimum
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:17.080]   donation, but you got 1,000 games.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.280]   That's pretty cool.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.080]   Humble bundle, $20 million.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.680]   They've always sold stuff for charity.
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.040]   Man, Humble bundles.
[01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.280]   How long have they been doing that?
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:26.280]   They're pretty cool.
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.280]   Wow.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.280]   They were a long time.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:37.640]   So, everybody's pitching in.
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:45.000]   The story above about the emails I found fascinating is that a psychology professor tied together
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:51.200]   with a Norwegian computer expert to get 550,000 volunteers who have sent 60 million emails,
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.440]   providing details of the war in Russia.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:54.440]   Oh, wow.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:58.840]   Trying to get around the blockade and with help about how they should be written to convince
[01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.840]   people this is real.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.360]   Of course, they could say those damned Americans are spamming this.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.200]   Yeah, it might look like spam, yeah.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:10.720]   But it's an interesting way to say, okay, if you're in a completely media-blockaded country,
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.680]   can you use the internet to get around it?
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:17.000]   Russians do it does.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   You think this will be a case, though, of people who already believe that will believe
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.720]   the email people who don't want.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:23.720]   Probably.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.120]   But that's life.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:30.960]   But that's also why it was 60 million of them.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:40.800]   If you speak Russian, I guess you'd probably want to speak Russian, but you can go to mail2ru.org.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.880]   Now 75 million emails sent.
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:44.880]   Jesus.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.880]   Wow.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:49.000]   Mail the number 2ru.org.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.240]   The service is built to send messages from your own email account.
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:58.880]   That's how they can keep from getting blocked to a batch of Russian email addresses with
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:02.040]   the help of thousands of volunteers around the world who are urging Russians to learn
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:07.680]   about the war in Ukraine and get access to independent news.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:14.720]   So you could also do it with messenger.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:21.200]   And then they have, I guess, a list of Russian emails.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.480]   But they also say, if you get bouncebacks, let them know.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:27.080]   Let us know so we can take them out of the list.
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.080]   Good on them.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:31.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:35.560]   Somebody asked, are we putting Russian people in danger by sending them these emails?
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:40.880]   Nah, we're just sending unsolicited emails that may take some risk responding if their
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:44.480]   outgoing mail is read by the Russian government, but they can't be blamed for our email simply
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.480]   appearing in front of our eyes.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.120]   Their eyes.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.120]   That's a good point.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.480]   I don't know if how they'd be blamed for opening them.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:12:02.480]   I wondered, yeah, I wondered just how many people actually seen them because I think you
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:05.920]   and I don't want people to even use email nowadays, right?
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.920]   I barely.
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.920]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:09.920]   Just me.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.040]   I think it's just you, big boy.
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:16.560]   This is a little triggering, so close your eyes.
[01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.760]   But I thought it was a really interesting use of technology.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:26.440]   You may remember that Russia was in a Ukraine town called Butcha for quite a while, and
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.520]   then they got beaten out of it.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:36.440]   And then of course, Ukrainian soldiers found a lot of bodies of Ukrainian citizens.
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:37.880]   Some of them bound at the risk.
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.920]   Some of them apparently tortured and showed that to the world.
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:45.240]   The Russian said, ah, no, no, they weren't dead when we left.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.120]   This is all propaganda from the Ukrainian government.
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:55.480]   So New York Times examined satellite images and was able to find many of these bodies
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:58.280]   weeks before the Russians left.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.520]   Thank you technology.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.760]   So I won't go any farther than that.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:07.760]   But an analysis of satellite images by the Times rebuts claims by Russia that the killing
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:14.080]   of civilians in Butcha suburb of Kiev occurred after its soldiers left town, not so.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:21.360]   We've got the pictures, not a hoax, not a hoax.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.400]   And let's see.
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:32.640]   Let's move on because I know you can't wait to see the unofficial Bridgerton TikTok musical
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:35.360]   that won a Grammy Grammy.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.960]   This is amazing.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.600]   This is crazy to me.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:43.320]   A Grammy, what?
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.280]   Beating out Andrew Lloyd Webber?
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.080]   I mean, feels really good.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.840]   And they miserable.
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:50.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:51.840]   Exactly.
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:55.400]   Stacey, the girl from the north country is it really good?
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.400]   Or is it just?
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.400]   Well, let's hear it.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.400]   It won a Grammy.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:13:59.400]   Just hip.
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:00.400]   I put it here.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.400]   I knew you'd ask that aunt.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:04.240]   So I put in some music so you can hear it.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.560]   Um, here's a just a little.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.960]   Well, just a little.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.400]   This is a version.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.560]   This is I burn for you.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.360]   You ready?
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.960]   Music video from Bridgerton.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.640]   By the way, Stacey, you watch this show.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.000]   Maybe you explain what's going on.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.800]   This is what you want.
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:28.640]   The honeymoon pacing around a separate rooms running from our elaborate rooms.
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.640]   We do.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:30.640]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.880]   This is too good for TikTok.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.160]   This is super professional.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.160]   Right.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.160]   It is.
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.160]   It is.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.880]   There are high quality people on TikTok.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.120]   These are like, this is a pro studio she's in.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.120]   Very nice.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.120]   Maybe not.
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.120]   It's her house.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:47.120]   Do you know what I'm in there?
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:48.120]   Listen to her voice.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:49.120]   Listen to her voice.
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:50.120]   Listen to her voice.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.120]   Listen to her voice.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.120]   Listen to her voice.
[01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:53.120]   Listen to her voice.
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.120]   Listen to her voice.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.120]   This is a discord.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.120]   It looks like it's all synthesized.
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:57.120]   But it sounds like an orchestra.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.120]   I think I'm going to look for some of you.
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.120]   I don't understand.
[01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.120]   And now you're forced to.
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:01.120]   Who wrote this?
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.120]   This is like a symphony.
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.120]   I don't understand.
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.120]   I don't understand.
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.120]   And now you're forced to.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.120]   Who wrote this?
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.120]   This is like a symphony.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.120]   Who wrote this?
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:09.120]   This is like Broadway.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:14.840]   Are they going to get kicked off of TikTok for not being within the spirit of TikTok?
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.040]   No, this is great.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.040]   Wow, that's impressive.
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.040]   This is great for them.
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.680]   And they went a Grammy.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:20.680]   No, that sounds good.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:22.080]   It's just unbelievable.
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:23.080]   It's wonderful.
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:24.080]   That sounded good.
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:28.640]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, it has the end seal of approval.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.480]   I just don't like musicals.
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:33.240]   But I always respect talent.
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.240]   You know?
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:39.120]   And bear, you can listen to it on a variety of services.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.680]   It's all on YouTube as well.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.680]   Wow.
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:43.680]   Wow.
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:44.680]   Wow.
[01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:47.880]   Yeah, they just use TikTok as a place to get their stuff out.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:48.880]   Yeah, no, I do.
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.200]   What's interesting to me is they're building on content.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:57.200]   I mean, to me, this is like what fan fiction or the point of remix culture is, right?
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:00.040]   So in Bridgerton is Shandra Rhimes.
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:04.480]   I have no idea how she feels about copyright and everything else.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.480]   She should be thrilled.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.240]   I mean, in no way really is this.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.640]   It doesn't use anything at first.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:12.200]   So she should be thrilled.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.920]   It adds the security to the story.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.440]   But remember, Lucas always hated fan fiction.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:23.600]   Here's the official, the unofficial official music video.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:24.960]   So they spent some time.
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.600]   They get some places to shoot.
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.640]   They got this is a steady cam.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.840]   This is some pretty serious stuff.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.840]   She's just out of three.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:38.440]   But you could do it going around the hickey course.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:43.120]   So you introduced us to the Bridgerton that you TikTok musical some time ago.
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:44.120]   I think so.
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:45.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:47.120]   But I didn't realize how good this was.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.320]   Well, there was also there was Ratatouille.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.320]   Ratatouille.
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.320]   Ratatouille.
[01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.320]   Ratatouille.
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:55.160]   They did not win the Grammy.
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.160]   They did not win the Grammy.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.560]   They were on Broadway.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:04.800]   But now, now TikTok is funding the guy behind the creative force behind the Ratatouille
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:05.800]   musical.
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:08.200]   They're funding him to make another new musical now.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.200]   Oh, good.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.200]   Artist in the band.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:13.680]   I have no problem with that.
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:20.520]   So you can see the he talks through the plot and some songs and other things.
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:21.520]   Now we can still try to.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:26.080]   Emily Bear and Abigail Barlow.
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:29.160]   Emily Bear said Abigail and I, this is I think in her.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.160]   Thank you, speech.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:34.920]   Have seen the power of TikTok for years and decided to invite fans to watch our writing
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:40.320]   sessions in real time and give their suggestions on the creation of the unofficial Bridgerton
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.320]   musical.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:46.320]   Barlow adds the immense success of this project was definitely in the fans hands.
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:49.360]   15 songs put together for the album.
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:52.360]   And they win the Grammy award.
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:58.080]   Fantastic.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.960]   This could be the future of creativity.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:00.960]   This is it's possible.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.480]   I'm really curious how Sean J. Rhimes feels about it.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:08.400]   Well, the only, you know, I mean, they use the word Bridgerton is the only and I guess
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:14.720]   some of the well, the name of the woman who wrote the books, the Bridgerton books is.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:17.520]   Oh, maybe she said books.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:20.880]   Well, is Bridgerton a modern series?
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:21.880]   No.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:27.160]   I mean, the TV show, the books books are I think it's Julia Quinn.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:28.160]   Julia Quinn.
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.160]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.160]   Julie Quinn's novels.
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.880]   But when did the Julia Quinn novels come out?
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.520]   Oh, like in the recently.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:38.880]   Yeah, she's she was born in 1970.
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.880]   So huh.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:45.360]   So these are not the Duke and I came out, which is what the first one was based on.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:47.880]   It looks like that came out in 2000.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:48.880]   Hmm.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:50.480]   No, nothing about it.
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:54.080]   I didn't know any comment from Rhimes.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.560]   I mean, I remember George Lucas for a while was really upset by actually, I don't think
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.560]   it was George.
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:05.840]   I think George probably liked the fan fiction, but the owners of Star Wars didn't.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:09.600]   Lucas was kind of notorious for suing and putting out a business.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.720]   People who did fan fixed stuff.
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:13.120]   But I think no any more.
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:17.640]   Shonda Rhimes isn't modern enough to understand this in no way hurts Bridgerton.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.800]   It makes you want to watch the show.
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:19.800]   Lifting her up.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:20.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:23.320]   Well, and finally, I feel like Shonda Rhimes would be all for it.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:25.920]   I mean, I feel like she'd be like, yeah, bring those guys in.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.080]   If I were her, I'd say, let's put this on Broadway.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:34.160]   So one of my students is working on fanfic for the redesign of the Internet, of course.
[01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:40.440]   And I didn't realize this that Garfield loves fanfic and he'll do Garfield without Garfield.
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.440]   Oh, fun.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:44.000]   So people could add it in and do all kinds of other things that they're there.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   Right.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   And engaging with it.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.240]   This was really cool.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.240]   Wow.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.240]   Wow.
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:54.520]   But there's also a porn Garfield.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:55.520]   TikTok is fun.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:58.760]   It's the Garfield where a car backs up and kills the cat.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:19:59.760]   Oh, no.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:00.760]   But we don't want to talk about that.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:01.760]   TikTok.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.760]   And it was driven by Stacy.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:04.760]   Thanks.
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:10.200]   TikTok is funding its first musical from the creative lead behind Ratatouille, the TikTok
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.440]   musical.
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.880]   They are now going to put it on Broadway, another Broadway.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.640]   What this amazing TikTok is amazing.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:19.640]   I mean, I just think of how well Henry is done.
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:21.160]   Yeah, it's creativity.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.160]   It's incredible.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:24.160]   And it's not just desktop solutions.
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:28.080]   Well, this is what we have these conversations about YouTube way back in the day.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.240]   Yeah, I guess that's true.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.440]   I mean, YouTube.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.800]   This has a bit of structure to it, doesn't it?
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:40.280]   You've got to work within a creative limitation A and B, there's an expectation of collaboration
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:42.480]   in it and C, there's the social piece to it.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:44.880]   So it just adds a few layers, which is interesting.
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:49.880]   My brother has a cat.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:52.240]   His name is, what's the cat's name?
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.240]   She will occurs.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.800]   No, will occurs.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:58.080]   And he's taught it to fetch and I love that cat.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.080]   My parents had a cat that they rescued.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:02.480]   Yeah, some of your best friends are cats.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:03.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.480]   This friends are cats.
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:10.760]   I do love a good kid for a cat.
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:15.240]   Patrick says we should call this Schrödinger's episode because we never know if the cats
[01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:16.240]   dead or not.
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.240]   That's true.
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:22.680]   I'm trying to think of a horrible, but not, you know, as horrible crime.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:23.680]   It's a dance.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:24.680]   I don't know.
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.680]   Was this specific to you?
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:26.680]   Was it beautiful?
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:27.680]   You look?
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:30.680]   No, I don't want to look.
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:31.680]   You look.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:32.680]   Oh, wait.
[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:36.880]   Here's my snack, the latest snack things that have been working here for me.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.880]   Muffin.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:38.880]   It's a cup of muffin.
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.880]   No, Kodiak cakes.
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:40.880]   Okay.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:42.880]   It's a power cup.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.520]   It looks like it's a cup of noodles, but really it's a cup of muffin.
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:47.680]   Did they wait all right?
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.000]   We see piece of it.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   They have pancake batter.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   Sorry, you know.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.000]   And you micro it.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   Make it in.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.320]   You micro it and it turns it on muffin.
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:59.720]   If, yeah, if you've ever had like a mug cake, it's that consistency, but I like them because
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.680]   I have a lot of make fun of my country.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.000]   I would just buy a mug.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:06.320]   Just get a mug and you could make a mug buy a muffin.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.560]   But a mug cake requires much more time.
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.880]   This is and this has 12 grams of protein.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:16.480]   So I make my mug cakes with almond flour and it has a lot of proteins.
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:17.480]   Quite good.
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:18.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.480]   Okay.
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:20.480]   Mug cakes are pretty easy.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.680]   That's the whole point of a mug cake.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:26.760]   Well, I know, but like it's it's not as easy as a full ad basically.
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.680]   Oh, I beg to differ.
[01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:32.480]   I think I could make a mug cake in the for look.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.480]   Look, you're a legit sip.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.280]   Here's a fun Fettie mug cake.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:39.560]   My daughter made those less like a few nights ago rather.
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:40.560]   Wow.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.560]   They're fine.
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.980]   need to get better mods, 'cause right now my cups are the only thing that really get
[01:22:44.980 --> 01:22:52.080]   hot into microwave. all right, and now a picture of John's cats.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.920]   awwwwwwwwww.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.420]   Hello Fluffyies.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:56.400]   They run the house.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:58.480]   Are they watching the show?
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:01.000]   It looks like they are.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.160]   Not anymore.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:07.080]   Obviously there's catalyzes in there.
[01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:13.760]   Post, opinion piece, dah, dana millbank tried.
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.000]   Trump's truth, truth social so you don't have to.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.860]   He says, I don't know honestly how he got in.
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:23.860]   It's still waiting listed.
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:28.560]   So here are a few of the things you missed because, because they're depressed.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.120]   The, um, members of the press, they may have gotten an in.
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:32.200]   Oh maybe, yeah.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:37.600]   I endure weeks on the waiting list for the Donald Trump created Devin Nunes run attempt
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:42.400]   at a Twitter killer and I suffered through a series of technical glitches rights millbank,
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.720]   but eventually I gained access as a result.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:49.280]   I've come to be in possession of the following new pieces of information about the war in
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:50.280]   Ukraine.
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:55.200]   Hunter Biden is involved in building and running bio labs in the country.
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:59.120]   The CIA and the National Institute of Health are both deeply involved in the Ukrainian
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.560]   bio labs.
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:06.360]   The Russian invasion of Ukraine was set in motion by a CIA false flag operation funded
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.920]   by George Soros.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:17.960]   The COVID-19 pathogen originated not in China, but in Spilchnya, a village in Ukraine.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:24.920]   The bio weapons developed in Ukraine specifically target the Abrahamic bloodline on on and on
[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.080]   and on.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.080]   Why?
[01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:30.080]   What is the Abrahamic bloodline?
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:33.680]   Jewish people Jewish people.
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:35.640]   Unbelievable.
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:38.760]   And you might say it's not a text story.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.840]   It kind of is.
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.560]   But I have to say it just shows you.
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:46.920]   I mean, remember before this was launched, everybody said, boy, if Donald Trump ever
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.960]   launches a Twitter, it's going to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:54.600]   You need libs to yell at is the general theory and they don't have any lives to yell at.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:55.600]   So it's no fun.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.600]   Nothing.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:57.600]   Nothing.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.600]   The yellow bar.
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:24:59.600]   Plus people are leaving.
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:00.600]   They see.
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:03.200]   So it's more fun in Twitter because you've got people to yell at.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.200]   Yes.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.880]   Yeah, they get frustrated with you.
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:06.880]   They interact with you.
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:07.880]   Right.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:09.200]   And it's like, it's no fun.
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:10.200]   It's no fun.
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:15.120]   They've lost the only technical people as far as I can tell who worked there are both
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.120]   gone.
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:18.320]   Josh Adams and Billy Boozer.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:22.720]   I'm sorry, but that is a name you have to escape.
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:26.560]   The company's chief of technology and product development.
[01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:27.560]   At least they will.
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:29.360]   You're a boozer is Billy Boozer.
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.800]   He's really leaning into it, isn't he?
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:33.800]   Yeah, he is.
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:34.800]   Yeah.
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:39.480]   Both have resigned their senior posts at a critical juncture for the company's smartphone
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.320]   app release plans.
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:42.800]   They only have an iOS app.
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.040]   They're trying to get an Android app.
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:47.120]   Of course, that's a huge part.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:50.680]   40% of the US market.
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:54.560]   Boozer declined to comment.
[01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:57.760]   And Adams did not respond to request.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:00.320]   So we don't know what's going on, but it's not been good.
[01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:02.880]   And of course, it was going to be a spec.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:08.440]   And they had, I think, close to a billion dollars in pledged investments in the spec.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.200]   That's almost all disappeared now.
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:13.040]   People going, oh, maybe not.
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.040]   Maybe not.
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:20.080]   Are you ready for drone delivery in Texas?
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:21.080]   You better be alphabets.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.760]   I'm not there anymore, but yes.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:23.760]   Dallas.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:24.760]   Dallas.
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.160]   We're bringing drone delivery to Dallas.
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:33.120]   Actually, it's near Dallas, Frisco and Little Elm.
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:36.680]   They're in the Dallas Fort Worth multiplex, Metroplex.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:37.680]   Metro area.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:41.480]   Walgreens is the primary partner.
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:49.440]   Drones will be picking up health and wellness products, pet meds from EasyVet, first aid
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:53.800]   kits from Texas health, and ice cream.
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.680]   It's raining ice cream from Blue Bell Creameries.
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:58.480]   Oh, hot for that.
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.400]   I dig it.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:04.360]   I want to set clear expectations, says the CEO.
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:08.280]   Not everyone who lives within the range of our drones will be able to order on day one.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:12.320]   We're going to invite customers and groups to make sure everyone has a good first experience
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:14.800]   with drone delivery.
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:21.240]   By the way, you could already do this in Virginia, Helsinki, Canberra, and Logan, Australia.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:25.440]   200,000th delivery was last week.
[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.960]   Do they drop it?
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.440]   Do they land?
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:33.760]   Amazon ones drop it.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.400]   I don't know if the Google ones drop it.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.360]   I mean, Texas makes sense.
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:39.760]   There's a lot of space.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.680]   You've got really well laid out planned communities with open space.
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.240]   You're not dealing with alleys and inner city kind of issues.
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:50.240]   Or anybody of the Abrahamic persuasion.
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.120]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.880]   Pretty sure there are two-ish people in Dallas.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:59.040]   I really want to see a video of this alphabet wing delivery.
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.640]   Let me see if I can follow.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:02.200]   Yeah, I am curious how they do it.
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:04.760]   How they drop it is doable either way.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:05.600]   Thank you, YouTube.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:08.560]   Here we go.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.120]   From tech first.
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:12.400]   We're not going to replace the majority of ground delivery.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.400]   That's not our case.
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:14.400]   This is an interview I won't.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:16.360]   But I just want to see a picture.
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.360]   Here we go.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.360]   Here it is.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:19.360]   Let's see it muffin.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:25.040]   I think they wish that we were in more than as far as quite as it is.
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.560]   It's all stock footage, B-roll.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.360]   I am marketing them.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:31.320]   I am an amen, amen, amen, amen, amen.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.320]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.000]   Here's a fake delivery.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000]   Some toast.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:42.640]   I'm going to turn off this hat so I can narrate this unhindered by facts.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:46.080]   Here's a guy.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.200]   He's got some toast.
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:49.200]   He's run out of Marmite.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.200]   Sorry, Vegemite.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.200]   Vegemite.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.200]   Oh, God.
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.200]   He's an Australia.
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.200]   He's three.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.200]   He's a vegetarian.
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:56.320]   Vegemite is three minutes out.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:58.000]   He drops the toast.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000]   Here's the nice clerk in camera.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.960]   Wait, he had the Vegemite in front of him.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:01.960]   I know.
[01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:02.960]   It was empty.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:03.960]   It was empty.
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:04.960]   Oh, look at that.
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:05.960]   It drops it on a string.
[01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:06.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:07.960]   What?
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:08.960]   Oh, no.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:09.960]   That's the drone coming to pick it up.
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:10.960]   It picks it up.
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:12.880]   The clerk puts a bag on the string.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:17.040]   The drone goes around and then a small child runs out.
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:22.680]   That's exactly what you want to do and then gets a thing of Vegemite dropped on his head.
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:23.680]   Here it comes.
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:25.080]   No, it comes down on a string.
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:28.520]   So you got to be ready for it because the drone's not going to wait for you.
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:30.160]   Oh, maybe it is.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.160]   Oh, it released it.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.160]   It unhooks it.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.160]   Okay.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.160]   Nice.
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.160]   And the small child runs out and dad has his Vegemite.
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.160]   It's poisoned for the child.
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:38.160]   Oh, no.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.160]   Don't eat that Vegemite.
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:41.200]   It's pure byproduct.
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:43.440]   Oh, okay.
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:45.440]   Oh.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:52.080]   So you can see it's obviously was launched first in Australia coming to Dallas.
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:53.080]   It won't be Vegemite.
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:54.640]   What will they be delivering in Dallas?
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:55.640]   K so.
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:56.640]   Barbecue.
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:29:57.640]   Barbecue.
[01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:29:59.640]   So, Rotel.
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:00.640]   I mean, so not case.
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:01.640]   Yeah, Rotel.
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:02.640]   A pepper.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:03.640]   Yeah.
[01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:04.640]   Mm.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:05.640]   Mm.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:06.640]   Breakfast tacos.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:07.640]   That's what I want.
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.640]   They don't have those in Dallas.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:10.640]   Well, they don't.
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.960]   That's just an Austin thing.
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:16.840]   It's not just an Austin thing, but it is, I don't.
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:21.880]   We're going to be in Dallas for a podcast expo this summer.
[01:30:21.880 --> 01:30:22.880]   How's Dallas in August?
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:26.240]   Oh, I'm going to be in Dallas in me.
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:29.080]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:30.080]   It's not too hot.
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:31.080]   It's hot, hot.
[01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:38.000]   So, I figure that the podcast movement is going to be in Dallas August 23rd because hotels
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000]   are cheap.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.760]   I was about to say it's cheap.
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:42.920]   But you know what?
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.000]   You don't actually have to.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.920]   The nice thing about summer in Texas is you never actually have to go outside.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:48.920]   You don't go outside, right?
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:53.520]   In fact, we're going to stay at the hotel so we don't have to walk and.
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.640]   You could say hi to Andrew.
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:56.640]   Is Andrew going?
[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:58.120]   I'm sure he is.
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.120]   Oh, how exciting.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:00.640]   He goes to podcast expo over here.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:01.640]   Or I'm sorry.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:02.640]   He's calling a podcast expo.
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:04.560]   He's a podcast movement, right?
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:05.560]   Yeah.
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:06.560]   He has a podcast business.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:11.720]   Yeah, he's got a whole site called Podcast Guests where you sign up to be in a podcast.
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.320]   You can find an expert and you can find guests for your shows.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.320]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:16.320]   I didn't know that.
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:17.320]   Yeah.
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:19.960]   He's all entrepreneur and stuff, y'all.
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.440]   I think I've heard of podcast guests.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.840]   How many different things does he run?
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:27.080]   Well, he runs the business side of my business.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.960]   He runs his domain publication.
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:32.280]   He runs podcast guests.
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:35.480]   And then at any given time, he's probably experimenting with something else.
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:38.520]   But I don't pay attention to them until they become like their rep.
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:42.760]   Until there's money to be heard that trifly working on this.
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:46.200]   Well, no, I mean, because, you know, he comes up with stuff.
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:50.600]   And I mean, when for as long as I've known him, he's had a side hustle.
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:53.520]   So like when we met, he was selling old beer signs.
[01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:57.520]   He'd go to like flea markets in Texas and sell these tin beer signs.
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:59.680]   I want to hang with Mr. Andrew.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:00.680]   Yeah.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:02.680]   Was this his first business when he was in college?
[01:32:02.680 --> 01:32:05.800]   He sold beer, old beers, rusty, that beer signs.
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:10.800]   No, when he was a kid, he used to bring candy to school and sell it.
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:14.200]   You know, he'd buy it at the candy store and then sell it to his classmates for.
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:16.600]   Yeah, he's he's entrepreneur.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:18.600]   He knows that's neat.
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.680]   I want to hang with him.
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:24.840]   If you called an Uber in San Francisco or New York and a yellow cab showed up, would
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.200]   you be disappointed?
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.200]   Yes.
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:29.840]   That's the future.
[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:30.840]   That's the future.
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:33.600]   That's like the worst of both worlds.
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:38.200]   This is, I mean, this is really interesting.
[01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:42.240]   This is exactly what Uber was created to avoid.
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:48.240]   They signed a deal in New York City to put all New York City cabs on the app.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:53.280]   Now they've signed a deal with yellow cab San Francisco and flywheel technologies.
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:57.640]   Bay Area passengers, this is the blind that kind of confused me, whose summon an Uber
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:03.800]   ride might see one of the city's taxis show up to ferry them in the coming months.
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:07.440]   So I assume that I saw the New York City on the app that you would have a choice, black
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:15.120]   car, you know, cab, but it sounds to me like Uber is just going to send whatever is nearby
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:17.600]   and it might be a cab.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:20.720]   I don't know about that.
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:25.200]   I actually like my Uber experience even though most of the time I just used Lyft, but I like
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:31.240]   that experience of the natural person is just sort of casually doing it.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:35.360]   So this is probably in response to the pandemic.
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:36.360]   They can't get enough drivers.
[01:33:36.360 --> 01:33:37.360]   They can't get drivers.
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.360]   I've seen.
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.960]   And it also, well, plus the cabbies are in raised.
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.360]   They're only these stallions that they can't get any value up.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.400]   So it's a way to pacify that fight.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:54.200]   However, the difference is it will not be a metered rate.
[01:33:54.200 --> 01:33:56.640]   Cabs usually, you know, you drop the flag and you get metered.
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:01.520]   Uber is going to be a flat upfront fare.
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:03.760]   So that's interesting.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.520]   Little more than a dozen cab drivers spoke out against partnering with Uber during the
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:12.260]   San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency Board meeting, while four drivers and four
[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:17.520]   cab company owners spoke in support of the idea saying it would generate much needed
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:20.760]   new business.
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.920]   So if this hadn't have happened, what would have happened with Uber because you said there's
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:28.040]   a driver's shortage going on.
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:31.840]   And it's probably a driver's shortage because of the dag gum fuel costs.
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:32.840]   Nobody's earned enough.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:33.840]   That could be.
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:34.840]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:35.840]   People don't want to drive for Uber.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:36.840]   I wouldn't blame them.
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:42.160]   So yeah, I don't know how this solves it except that a cabbie, I guess, is already doing it.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:46.240]   Taxi rides through Uber will cost the same as an Uber X ride.
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:47.760]   The more expensive ones, right?
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:51.200]   No, X is the cheap one, which is calculated on the base fare.
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.200]   This is expensive.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.200]   Yeah, right.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:57.600]   Base fare plus trip time and distance taxi drivers will know in advance which rides come
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:02.200]   from Uber and what they will be paid and they can accept or reject it, reject it without
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.600]   consequences.
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:07.200]   I could, I mean, it's good for cabbies.
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:08.200]   It's good for them.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:09.600]   I don't have as good for Uber though.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:12.800]   Oh, see, it might be maybe Uber had to do it, right?
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.280]   They couldn't get drivers.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:15.280]   I don't know.
[01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:16.280]   It's a good question.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:17.280]   What would have happened with that on this deal?
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:18.280]   I don't know.
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.960]   I don't know.
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:29.560]   I think of San Francisco, you may remember a company called Fast raised $120 million
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:32.320]   to do one-click shopping.
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:33.320]   They're gone.
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:41.000]   So the most interesting thing about this story to me was Dan Pramak over at Axios now.
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.560]   He wrote in his newsletter that he says, he's like, "This story in and of itself is
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:51.960]   a surprise.
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:51.960]   It is too soon yet to have the death watch for these companies, but he feels like that
[01:35:51.960 --> 01:35:57.480]   time is coming because the story is one about basically blowing through your money to gain
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:00.760]   market share and then not being able to raise more money."
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:01.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:02.760]   So familiar.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.760]   Yeah, we've lived through this twice now.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:07.160]   Remember the wonderful site F Company?
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:08.160]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:10.160]   All that.
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:11.160]   Pud.
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:12.160]   That's Pud started then.
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:13.160]   He did something else after that.
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:14.160]   Oh, he did a lot of stuff.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.160]   I'm going to do a lot of stuff.
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:16.160]   What's an interesting character?
[01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.160]   Philip Kaplan.
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:23.160]   So fast, I guess, despite raising $120 million, only made $600,000.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.160]   Oh, gosh.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:28.360]   So, yeah.
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:29.360]   That's interesting.
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:35.040]   I guess this is the logical conclusion of having so much free money floating around that,
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:38.760]   you know, at some point you're going to have to do something with it.
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.560]   It's kind of like a game of musical chairs.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:41.560]   Yeah.
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:45.000]   Like if you're not doing great, you can sell to a company great, but at some point in
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.920]   time, you do actually have to create value.
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:48.920]   Right.
[01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:49.920]   I know.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:52.960]   It's so old school with me to think that, but it's still true.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:54.160]   Old school.
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.800]   Old school.
[01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:01.240]   Like putting in a cup.
[01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:05.640]   We're going to take a break while Stacey pops another muffin in the micro.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:07.960]   To talk about our sponsor.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:10.000]   We'll have more with this week in Google in just a bit.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.720]   This episode brought to you by HPE Hewlett Packard Enterprise.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:19.720]   HPE GreenLake orchestrated by the experts at CDW.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:25.840]   Yesterday's infrastructure is not going to help you meet the demands of tomorrow's innovation.
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:31.280]   And now more than ever, you have to quickly adapt to change the consumption or this fits
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.560]   right into what we're just talking about.
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:38.680]   The consumption oriented model of public cloud has actually revolutionized how organizations
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:43.760]   think about infrastructure and organizations are now demanding the speed and agility of
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:45.280]   a public cloud experience.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:49.080]   But many workloads still remain on prem.
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:51.440]   Maybe they're complicated legacy applications.
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:55.080]   There's issues, of course, with data sovereignty or compliance.
[01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:59.800]   And just, you know, how serious it is, how tricky it is to migrate sensitive data to
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:04.160]   the cloud and you in the IT department are caught right in the middle trying to satisfy
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:10.200]   the demand and growth for your company while struggling to manage disparate data and expected
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.200]   to do it all at budget.
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:15.960]   Well, that's why you need to know about HPE GreenLake and CDW.

[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:22.200]   Was that enough time to make a muffin?
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:23.200]   Survey says.
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:25.160]   Survey says I did not need a muffin.
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.960]   There wasn't enough time to finish writing my podcast post.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:28.960]   Wow.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:29.960]   You're that good, huh?
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:30.960]   She's fast.
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:31.960]   She's...
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:34.240]   No, I just had to write one more paragraph and cut it down.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:35.240]   Multi-tasking.
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:39.840]   Thanks to ScooterX in our chat, actually in our Discord chat.
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:44.280]   This tweet from Christina Warren, "Alright, I'm gonna need you all to help me get a fast
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:48.520]   hoodie because she collects the...
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:51.480]   That'll be a collector's item, right?
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:53.240]   Hoodies have failed startups.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:54.400]   That and shoes are...
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:56.320]   I used to have a bunch of those.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.560]   Yeah, who doesn't?
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:40:58.560 --> 01:40:59.560]   And you did a review...
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:00.560]   You're all real old now.
[01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:07.160]   You did a review of the Olive Pro earbuds last year.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:08.160]   Mm-hmm.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.160]   Did you like them?
[01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:13.480]   Yeah, they're really, really neat set of earbuds because, yeah, you can listen to your music
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:18.480]   and phone calls or whatever, but if you're someone to have issues like hearing impaired
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:23.160]   issues, you can hear things better in a loud environment.
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:28.000]   Like I tested them out, I went to the casino and just popped them in and I can hear things...
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:32.920]   I can actually hear conversation next to me versus all of the rumble and how so going
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:33.920]   on around here.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:36.200]   They're really, really, really nice set of earbuds.
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.040]   We're gonna have to get a pair of these.
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:43.160]   These are the successor, the Olive Max 2-in-1 hearing aids.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.800]   They're actually calling them hearing aids.
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:47.840]   They double as earbuds.
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.840]   They look pretty cool.
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:49.840]   They call them hearing aids.
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:50.840]   Well, you know, the...
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:51.840]   Well, you...
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:52.840]   Because they didn't call the...
[01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.880]   The FDA doesn't want you to call them.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:57.600]   They're still not over-the-counter hearing aids yet.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:58.600]   Okay.
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:01.960]   Even though they were supposed to be going back four years now, five years.
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:03.200]   Hearing helpers.
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:04.200]   Hearing helpers.
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:05.200]   Assisted.
[01:42:05.200 --> 01:42:07.560]   Hearables is what they call them.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:10.200]   Hearables, yeah.
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:18.280]   So the Olive Max, they say it's an FDA Class 2 hearing aid, but now while my hearing aids
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:21.760]   cost $6,000, that's pretty typical for hearing aids.
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:22.760]   Good on all theologists.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:25.320]   You get them fitted and all that stuff.
[01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:27.040]   And tuned.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.760]   These started $299.
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:30.600]   They'll start shipping in the fourth quarter.
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:35.800]   I bet you there, they're figuring the FDA, which is delayed the rollout of over-the-counter
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:39.840]   hearing aids for some time, will finally say, "All right, all right, just do it."
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.440]   I think they did set it.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:43.080]   I think they said it.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:44.080]   Did they set it?
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:45.080]   So hold on.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:48.240]   Let me give you the accurate information.
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:54.360]   Yeah, so Biden did an executive order last summer that said we need to get on that.
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:55.840]   They're going.
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:01.000]   And because the regulations were already there, this, okay.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:07.440]   So yeah, they implemented a rule in October that basically says there was a law over-the-counter
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:10.720]   hearing aid act that was in 2017.
[01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:16.880]   The order, five in order from the summer did a timeline for action, and now the FDA has
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:19.560]   issued a proposed rule.
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:22.840]   So now it should be doable.
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:23.840]   That would explain it.
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:24.880]   Because that proposed, yeah.
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:26.960]   So this is the first expect a flood.
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:31.200]   I wouldn't even be surprised if Apple at some point starts to say, "Hey, you know, AirPods
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:33.600]   Pro can be used this way as well."
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:34.760]   Well, I think it'll be-
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:35.760]   Well, I think it'll be-
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:36.760]   Or health kit-
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:43.000]   Once you get the hearables, like, turn into hearing aids, you can also put a lot of really
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.400]   cool sensors in there like galvanic skin response or stress.
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:50.000]   You can put body temperature, you can track heart rate.
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:55.720]   You can actually track a lot of stuff in your ears in a way that might be interesting,
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:58.400]   especially for people who can't sleep an Apple watch.
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:02.680]   Or you're not going to sleep with your hearing aid in.
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:05.600]   So you've got to think of things where it's intermittent and you would want to be hearing.
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:07.600]   And these only give you about eight hours of-
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:10.640]   So you're going to take them out after eight hours and put them in the case where they'll
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:12.880]   charge some more, just like AirPods do.
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:15.280]   Anyway, Olive Max.
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:17.600]   Sounds like it's kind of like the pros that you reviewed.
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:19.360]   Maybe it looks cool.
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:27.680]   They have the Auto-Focus feature which will focus in on the voice automatically.
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:33.200]   And a new sound engine, they say that lets you detect voices better and is better at
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.880]   reducing and filtering background noise.
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:36.400]   How did the pros do when you had that?
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:38.280]   It was ridiculous.
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:44.000]   The app has pretty much the EQ on it and you can tailor it to fit even better than what
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000]   their AI is already doing.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.320]   We would have the hard hits running around and the dogs running around and I could still
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:55.360]   listen to the television clearly even though there was all this mess going on in the kitchen
[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:57.000]   and things like that.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.160]   It was really impressive.
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:44:59.160]   Nice.
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:00.800]   And it didn't look like hearing aids.
[01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:05.840]   It just looked like earbuds that you'd listen to music in.
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:11.440]   Google, like many companies struggling with the return to office, they are now bribing
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:18.880]   employees with free electric scooters from a not scooter but a scooter subscription.
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:23.160]   Oh, you don't get the scooter just a subscription.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:24.880]   You quit, you lose scooter.
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:30.800]   Oh, it's called ride scoot in which most of Google's US-based workers can get reimbursed
[01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:37.200]   for the full cost of a monthly subscription to Enagi's stylish Model 1 scooter.
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:40.600]   If you were to buy it, it would cost $990.
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:41.600]   It's a dual motor scooter.
[01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:45.680]   It's a top speed of 20 miles an hour range of 15 miles.
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:48.240]   I guess this is smart, right?
[01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:54.320]   I mean, it's a thing that scooters are apparently a big thing right now because of the gas prices.
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:56.040]   So people are turning to scooters.
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:57.880]   This could get you.
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:58.880]   Oh, I know.
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:01.240]   I'm having a hard time staying awake too.
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:03.240]   That's so nice.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:08.800]   Actually, I don't understand what's wrong with bicycles.
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:09.800]   No one wants to sweat.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:12.880]   Oh, it's a good electric bike then.
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:14.360]   Yeah, I am an electric bike.
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:15.840]   I would assume it's a small Google bus.
[01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.880]   You still have to pedal on the e-bikes too.
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:20.960]   Yeah, but you don't have to pedal hard.
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.960]   These will fit above you on the Google bus.
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:23.960]   Oh, that's true.
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:26.560]   You scoot to the bus and get on the bus.
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:27.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:28.560]   That's the idea.
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:29.560]   That's the idea.
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:32.320]   And then you scoot once you're off around campus.
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:35.080]   Google has just built a lake house.
[01:46:35.080 --> 01:46:39.480]   Well, that's kind of a misinterpretation in this story, but I kind of prefer it.
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:43.360]   Google Cloud just built a data lake house on BigQuery.
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:44.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:49.920]   No, I'm less excited about that story.
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:53.960]   Google has banned apps with hidden data-sarvesting software.
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:56.000]   Well, duh.
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:57.560]   Well, from governments.
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:46:58.560]   Oh, okay.
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:00.440]   I'll catch that part.
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:05.960]   The consumer-facing apps are tied to the US national security contract.
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:06.960]   Oh.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:07.960]   Oh.
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:12.520]   A Panamanian company wrote the code.
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:18.240]   It's linked through corporate records and web registrations to a Virginia defense contractor
[01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:24.280]   that does cyberintelligence, network defense, and intelligence intercept work for US national
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:26.760]   security agencies.
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:35.200]   That code ran on millions of Android devices, dozens of apps on the Google Play Store, including
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:43.680]   several Muslim prayer apps, a highway speed trap detector.
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:44.960]   What do these have in common?
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:51.560]   A QR code reader and a number of other popular consumer apps.
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:53.720]   Wow.
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:54.760]   Our government.
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:55.760]   Wow.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:02.680]   My measurement systems paid developers to incorporate its code, surptitiously collecting
[01:48:02.680 --> 01:48:07.960]   data from the users.
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:09.320]   Stacy?
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:10.520]   This was old.
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:15.040]   We knew about the Muslim prayer app collecting data and then selling it to government officials.
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:18.320]   But Google, getting rid of it is new, right?
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:25.080]   I thought they did get rid of it, but maybe they found more.
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.080]   This feels very familiar.
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.600]   I'm like, oh, I feel like we've covered this, but okay.
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:33.360]   Two security researchers shared their findings in March last month with Google, which initiated
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:38.280]   an investigation resulting in the ban.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:41.840]   The apps containing measurement system software removed from the Google Play Store as of March
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:42.840]   25th.
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:49.320]   I wonder what's the procedure for Google to go through its store and see this stuff?
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:53.800]   Because I mean, there's a gazillion apps out there and how are they checking?
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:54.800]   Oh, they know.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:56.800]   Call in.
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:59.400]   When you're in the metadata removed from the store, you've got it on your phone.
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:00.400]   You've got it.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:01.400]   It's working.
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:02.400]   Yeah.
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.400]   Wow.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:10.960]   I guess all you could do if your Google is to monitor outbound traffic, right?
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:13.880]   Because it has to upload to some servers somewhere.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:14.880]   I don't know.
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:15.880]   That's not correct.
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:18.560]   Well, I feel like it didn't.
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:20.080]   I can't remember how they got that.
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:21.080]   Never mind.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:22.080]   I can't remember.
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:23.080]   Hmm.
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:26.600]   So you're all terrible today.
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:30.280]   I wish I had a cup of muffin.
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:31.720]   Yeah, I need to do some squats.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:38.120]   What do you think about ubiquity, the router company suing Brian Krebs, a security journalist
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:40.840]   for $425,000 in damages?
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:44.520]   Because ubiquity says that he misled intentionally.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:46.920]   It has to be intentional, right?
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:51.080]   Intentionally misled the public about a data breach on ubiquity's hardware and a subsequent
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:56.160]   blackmail attempt.
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:58.120]   Krebs said they covered up the cyber attack.
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:03.240]   Ubiquity says, no, we send an email out immediately, told customers to take additional
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:05.880]   security precautions.
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:10.560]   Then we notified the public in the next filing and made with the SEC.
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:12.560]   They claim Krebs intentionally disregarded.
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:13.560]   Okay.
[01:50:13.560 --> 01:50:14.560]   That's not true.
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:15.560]   Not true.
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:16.560]   Is it proof?
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:19.400]   Or saying that, oh, we told the SEC is not the same as telling the public.
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.640]   I think they should not have sued Brian Krebs.
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:27.040]   That's just a dumb thing to do for a bunch of reasons.
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:35.920]   They say his only source was the company employee who leaked all this information in the first
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.120]   place.
[01:50:37.120 --> 01:50:41.320]   He was later charged with stealing confidential data and extorting ubiquity while posing
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:44.680]   as anonymous hacker.
[01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:48.840]   Ubiquity knew the sole source had been indicted for his criminal involvement in the attack,
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:52.280]   but he published a Krebs published a story on the blog next day.
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:57.240]   Krebs knew doubling down on his accusations against ubiquity.
[01:50:57.240 --> 01:51:00.080]   It doesn't matter.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:04.480]   You have to prove malicious intent in a lawsuit like this, right?
[01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:12.400]   Still, as long as Sullivan stole the case, the libel suit, yes.
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:18.440]   It's just a bad look if you ask me for ubiquity, but I guess they feel like they've got a case.
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:22.320]   They can prove they actually did that communication to the public.
[01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:23.880]   They did send out an email.
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:25.880]   Yeah, but did they send it out three years later?
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:27.720]   No, some other company they didn't wait.
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:29.720]   Like, why did they?
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:31.320]   They didn't wait.
[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.320]   Did they clearly?
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:36.160]   I mean, like, I guess I would like to see the email they sent out to be.
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:37.160]   Right.
[01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:38.160]   I have it somewhere.
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:39.160]   I've carried it to you.
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:40.160]   Oh, that's right.
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:42.160]   Because you're a ubiquity customer.
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:43.160]   I am.
[01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:54.720]   It was kind of an anodyne email that said, you know, it'd probably be a good idea if you
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:56.920]   were to change your password right now.
[01:51:56.920 --> 01:51:57.920]   Okay, so that's not true.
[01:51:57.920 --> 01:52:03.960]   They weren't too clear about exactly what had happened.
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:04.960]   But doesn't matter.
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:05.960]   They did do.
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:06.960]   You know, that's the question.
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:07.960]   Does their notifications?
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:08.960]   Does their notifications?
[01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:09.960]   That's the account of the account of the account.
[01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:10.960]   Yeah.
[01:52:10.960 --> 01:52:11.960]   Because think about sales.
[01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:17.080]   Tell someone, hey, lock your, if you send someone an email that says, hey, by the way,
[01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:22.320]   you may want to lock your door, you know, versus, hey, you may want to lock your door
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:27.600]   because we have noticed that there is a robber roaming around trying all the door locks in
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:28.600]   your neighborhood.
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:29.600]   Those are very different emails.
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:30.600]   Right.
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:34.640]   As the emails that I've seen from other vendors that say suspicious activity on your account
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:35.640]   change.
[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:36.640]   Here's the.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:38.040]   Or change your password.
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:39.040]   We've had a data breach.
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:41.040]   Something like that.
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:42.040]   Yeah.
[01:52:42.040 --> 01:52:46.040]   So the data breach happened December 5th.
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:49.960]   No, wait a minute.
[01:52:49.960 --> 01:53:01.400]   So the Justice Department indicted a ubiquity developer for causing the breach December 5th.
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:07.760]   Ubiquity on March 31st of last year said it's security experts identified.
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:15.160]   No evidence that customer information was accessed or even targeted.
[01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:20.560]   And then in January 11th, so about a month later, they sent an email.
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:22.240]   This is what the email said.
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:26.800]   Dear customer, we recently became aware of unauthorized access to certain of our information
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:30.760]   technology systems hosted by a third card party cloud provider.
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:35.440]   We have no indication there's been unauthorized activity with respect to any users account.
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:37.200]   I remember getting this email.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:41.120]   But as a precaution, we encourage you to change your password.
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:45.520]   We recommend you also change your password on any website where you use the same ID and
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:46.520]   password.
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:47.520]   Okay.
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:49.200]   Well, this there's a button that says here you can change it.
[01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:52.640]   We apologize deeply regret.
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:53.640]   That covers it.
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:56.680]   This is kind of.
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:54:05.360]   Ironically from the Brian Krebs story, which came out March 30th of last year, what Krebs
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:13.400]   according to Ubiquity did not reveal as his source for these stories was the hacker.
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:17.720]   And that Krebs should have known it was actually the hacker, but did not reveal that.
[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:19.560]   Did Krebs know?
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:24.240]   So they're suing him because they think or because Krebs admitted that he knew it was
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:25.240]   the hacker.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:27.800]   Well, I guess that's what the trial will.
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:32.680]   Because I mean, like if the hacker comes to talk to me, then as long as I don't know
[01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:33.680]   it.
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:34.680]   Right.
[01:54:34.680 --> 01:54:40.320]   I mean, the complaint said only one source propped up Krebs story against Ubiquity.
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:44.600]   Nicholas Sharp, the Ubiquity employee behind the cyber attack.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:47.160]   By the way, we'll never we won't get Brian's side of it.
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:48.680]   And I have huge respect for Brian.
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:54.080]   We use his work all the time on the shows, but he is lawyer on advice of his lawyer.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:55.080]   He's not commenting.
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:54:56.080]   Smart.
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:57.080]   Smart.
[01:54:57.080 --> 01:54:58.080]   Smart.
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:02.640]   So on December, sharp was charged.
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:07.280]   Krebs allegedly Ubiquity said Krebs allegedly reviewed the press release, knew that his
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:10.720]   sole source had been indicted.
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:14.360]   But the indictment said Krebs published a story on his blog, the next date doubling down on
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:19.800]   his accusations and intentionally mislating his readers into believing his earlier reporting
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:22.640]   was not sourced by sharp.
[01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:23.640]   So that's yeah.
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:26.960]   So this is like defamation, basically, what they're going after.
[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:32.080]   The key, correct me if I'm wrong, Jeff and Stacy know the rules, but the key is you have
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:36.560]   to show knowledge that it was wrong before you published.
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:38.200]   And you have to have malice.
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:39.200]   Okay.
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:40.200]   It has to be intentional.
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:41.200]   Okay.
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:46.560]   And that's so that's why the lawsuit says, look, he knew intentionally published it anyway.
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:47.560]   Okay.
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:49.400]   We'll see.
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:50.400]   It's a bad look.
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:58.080]   I'm a company, a journalist over stories that don't make it look good because it makes you
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:55:59.080]   look bad.
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:00.320]   It makes you look even worse.
[01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:02.520]   And it's a story saying effect.
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:07.680]   So anyway, I kind of I'm gonna I'll have to see more.
[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:13.040]   I'm gonna my my tendency would be to to say Brian did nothing wrong.
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:14.600]   But we'll see.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:16.040]   Just sounds like he reported.
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:24.040]   Well, but it sounds like he reported based on a source that he knew was the bad guy.
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:26.160]   You would that would be wrong, right?
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:27.520]   Or no, not necessarily.
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:32.840]   I mean, if he's reporting that there's still an issue, right?
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:37.480]   I mean, just because the person, I mean, it's not ideal, like, but if someone called me
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:42.680]   up and it was like, I murdered my family, I would still publish a story about them murdering
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:43.680]   their family.
[01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:45.480]   Is this sort of a cat?
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:46.480]   Is this sort of like snowed?
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:47.480]   Right.
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:52.720]   You know, because a lot of people consider snowed in the government bad guy.
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:58.080]   But yet what he reported was stuff that the public needed to know and deserved the right
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:59.600]   to know, right?
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:03.840]   Yeah, but his sole source here is the guy.
[01:57:03.840 --> 01:57:06.280]   The bad guy maybe craves is fooled by that.
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:08.000]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.680]   I really don't know.
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:12.200]   We're gonna have to wait, I guess.
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:15.600]   I don't have enough information.
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:17.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:18.400]   Yeah.
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.600]   I'm not willing to be a pundit that doesn't know on this one.
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:21.600]   Right.
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:22.800]   Right.
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:27.000]   I can't like, I mean, as a journalist, I'm like, I want to be, I want to be like, he
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.760]   did nothing wrong, but I also know that this could be confusing.
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:35.400]   But I don't believe he was malicious.
[01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:37.000]   Get ready for this.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:43.200]   It's all opening days tomorrow and the Major League Baseball officials are saying pitchers
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:49.120]   and catchers can use a new anti-sign stealing technology during the regular season.
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:53.000]   This has historically been a problem.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.000]   Catchers would signal to the pitcher using fingers what pitch to throw.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.640]   Now they have a little thing on their wrist.
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:04.840]   Looks like a little blackberry or calculator that goes to an earpiece of the pitcher's
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:08.880]   ear that tells him what pitch to throw.
[01:58:08.880 --> 01:58:09.880]   Watch this video.
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:12.840]   You can see the catcher is entering in the pitch.
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:13.840]   You know what's coming next, right?
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:15.960]   There's no way, no way to steal those signs.
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:17.280]   Man in the middle of the time.
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:18.280]   Oh, yeah, man.
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:19.720]   You know what's coming next.
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:23.040]   What technology is it based on?
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:27.480]   It's called pitch com using a pad with buttons on the wrist of the glove to hand a catcher
[01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:32.000]   can signal pitches type and location to the pitcher through a listening device.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:37.080]   Up to three teammates of the pitcher and catcher will also have access to the signals available
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:40.840]   in Spanish and English, which helps the fielder's position.
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:42.840]   It can be hacked.
[01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:46.240]   These team owners have billions of dollars that they're disposing.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:47.960]   Yeah, you've got to use encryption.
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:49.800]   You've got to use strong encryption.
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:53.120]   Just text them.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:54.120]   Just take a phone out of your pocket.
[01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:56.320]   It's kind of like you're texting them.
[01:58:56.320 --> 01:58:57.320]   Yeah.
[01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:00.560]   It's a big problem in sign stealing.
[01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:02.560]   And it is illegal.
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:03.560]   I thought it was part of the game.
[01:59:03.560 --> 01:59:04.560]   No, no, no, no.
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:05.560]   It's illegal.
[01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:06.560]   No, no, no, no.
[01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:11.760]   It's sheet because normally the only person who can see that is the pitcher unless you've
[01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:20.080]   got a guy in the outfield with binoculars or a camera trying to steal it.
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:24.320]   Even a guy in short could potentially see it, but he would have to yell back.
[01:59:24.320 --> 01:59:26.320]   Hey, get ready to do something.
[01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:27.320]   Right.
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:28.800]   Well, you could have his own signal.
[01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:30.920]   I'm sorry, I'm an American.
[01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:33.720]   Baseball is just the most boring, damn sport.
[01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:34.720]   I am so light.
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:36.160]   I don't agree on.
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:42.160]   So in the 2017 World Series, the Houston Astros, your team.
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:45.400]   Well, your team, you're from Houston.
[01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:48.800]   They're your team officially your team.
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:50.520]   You must own them.
[01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:51.960]   They're like the second-person.
[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:52.960]   You're a sponsor.
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:53.960]   You're a sponsor.
[01:59:53.960 --> 01:59:58.760]   We're determined by the baseball commissioner's office to have used a sign stealing system.
[01:59:58.760 --> 02:00:03.920]   Through the use of a TV monitor set up behind the Astros dugout.
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:10.280]   As a result, general manager and manager of the team were suspended and then fired.
[02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:16.160]   The bench coach was suspended.
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:20.680]   So it's a fairly serious charge.
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:23.160]   The New York Times had, I think it was New York Times Washington Post, one of them had
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:25.800]   a ridiculous op-ed this week saying baseball is failing.
[02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:27.840]   The government should take baseball over.
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:28.840]   That's why.
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:29.840]   Oh my God.
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:30.840]   It was absurd.
[02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:31.840]   We wasted space.
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:32.840]   Oh, that's crazy.
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:36.760]   That's crazy talk.
[02:00:36.760 --> 02:00:42.520]   I am very happy to say that the company that owns my radio show is building a new NFT network
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:43.520]   for podcasts.
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:44.840]   I put this just for you.
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:47.080]   I thought you'd be getting your FFTs out there.
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:48.600]   Oh, and gee.
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:53.680]   I Heart Media is pouring several hundred thousand dollars into purchasing the rights to roughly
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:01:00.800]   a dozen NFTs to create a new NFT based podcast network.
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:01.800]   You knew that was good.
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:04.080]   Have you been saying on your show that NFTs are BS?
[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:05.080]   Yes.
[02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:07.880]   You knew that was kind of...
[02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:13.200]   I Heart Media currently talks to make 10 to 15 investments in crypto, punks, mutant, ape,
[02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:16.240]   yacht club, world of women.
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:21.600]   It's eyeing work from emerging NFT creators such as Quarkies, Cryptodes and LUTs for adventures.
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:24.680]   You know, I remember when they hired somebody who was an expert in this.
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:28.240]   I thought, oh, this is not going to end well.
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:30.680]   But I don't understand how you turn it into a podcast.
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:32.200]   Oh, here we go.
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:38.600]   Conal Byrne, who is the beloved CEO of I Heart Media's digital audio group.
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:42.800]   He came to I Heart Media when they bought how things work, how stuff works.
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:47.400]   The idea is to combine IP from the various NFTs it acquires into a content collection.
[02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:52.160]   They will call the non-fun squad universe.
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:56.920]   Can't wait to join that one, the non-fun squad.
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:02:00.480]   Conal says, "We can world build for them creating narratives around them and bring those stories
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:03.320]   to life via podcasts."
[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:04.680]   World build?
[02:02:04.680 --> 02:02:05.680]   No one will listen to.
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:10.360]   The first commercial manifestation of that universe, a podcast network called the non-fun
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:11.960]   podcast network.
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:13.920]   Boy.
[02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:14.920]   With what made up monkeys?
[02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:15.920]   What's it going to be?
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:21.600]   Podcast will be hosted by voices that portray the NFT characters.
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:24.040]   Hi, I'm aboard.
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:31.200]   I don't know where they're going to go with this.
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:32.360]   But you knew this was coming.
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:33.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:34.360]   Totally.
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:38.360]   I Heart Media has invested aggressively in building out its podcast business.
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:39.560]   Yes, I know that.
[02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:40.680]   We tried to sell to them.
[02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:42.520]   They wouldn't buy us.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:48.760]   That spent hundreds of millions of dollars on people other than Twitter.
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:51.200]   Acquiring right to various podcasts and audio ad tech companies.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:58.560]   In all seriousness, like Spotify, like Amazon, I guess like Apple, YouTube, Facebook, these
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:00.480]   companies really want to own podcasting.
[02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:02.480]   So they're spending a lot of money buying shorts.
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:04.160]   If you just had an MPSL, it would be okay.
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:07.080]   You'd be snapped up.
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:11.960]   This is really pushing the envelope to pressure test the assumptions we have around what is
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:16.360]   IP, what is a host and what is talent?
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:18.520]   Said Carl Byrne.
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:19.520]   What is our company?
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:20.880]   What are we doing here?
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:21.880]   Am I a host?
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:23.720]   No, you are an NFT.
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:24.720]   Oh, okay.
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:25.720]   Are you talented?
[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:28.360]   Thanks for clearing that up.
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:29.360]   Geez.
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:31.320]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:35.800]   There's more burn says I Heart Media plans to test five to ten of its existing podcast
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:42.120]   shows as I live for Dows, a kind of crypto driven community.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:45.720]   You know, so the podcast will be a democracy then.
[02:03:45.720 --> 02:03:48.320]   Yeah, you can't buy a DOW for this show.
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:49.240]   Nope.
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:50.720]   Mm hmm.
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:55.440]   And I wonder why they never bought us.
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:56.440]   How about this?
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:57.440]   This is all.
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:58.440]   It's all my fault.
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:00.680]   This is all this right up your alley.
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:02.760]   This one is interesting.
[02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:07.760]   Street photography.
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:12.760]   It's a new book of street photography, but it's not a people.
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:15.400]   It's of the screens of their smartphones.
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:17.760]   I like this one.
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:19.760]   The nun said it's okay.
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:20.760]   Here's one.
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:25.160]   This is from NYC courtesy of Jeff Mermelstein and Mac, Mac 2020, a fatty tumor.
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:29.680]   I'll take him Wednesday when I get home from a run that I have.
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:30.680]   Question for you.
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:32.560]   "Causage links in my fridge.
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:35.120]   The door didn't close all the way Sunday.
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:38.680]   So they basically got room temperature by the time I realized to close the door.
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:42.760]   If I then closed the door and they got cold again, can I cook them for soup or would I
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:43.760]   vomit?"
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:50.920]   You know, this is why it's probably good not to read over people's shoulders.
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:55.520]   You know, which street photography there's a lot of controversy because people are concerned
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:57.800]   about the privacy and so forth.
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:02.400]   Depending on where you are, you know, a photographer can literally just walk up and snap your photo.
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:04.600]   But yeah, but this is a smart phone.
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:05.600]   But this is a smart phone.
[02:05:05.600 --> 02:05:07.200]   How do you define street photography?
[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:08.200]   Pardon?
[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:11.840]   How do you define street photography specifically?
[02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:17.800]   Anything out in the public, whether it be people, whether it be buildings, anything out
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:18.800]   in the public.
[02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:19.800]   Okay.
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:25.160]   But what gets me with this story is it says right there at the top, they took the photos
[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:29.400]   of these smart phones up close and personal with the knife.
[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:30.680]   I presume with permission.
[02:05:30.680 --> 02:05:31.680]   Right.
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:37.600]   So I'm assuming there was permission there, but what if there wasn't?
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:41.280]   Can you imagine just walking up to someone and say, "Hey, I'm a photographer.
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:44.520]   I'd like to take pictures of you texting right now of your phone."
[02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:45.520]   That is.
[02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:46.520]   I don't know if I could get away with that.
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:48.520]   There's a big question to me about the knowledge.
[02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:51.640]   That's a pretty charismatic and charming, but I don't think I've told that at all.
[02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:55.920]   I have to say though, there is a certain voyeuristic appeal in these pictures.
[02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:57.520]   I can't stop looking at them.
[02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:58.520]   They are good.
[02:05:58.520 --> 02:05:59.520]   That's the thing.
[02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:00.520]   They're great stories when you look at it.
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:01.520]   First, you look at this.
[02:06:01.520 --> 02:06:02.720]   It's completely out of context, right?
[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:04.560]   The text is on there.
[02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:06.160]   Didn't you look at the actual device itself?
[02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:07.160]   Yeah.
[02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:08.160]   Didn't you look at the screens?
[02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:09.160]   Are the screens clean?
[02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:10.160]   Are the screens chippy?
[02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:11.160]   A lot of them are cracked.
[02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:12.400]   And you look at their hands.
[02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:13.400]   Are they manicure?
[02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:15.040]   Are they female?
[02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:20.440]   I love this, but I'm just bothered by the aspect of someone literally walking up and
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:23.800]   just snapping the picture of my phone without my consent.
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:24.920]   No, no, no, no.
[02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:29.480]   I had a guy once in Chicago who came right up behind and then he came by and he snapped
[02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:35.480]   up a picture right below my face and then went going, "I pissed was pissed off as hell."
[02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:39.080]   In a lot of places, you can legally do that.
[02:06:39.080 --> 02:06:40.720]   It's totally fine.
[02:06:40.720 --> 02:06:45.240]   Well, they, because they didn't contemplate that you would be holding a phone with all
[02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:46.240]   of your life.
[02:06:46.240 --> 02:06:49.760]   Does it say anything about permission in there?
[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:55.600]   All of the photographs themselves taken in a very close range with an iPhone, which the
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:07:02.760]   photographer Jeff Mermalstein has been shooting with exclusively since 2016 after decades
[02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:03.760]   of using a Leica.
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:07.720]   I saw nothing about consent when I read it.
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:08.720]   Yeah.
[02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:13.320]   It's just, you know, you don't have to, you could do this surreptitiously.
[02:07:13.320 --> 02:07:17.280]   Dude, those are pretty sleazy.
[02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:18.280]   Those are in focus.
[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:19.280]   Yeah.
[02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:20.280]   How could you do that?
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:24.000]   Like, is that a reason, how far would you have to be to take the picture like that?
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.400]   I could get that picture.
[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:28.800]   You can get that, okay, standing two feet behind.
[02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:29.800]   Two feet on a hold up.
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:32.720]   I mean, again, that is in focus.
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:33.720]   That's the thing.
[02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:34.720]   You know, I...
[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:35.720]   Let me see.
[02:07:35.720 --> 02:07:36.720]   I'm going to...
[02:07:36.720 --> 02:07:37.960]   So we're two feet away.
[02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:38.960]   Yeah.
[02:07:38.960 --> 02:07:39.800]   Yeah, I would need to.
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:41.920]   I can zoom in, but...
[02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:44.280]   But that takes an effort.
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:45.720]   I'm still pretty close.
[02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:46.720]   Yeah.
[02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:48.560]   You would know that I'm taking a picture of your shoulder.
[02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:51.320]   I mean, I was able to get that.
[02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:52.320]   So I mean, I'm able to get...
[02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:55.000]   Well, stand behind your shoulder.
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.520]   I mean, I was far enough, but I was able to...
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:07:58.520]   That's pretty much the...
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:07:59.520]   Where's the camera?
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:00.520]   Where's the camera?
[02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:01.520]   Where is it?
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:02.520]   Over that shoulder here.
[02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:03.520]   I got it, John.
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:04.520]   Go ahead and do it again.
[02:08:04.520 --> 02:08:05.520]   No, no, no.
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:07.240]   I meant stand, literally stand behind and shoulder and see what it looks like.
[02:08:07.240 --> 02:08:08.680]   Yeah, but this is what I was...
[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:10.160]   John, what is that?
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:12.040]   John, John, John.
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:14.040]   Push the button.
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:15.240]   You had it a second ago.
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:16.800]   John, sleep me too.
[02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:17.800]   If we're sleeping...
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:18.800]   I'm just having fun.
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:20.480]   He's like, I got alive in this up.
[02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:21.480]   Come on.
[02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:23.880]   Can you get this shot over here?
[02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:24.880]   You had it a second ago.
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:25.880]   The PTZ.
[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:27.720]   No, that was over here.
[02:08:27.720 --> 02:08:28.720]   What, PTZ?
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:29.720]   Okay, well, anyway.
[02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:30.720]   Everywhere.
[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:33.160]   I mean, Jesse Leo, there we go.
[02:08:33.160 --> 02:08:34.320]   You stood up.
[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:35.320]   So...
[02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:36.320]   Behind and...
[02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:37.320]   You can...
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:38.320]   You can...
[02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:40.040]   That's pretty much the same quality as the image on the screen I'm seeing.
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:41.040]   So let me do it over.
[02:08:41.040 --> 02:08:42.040]   It's all right.
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:43.800]   So two feet away.
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:47.720]   By the way, with my Samsung S22, no problem.
[02:08:47.720 --> 02:08:49.440]   I got 10 feet optical zoom.
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:50.440]   Oh, fancy.
[02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:53.840]   So it's a little harder with an iPhone.
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:58.760]   And is there on the street concentrating on sending a message to his mother?
[02:08:58.760 --> 02:09:00.280]   You walk up behind him.
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:01.280]   Okay.
[02:09:01.280 --> 02:09:02.840]   And we see an X on the floor.
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:03.840]   Show the shot.
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:05.680]   I'm pretty far behind him.
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:07.840]   All right.
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:08.840]   You wouldn't...
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:09.840]   Would you...
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:10.840]   If I...
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:11.840]   You probably...
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:15.280]   If you were doing a text and you weren't really paying attention, that's pretty good.
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:16.280]   Oh my...
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:17.280]   That's the same quality.
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:18.280]   That is pretty good.
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:21.280]   That's the same quality as the one you've seen on the...
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:22.280]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:23.280]   On this book.
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:24.280]   Oh boy.
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:25.280]   That's pretty good.
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:26.280]   Yeah.
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:27.280]   And that was a couple of feet back.
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:30.560]   So yeah, I would submit you can.
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:34.320]   I thought it'd been a lot more difficult to get focused at clear.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:35.320]   But...
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:36.320]   Well, you got to be as good as I was.
[02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:37.320]   Right.
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:39.320]   You got to be a hell of a street filmmaker.
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:43.600]   If you're a real report, this is no problem.
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:46.000]   Computational photography, especially if it fills in the...
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.240]   That's actually a pretty good picture.
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:51.480]   I got to say, the other thing is it's kind of an interesting picture with your hands and
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:52.480]   there's a...
[02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:53.480]   Yeah, I'll just do it.
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:54.480]   There's an immediacy.
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:09:56.480]   There is a voyeuristic...
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:59.320]   So this would be actually not so hard to do.
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:01.880]   With an iPhone and with an S22, it'd be a lot easier.
[02:10:01.880 --> 02:10:04.520]   It says a lot about me just looking at that screen.
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:06.600]   Oh, it says it's a VPN is on.
[02:10:06.600 --> 02:10:07.600]   VPN connected.
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:08.600]   That's one story.
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:09.600]   To Los Angeles.
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:10.600]   That's one story.
[02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:13.160]   But then there's my background.
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:14.760]   Yeah.
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:20.560]   Which looks like fireworks going off after some sort of event.
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:21.560]   Can you see that, John?
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:23.660]   Anything else.
[02:10:23.660 --> 02:10:25.120]   There's your fingerprint.
[02:10:25.120 --> 02:10:26.120]   The weather.
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:27.120]   The weather.
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:28.120]   There's your...
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:29.120]   I don't know.
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:30.120]   There's a lot.
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:31.120]   What is the event?
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:32.120]   That's Clemson.
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:33.120]   Of course.
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:34.120]   I see orange.
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:35.120]   Of course.
[02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:37.480]   So this is Clemson Morning, the US Championship two years ago.
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:39.200]   No, it does actually in Death Valley.
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:40.200]   Oh, okay.
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:41.200]   Nevermind.
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:42.200]   But it's still.
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:43.200]   It's a story there.
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:44.200]   It's a story.
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:45.360]   That's what I like about that.
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:46.360]   This is actually...
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:47.360]   That's why I like this.
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:48.360]   That's kind of a cool street photography.
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:53.280]   It's a little out of focus because of our camera, not because the shot is out of focus.
[02:10:53.280 --> 02:10:54.280]   Shot is actually...
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:55.280]   There we go.
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:56.280]   Yeah.
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:10:57.280]   Zoom in.
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:10:58.280]   Zoom.
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:10:59.280]   Center.
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:00.280]   Yeah.
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:03.280]   Your camera is on the other hand.
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:05.880]   Mr. Jammer Bee is back there.
[02:11:05.880 --> 02:11:12.320]   Hey, let's make another picture of me holding the picture of him holding fingers on fingers.
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:14.400]   We're cursing.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:16.360]   Now that tells a story.
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:19.800]   Yeah, you're that is sharp on your fingers there.
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:20.800]   It's not hard.
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:21.800]   It's not hard.
[02:11:21.800 --> 02:11:22.800]   It's not hard.
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:23.800]   These are good.
[02:11:23.800 --> 02:11:24.800]   These phones.
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:26.760]   We also know that Ant has clean fingernails, which is nice to see.
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:27.760]   Very nice.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:28.760]   That's good.
[02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:30.240]   You can see a little bit of blood from when he punched me, but that's okay.
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:32.240]   How's that, Ant?
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:33.480]   Does that work out there?
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:34.480]   Oh, there's a...
[02:11:34.480 --> 02:11:36.480]   There's the zoom in.
[02:11:36.480 --> 02:11:37.480]   Yeah.
[02:11:37.480 --> 02:11:39.880]   Honestly, I think those are good images.
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:42.400]   Well, you just took a picture of me taking a picture of you.
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:43.400]   Yeah, you didn't know it.
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:44.400]   No, that's good.
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:45.400]   See, I didn't even notice.
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:46.400]   Even though.
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:47.400]   Yeah.
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:48.400]   Even though you have cameras all around in the water.
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:53.320]   It's just a good thing I normally have my head on the Swivel one I'm out and about.
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:54.760]   I have very mixed feelings about this.
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:56.760]   I think these are great photos.
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:57.760]   Great photos.
[02:11:57.760 --> 02:11:58.760]   It's fascinating.
[02:11:58.760 --> 02:11:59.760]   Yes.
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:02.000]   And I think it's a total invasion of privacy, but you can get the book.
[02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:06.160]   It's #NYC from Jeff Mearmelstein published by Mac.
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:08.680]   And you can always put a, what are those called?
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:11.760]   Screen reflector thing on your phone so people can't see it.
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:14.920]   If you can see it, they can see it.
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:19.960]   And again, the photographers, not out of line, they can clearly do this.
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:21.400]   I just wouldn't do it.
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:23.080]   It tells the story, doesn't it?
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:26.600]   What's interesting, they made them all blue, which I don't know if I agree with, but...
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:27.600]   The stylized.
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:28.600]   Yes, the style.
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:31.760]   But I just love to see the broken screens.
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:33.080]   It totally tells the story.
[02:12:33.080 --> 02:12:34.160]   A bit in fingernails.
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:35.160]   Yeah.
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:36.480]   This is a great one.
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:38.080]   This is hysterical.
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:41.360]   Guy sends a text saying this, there isn't much of a future in this country.
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:43.440]   Everybody is stupid, lazy, and fat.
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:46.000]   The world is leaving us behind.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.360]   And the response, the guy's typing in his strawberry.
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:50.360]   Strawberry.
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:51.360]   That's hysterical.
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:52.360]   I love it.
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:55.280]   This is hysterical.
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:56.760]   This is a great commentary.
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:12:59.120]   I love this book.
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:00.360]   But I'm still a little...
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:02.240]   So would you buy it and thus support the author?
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:07.240]   That's a good question.
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:09.240]   Well, give the title in case somebody else wants to.
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:10.240]   I did.
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:11.240]   #NYC, published by Mac.
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:13.240]   Jeff Murmelstein is the photographer.
[02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:15.040]   I forget where I found that.
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:17.440]   That's a really interesting story.
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:22.480]   We talked about street photography on my show, and some photography with Miss Chris
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:23.480]   and Johnson.
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:28.680]   And she was in New York, and she pretty much spoke about that experience of being in New
[02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:29.760]   York.
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:34.560]   You can just do that really nearly, even to the point where some of the folks are like,
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:38.840]   "Okay, they're used to photographers walking around, so maybe that's the case here."
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:40.360]   Or they're like, "Okay, yeah, go ahead.
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:41.360]   Just take the photo."
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:42.360]   It doesn't.
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:46.480]   Honestly, if I'm doing this, it doesn't look like I'm taking a picture of you.
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:47.480]   Nope.
[02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:48.480]   Sure it doesn't.
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:49.480]   It looks like I'm looking at my phone.
[02:13:49.480 --> 02:13:50.480]   So what did Bill Cunningham do?
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:51.480]   Did he ask people's permission?
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:52.480]   Yeah, I think Bill did.
[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:53.480]   He was just so well-known.
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:54.960]   Yeah, but the other thing is he had a camera.
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.760]   So his camera, you know, he had a Leica.
[02:13:56.760 --> 02:13:57.760]   So it looked like...
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:13:58.760]   Up your face.
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:00.760]   Yeah, up in the story.
[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:02.760]   Yeah, this is really kind of...
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:03.760]   I'm waiting.
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:09.600]   I wait the moral panic of privacy violation, presumed privacy in public stories that will
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:11.440]   come in the New York Times of The Washington Post Nation.
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:12.440]   It's coming.
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:13.760]   Oh no, it's art.
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:16.000]   Nobody cares.
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.040]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for...
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:23.880]   The Google Change Log.
[02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:25.680]   We'll make this quick.
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:28.480]   I got a muffin and a cup waiting.
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:32.160]   Google Maps is adding toll road prices.
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:34.800]   Toll road prices, more map details.
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:39.880]   Apple Watch improvements is more big, big update to Google Maps, especially if you're
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:40.880]   on iOS.
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:42.680]   They announced this yesterday.
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:47.280]   A new pinned trip widget on your watch.
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:48.720]   You could pin a trip.
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:52.160]   The option to get directions on Google Maps directly from your Apple Watch.
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:55.160]   This is a feature really Apple has owned up to now.
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:59.880]   One of the reasons I only use Apple Maps is because I can have directions walking directions
[02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:00.880]   on my watch.
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:01.880]   It's convenient.
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:02.880]   More even while I'm driving.
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:07.040]   I know I have the map over here, but my watch will buzz at me and I know I'm going to make
[02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:08.040]   a turn and stuff.
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:09.040]   I love that.
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:10.240]   That's a really nice thing to add.
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:13.600]   I guess I thought maybe it was Apple keeping him from doing it, but maybe it's just Google
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:15.040]   didn't get around to it.
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:19.160]   You'll also get toll prices for the first time on Google Maps.
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:21.600]   That's cool.
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:27.880]   The toll prices will be provided by local tolling authorities.
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:31.640]   You can even see, so now instead of just the mileage of a trip, you'll see the cost of
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:34.960]   a trip, right?
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:39.680]   This will be nearly 2,000 toll roads in the US, India, Japan, and Indonesia more countries
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:43.560]   coming soon.
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:48.040]   You'll also see there'll be features that will make it less stressful to drive on unfamiliar
[02:15:48.040 --> 02:15:53.040]   roads.
[02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:58.760]   There'll be more details on the road to help you understand that that's where I am.
[02:15:58.760 --> 02:16:00.720]   I see that.
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:03.520]   New iOS updates to make it easier to use maps on the go.
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:06.520]   I mentioned the PINN's trip widget.
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:13.680]   You can pin your trips into your Go tab right from the iOS home screen.
[02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:17.280]   You'll see your arrival time, the next departure for your transit trip and suggested route if
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:18.280]   you're driving.
[02:16:18.280 --> 02:16:20.720]   Oh, I see.
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:24.320]   This is for the widgets on the smartphone, the iPhone.
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:25.320]   I get it like that.
[02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:26.320]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:28.080]   Now you can have a widget for school.
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:30.840]   Go into school.
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:31.840]   Nice improvements.
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:32.840]   Google Maps.
[02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:36.880]   It's nice to see them putting some effort into it.
[02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:37.880]   Google Docs.
[02:16:37.880 --> 02:16:43.120]   Now, I know you've been waiting for this, can have emoji reactions right there in the
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:44.120]   Google Doc.
[02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:46.280]   Can you see editors with this?
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:50.120]   Someone I knew was so excited by this.
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:55.200]   What are you doing in Google Docs that you're like, yes.
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:56.680]   Emoji reactions.
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:01.760]   Hey, I just added color emojis to my e-max.
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:03.320]   So there.
[02:17:03.320 --> 02:17:05.280]   I can use it for my students now.
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:06.280]   Yeah.
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:08.280]   When I do their stories, yes.
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:12.920]   Oh, that's true because they think good grammar sometimes is aggressively angry.
[02:17:12.920 --> 02:17:13.920]   Right.
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:16.240]   And put periods in, but you can also put a smile.
[02:17:16.240 --> 02:17:17.240]   Happy face.
[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:18.240]   Happy face.
[02:17:18.240 --> 02:17:25.600]   Remember, Google was going to cut off legacy G Suite users and make them pay.
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:29.360]   Google is going to put that off.
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:32.560]   So and they'll also be a waiting list and no cost waiting list.
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:36.720]   So Google announced in January, G Suite Legacy Free Edition accounts would have to start
[02:17:36.720 --> 02:17:39.600]   paying this year, but that's going to be slightly delayed.
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:43.840]   You will have until May 1st to select a new workspace plan.
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:46.920]   That's up for very long.
[02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:47.920]   Yeah.
[02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:51.040]   Well, if you don't, billing won't start till July 1st.
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:55.200]   After that, your Google workspace subscription will be suspended until you set up billing.
[02:17:55.200 --> 02:17:58.680]   So you have in a way till July, right?
[02:17:58.680 --> 02:17:59.680]   Was June.
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:02.240]   Yeah, it's not a big difference.
[02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:03.240]   Okay.
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:04.240]   I put that in there.
[02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:05.240]   That's not worth that.
[02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:06.480]   That's not the standard of change.
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:11.520]   Google said it would offer a no cost transfer option that moves users to a free Gmail account.
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:12.520]   So that's good.
[02:18:12.520 --> 02:18:13.520]   Nice.
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:15.640]   That's good.
[02:18:15.640 --> 02:18:17.800]   They were talking about it last night on all about Android.
[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:20.200]   Pixel 6, April update is out.
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:24.160]   Fixes some camera problems on the Pixel 6 wireless charging issues.
[02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:26.360]   If you've got a Pixel 6 phone, update it now.
[02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:27.560]   Got mine yesterday.
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:29.060]   Ooh.
[02:18:29.060 --> 02:18:33.320]   Google Translate can now auto switch Gboard to the appropriate language.
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:36.680]   You can type back in that language.
[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:41.640]   And Google hardware gets unified security reward program.
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:45.680]   That's for Pixel Nest and Fitbit.
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:47.400]   What is that?
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:50.680]   So it's like a bug bounty.
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:52.480]   Oh, okay.
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:53.480]   It's an.
[02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:56.720]   I thought they've always had a bug bounty.
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:18:57.960]   Yeah.
[02:18:57.960 --> 02:19:01.080]   Now brings Nest and Fitbit into the folder with Pixel.
[02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:03.640]   So I guess they didn't have it for Nest and Fitbit.
[02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:06.600]   Well, they had a bug bounty program for Nest devices.
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:08.600]   But I guess now it's just the same program.
[02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:09.600]   Maybe there's a different one.
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:14.600]   Maybe they're all united now into the Android and Google devices security reward program.
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:15.600]   All right.
[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:17.720]   Anyway, these are good things.
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:20.160]   This is something that keeps us all safe.
[02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:21.160]   All right.
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:22.160]   Moving right along.
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:25.240]   And if wise had had this, maybe they wouldn't have been three years.
[02:19:25.240 --> 02:19:26.600]   Three that come years.
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:28.200]   The way that had an insecure camera.
[02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:31.800]   We talked about this on the show and I have a question about that.
[02:19:31.800 --> 02:19:40.520]   So the, I know that people are outraged over this, but the exploit required you to be on
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:42.440]   the person's actual wifi now.
[02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:44.120]   So that's what I thought.
[02:19:44.120 --> 02:19:49.760]   And that's what wise said, but I asked Steve Gibson this and he said no.
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:53.320]   Oh, so I, all I know is.
[02:19:53.320 --> 02:19:54.320]   They more things.
[02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:56.320]   It's not clear.
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:59.600]   And not, it's not clear.
[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:03.080]   And I'm Steve, what under, Steve understands this better than I do.
[02:20:03.080 --> 02:20:08.760]   I think what happened, I'm guessing what happened is initially the initial exploit was
[02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:14.480]   in fact, uh, open to any and then they made some slight changes that made it that you
[02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:16.120]   would have to be on the network.
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:20.720]   But Steve said, no, it could be launched from the internet.
[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:23.840]   Originally or if they changed that, they didn't fix the.
[02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:24.840]   I'm unclear.
[02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:28.760]   Because this was, I was like, so the verge wrote a story.
[02:20:28.760 --> 02:20:36.040]   Wise rebutted and the verge had an update that said, Oh, yeah, but I'm still upset about
[02:20:36.040 --> 02:20:37.040]   it.
[02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:41.200]   But yeah, it had to be remote, but I think that may not be the case.
[02:20:41.200 --> 02:20:50.680]   I think wise may not have, uh, it may not be completely clear about this.
[02:20:50.680 --> 02:20:58.680]   So as I said, I asked Steve and he said, no, you do not have to be on the victims network,
[02:20:58.680 --> 02:20:59.680]   which is bad enough.
[02:20:59.680 --> 02:21:02.240]   I mean, that means there's, you could have an evil made attack or somebody could sit
[02:21:02.240 --> 02:21:05.200]   on your curb on your Wi-Fi.
[02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:07.680]   But it does mean it's not as bad as it sounds.
[02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:11.840]   I mean, it's only, you know, somebody, somebody have to connect to your home Wi-Fi.
[02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:12.840]   You can.
[02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:13.840]   Right.
[02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:16.840]   Well, and there were, I mean, we had the, what are those called?
[02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:21.160]   The we mode devices for years had, was it a security flower?
[02:21:21.160 --> 02:21:22.160]   Was it their design?
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:24.160]   I mean, they argued that it was their design that did this.
[02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:29.680]   But if you are on the person's Wi-Fi network and had the app open, you could actually control
[02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:30.680]   their devices.
[02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:31.680]   Yeah.
[02:21:31.680 --> 02:21:32.680]   And that was by design.
[02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:37.240]   So I kind of looked at why is treating this kind of like that because that's what it sounded
[02:21:37.240 --> 02:21:38.240]   like.
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:39.240]   Yeah.
[02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:45.160]   And in fact, um, in an update to his article, I'm done with wise Sean Hollister quotes bit
[02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:51.600]   defender saying that it is unlikely that somebody outside your network could get it.
[02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:57.360]   The remote from outside the network attack requires an initial camera ID that can only
[02:21:57.360 --> 02:21:59.800]   be acquired if present on the same network as the device.
[02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:02.560]   It's completely random and a non predictable string.
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:04.520]   It's kind of like a really good password.
[02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:06.040]   It's random.
[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:09.680]   So somebody would have to get on your Wi-Fi, get the token.
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:14.800]   And then later now that you've got the token, you can go.
[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:19.800]   So you can drive off with the token in hand and then it then get into your camera after
[02:22:19.800 --> 02:22:20.800]   that.
[02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:21.800]   Yes.
[02:22:21.800 --> 02:22:23.960]   But that assumes they had access to your network.
[02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:25.040]   They have what it would have been.
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:28.840]   According to Bitdefender, that's the case that you would.
[02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:30.760]   Well, that's not that's not as bad.
[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:31.760]   Right.
[02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:32.760]   I agree.
[02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:35.080]   It's possible, but that that's a pretty targeted attack.
[02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:36.080]   That's right.
[02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:37.080]   Mm hmm.
[02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:38.080]   That's right.
[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:44.560]   So maybe I should have gotten Steve to clarify, but it's so and or maybe Steve is.
[02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:49.200]   You were actually talking about something totally different, but it was a tangential that I was
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:50.200]   wanting to explore.
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:51.840]   No, we hadn't really talked about it.
[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:56.640]   This growth literally a minute or two after we ended the show last week.
[02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:58.720]   So we hadn't talked about it on the show yet.
[02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:00.960]   And I think it's an important thing to talk about.
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:03.680]   There's two, in my mind, there's two questions.
[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:06.000]   Why did Bitdefender sit on it for three years?
[02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:07.440]   Because they knew about it.
[02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:10.320]   And normally in responsible disclosure, you tell a company, look, you're going to get
[02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:12.320]   three months to fix this.
[02:23:12.320 --> 02:23:14.320]   And after that, we're going to tell the world.
[02:23:14.320 --> 02:23:19.440]   Bitdefender apparently was told by Wise, we can't fix it.
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:23.240]   There's not that Wise says there's not enough memory in the camera for us to patch it.
[02:23:23.240 --> 02:23:30.080]   And Bitdefender decided, well, since it's unfixable, we won't force them to disclose.
[02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:35.120]   And obviously, because as soon as you disclose, you're telling hackers how to do it in effect.
[02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:39.760]   So they everybody decided, well, since it's an unfixable thing, we'll just be mum about
[02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:40.760]   it.
[02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:42.800]   And that's Wise continued to sell those cameras.
[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:43.800]   Sure it did.
[02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:47.200]   For three years, they shouldn't have.
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:51.600]   They should have, in my opinion, they should have, if they can't fix it, they should have
[02:23:51.600 --> 02:23:56.200]   offered, said to told everybody of the flaw and said, we'll give you a discount on another
[02:23:56.200 --> 02:23:57.200]   one.
[02:23:57.200 --> 02:24:00.640]   It is also because Wise doesn't really design the things themselves they just buy.
[02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:02.360]   No, it's Chinese camera.
[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:04.320]   Wise does do the software though.
[02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:07.360]   So they are responsible for the flaw.
[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:09.200]   The other problem is it's a $20 camera.
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:10.960]   So what do you expect?
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:11.960]   Yeah.
[02:24:11.960 --> 02:24:15.560]   And Wise probably could not easily afford to replace those.
[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:18.880]   And that's the Google change log.
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:20.400]   Whoa.
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:22.400]   Whoa.
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:23.400]   That's a good point.
[02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:24.480]   Thank you.
[02:24:24.480 --> 02:24:25.920]   We left that hanging, didn't we?
[02:24:25.920 --> 02:24:27.720]   It's like a hanging particle.
[02:24:27.720 --> 02:24:29.880]   I don't know if there was more in the Google change.
[02:24:29.880 --> 02:24:30.880]   I was what I was apologizing.
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:33.080]   I was like, oh, no, you're done.
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:38.160]   I thought the brakes on the train just went, meh.
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:44.160]   I really have to quiz Steve then more.
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:49.760]   And maybe that he, when he said, no, no, you don't have to be local, he meant after you
[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:51.520]   get the key.
[02:24:51.520 --> 02:25:00.760]   But he was, my sense is he was of the impression that you, you know, this was, you were vulnerable
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:06.560]   even if the hacker was not on your curb, which would be a very different issue.
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:07.560]   Yeah.
[02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:12.680]   I thought I heard something like it was someone trying to go after an FTP server, pretty much
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:13.680]   the same way.
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:14.680]   Right.
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:15.680]   And it was open.
[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:18.560]   So I mean, the main point still stand.
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:20.000]   There was a security flaw.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.680]   Wise knew about it, bit defending knew about it, both conspired not to tell anybody about
[02:25:24.680 --> 02:25:27.000]   it for three years.
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:33.240]   Wise replaced the camera in January without saying much about it.
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:34.640]   This is the message they sent out.
[02:25:34.640 --> 02:25:35.640]   Hey, friends.
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:40.440]   It's a new year and it comes with some important updates protecting you and your security is
[02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:41.920]   always top of mind for us to do that.
[02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:48.480]   We need you to update your wise app to at least 2.27 and update your wise cam firmware.
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:53.240]   And for those of you with wise cam version one, they didn't say anything about that.
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:54.240]   Burn it.
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:55.240]   But yeah.
[02:25:55.240 --> 02:25:57.800]   Well, they've been waiting for version one to go.
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:00.040]   I mean, they update these things every few years.
[02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:03.120]   They can now, by the way, they can now update the firmware.
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:18.560]   So, so, why says these vulnerabilities require some form of local network access?
[02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:21.640]   So you would either had to open your network.
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:22.800]   Maybe that's what Steve was talking about.
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:28.080]   If you put your cameras on the internet, then somebody could attack you, but you'd have
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:29.520]   to put your cameras on the internet.
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:32.440]   Most people have their cameras inside a firewall, right?
[02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:36.040]   And let the software share it.
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:37.040]   Hopefully.
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:38.040]   Yeah.
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:43.400]   Despite extensive efforts stretching into 2022, we found that wise cam V1, again, this is
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:51.640]   wise talking, last sold in March 2018 could not support the necessary security updates.
[02:26:51.640 --> 02:26:52.640]   The limited camera memory.
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:54.760]   So they didn't keep selling it then.
[02:26:54.760 --> 02:26:56.600]   They stopped selling it in March 2018.
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:26:57.600]   That's right.
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:01.080]   But still, there were a lot of people, including me, that had V1s.
[02:27:01.080 --> 02:27:07.680]   That's why they created the wise cam too, because we couldn't patch.
[02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:08.680]   Okay.
[02:27:08.680 --> 02:27:13.480]   We were transparent with our customers and then disclosed our inability to continue to offer
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:18.280]   the necessary security updates in an email announcing the end of life for this product.
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:19.560]   So they said we can't update it.
[02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:25.640]   What they did neglected to say is even though there's a serious flaw for security reasons,
[02:27:25.640 --> 02:27:31.320]   we again chose to remain prudent about the specific reason why until now to limit the
[02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:34.520]   risk to all of our affected users across the affected models.
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:36.040]   Does that limit the risk?
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:37.440]   That's the question.
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:43.000]   Well, what might be more interesting is if you're on that version one, you can't actually
[02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.280]   subscribe to any of their subscription services.
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:48.640]   So maybe they were just trying to push people from using those cameras anymore.
[02:27:48.640 --> 02:27:49.640]   Right.
[02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:55.320]   If I'm being, if I'm being my most cynical, maybe like, yeah, you know, it isn't as bad
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:27:57.040]   as we initially thought.
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:27:58.880]   I think that's correct.
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:27:59.880]   Okay.
[02:27:59.880 --> 02:28:00.880]   All right.
[02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:02.920]   Carry on, my friends.
[02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:03.920]   Carry on.
[02:28:03.920 --> 02:28:05.600]   Well, I'll tell you what we're going to do right now.
[02:28:05.600 --> 02:28:08.360]   We're going to take a little break.
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:12.440]   There is much more to talk about, but we just have run out of time.
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:13.440]   We're steam.
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:15.280]   I feel like we're all a little laggy today.
[02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:16.280]   Yeah, I'll are not me.
[02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:17.280]   I'm good.
[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:18.280]   Oh, I feel good too.
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:20.600]   I just did 100 pushups before the show.
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:21.600]   All right.
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:22.600]   Let's take a break.
[02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:27.880]   Next, picks of the week and you shamed me into having one this week.
[02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:31.960]   So there it's all your.

[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:57.000]   I remember when we started video and we had this confab saying, should we tell cash fly?
[02:28:57.000 --> 02:29:02.840]   At the time, when we first started, we were spreading out our bandwidth all over the place.
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:08.520]   We asked people to use a bit to our cash life saved our bacon, but here they were hosting
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:12.000]   our audio and now we're going to host video, but you know what?
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:13.000]   They're great.
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:14.000]   We put the video on.
[02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:18.040]   We greatly increased the amount of data we sent through the cash line networks to petabytes

[02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:22.640]   We really appreciate it.
[02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:26.240]   Time for Stacey's thing of the week.
[02:31:26.240 --> 02:31:28.960]   Okay, it hasn't arrived yet.
[02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:35.960]   So I can't show it to you, but I just purchased something called the turtle T-E-R-T-I-L-L.
[02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:43.960]   It is by the CEO of the company is the former co-founder of iRobot and made it work.
[02:31:43.960 --> 02:31:45.360]   Wait a minute, let me guess.
[02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:49.800]   Is it a garden-tilling robot?
[02:31:49.800 --> 02:31:52.200]   It is a weeding robot.
[02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:53.200]   Weeding.
[02:31:53.200 --> 02:31:58.400]   Solar powered Roomba looking robot that weeds your garden.
[02:31:58.400 --> 02:32:01.080]   With laser please tell me it's laser.
[02:32:01.080 --> 02:32:02.880]   It is not laser.
[02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:06.680]   Oh, this is fantastic.
[02:32:06.680 --> 02:32:08.240]   It's $349.
[02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:09.920]   There are some limits to know.
[02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:15.080]   So this is not for this is for someone who likes to play with things and they know that.
[02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:17.960]   It's got the sensors on it so it won't bump into things.
[02:32:17.960 --> 02:32:24.320]   It basically the wheels on it disrupt the soil enough that it's going to prevent the
[02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:26.040]   weeds from popping up.
[02:32:26.040 --> 02:32:30.160]   If they do pop up, it has a little it looks like the Roomba little spinner thing.
[02:32:30.160 --> 02:32:34.080]   It's a weed wacker and it just chops down the weeds.
[02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:37.840]   It avoids things that are over four inches high.
[02:32:37.840 --> 02:32:42.160]   So if you've got seedlings, you're supposed to put like physical wire barriers that come
[02:32:42.160 --> 02:32:46.160]   in that they have that come with it or you could build your own.
[02:32:46.160 --> 02:32:49.720]   So it'll bounce right off of those.
[02:32:49.720 --> 02:32:50.920]   And anything taller.
[02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:54.840]   So if you've got weeds that are for inches or more high, you need to pluck those and
[02:32:54.840 --> 02:32:56.960]   then let this live.
[02:32:56.960 --> 02:33:00.120]   It only weeds for about two hours a day.
[02:33:00.120 --> 02:33:02.760]   Oh, here's the little weed wacker thing.
[02:33:02.760 --> 02:33:04.280]   Little is right.
[02:33:04.280 --> 02:33:05.280]   Wow.
[02:33:05.280 --> 02:33:07.680]   So it looks like a solar.
[02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:08.680]   It does.
[02:33:08.680 --> 02:33:09.680]   So it's solar operated.
[02:33:09.680 --> 02:33:11.680]   So it basically lives outside.
[02:33:11.680 --> 02:33:17.840]   It charges it runs it wax and then it goes and hangs out and charges for a minute.
[02:33:17.840 --> 02:33:24.880]   And then so it only can do like 200 square feet, which is kind of a small amount.
[02:33:24.880 --> 02:33:30.400]   So there are lots of caveats here, but it's adorable and I can't wait for mind to arrive.
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:34.320]   I feel like it's kind of a little bit like a toy.
[02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:35.320]   It is.
[02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:40.220]   But so back when Roomba's first launched, they were also kind of like right.
[02:33:40.220 --> 02:33:45.000]   So I, you know, this is to me, this is like pretty.
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.800]   What is one of the one early asks?
[02:33:47.800 --> 02:33:48.800]   Yeah.
[02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:52.800]   Well, I feel like it's my job to do that, you know?
[02:33:52.800 --> 02:33:58.360]   And if you, I mean, if you have, if this is of interest to you, it would be amazing.
[02:33:58.360 --> 02:33:59.360]   Like to play with.
[02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:02.760]   So what kind of garden will you be turtilling?
[02:34:02.760 --> 02:34:07.440]   So I have a raised bed herb garden that I also plant my tomatoes and like stuff in.
[02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:09.200]   So I'll put it in there.
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:10.200]   Yeah.
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:11.200]   Perfect.
[02:34:11.200 --> 02:34:12.200]   It's pretty cool.
[02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:13.200]   Seeing the little weed wacker on the bottom.
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:14.200]   It's cute, isn't it?
[02:34:14.200 --> 02:34:15.200]   I know.
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:16.200]   It's just so cute.
[02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:17.200]   It's pretty little.
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:21.280]   I mean, my, my, our weeds, it's not going to do much with, but well, you have to.
[02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:24.560]   You'll need one more time before you put it in there.
[02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:25.560]   Right.
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:27.200]   And then it'll prevent them from popping up.
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:29.200]   And if they do pop up, it'll whack them.
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:30.200]   Right.
[02:34:30.200 --> 02:34:32.480]   And it'll just keep running throughout the season.
[02:34:32.480 --> 02:34:34.800]   And so the idea is you won't have to leave it yet.
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:35.800]   Yeah.
[02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:38.800]   Do one, one last flush and clean, if you will.
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:39.800]   Yeah.
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:44.600]   Proven as effective as hand weeding by the Cornell School of Architecture.
[02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:45.880]   There is an endorsement.
[02:34:45.880 --> 02:34:46.880]   Wow.
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:48.760]   The School of Architecture or Agriculture?
[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:49.760]   Well, that's the problem.
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:54.760]   I was going to say, our, our agriculture, I got it wrong.
[02:34:54.760 --> 02:34:55.760]   Oh.
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:01.920]   I was like, um, great.
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:10.080]   My approved for use and weeding by the military cadets at West Point.
[02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:11.080]   West Point.
[02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:13.640]   Um, turtle T.E.R.
[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:17.440]   T.I.L.L.
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:18.440]   Like Terra.
[02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:19.440]   Terra T.E.L.
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:20.440]   Pronounce turtle.
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:21.440]   It's got a little turtle logo.
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:22.440]   And it looks like a little green turtle.
[02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:25.160]   It looks like a, it looks like a room, a green room.
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:26.160]   A green room.
[02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:27.160]   They said it was solar panels on top.
[02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:28.960]   Apparently it fertilizes as well.
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:31.600]   No, that is a separate product that they have.
[02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:32.600]   Oh.
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:37.280]   You can, and this is actually really useful if you're into that sort of thing.
[02:35:37.280 --> 02:35:39.960]   You can send them a soil test.
[02:35:39.960 --> 02:35:42.600]   They'll send you back an appropriate fertilizer.
[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:43.600]   Oh.
[02:35:43.600 --> 02:35:44.600]   Or your particular.
[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:45.600]   Completely unrelated in effect.
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:46.600]   Oh, that's interesting.
[02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:47.600]   Yes.
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:52.320]   So, turtle weeding robots and soil testers.
[02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:56.240]   And now it's time for Jeff Jarvis number of the week.
[02:35:56.240 --> 02:35:59.720]   So I'm going to do something special in a second, but first with a little late breaking
[02:35:59.720 --> 02:36:00.720]   number here.
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:05.820]   So Washington Post reports that Elon Musk was 11 days late publicly declaring that he
[02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:08.880]   had amassed more than 5% as is required by law.
[02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:10.560]   That is a space he's in the courts.
[02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:12.200]   He doesn't much care.
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:18.800]   So he was able to continue buying stock from 5% up to 9.2% at $39 a share versus the $50
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:21.120]   that came out when the news came out.
[02:36:21.120 --> 02:36:27.320]   Me and he made just from that delta there $156 million.
[02:36:27.320 --> 02:36:29.960]   So who else got paid at his seat?
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:33.480]   You know, we got off the board for this.
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:36.040]   Why isn't the SEC finding this fella?
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:38.240]   Yes, I'm going to get paid.
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:43.120]   So the law, which by the way is an old law requires it, as soon as you go over 5% stake
[02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:46.760]   in a company, you have to notify.
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:51.760]   March 15th, he reached that, but he only made the public disclosure on Monday.
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:54.040]   Well that seems like a big deal.
[02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:55.640]   That's an SEC violation.
[02:36:55.640 --> 02:36:58.640]   Especially since you can see how he made money because of it.
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:36:59.640]   Yes.
[02:36:59.640 --> 02:37:01.200]   Or an auto lighter note.
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:02.200]   I bet nothing.
[02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:05.200]   I'm going to go to pictures here.
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:08.160]   Don't show the last picture until I come to the end of the success of the story.
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:09.160]   OK.
[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:14.280]   While you guys were off, you know, taking time off, leaving the show, Leo and me here alone,
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:15.280]   you know, trying to work.
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:18.640]   Why was it a tiny machine learning conference?
[02:37:18.640 --> 02:37:19.880]   I went out.
[02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:23.840]   I went out and I decided to do a reporting trip for the sake of the show.
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:24.840]   Oh, good man.
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:26.680]   I said I'm going to go home.
[02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:28.480]   I said it wasn't happening right here.
[02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:29.480]   Exactly.
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:30.480]   Exactly.
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:33.160]   I read a story and I found out it was this thing that was technology based, was nearby
[02:37:33.160 --> 02:37:34.160]   in Jersey City.
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:35.160]   I left Manhattan.
[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:36.160]   I drove to Jersey City.
[02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:37.360]   I went to look at it.
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:42.000]   There is a Robo Burger maker, a burger vending machine.
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:43.760]   Stay on this picture for a second.
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:44.760]   Oh, boy.
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:51.760]   And so you see this box here and you can put in the money and decide your condiments and
[02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:54.400]   get your your next one now.
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:55.400]   One more.
[02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:56.400]   I got to give you a clicker.
[02:37:56.400 --> 02:37:57.400]   Yours their story.
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:37:58.400]   It's based in Jersey City.
[02:37:58.400 --> 02:37:59.400]   The founders did this.
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:00.400]   I thought this is wonderful.
[02:38:00.400 --> 02:38:05.040]   I'm going to go because I want to do a video of this for the sake of the show.
[02:38:05.040 --> 02:38:06.280]   So I go and I try to find it.
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:07.280]   It's in the food court.
[02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:08.280]   It's not in the food court.
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:11.680]   So I asked the nice guy, one of the things not selling burgers himself, selling something
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:12.680]   else.
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:14.360]   I said, can you tell me where this Robo Burger thing is?
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:17.520]   He said, well, yeah, on the record, it's over there off the record.
[02:38:17.520 --> 02:38:18.520]   It sucks.
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:19.520]   Oh, baby.
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:24.240]   We're going to be 16 years and 15 minutes.
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:25.240]   Okay.
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:27.800]   And you go over there right over there to the BK, the dollar menu.
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:28.800]   It's better.
[02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:33.200]   But I said, no, for the sake of the show, I'm going to sacrifice my stomach.
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:34.200]   I'm going to go.
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:37.640]   So I go over and I find the machine now the third picture.
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:38.640]   Yes.
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:39.640]   It's closed.
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:45.040]   It looks like it's got Billy Eilish's head, though, which is interesting.
[02:38:45.040 --> 02:38:47.240]   I know it's only over 12 PM.
[02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:51.160]   Oh, and only works as 11 AM to 3 PM.
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:52.440]   Monday to Saturday.
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:54.600]   How would there's a guy in there?
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:59.320]   Obviously, there's a person inside the robot that's so obvious.
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:02.520]   But like ground meat is pretty persnickety.
[02:39:02.520 --> 02:39:06.600]   So maybe it's a food, ice, food, oh, you're so nice.
[02:39:06.600 --> 02:39:07.600]   I have a friend.
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:08.600]   It is too nice.
[02:39:08.600 --> 02:39:09.600]   Oh, I have a friend.
[02:39:09.600 --> 02:39:11.240]   It's your refrigerator.
[02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:16.920]   I know, but you know, once you start touching it to other things, unless the whole thing
[02:39:16.920 --> 02:39:20.440]   is refrigerated to a certain level, do you think somebody has to come out like a Macplory
[02:39:20.440 --> 02:39:24.520]   machine and adjust and tweak it and clean it every day?
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:26.240]   Otherwise, I tried guys.
[02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:30.800]   I tried to go report on the Robleburger for the show because I knew it would be very
[02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:31.800]   interesting.
[02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:33.520]   I want you to go back Monday through Saturday of 11 AM.
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:34.520]   Oh, I'm not 3 PM.
[02:39:34.520 --> 02:39:35.520]   I've done my thing.
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:36.520]   That's it.
[02:39:36.520 --> 02:39:40.440]   So what if one of my good friends actually covers food robots?
[02:39:40.440 --> 02:39:41.880]   He's familiar with this.
[02:39:41.880 --> 02:39:46.360]   So if you have questions, Jeff, I can give you his information and he will tell you.
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:50.160]   Oh, does he know about salad bot?
[02:39:50.160 --> 02:39:51.160]   He does.
[02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:52.160]   He knows about all the bots.
[02:39:52.160 --> 02:39:53.160]   All the bots.
[02:39:53.160 --> 02:39:56.680]   Pizza bots, all kinds of bots.
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:39:58.320]   I used to go in San Francisco.
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:01.200]   I loved when I lived there, I would go to Musco nice.
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:02.200]   Not Musco nice.
[02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:03.200]   I was before that.
[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:06.640]   It was a civic center and they'd have all these industrial shows and my favorite was
[02:40:06.640 --> 02:40:11.560]   the food industry show and I'd go find things like sausage extruders and all this great
[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:12.560]   stuff.
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:13.560]   I love food technology.
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:14.560]   It's wonderful.
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:19.560]   Well, let's take a look at the video of the Robleburger when it is at work.
[02:40:19.560 --> 02:40:27.880]   I just want to point out it's big enough to hold a human.
[02:40:27.880 --> 02:40:31.240]   I'm just going to say it.
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:32.840]   Robleburger is a red.
[02:40:32.840 --> 02:40:33.840]   See how big that is?
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:34.840]   Yeah.
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:35.840]   Look at it easily.
[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:36.840]   Look at it.
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:37.840]   It's going in.
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:38.840]   It's doing it.
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:39.840]   It's a monster.
[02:40:39.840 --> 02:40:40.840]   Refrigerator.
[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:46.120]   All in just a 12 square foot format.
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:48.720]   Now you can get a freshly grilled burger.
[02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:50.920]   You wasted a lot of money.
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:52.720]   They're six minutes.
[02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:54.920]   The guy said it was 15 minutes.
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:56.480]   It's a five step cooking process.
[02:40:56.480 --> 02:40:57.480]   795.
[02:40:57.480 --> 02:40:59.520]   What chefs use in a restaurant.
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:04.200]   Similar to what chefs use in a restaurant.
[02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:10.880]   The selected condiments assembles the burger and delivers it piping hot.
[02:41:10.880 --> 02:41:13.600]   That's what how does it taste?
[02:41:13.600 --> 02:41:15.120]   Well, you see.
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:16.120]   The bread looks good.
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:19.000]   It's like only the highest quality ingredients.
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:20.000]   Oh, please.
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:21.000]   Zen.
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:22.000]   There's a human in there.
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:23.000]   How did they choose this narration for?
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:24.000]   This is some words.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.440]   It's a-- because it's an April Fools joke.
[02:41:26.440 --> 02:41:27.440]   Those are like American wagons.
[02:41:27.440 --> 02:41:29.320]   It's an April Fools joke.
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:31.960]   I honestly think so.
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:37.640]   Now everyone can have a delicious, freshly cooked restaurant quality meal.
[02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:38.640]   That's not a restaurant.
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:40.520]   Where's the lettuce, tomato, onions?
[02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:42.400]   A little waiting rooms.
[02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:46.040]   Or at 1 a.m. in the airport.
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:47.040]   No, not at 1 a.m.
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:48.040]   This is an amazing food.
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:51.720]   It's better just more conveniently.
[02:41:51.720 --> 02:41:53.440]   The ATM.
[02:41:53.440 --> 02:41:55.560]   Money on the go.
[02:41:55.560 --> 02:42:00.040]   And now, Robo Burger brings us access to our--
[02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:01.040]   Oh, please.
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:02.040]   --to our boss.
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:03.040]   There's food.
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:04.040]   Anytime, anywhere.
[02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:07.040]   Oh, the taco truck with the taco speed.
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:08.040]   Well, come to the future.
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:09.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:10.040]   You're right.
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:11.480]   Whatever half of the taco truck on every corner.
[02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:13.520]   I'm mad we don't have that.
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:15.760]   Well, that's what we got now is Robo Burgers.
[02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:17.000]   Well, I tried, guys.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:18.000]   I tried.
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:19.000]   Wow.
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:20.000]   OK.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:21.440]   I'm surprised you with a nice video.
[02:42:21.440 --> 02:42:23.680]   I thought you had a little hilarity and then nothing.
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:26.480]   I was excited, but no.
[02:42:26.480 --> 02:42:27.480]   Nope.
[02:42:27.480 --> 02:42:28.480]   Nope.
[02:42:28.480 --> 02:42:29.480]   Nope.
[02:42:29.480 --> 02:42:31.120]   I want to show you real quickly.
[02:42:31.120 --> 02:42:32.640]   We were talking about Twitter earlier.
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:35.080]   And you know, I'm not a huge Twitter fan.
[02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:36.080]   You?
[02:42:36.080 --> 02:42:37.080]   No.
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:38.560]   But there is a new Twitter thing.
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:39.560]   It's going to be a buck a month.
[02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:42.840]   You can try it free for the first month.
[02:42:42.840 --> 02:42:44.840]   Bear tweets.
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:48.480]   B-A-R-E dot T-W.
[02:42:48.480 --> 02:42:52.240]   The idea is it doesn't have pictures.
[02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:58.560]   It doesn't have-- it's just any tweet with a lot of text.
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:01.800]   No media, no URLs, no social media engagement.
[02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:02.800]   The boring stuff.
[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:04.520]   It's just the boring stuff.
[02:43:04.520 --> 02:43:07.520]   Exactly.
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:10.120]   And actually, it is just the boring stuff.
[02:43:10.120 --> 02:43:14.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:16.040]   Point taken, sir.
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:17.040]   It is.
[02:43:17.040 --> 02:43:18.040]   All right.
[02:43:18.040 --> 02:43:19.040]   Let's read.
[02:43:19.040 --> 02:43:21.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:22.040]   Geez.
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:23.040]   OK, this sucks.
[02:43:23.040 --> 02:43:24.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:43:24.040 --> 02:43:27.040]   Is this the same guy as Robleburger?
[02:43:27.040 --> 02:43:28.040]   God.
[02:43:28.040 --> 02:43:30.040]   I really thought this was going to be a good thing.
[02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:33.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:43:33.040 --> 02:43:35.040]   It's so horrible.
[02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:37.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:39.040]   Well, I'm glad I had a good day.
[02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:40.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:41.040]   You're terrible.
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:42.040]   It's good to see you.
[02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:43.040]   Yes, you do.
[02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:44.040]   God.
[02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:45.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:49.040]   It's just a lot of Bernie Sanders tweets, basically.
[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:50.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:43:50.040 --> 02:43:51.040]   OK.
[02:43:51.040 --> 02:43:52.040]   What do you got, Ant?
[02:43:52.040 --> 02:43:53.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:56.040]   It's not going to be hard to follow that, Ant.
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:43:57.040]   Yeah.
[02:43:57.040 --> 02:43:58.040]   Go on, Ant.
[02:43:58.040 --> 02:43:59.040]   You'll do great.
[02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:01.040]   Twitter, just the bad parts.
[02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:03.040]   Oh, just the boring parts.
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:04.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:44:04.040 --> 02:44:05.040]   Holy cow.
[02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:07.040]   Oh, man, that is so bad.
[02:44:07.040 --> 02:44:08.040]   Oh.
[02:44:08.040 --> 02:44:09.040]   My pick.
[02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:11.040]   Try to do these quickly.
[02:44:11.040 --> 02:44:13.040]   The first one is a book.
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:18.040]   A guy I know who knows the author that wrote this book, Little Steve.
[02:44:18.040 --> 02:44:20.040]   And I quizzed him on it.
[02:44:20.040 --> 02:44:26.040]   I was like, look, it's cool that people are writing books about Steve Jobs and his journey
[02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:30.040]   and whatnot and trying to teach kids about the beginning of personal computing.
[02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:34.040]   But hey, it was mentioned in this.
[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:36.040]   And he was like, yeah, I totally get that.
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:40.040]   So there is another book coming out on the same aspect of this Little Steve.
[02:44:40.040 --> 02:44:43.040]   That's going to be dedicated to Steve Wozniak as well.
[02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:44.040]   So I thought it was--
[02:44:44.040 --> 02:44:47.040]   Little Steve didn't like to play ball.
[02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:50.040]   Instead, he invented big and small.
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:56.040]   Read along and you'll surely see how the Apple company came to be.
[02:44:56.040 --> 02:44:57.040]   Apple company.
[02:44:57.040 --> 02:44:59.040]   Apple company came to be.
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:02.040]   The story of the Mac iPad and iPhone.
[02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:06.040]   Reimagined for kids to bring into your home.
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:09.040]   Entrepreneurship is quite a big word.
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:13.040]   But with the Little Founders series, it will surely be heard.
[02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:15.040]   Such a great narrator.
[02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:18.040]   They should have given this to Elizabeth Holmes.
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:19.040]   Such a great narrator.
[02:45:19.040 --> 02:45:20.040]   Little Steve.
[02:45:20.040 --> 02:45:25.040]   But yeah, that's Little Steve and then a Wozniak version is coming soon.
[02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:29.040]   Well, it sounds like they're going to do a lot of entrepreneurs, like it's a series of Little Founders.
[02:45:29.040 --> 02:45:30.040]   Next.
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:31.040]   Or as Little Founders.
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:34.040]   Next up, we have Freedom Lutz.
[02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:39.040]   If you watch Hands-On Photography last week where I was talking about shooting in Log LOG,
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:42.040]   that is a flat profile when you're shooting video.
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:50.040]   And you need to apply a look up table, L-U-T, LUT, to help bring that image back to life based on the data that's provided.
[02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:55.040]   Well, Skylum, as we mentioned previously on the show, is on Ukraine.
[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:59.040]   And they make a great piece of software called Luminar for Photography.
[02:45:59.040 --> 02:46:09.040]   And they are selling LUTs to help support them over there during this time, as well as offer it up some support for some of the charities and things over there.
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:11.040]   And I think they started $30.
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:13.040]   So this is really cool.
[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:23.040]   So these are essentially filters you can apply to your photos based on cities in Ukraine, which is there's a Mariopolitessa, Kiv, Sumi.
[02:46:23.040 --> 02:46:24.040]   That's really neat.
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:25.040]   Pretty cool.
[02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:28.040]   And this photos or video you can apply it to.
[02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:34.040]   And today, PlataPod, I just saw this this morning because I use a PlataPod.
[02:46:34.040 --> 02:46:41.040]   They announced a new PlataPod and it's already a diagram success on Kickstarter's, the PlataPod, it's stream.
[02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:53.040]   I use one to help get shots in the landscape that's really, really low and keep the camera steady or, heck, I've hung it up on a tree, a time or three to get some photographs.
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:58.040]   But now they added some extra tools with it to make it a little bit more convenient and more portable.
[02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:03.040]   And, heck, they've already fulfilled their Kickstarter.
[02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:05.040]   So it's a tripod for the ground.
[02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:06.040]   Mm-hmm.
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:07.040]   Photo ground?
[02:47:07.040 --> 02:47:16.040]   Or if you want to do, like, I've put my camera in the refrigerator and set it on the tripod where it looks like I'm opening the refrigerator and you see me.
[02:47:16.040 --> 02:47:18.040]   You know, just creative uses for it.
[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:19.040]   Cool.
[02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:20.040]   PlataPod.
[02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:21.040]   PlataPod.
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:24.040]   And lastly, this comes from the show.
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:29.040]   I don't remember having this conversation, but apparently you and I did.
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:31.040]   [Laughs]
[02:47:31.040 --> 02:47:32.040]   You and I did.
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:33.040]   We did?
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:37.040]   I guess you were looking at some shoes and I said, "Do they have a size 14?"
[02:47:37.040 --> 02:47:41.040]   And apparently they did and they sent me a size 14.
[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:42.040]   What?
[02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:44.040]   Yeah, it was so nice.
[02:47:44.040 --> 02:47:45.040]   What?
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:47.040]   I was like, "I don't remember this conversation, but thanks."
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:48.040]   Adam's sneakers.
[02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:53.040]   So, Adam's thank you so much and I did a little photo of the shoes since they were kind enough.
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:54.040]   But yeah.
[02:47:54.040 --> 02:48:04.040]   Adam's atoms.com, so it's just like a little tiny, you know, mom-and-pop sneaker maker kind of.
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:05.040]   Do you like them?
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:06.040]   Yeah, they're pretty nice.
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:08.040]   I mean, they're actually really nice.
[02:48:08.040 --> 02:48:10.040]   They're really nice for me.
[02:48:10.040 --> 02:48:13.040]   I'll say that because I'm not that stylish.
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:14.040]   Wow, that is really a...
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:17.040]   I set up a little photo of the shoes.
[02:48:17.040 --> 02:48:18.040]   Oh, I like those.
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:19.040]   Oh, they're really...
[02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:20.040]   They're kind of...
[02:48:20.040 --> 02:48:21.040]   They're not like athletic shoes.
[02:48:21.040 --> 02:48:22.040]   They're like casual shoes.
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:24.040]   Casual lounge shoes.
[02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:25.040]   Yeah, they look good.
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:26.040]   They look really comfy.
[02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:28.040]   And they have them in your size.
[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:29.040]   Yeah, they have a size 14.
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:30.040]   Nice.
[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:31.040]   They feel good.
[02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:33.040]   And is this your shoot?
[02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:34.040]   Yep.
[02:48:34.040 --> 02:48:35.040]   That's what I...
[02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:36.040]   Oh, wow.
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:37.040]   They deserve...
[02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:38.040]   You should send them...
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:39.040]   That's nice.
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:40.040]   Yeah.
[02:48:40.040 --> 02:48:41.040]   Wow.
[02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:42.040]   How do you...
[02:48:42.040 --> 02:48:44.040]   That's called "Fishing Line."
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:45.040]   Seriously?
[02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:46.040]   That's really cool.
[02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:48.040]   I tied it to "Fishing Line" onto a C-stand
[02:48:48.040 --> 02:48:52.040]   and I stuck a light behind it and just played around with it.
[02:48:52.040 --> 02:48:55.040]   Have you ever done the hands-up photography and product shots?
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:56.040]   We will soon.
[02:48:56.040 --> 02:48:57.040]   I hope you do.
[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:00.040]   You've done gadget shots.
[02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:01.040]   I've done...
[02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:03.040]   I did food and...
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:05.040]   I swear you did get...
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:07.040]   I've watched your thing about shooting...
[02:49:07.040 --> 02:49:08.040]   Yes.
[02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:10.040]   That is so cool.
[02:49:10.040 --> 02:49:11.040]   Well, thank you.
[02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:12.040]   Yeah, thank you, Adam.
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:13.040]   It's appreciated.
[02:49:13.040 --> 02:49:14.040]   Wow.
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:15.040]   ATOMS.
[02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:22.040]   I told him, "Let me know if they want to do something because I know a model that are really...
[02:49:22.040 --> 02:49:26.040]   Also known as "Hard Hits" that would really help those shoes.
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:27.040]   Mm-hmm.
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:28.040]   He likes the model.
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:29.040]   He's all in the fashion.
[02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:33.040]   They need you to give them some product shots is what they need to do.
[02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:35.040]   That is really neat.
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:36.040]   Oh, good job.
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:37.040]   They're from Brooklyn.
[02:49:37.040 --> 02:49:42.040]   And when I dug into them a little more, they support creative artists.
[02:49:42.040 --> 02:49:47.040]   They've been trying to do a lot for helping out other creators across the industry.
[02:49:47.040 --> 02:49:49.040]   Neat, good stuff.
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:50.040]   Good pick.
[02:49:50.040 --> 02:49:53.040]   Did I show you the only the Good Tweets thing?
[02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:54.040]   Oh, yeah, I did.
[02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:55.040]   Okay.
[02:49:55.040 --> 02:49:57.040]   It's time to go.
[02:49:57.040 --> 02:49:58.040]   Boring Tweets.
[02:49:58.040 --> 02:50:01.040]   Only a dollar a month for just the boring Tweets.
[02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:04.040]   I think I'll just keep my Twitter blue and leave it as it is.
[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:07.040]   There's Twitter blue and Twitter boar.
[02:50:07.040 --> 02:50:08.040]   Twitter boar.
[02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:12.040]   It's bear, but it's pretty boring.
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:16.040]   They call it Zen-like, but I guess that means you're sleeping or something.
[02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:17.040]   I don't know.
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:19.040]   Stacey Egan-Bothamstacey on IOT.com.
[02:50:19.040 --> 02:50:23.040]   Don't forget the IOT podcast she does with Kevin Tofol every week.
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:24.040]   Subscribe to her newsletters.
[02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:27.040]   Check out the events.
[02:50:27.040 --> 02:50:29.040]   Anything else you want to plug?
[02:50:29.040 --> 02:50:30.040]   Stace?
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:32.040]   No, I think...
[02:50:32.040 --> 02:50:33.040]   Is that everything?
[02:50:33.040 --> 02:50:34.040]   Great.
[02:50:34.040 --> 02:50:35.040]   Yeah, sign up for the newsletter.
[02:50:35.040 --> 02:50:36.040]   Listen to the podcast.
[02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:37.040]   Club coming up.
[02:50:37.040 --> 02:50:38.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:50:38.040 --> 02:50:40.040]   Oh, it's April 7th.
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:41.040]   Oh, right, right, right.
[02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:42.040]   No, no, no, no.
[02:50:42.040 --> 02:50:43.040]   You mean tomorrow, April 7th?
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:46.040]   The vote is closing tomorrow, but this vote is closing.
[02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:47.040]   This is a landslide.
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:49.040]   Oh, we already know what we're going to be doing.
[02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:51.040]   I've already got to audio version.
[02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:52.040]   What is it?
[02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:56.040]   I forgot the name of it, but I know it's like 22 hours long.
[02:50:56.040 --> 02:50:57.040]   It'll be a surprise.
[02:50:57.040 --> 02:50:59.040]   It's termination shock by Neil Stevenson.
[02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:01.040]   Oh, I love Neil Stevenson.
[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:03.040]   But I haven't read that one.
[02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:05.040]   Yeah, I've already started it.
[02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:08.040]   Yeah, you're going to need the time.
[02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:09.040]   Yeah.
[02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:14.040]   So, but it's not too late if you want to stack it in favor of the shorter story.
[02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:16.040]   You can help hand out by going risk.
[02:51:16.040 --> 02:51:17.040]   It is not going to happen.
[02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:18.040]   It's for club trip members.
[02:51:18.040 --> 02:51:21.040]   I think termination stock was all of that.
[02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:23.040]   Well, why did you put it on the list?
[02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:25.040]   I think the mill is just having that.
[02:51:25.040 --> 02:51:27.040]   Well, because I wanted to give everybody was so excited about...
[02:51:27.040 --> 02:51:30.040]   You should have the best Neil Stevenson book, maybe the best book of all time.
[02:51:30.040 --> 02:51:32.040]   Crypto Nomicon on the list.
[02:51:32.040 --> 02:51:34.040]   Well, he's that otherwise.
[02:51:34.040 --> 02:51:35.040]   Jim or Bea, you could talk about it.
[02:51:35.040 --> 02:51:37.040]   Crypto Nomicon was a terrible book.
[02:51:37.040 --> 02:51:38.040]   No, what was it?
[02:51:38.040 --> 02:51:39.040]   I don't like Neil Stevenson.
[02:51:39.040 --> 02:51:40.040]   Seven Eaves.
[02:51:40.040 --> 02:51:41.040]   Seven Eaves.
[02:51:41.040 --> 02:51:42.040]   I loved Seven Eaves.
[02:51:42.040 --> 02:51:44.040]   I hate that book.
[02:51:44.040 --> 02:51:45.040]   Okay, never mind.
[02:51:45.040 --> 02:51:50.040]   Stacey's book club, Jeff Jarvis's fireside chat is a week from tomorrow.
[02:51:50.040 --> 02:51:51.040]   That's right.
[02:51:51.040 --> 02:51:53.040]   Nine AM Pacific noon Eastern.
[02:51:53.040 --> 02:51:58.040]   Now, how you might ask, how can I listen in and hear more of that?
[02:51:58.040 --> 02:52:01.040]   More of Stacey's book club, more of the untitled Linux show.
[02:52:01.040 --> 02:52:02.040]   More of the Gizfiz.
[02:52:02.040 --> 02:52:05.040]   Well, there's only one way you need to join Club Twitch, seven bucks a month.
[02:52:05.040 --> 02:52:08.040]   It gets you ad-free versions of every show.
[02:52:08.040 --> 02:52:10.040]   You don't even hear this ad.
[02:52:10.040 --> 02:52:12.040]   That's how ad-free it is.
[02:52:12.040 --> 02:52:14.040]   Plus access to the fabulous Discord.
[02:52:14.040 --> 02:52:16.040]   We have all these events.
[02:52:16.040 --> 02:52:19.040]   And it's a community manager there so you know it's a lot of fun.
[02:52:19.040 --> 02:52:26.040]   And the Twitch+ feed, where all sorts of stuff that doesn't make it, you know, stuff from the cutting room floor,
[02:52:26.040 --> 02:52:32.040]   shows as I just mentioned and shows we're working on push-ups, push-ups, all of that.
[02:52:32.040 --> 02:52:37.040]   All you have to do is go to Twitch.tv/clubtwit, $7 a month.
[02:52:37.040 --> 02:52:41.040]   And you know, in all seriousness, it really helps us out.
[02:52:41.040 --> 02:52:42.040]   Indeed.
[02:52:42.040 --> 02:52:49.040]   We now have enough members that is effectively another advertiser, which really helps in those slow times.
[02:52:49.040 --> 02:52:55.040]   And honestly, if we could get it to four or five advertisers, we'd probably just eliminate advertising entirely.
[02:52:55.040 --> 02:52:58.040]   So, you know, thank you for the support.
[02:52:58.040 --> 02:52:59.040]   Keep it up.
[02:52:59.040 --> 02:53:00.040]   We appreciate it.
[02:53:00.040 --> 02:53:01.040]   And tell others.
[02:53:01.040 --> 02:53:03.040]   Tell everybody, yeah, Twitch.tv/clubtwit.
[02:53:03.040 --> 02:53:06.040]   You know, one way you could support us, we have a number of corporate members.
[02:53:06.040 --> 02:53:07.040]   Do you know how many corporate members we have now?
[02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:08.040]   It's three or four, I think.
[02:53:08.040 --> 02:53:09.040]   Oh.
[02:53:09.040 --> 02:53:14.040]   It's like four different ones, but there's a couple hundred seats all together.
[02:53:14.040 --> 02:53:15.040]   Yeah.
[02:53:15.040 --> 02:53:22.040]   So if you are in a company that you think would benefit, one of them, they just want everybody to hear security now.
[02:53:22.040 --> 02:53:25.040]   They just want to hear, you know, every week they want to hear security now.
[02:53:25.040 --> 02:53:28.040]   All you have to do is go to Twitch.tv/clubtwit.
[02:53:28.040 --> 02:53:32.040]   You'll see there's information about corporate members as well as individuals.
[02:53:32.040 --> 02:53:35.040]   And thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:37.040]   Thank you in advance.
[02:53:37.040 --> 02:53:42.040]   Jeff Jarvis is a, well, of course, I have it here right down, written down.
[02:53:42.040 --> 02:53:43.040]   It's not, it's not.
[02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:51.040]   The director of the, you know, the townite center for, you know, the entrepreneurial journalism, you know, at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
[02:53:51.040 --> 02:54:07.040]   At the City University of New York, you know, I'll suddenly wake up and sit up a bolt upright and say, "Newmark, Newmark, Craig, Newmark, please join us for his special, ask me anything a week from tomorrow.
[02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:08.040]   That'll be a lot of fun.
[02:54:08.040 --> 02:54:09.040]   And prove it.
[02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:11.040]   Hosts hands-on photography.
[02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:13.040]   That is at Twitch.tv/hop.
[02:54:13.040 --> 02:54:19.040]   That's really is fantastic photographer and person and human and our community manager in the club as well.
[02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:20.040]   Thank you, sir.
[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:23.040]   And produces a number of shows for us as well.
[02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:24.040]   It's just great.
[02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:26.040]   And of course, a regular right here on Twig.
[02:54:26.040 --> 02:54:28.040]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:35.040]   We did Twig every Wednesday, 130 Pacific, I'm sorry, two Pacific, five Eastern time, 2100 UTC.
[02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:41.040]   If you want to watch us do it live, you can at live.twit.tv chat live at irc.twit.tv.
[02:54:41.040 --> 02:54:43.040]   That's our community IRC that's open to all.
[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:49.040]   We also have a Discord open to anybody who plays seven bucks a month.
[02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:50.040]   Yeah.
[02:54:50.040 --> 02:54:51.040]   It's like to some.
[02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:55.040]   To some, not to all, but you can chat in there as well.
[02:54:55.040 --> 02:54:57.040]   We'd love to see you there.
[02:54:57.040 --> 02:55:06.040]   After the fact, on demand versions of this show at Twig.tv/Twig, all of our shows are on the website, as well as on YouTube every show as a YouTube channel.
[02:55:06.040 --> 02:55:10.040]   And of course, you could subscribe because we're a podcast.
[02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:14.040]   RSS, baby, you could subscribe in your favorite podcast player.
[02:55:14.040 --> 02:55:19.040]   And if your podcast player supports reviews, leave us a five star review. That would be great.
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:24.040]   Thanks for joining us everyone. We'll see you next time another Twig is in the can.
[02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:25.040]   Bye bye.
[02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:29.040]   Hey, I'm Rod Pyle, editor of Ad Astra Magazine.
[02:55:29.040 --> 02:55:34.040]   And each week I'm joined by Tariq Malick, the editor in chief over at space.com.
[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:41.040]   In our new This Week in Space podcast, every Friday, Tariq and I take a deep dive into the stories that define the new space age.
[02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:42.040]   What's NASA up to?
[02:55:42.040 --> 02:55:45.040]   When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?
[02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:47.040]   And how about those samples from the Perseverance rover?
[02:55:47.040 --> 02:55:51.040]   When are those coming on? What the heck has Elon Musk done now?
[02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:58.040]   In addition to all the latest and greatest in space exploration, we'll take an occasional look at bits of space flight history that you probably never heard of.
[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:01.040]   And all with an eye towards having a good time along the way.
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:03.040]   Check us out on your favorite pod catcher.
[02:56:03.040 --> 02:56:13.040]   [MUSIC]
