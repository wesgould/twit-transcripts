[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.280]   He's gonna be on the phone I think Stacy Higginbotham from Austin
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.560]   We're there about to celebrate a special fourth of July and Aaron Newcomb with another great project
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.640]   We'll talk about the latest news from Google and a whole lot more stay tuned twig is next
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:25.880]   Netcast you love from people you trust
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:38.920]   This is twig bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cash fly C A C A G F L Y
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920]   .com
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:51.840]   This is twig this week in Google episode 359 recorded Wednesday June 29th 2016
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.840]   This week in Google is brought to you by Atlassian unleash your team's potential with collaborative software tools like hip chat and Jura
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.840]   That'll let you work and communicate better together visit Atlassian.com to learn more
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.840]   It's time for twig this week in Google the show we cover the latest from the Google verse
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.840]   The cloud, Facebook, Twitter and anything else
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.840]   We darn well want to talk about Jeff Jarvis is in Mexico City and we've got him
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.840]   He's time traveling via cell phone hello Jeff
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.840]   What you're hearing right now is my screen
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.840]   Why what's the matter?
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.840]   So the hotel Wi-Fi was the unbelief badge you know I have been the pioneer of bad Wi-Fi
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.840]   Yeah you're the king
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.840]   Wi-Fi I've ever seen I am the king of bad Wi-Fi so then at the end you are speaking tomorrow so I'll use that
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   This is a home to try so then I tried Starbucks no so then I tried Wi-Fi that didn't work
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.840]   So then I bought my five which in two languages is majorly challenging and I worked okay in the store
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.840]   I get back to the hotel it wouldn't even hit it one all it wouldn't hit a quarter of one out
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.840]   Yeah so then I just went through four hours returning it
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   Oh I'm sorry
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.840]   I still don't have my money back but this real report this is what I do for twig
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.840]   I appreciate it I thank you very much so you're joining us via your Google Fi cell phone right now
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.840]   and when you get back to the hotel in a few minutes we'll get you on the hotel landline
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.840]   Yeah so I delighted to be here even if I have a primal screen going on
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.840]   You know my daughter is in Mexico for this semester as well she'll be there through the end of the year
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.840]   She's in Puebla which is a smaller city than Mexico City but similar issues it's very crazy
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.840]   It's because it was a monopoly system
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.840]   Right when you change from a government run monopoly to a kind of half and half or a color of slim
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.840]   It really is a mess same thing in Australia that's Stacey Higginbotham who knows all
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.840]   Tels all from the IOT podcast and parts south she's in Austin
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.840]   Hey Stacey
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.840]   Hello
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.840]   Nice to have you
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.840]   Yeah I think the same thing happened in Australia
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.840]   Well they have it
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.840]   They have now it's
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.840]   It was government run and now it's like half and half
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840]   It's a tellstress kind of half
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.840]   Yeah when I was in Australia I also bought a My Fly there so I could come to show
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.840]   Yeah stop buying My Fies
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.840]   Stop buying My Fies
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840]   Yeah really
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.840]   Don't you have a
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840]   I'm trying to go
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.840]   The only issue is they have one they used to have one cable coming in for data for the
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.840]   Right
[00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.840]   Is it eastern seaboard western seaboard I can't I guess it's western
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.840]   Eastern seaboard is the big population area where Sydney and everything
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   Oh okay eastern side
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   And so Telstra had access and controlled that basically so
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.840]   Broadband was crazy you thought our caps were bad
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   Australia's were way worse
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.840]   They have gotten better I think
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.840]   Also joining us Aaron Nukem great to see you Aaron
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.840]   Hey Leo glad to be here as always
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.840]   We don't usually get to see your your lab I like it
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.840]   I know well yeah actually all you can see is my wife's half
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.840]   That's her desk her messy desk all her books she was a philosophy major so there's tons of books back there
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.840]   On my side there's like you know stuff all around here's a raspberry pie
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.840]   Arrow here's actually here
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.840]   Interestingly enough if I can get to it as an original the original raspberry pie and all kinds of other stuff and
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.840]   Just as a in as way of a teaser
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.840]   I brought a project as always so if you want to know what this is and what it does you got to stick around till
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.840]   The end of the show America keypad attached to something
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.840]   Hey did you get your $9 computer yet?
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.640]   Yes, you know what I left them down at the maker space last night. I got two of them. I got the
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.240]   The HDMI add-on that you can just pop on that was kind of an adventure getting that working
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.240]   But so far I'm very very impressed maybe next time I'm on I'll do a little a lot that'll make that my project
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.960]   because
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.760]   It's at least I was telling people last night at our meetup
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.760]   It's similar to in performance the rasbury the first generation raspberry pi one which is actually saying a lot
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.640]   It performs really well got the gooey running. I got a browser running with ice weasel
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.960]   It worked really really well. So I would encourage people and it has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for nine bucks
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.520]   It is it is the chip computer. This was so exciting. It is okay
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.000]   Yeah, we had them on the new screensavers when they were doing the kickstarter
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.120]   They raised two million dollars and they've just started shipping
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.200]   Yeah, I think that's I think that's one of the most innovative things coming out. Well, you know
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.080]   Why nine dollars versus thirty five dollars for the raspberry pie that doesn't seem like a big difference
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.240]   It is if you're a school district or if you're poor buying a hundred of them, I guess
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.400]   Yeah, I mean even and the idea so when I talk to the next thing guys and Aaron if you know this I will shut up
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.760]   But when I talk to the guys who are making it they were like look, you know for nine bucks
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.680]   That's something a kid might have in their allowance and if they're interested in this they can just go out and get it and it's good point
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.600]   Less for them. So this isn't this isn't for necessarily us. It's for people like
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:25.140]   $35 that's a lot. I ordered it. I pledged 74 bucks for the pocket chip plus HDMI adapter
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.940]   And then I got a regular chip
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:33.880]   So I don't it's I haven't gotten mine yet. So I'll have to look at
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:40.080]   See, maybe maybe they need my address or something. Oh, yeah, that's actually that was my mistake
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.800]   As well, I didn't see the email that they said so you know make sure you get this website and verify your address once I did that
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.720]   I got it like in a week. So I must have hit it at just the right time. I don't know why
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.680]   That happens a lot with Kickstarter. Well, like they have everything
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:07:02.260]   Yeah, they had to I signed up a key. I mean they I guess Kickstarter doesn't give them the information Kickstarter knows or something
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:08.680]   It's kind of strange since I gave money
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.680]   I
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.280]   Have to search through my email because a lot I think everybody's gotten their chip
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:21.960]   And I haven't so but it but it's a cool idea. So you're right. I mean that's that's a third as much
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:29.280]   Less of a third almost a great thing about it is it's it's completely open source open hardware. You can go download all the stuff
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.160]   What's the processor?
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.720]   It's a it's an all-winner a eight
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.480]   Okay
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:43.280]   Is that an arm arm processor arm processor and it runs, you know full stack Debian?
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.080]   So wow like the Raspberry Pi it is so if you're familiar with Debian or familiar already familiar with the Raspberry Pi
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.200]   Most things will work. You'll need different libraries to control
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.680]   GPIO and those kind of things because they're dependent on the chipset
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.920]   But otherwise if you know Debian if you know how to use Linux on the Raspberry Pi
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:06.400]   You should be able to do things like update software and use the GUI and use the terminal
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.600]   Emulator and all that kind of good stuff cool. So it has a has a full ex GUI and everything. That's really cool
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:18.640]   Got that's amazing for nine dollars. It is it is it's also good for project makers because if you want to make a
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.840]   you know, I was at the Harry Potter ride and
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.240]   You know universal studios last week and
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.660]   You know they have on the wall they have the Harry Potter style talking paintings
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.120]   You know paintings and Harry Potter don't just sit there the people move around they wink at you
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.000]   And I always had this dream in fact
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.400]   Maybe we'll do this in the new studio of having all our hosts on the wall in what looks like still pictures
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.920]   But every once in a while they go
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.480]   Yeah
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:49.640]   Or wander off and come back and of course the way to do that it wouldn't be that hard to do with a screen
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:55.000]   And it's an a simple computer in the background this this would be all you need really
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.160]   Yeah, yeah, it's a much more affordable if you if you could get an old style
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.120]   Monitor or something that had a composite input
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.120]   I mean this comes with a composite
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:11.120]   Breakout on it. So it's got one of the combined audio and compot and video composite jacks on it
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.200]   So it comes with the plug you plug it in and you get your video left and right channels
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:21.640]   So if you can find an old monitor mount that in a picture frame on the wall really all you would need is this nine dollar computer
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:26.640]   They did a really interesting thing in the one and I'm sure that's exactly how they do it at the Harry Potter ride
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.760]   But they've kind of crack alerts that on top of it
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.880]   so it looks like
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.600]   It was at it's an old aging
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.240]   Oil painting and they must have just you know painted of
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.120]   Varnish on top of the screen so doesn't look like a screen
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.920]   It looks like you're looking at an oil painting and it's even more dramatic as a result when the thing suddenly moves
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.840]   It's like whoa
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:53.000]   Whoa, I could have sworn that was an oil painting. Maybe you could help me with that error and we could be a fun project
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.360]   We could do that. I know how are the wood servers. Yeah, you bet
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.160]   Jeff you still there I
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.080]   Just got to the hotel room. Sorry, I mean if you want to call me
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.520]   We'll check the
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.160]   We'll hang up on the cell phone as we walked
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:13.840]   Okay, okay, it was fun. We got a little walking tour of Mexico City. How's the air?
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.080]   Is it really hot though?
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.920]   No, no, decent good good good good. All right
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:31.080]   I got a little distracted, but we can move on there's been a lot of speculation when they talked about it yesterday and all about
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.360]   Android about
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.520]   What's gonna happen to the Nexus phones?
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:41.600]   There's you know, it's all rumor at this point but the the impression some people are getting and this comes from an article in the
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.920]   Telegraph of the UK is that Google is gonna stop doing
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.700]   What these Nexus phones are which is essentially dev developer editions and start doing?
[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:54.320]   premium
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.640]   Smart phones to compete with Apple and Samsung
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.360]   Credible, what do you think Stacy?
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.280]   um, I
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.000]   Have been I actually have an excess phone. I
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.640]   Would love for Google to actually do this and now that they have Rick over there. Rick. Uh,
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:16.160]   Motorola Motorola. Yeah, I mean I see no reason why not in I
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:23.200]   Mean, yeah, I would say what the heck I don't think they would actually they would have to contract manufacture it out
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.280]   But that's what they do right right now right Aaron is these they're not making the 6p or the 5x
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.600]   Yeah, they
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.920]   Go ahead. I was gonna say while wait while way makes a 6p. I'll answer my own question
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:43.880]   And you guys fight it out while we make a 6p and LG makes the 5x and in the past
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.160]   They've used HTC HTC made the first Google Android phone
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:56.000]   The one with the slide out keyboard the G1 I think it was called and they've used all the manufacturers, you know under the Sun
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.180]   So is the telegraph story that they're gonna build it themselves? Why would they even bother? Who cares?
[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:07.360]   Even Apple really doesn't build the iPhone Fox Condos
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:14.080]   Yeah, and they may do this they may take the same approach where the components get you know shipped in from various places
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.160]   And they put it together somewhere. I think it's really is to
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.900]   solidify a phone that actually works instead of having because I
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:28.280]   Probably going back and forth between Huawei and LG and can you please include this feature?
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.320]   We want to do X Y and Z and they're like, I we don't want to do that it's too expensive or whatever
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.460]   So they're always these negotiations back and forth from the manufacturers and I think they just want
[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:44.480]   Jump that whole process and say look we're just gonna do it ourselves and put out a phone that we know has all the features
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.480]   We want it works the way we want it to work
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.680]   and
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.320]   They probably aren't looking to compete more with Apple not only that but
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.680]   You know, then they actually start making some revenue as well
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.940]   As opposed to the majority of it going back to the manufacturers
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:04.520]   There's the whole I was just gonna add to that with Samsung being the
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.480]   biggest seller of Android phones
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:13.680]   Samsung's actually been disabling and tweaking Android to a certain point that's kind of really frustrating for users
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.720]   So I can see Google being like, all right
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.960]   Gotta take this bull by the horns and own it. I've been using
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:27.520]   For about five or six days. I got it on Friday. I think the new one plus
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.400]   three
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.320]   Which is an interesting I think a really interesting phone. It is in every respect
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:42.080]   Equal to the iPhone of the Samsung Galaxy S7. I think very at least very close my respect. It's four hundred dollars
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   And it's pretty pure Google experience. They're using their own oxygen
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:53.960]   OS but that is as pure as you can get. I mean it is it's similar to the Moto X that kind of
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:14:00.760]   You know a few extensions a few differences, but it feels like marshmallow the big question though
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:07.240]   And I think for four hundred dollars. This is there's no it's a no-brainer. This is don't buy the Galaxy S7
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:10.480]   By this but the big question
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:17.360]   In my mind is updates and I mean a lot of people are asking is updates and one of the things that you could guarantee with an
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:23.720]   Exis phone and I presume with us with a high-end Google phone is that you're gonna be using the latest OS and all and always get the latest
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.640]   Security patches that fact that's one of the reasons probably Google would like to do this
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:35.360]   Yeah, I having owned high-end Android phones my entire smartphone career for the most part
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.800]   I'm on Verizon and Verizon is always so late on
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.040]   Actually, that's why I switched to a Nexus is
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:50.720]   So it makes sense this this only I only went off Nexus one time
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.600]   I had I've been since the G1 I've been using only
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.840]   But they weren't called Nexus back then but Nexus phones
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:02.280]   I got a Samsung Galaxy S4 at some point and the updates were so slow
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:09.600]   I use the stock, you know OS for a couple of weeks and before I rooted it because it was just awful having to wait for
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:15.420]   For in this case AT&T to put that put out an update course the one one thing about this one plus three is it's
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:21.360]   It's easy to unlock. I think it may even be an unlocked bootloader and it's so it's if you could put any
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.800]   ROM on it you wanted to so
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:29.420]   You know in some ways you have more you have more flexibility certainly a lot more than Samsung
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.680]   gives you
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.480]   Did you see the the news their discounts on was it?
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:42.560]   Nexus phones Amazon's doing discounts on certain Android phones. Yeah, the Amazon front page is interesting. Let's go
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.000]   Yeah, I'm just thinking about what this means for like the hardware model versus
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.120]   I don't know everything else and who owns the phone and doesn't matter anymore
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.280]   So this is the blue which is a kind of little known in the US but a well-known
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.320]   internationally they make Windows phones as well the blue R1
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.280]   for
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.600]   Well, what's interesting is
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:13.720]   What they're doing for prime members is they're giving you a version with offers and ads built in kind of like the Kindle
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:19.760]   And and that one's less expensive and if you get the version without ads worth with ads
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:24.600]   It's I think 50 bucks without ads. It's a hundred bucks 50 bucks
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.320]   And then they're also selling a Moto G. I don't know if the Moto G
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.320]   By the way, you have to be an Amazon Prime
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:38.640]   Customer to get this so this is one way, you know what? I'm not logged in so it doesn't know I'm prime
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.440]   But this is one way
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.960]   Amazon is is spiffing prime
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.000]   Users and getting them 150 bucks for the Moto G. That's not such an incredible price
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.680]   Neither of these phones is a high-end phone however
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:58.800]   No, I just think I thought it was interesting that Amazon was putting their ads on somebody else's device
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.240]   Isn't that weird they must have a do you think they must have a deal or they have to have a deal?
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:07.640]   So that's what I'm thinking about like okay, so what does it mean to own a mobile phone ecosystem?
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:13.760]   Like going forward if someone else can put ads on it think about how it interplays with like the smart home
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.760]   I'm just I'm just kind of thinking about
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:22.200]   Kind of everything especially as more and more things get unlocked. Sorry my brain is just kind of going all over the place today
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.800]   It is interesting
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.920]   29 without the offers and ads for the 32 gig version
[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:37.640]   179 you say 50 bucks and if you if you can survive with 16 gigs which I don't recommend for most people as low as
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.160]   150 bucks that's for the Moto G which is a quite a good phone
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:45.880]   Not I would say if you can afford to spend a little more get a bit a little bit better phone than this
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.040]   But if you can't maybe for a kid or somebody doesn't have a lot of money 50 bucks
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.960]   For the 8 gigabyte blue Wow
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.720]   Can't imagine it runs very well. It's got a media tech 1.3 gigahertz quad core processor
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.640]   But it is I think tell it's more interesting as a story about Amazon and what Amazon's up to then it is about the deal itself
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.480]   Right, sorry. Yes. That is true. Go ahead. That Jeff
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.320]   - what do you think they're bigger strategy is I?
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:21.040]   Don't know Stacy you got an idea. What does this okay? Let me think ads on devices selling other hardware. I'm just thinking about
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:27.960]   Yeah, I have no idea well, okay. I'll wait into the waters here
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.120]   After all for years we bought subsidized phones from carriers
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.600]   Right and so we thought our phones were only 200 bucks and then we found out
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:45.920]   When carriers stopped the subsidies what the phone actually cost and I think that that has put some downward pressure on phone prices on everybody
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:53.200]   But Apple and it's it's changed how people think of the phone. So this is in a way Amazon's subsidy, right?
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.680]   Obviously they have to negotiate this with Motorola and blue
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.400]   But that the subsidy is we'll take 50 we'll take 50 bucks off
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.240]   If you don't mind lock screens and they have done this with as I said with the Kindle and the Kindle Fire tablets
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:11.240]   I have both kindles and Kindle Fire tablets with offers never bothers me on the Kindle because mostly on the Kindle
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.080]   You don't ever see the lock screen except the first time you turn it on
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:22.840]   I'm the ads at the bottom and not while I'm reading a book though only when I'm browsing the library. That's true now
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:28.000]   I get I have the Kindle app on my phone and I get Kindle notify Kindle add
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.840]   Notifications or Amazon add notifications. See I think that's annoying. I think it's super annoying. Yeah, but you can't turn that off
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.480]   I mean you're not yes
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.640]   Yes, I have turned it off. Yeah
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:43.480]   Well, this is this this is this gives you the permission to send notifications
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.400]   So it could be a similar it's just doing that no because it's the lock screen although wait a minute though
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.160]   Let me think about this if I'm listening to a Spotify song on my Android device
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:00.520]   The lock screen is the album art so it may be a maybe they don't need the manufacturer to do this
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.520]   Maybe this is just a mechanism where they
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:09.060]   They as an app they just put an app on here and it takes over the lock screen because it's always playing in the background
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.060]   I don't know
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:18.320]   Who's gonna buy a $50 phone and see not me I would buy a $50 phone because I bet there's a way to
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:25.760]   Load your own OS onto this pretty easily and bypass all of that right right because the hardware should be independent unless
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:31.960]   They've built something into the firmware that says you know do a check and if it's not working turn off the radio or something like that
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:37.360]   Is this impossible but it's hard to do it's it's really interesting because it's I
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:43.200]   Almost feel like this is Amazon throwing something against the wall and seeing if it sticks because it doesn't make sense
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:49.440]   If if you're a prime member you're paying a hundred dollars extra a year for the privilege of second-day delivery
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:54.240]   You're I think by definition an affluent customer
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:59.400]   So why you would be interested in a $50 phone as a prime benefit?
[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.760]   Seems puzzling to me
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.680]   If you have kids, I mean I would look at something like this for my nine-year-old
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.360]   Yeah, they don't care about the ads
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.640]   Wouldn't even be legal to show them ads actually
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:17.480]   You might have to certify that you're over 13 years
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:26.520]   Wouldn't that be weird so getting back to the original premise
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:34.160]   If Google were to make were to compete with Samsung and Apple with us a Google branded
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.800]   Couldn't be Nexus. I guess it'd be a Google branded made by Google phone
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:44.600]   You know here's the real problem. We're it. We've been a peak phone for a year
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:51.520]   There's nothing new that you could put that's why one plus can sell a four hundred dollar state of the art phone
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:56.560]   There's nothing you know, it's got a fast fingerprint reader. It's got a good camera. What else?
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:03.200]   Well, so this is this gets into like the phone is going is the phone because I'm having this discussion with people
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.200]   I talked to in the Internet of Things space
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:12.120]   Half the world believes that the phone is the key to like owning the phone is the key to controlling the next
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.800]   ecosystem in tech, which is
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.480]   everything in
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.160]   machine learning, right?
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:23.160]   the other half are like yeah, you can control other platforms and still access it so
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.720]   You look at us being a peak phone. Does it?
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.200]   Does it matter that you control the hardware?
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.560]   Does it matter if you can control the OS or
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.160]   What?
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:39.160]   Rather that you sell them and you get their email address. I don't know like what what everybody's got to figure out is what's going to get people
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.720]   To buy a new phone besides they broke the old one
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.520]   Yeah
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.520]   People will buy a new phone eventually
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:52.520]   The Samsung game that is without special things with it though at VidCon
[00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:57.600]   I actually bought the Samsung 360 camera. There's the Samsung gear
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:03.240]   I've made fun of that strategy in the past. Well, I don't know maybe maybe it's right where to go is that it's not the phone
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.580]   It's what you can get with the phone because it's more iterated. Well, certainly Apple strategy apples
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:13.960]   WWDC they basically said everything works better as long as you have an iPhone and Apple watch
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:19.920]   Then then everything's tightly integrated and by the way, I should point out that the one thing you wouldn't want to do with this
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.560]   1.3 is VR because it's a 1080 screen
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:31.000]   So you will have to buy a 1440 screen from Samsung or one of the high-ends if you want to do the gear VR
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.080]   So that's I think you're right Jeff. I think that's one way to make sure people don't buy these lower-cost phones
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:43.900]   The Samsung sorry, sorry go ahead go. No you Jeff go ahead. You go Jeff
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.640]   I can't see you guys
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:52.760]   The integration of the Samsung 360 camera
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:24:02.440]   This phone is pretty damn awesome. It's stitching on the phone as you're shooting you can see what you're shooting in live 360
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:10.240]   You know could you do that on the other phone with the software? Well, maybe you could but it but it but and is that a huge market?
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.200]   No, but the integration is really impressive
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:16.400]   Get ready because there's a guy in
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:25.840]   Florida who's suing Apple for ten billion dollars. He says oh no, I invented the iPhone in 1992. He's got a drawing
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.160]   He's got a patent
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:32.400]   And he says Apple stole my idea
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:40.800]   From 1992 he was according to the lawsuit the first to file a device so designed and aggregated is to have a creative a novel
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:47.200]   combination of media communication tools as identity was then since then hijacked by Apple's iPhones iPads and others
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.920]   Wasn't there a palm pilot round about that time or other product? I guess the pilot was much later
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:59.880]   And Newton I mean anybody could draw a picture he never made a phone. Yeah
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:06.400]   Did he get a patent I guess he did he wants a Eastern District
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:12.840]   Well, he's in Florida right now, but he absolutely should move that lawsuit over to the Eastern Eastern District of Texas
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.800]   I hear Tyler Texas is great this time of year
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:23.140]   At EFS I didn't know this there is a marked Cuban chair of getting rid of stupid patents
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.080]   Yeah, Mark's been very aggressive
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:33.160]   Yeah, by the way the telegraph has actually has a great little bit at the bottom here
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.080]   Where they show Apple's revenue since you start reading this article
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:43.280]   And it's almost a million dollars
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.280]   Wow
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.320]   That's a counter
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.760]   So I guess they could afford 10 billion
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.680]   dollars
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:01.840]   Isn't that funny since you started reading this article and I've been on it what for a minute or two apples made almost a million dollars
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.840]   So it'll cross a million in a few seconds
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:12.680]   Ross's patent was never approved because he didn't pay the fees and the application was declared abandoned in 95
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:18.640]   But he still claims Apple resorted to dumpster diving. Oh, come on. This will be thrown out so fast
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:22.880]   I just want to see your head spin. It'll spin fast in those numbers on the screen
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:30.080]   Yeah typical
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.600]   Yeah, yeah
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.720]   nuts
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.440]   It's like the woman. All right. What do you think who sued Microsoft for ten thousand dollars?
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:46.120]   She's a travel agent just down the road here in Sausalito who says it Microsoft forced Windows 10 on her computer and
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:52.520]   Then when she tried to revert to Windows 8 it wouldn't work for days. She lost a lot of business. She sued Microsoft one
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:58.640]   Microsoft decided not to appeal they were gonna appeal initially decided not to appeal in Peter ten thousand dollars
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.240]   For the forced upgrade to Windows 10
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.520]   Unbelievable
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.360]   Let's see what are you there for Jeff? Where are you in Mexico City?
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:20.640]   So I'm here for the tag CDM X conference, which is an effort to kind of think we brand Mexico City and bringing some cool people who are around me and
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.760]   So I'm speaking about you know the end of the mass tomorrow
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:32.440]   Last week I was in VidCon, which was really you were so close. So no, it's so funny
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.520]   I'm eating at a restaurant and there's all these people from VidCon and I'm thinking wait a minute
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.520]   I'm I'm like a block away
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:46.060]   But I didn't go right I didn't go I was on vacation. So how was VidCon?
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.040]   VidCon was great. I
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.400]   Just I'm just to make 25,000 people now
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.120]   Unfortunately sadly because of the two tragedies in Orlando the security was much higher. Yeah
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:03.400]   But still this year. I got to take my daughter because last year I was in deep trouble for not taking my daughter
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:06.260]   Cuz she wanted to meet who who did she who did she want to meet?
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:15.000]   I forget what I'm a good dad because she got to meet John Green. I don't I never heard of one never heard of him
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.240]   You know he's co-founder with Hank Green of VidCon, you know, you know, you know why
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:26.360]   I got in trouble with Michael our 13 year old because apparently McJugger nuggets was there
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.360]   He said McJugger nuggets was just down the street and you didn't tell me
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:40.180]   Who's my oh, you don't have a third time you don't know McJugger nuggets. I have no idea
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.000]   Consider yourself lucky and I know is it a boy thing?
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.440]   It's yeah, it's boy thing cuz it started off with a video that I think a lot of people thought was real of
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:59.080]   a brother making a clandestine video of his brother playing video games and their dad going ballistic and
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:07.160]   Taking the brothers Xbox and all the games putting it out in the backyard and mowing it with his lawnmower tractor and
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:11.840]   and the temper tantrum that McJugger nuggets through
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:18.960]   And then it turned out my my kid thought it was real for the longest time. I'm sure you deal with that as well
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.920]   And then it turned out
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:28.160]   I remember this yeah, yeah sure you remember McJugger by the way the last episode just a few weeks ago
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.160]   He killed his father
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:35.500]   It's called psycho dad here you go. Here's this here's the psycho dad
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.480]   This is this is the brother. I
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:44.320]   Don't know if this is the first one or the last one, but it at the other there you go
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:50.320]   You got it you can turn up the audio so so that there's a lot of shouting and swearing
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:56.840]   And he throws his Xbox in the fire for Christmas Merry Christmas dad
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.840]   You
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:05.600]   Got my stream open
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:13.080]   Anyway, you don't we don't need to watch any anymore McJugger nuggets
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:19.840]   But apparently he's huge. I mean that video that video you just saw has 19 million views
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.960]   He's huge 32 million for the one that I was talking about where dad
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.480]   shreds the Xbox games with a
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.440]   Riding mower and the fun of it of course is
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:41.280]   Is the kids a reaction? He's a good actor because I wasn't sure this was fake either at the time
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.000]   Yeah
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.160]   But now of course we know this is a
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:50.960]   So he was at VidCon too. So it's that it's that stuff Jeff. Oh here. Here we go
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.160]   It's that more it's that more. I mean, you know, there were five which was all lazy panels
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:31:02.660]   We owe about mental health for example where you had the YouTube stars talking about how my latest post on medium is about that
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.080]   Had I'm talking about
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.080]   their depression their
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:13.960]   Disorders their suicide, you know, whatever and in the room are people who feel the same thing and it's just a room filled with
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:20.200]   Empathy to a empathy that you just don't see in big old media that you can you can beat these people and talk to these people
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.360]   And and it's something different now
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.320]   It's a big business
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.160]   which is key from YouTube the CEO gave a C note and
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:36.200]   They're giving you know, there's no they're putting big money in people's pockets. Good GC mo from Facebook was there
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:43.960]   Facebook announced that they were gonna add a live formal box people's home pages soon, which will be a big deal
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.840]   YouTube announced that they're gonna add a live
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:54.320]   But in sharing button to all YouTube players soon live is gonna be bigger than ever. So it was
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:32:00.320]   I was there any any I guess not at VidCon because it's really a fan
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.720]   What am I hearing
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.800]   What where am I hearing that from?
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.880]   Carson it's not I'm hearing this the audio stream back
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:12.720]   There you go
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:17.640]   Was there is there anybody at VidCon who stands up and says you guys are
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.720]   Crazy
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:24.640]   This is YouTube ripping you off. You're working in YouTube's minds and
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.640]   Well, is there any dissent at all?
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:35.600]   Little yes, I went to a session on on but it's a reasonable dissent
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:41.680]   I went to a session on fair use or as professor Larry Lusick says fair use is the right to hire a lawyer and
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:45.840]   So we were sharing
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:51.160]   Techniques about how to avoid problems. They were lamenting when they've gotten strikes and they've had huge problems
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:57.280]   They wish for more contact from YouTube, but there were no reason about it than Hollywood and their discussions
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:03.120]   But I thought I was gonna stand up and say you know you guys should have kind of a union or something again
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:10.640]   I gather gonna see you can have some strength and damned if at the final keynote for the creators Hank Green the founder with his brother
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:17.680]   One of the vlog brothers the founder of VidCon stood up and announced the creation of an internet creators guilt
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.080]   Which is an inter-internet creators dot or I think we're calm
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:28.400]   Where they they can stand together more they can use it to lobby they can use the lobby government they can use it to lobby
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.920]   the platforms and
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.760]   And you know at one hand yaleo
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.720]   YouTube's getting the big chunk of the money by the other hand without YouTube
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.320]   Most people would have no mechanism to get anybody. Yeah
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.600]   I
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:46.600]   It's just me
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:53.560]   But I really feel like it's a it's a it's a it's a fool's game to put your stuff on YouTube
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.560]   I guess you know people have made a lot of money
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:34:05.160]   But I just feel like YouTube's making a hell of a lot more and in most cases with the exception of the McJugger nuggets in the PewDie Pies of the world
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:13.240]   Most people are working their butts off for below minimum effectively below minimum wage like 99.5
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:17.640]   Well, that's true Leo. That's true. That's ever been true of authors and artists
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:25.120]   Right any glamour of us for a fashion can do that. Yeah. Well, that doesn't excuse it
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.920]   Well, yeah, I'd accept it. What's the market?
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.920]   If your video gets
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.120]   1000 views then you get paid commensurally and that's back
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:40.520]   No, but you you don't get to pay commensurally. That's kind of my point. Well, but here's another way to look at it. Here's
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.840]   Well, but here's another way to look at it. Uh, which is that um
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:48.240]   There's um, sorry if my sister um
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.960]   Probably the phone
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:57.440]   Most of those people would never have gotten a video to the public or or you know in the day is a big problem
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.840]   See this I think you're gonna go through a big gauntlet
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.840]   I understand and so for
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:08.640]   Just by the way the same as it's always as it's ever been for the handful the top 100 youtubers
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.600]   success glory fame and money
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:17.920]   But that really belies them literally the tens of millions of other youtubers
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:25.760]   Who are really killing themselves trying to achieve that and I I think that youtube uses them
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.680]   Um
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.560]   I would say that that that
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:41.440]   No, I'm still gonna argue that youtube gives me opportunity to reach a public and maybe have that shot which hollywood never ever ever gave them
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:48.800]   And you agree, see make it that's always been true. Yeah, I think it's true of any sort of creative
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.640]   endeavor
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:54.480]   Um, I agree that like actors are probably a bit more protected
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.320]   um
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.560]   But I also think about journalism which
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:07.040]   Not as glamorous, but still, you know, they're I worked as a unpaid intern at magazines while I tried to like that's the old days
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.200]   So look okay. Here's an example
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.720]   I same thing when I was in radio worked my way up got crap jobs
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.000]   I never got below minimum wage because that would be illegal, but I got had crap jobs
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.960]   But I you know I worked there is a union blah blah blah
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:25.120]   Uh and I worked my way up nowadays if somebody wants to become good at they can make a podcast the mistake
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.520]   What I'm saying is the mistake is to say oh, I'm gonna put it all in youtube
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:34.160]   And let them sell the ads and share the revenue because they'll screw you
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.760]   I mean you or you could or you could do it yourself
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.920]   So I agree with the problem is like jeff was saying that
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.960]   Hard for people to do all that stuff
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.360]   Um, especially when they're first starting out and so they go to youtube because it's an easy way
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.920]   For them to get started
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:59.200]   But I but I agree with you leo in that the better way to do it is to do your own stuff and use all the various
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:02.560]   Yeah, herbucia methodologies that you can like you're doing
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:06.720]   Um, we post on youtube, but we don't expect to make any money from youtube
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:11.760]   Right youtube for these kids is probably like the digital equivalent of like moving to l.a
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.040]   If you want to be an actor, right?
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.520]   So you have to get your stuff on youtube to get discovered
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:20.640]   You know, I understand that but I thought we had a better way these days than having to do that the old
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.440]   sweatshop way
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.520]   Okay, leo, okay. All right
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.800]   So I think that's i don't know if it's everybody but for big publishers
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:35.680]   They you know twitches sweatshop, but we have a lot to be in here. Hi. This is not a sweatshop wait a man
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.720]   Not now admittedly no, I mean look i'm a capitalist. I don't pay you
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:47.200]   Uh a full share of what we make on the show. I pay you and I hope it's enough, but I don't pay your full share
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:53.040]   But you know the truth is real close your ears you would that pay me a penny and I begged to be on twig
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.680]   That's absolutely true. Well, I wouldn't do that though
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:01.280]   So so there's an example. So if I were youtube, I'd go yeah, come on and we could do that
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.760]   Jeff and I but I but I don't I feel like you should be paid for your time
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.880]   Okay, but here's a change the change you want is coming at least at the high level where it always starts
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:17.680]   The new youtube player will be white labeled so the publishers can use it as their player and sell their own ads
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.120]   On it and backfill as they wish that'll never happen
[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.320]   That'll never happen google will not wait
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.520]   Leo
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.800]   No, Leo it's happening. It's been promised to the publishers. It's happening. Mm. Really?
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:33.920]   It's only the big publishers. Europe. Yeah, the big publisher that's where it starts
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:40.400]   It's where it always starts facebook youtube google that always starts the big guys right and little guys get pissed
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.280]   But uh, no the precedent is going to be there
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:50.400]   Well, and maybe because there's competition facebook we know is paying at least 50 million dollars
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:56.080]   to celebrities and media companies to just to kind of prime the pup of live video
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:59.680]   They want to get in this game as well
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:05.920]   I'll wait for you though, Leo that 90 percent of those people who are paid by you. They're all their celebrities
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:11.200]   We're going to get a lot less we get a lot less if they tried to sell ads on their own. Yeah, no, but it's kevin hard
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:15.920]   It's gordon ramsey. It's buzzfeed. It's cnn. I mean, it's not it's not
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:20.240]   I'm even talking about the youtube little guys. Yeah, if I couldn't sell my own ads
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:25.440]   Which is what you're saying they should do you know the structure you need to sell ads. It's huge. It's expensive
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:34.080]   And it's tough. I mean we're selling ads now and where i'm i'm sort of legit in what I do and it's still like
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.400]   a pain in the butt
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.800]   and if you're like a 14 year old youtube star
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.120]   That's
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:44.000]   Not gonna happen. I just I guess I always have this argument
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.160]   I just I would guess I would just say consider youtube an amazing deal if you what you think is
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.920]   You're getting free bandwidth and exposure to a large audience
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:59.520]   But but but don't consider it to be a path to making a living because it
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.720]   It really isn't for most gonna be and they're taking advantage of you. I think
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:10.400]   So that's also if you think your living is gonna be on ads, but what about endorsements or getting fancy cars
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.040]   That's what you have to do. That's what you have to do, right?
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:17.120]   If you're gonna make money on youtube, it's not really from youtube you make your money. It's selling
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:22.080]   You know cosmetics and other things. I think that's a lot of these people
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:29.680]   Sorry, sorry state you go you go. Oh, no, I was gonna say I think that's actually what they're striving for. They're not looking for ads
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.240]   Okay, all right
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:37.360]   So when they say the other thing the next step what I see happening all over these so-called influencers
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:44.480]   Which the fpc is you know cracking down on but I see this all over where they they are sell
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.400]   They are indeed selling ads under the noses of facebook and youtube and twitter and snapchat
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:52.240]   Uh because they're selling their influence on products, right?
[00:40:52.240 --> 00:41:00.800]   Well, so this all really the reason I asked this question is is i'm just curious if anything like this conversation happens at vidcon
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:06.160]   Yes to a civilized extent it does there there listen
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:12.720]   Motives for a lot of people being there are to find friends and to be famous and social make money. Yeah
[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.520]   That's fine
[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.400]   And those who then do have the ambition
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:24.480]   Uh, they get they get um some of them big enough to go off on their own some of them wish that they had more
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:30.240]   Contact but Susan Wojcicki announced that they're gonna have a huge increase in the customer service for youtube
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.560]   Because they realize that's some planes
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:37.920]   Um, you know, they're they're doing some things. Yeah, we're gonna talk about facebook shortly too
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:44.480]   The you know you have to be aware that these platforms live first and foremost to serve their users
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:46.960]   uh in their definition and
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.920]   Um, you know, i'm arguing that we should work in partnership with them, but we can't fully count on them either
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.680]   Yeah
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:58.240]   Well, we've said that for years, uh and it's in we've said for years if you're a brand if you're
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:03.840]   Uh, uh, the financial times you shouldn't be putting your content on the facebook platform because you don't own it
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.400]   And yet everybody's doing it
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:10.960]   Well, I think you have to be attracted to where public cares because they're stuck. Yeah
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.760]   And the days of the destination well here's what when I was in Europe. I got this I
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:21.360]   Disconversation I had where you go from an era of the destination, which is I own it come to me and I own you
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.640]   To distribution, which is okay. I'll go chasing you on facebook
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:29.440]   The next thing that happens. I think is we're a product era where you create products that are
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:36.320]   Um, especially beneficial to people and they come to it because it's useful to them and and it's worthwhile
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:42.160]   But not because you just make content and force people to come to you in markets, but instead they feel like there's something there community
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.960]   utility
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:50.640]   Friendship social whatever it is that makes them come to that product you've made for that community. That's where we have to have
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.040]   Stacey you think you said this is because they don't have a plan. This is just
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.400]   They're falling into it because they don't know anything else to do
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.240]   I
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.840]   Falling maybe a little overstating. I think they're like they see these
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:06.240]   successes on youtube
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:13.040]   And they want to do that and so they that's where they go to do it and they model themselves after their idols
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.200]   But also no, no, I'm talking about big publishers though
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.880]   I mean there I mean you you come from that industry you know, you know these these guys
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.840]   I look at what jeff was good article about jeff bezos
[00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:26.000]   as a patron of journalism at the washington post
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.040]   Um clearly he understands what a digital first strategy looks like and it seems like
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:36.800]   The washington post is and his his staff is getting it and and buying into it
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.680]   I think there's a
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.240]   Yeah
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:45.120]   Well, and there's still it's very hard to give up
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.920]   To give up the cache that comes with being like this amazing
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.640]   Print publication. I mean you still get I mean when I was at fortune
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.880]   People still were like will this be on print? I'm like, why would you care?
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:04.880]   I it just they didn't even send me the print version of the magazine. So like
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:11.040]   I just I don't know. This is this has been crazy and most of them don't
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.080]   They they don't have a plan for digital because they don't understand it
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.520]   and half their employees are
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:24.800]   You know union and old school and stuck in the older era and the other half are like
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.360]   What are you guys doing?
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.720]   And it's very different writing for one side or the other
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:35.840]   There's a great article from yesterday in new york magazine about the washington post and they
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.760]   They tell a story that when ben bradley the legendary editor
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:45.920]   at the washington post the guy who was memorialized in uh, uh, the um
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.160]   watergate
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.360]   story
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.280]   Uh when bad bradley passed jeff bazos wasn't going to go to the funeral
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.000]   And I think it was marnie baren or somebody called him and said jeff you don't understand you have to go to the funeral
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.400]   This this newspaper you bought
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.640]   This has been bradley's paper you have to go and jeff said i'm on my way
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:11.120]   Uh, he understood i think he called yeah, yeah, this he didn't just do the symbolism of of of attending and you know
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.200]   marnie baren speaking of people made famous by a movie of course, uh, the guy
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.440]   featured in spotlight
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:22.720]   Um seems to really embrace what jeff is doing. They've they've built a new kind of high tech newsroom
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:27.360]   Uh moved him out of they apparently were over the printing presses as many newspapers are
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:30.400]   And they moved him out and put him down the street
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.600]   And uh, it sounds like they've got money to spend. I don't know
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:38.320]   Do you do you know what's going on at the washington post jeff do you talk to people over there?
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:44.480]   Yeah, they're a little bazos secretive, but but yes, they they have gone all in on on facebook
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:48.560]   I talked to one of the negative there and he said that they they went to bazos and said
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:54.320]   We would have cast the facebook thing and bazos said well how are you gonna test and uh, it's all put up like our 10
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:58.160]   Those 10 articles today. He said well what articles are best one bazos have that fun a test
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.000]   assistant
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.080]   And they did and they're happy that it's it's it's doing well
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.360]   That i against their their incremental revenue in their view
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:12.800]   Um, they really you know what the fight the old site of the post was about that local versus national
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:20.800]   And print was local and national was digital and they had a huge fight never settled to the to the dying days of the grand family ownership
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:25.360]   And clearly bazos came in and said oh, oh no. This is a national fight
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:31.200]   Let's let's put all the gas we can on the pedal and they are now bigger than the new york times in the us in terms of audience
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.800]   No traffic. And so that's what they're doing, but they're still in a
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:41.200]   Volume based business. I think but they're doing very smart things. They were the first ones to do progressive web apps with
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:48.880]   Uh with google, uh, they're the first in on a lot of things because they have the good technology talent and the willingness to work at it
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.200]   And I think he's made a very good product all at all
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:56.960]   You're right. It was bob woodward who emailed bazos and said he was the soul of the institution that's now yours
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:02.320]   You got to go to the funeral and uh bazos says understand on my way
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.920]   he also uh
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.800]   Of course famously sent his private plane
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:14.400]   Um to uh get the the journalist who had been held hostage. Yeah
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.320]   Um
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:22.160]   Stocked with i love this stocked with food that he liked he checked ahead with his friends
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:25.040]   And uh found out that he liked burritos
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.200]   when uh
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.240]   Jason uh rosane rosane how do you pronounce that rosane
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:37.840]   Was released from an Iranian jail bazos floon to florida on his private jec stocked with beer and burritos after asking rosane's friends
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.920]   What his favorite foods are?
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:46.000]   That's pretty cool. That is cool. Be a cool guy. He's a tough guy. He's a cool guy. Yeah
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.160]   Well, and there's a long there's a long uh history of journalism being supported by patronage
[00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:55.520]   That was actually a model that
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.240]   Could come back. I mean
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:01.680]   Oh, who is it? It's one of the microsoft guys is funding uh
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.320]   journalism into like brain research and
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.160]   interesting
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.520]   bio
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.880]   I don't know if it's bioethics or just biology kind of startups but or not the startups themselves
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.840]   but journalism into the space um and if you think about
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:24.000]   That's a model that works because the stuff that people the stuff that scales and gets you massive ad revenue
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.960]   Is most often crap. I mean
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.920]   Lesson but
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:34.800]   In that you have to pay for the real journalism, but when you atomize your revenue streams with
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:41.600]   Digital, which is what you do you look at it. You're like well. This economically doesn't make sense doing the craps of shows. That's the problem
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.840]   so
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:50.320]   Patriotish sounds good either through like individuals funding you through patreon or one
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.960]   massively big rich individual. Yeah
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.240]   Uh today facebook
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:03.280]   Published its criteria for the news feed which I thought I don't know have you had a chance to look at this yet jeff
[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:11.040]   Oh, yeah, I wrote a quick post about it, which you'll find there. Okay, the the facebook said facebook did two things today
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:14.000]   one was that they um
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.760]   For the first time
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:24.400]   Gave people a little more transparency into the algorithm to the extent that they said here are the principles that guide what we do news feed your values
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:30.640]   Yeah, right. We want your family and friends first. That's our job. That's what facebook does people also want to be
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:36.980]   Um informed and entertained and what I've heard this in the past with the opposite order. It was friends entertainment
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:44.160]   Information, I know this hasn't been my experience. There's here's the quote. That's why if it's from your friends. It's in your feed period
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.600]   You just have to scroll down. That's not been my experience, but i'm
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.400]   Not true. That's not true. No, because because there's a lot of why don't a lot of my friends put stuff. I don't want that's
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.640]   At the same time
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.640]   The second thing they did
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.160]   Which is that they also tweaked the algorithm to say
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.680]   Uh, yes, we're gonna favor friends even more and they're warning news organizations. There may be an impact
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:09.760]   Well, the news organizations are with batlish. Oh, bon sartan. Sorry about that karson edit
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.800]   Um, they went crazy and the new york times
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:18.240]   Uh, you know shock shock. They're gonna show us cats. Uh, no news. Uh, how what they've they've they're a news organization
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:24.560]   Uh, what are they doing? They've never been a news organization. There's never been a priority. This is a matter of degree
[00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.120]   but uh, the the
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:32.960]   Uh, even a lab post was the most reasonable but most of the other posts i saw said, oh my god
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:38.000]   They're gonna de-emphasize news everybody whose partner would use with facebook is basically an idiot
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.760]   Uh, well, we got to wait and see over time and experience and data what actually happens
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:49.600]   Yes, there's an impact but the real lesson here is facebook is not a place to read thousand word articles
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:56.800]   Facebook is a place where you discuss things and we in news have to feed those discussions appropriately to the platform
[00:50:57.280 --> 00:51:00.880]   You know, we we don't get mad because step chat will not let us put up an article
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.600]   And we have to make things especially inappropriately for step chat
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:11.520]   Well, facebook is trying to gently guide us there. I think nonetheless all my my uh, ewors in the news business all went crazy today
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:16.080]   saying big bad uh facebook is ruining news again and I don't think it's the case
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:24.000]   So the problem at I mean, what are the problems? I should say is that a lot of news organizations in the last year or so have oriented
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:30.000]   Towards facebook and it's a significant driver of their traffic when you're trying to achieve those crazy scales
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.440]   So it makes sense that everyone's like holy cow they're changing the algorithm
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:41.600]   It's like when it's like the greeks when they were like, oh, the gods are mad at us again when you know, it didn't rain in enough time
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.760]   That's that's what it feels like
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:49.440]   So I don't know are they gonna start sacrificing goats on mark zuckerberg's porch is a question
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:56.400]   They'll be sacrificing journalists as for usual farhan manjus headline in the new york times facebook a news giant
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.880]   That would rather show us baby pictures
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:04.160]   Yeah, that's just so condescending not only to facebook but to every user of facebook
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:11.440]   Yeah, yeah, I think actually i'll have to say uh facebook from my experiences doing it about right
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.000]   For me personally, yeah
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.320]   Yeah, um here i go there and I see
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.480]   a nice mix I do see a lot of news
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.360]   Uh, and I can't
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:26.400]   Verify that i'm seeing everything my friends and family post
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:32.400]   But I see a nice mix and you're right. I don't want to necessarily see everything my friends and family post
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:35.760]   that facebook's ultimate metric
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:43.200]   Is I I mean, I don't think they've this is a surprise is yeah, how much time you spend there period
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.240]   And they're gonna just
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:52.800]   And they know what you like and what you don't like so they're gonna they're gonna just watch and see what you like and what you interact with
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.760]   And they're gonna give you more of that because that's their only real job
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:01.600]   Right, so here is the same as it is to me from vidcon is that we
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:04.080]   Is it less than ever less your vidcon?
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.080]   They're not about content. It's about social tokens
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:12.240]   You make things to serve the conversations people have and you can serve it with journalistic value with facts and fact-checking
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:16.000]   And and information and explanation and education, but you do it
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:21.760]   Appropriate to how people live their lives. We don't do that. We still make a destination product called an article
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:30.960]   Well, that's sorry folks, but that's what we have to rethink and and and facebook is making is is gently not so gently making us do that
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:37.440]   You know, it's really happening. It's this it's another similar shift from the library to the internet
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.360]   so
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.720]   The way you use the library is very different the way that you use the internet
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:47.360]   but the library is the old days where you would go to the library and you would
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.000]   get something to read and
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.480]   Similarly, you would go to the New York Times site and get something to read
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:54:00.960]   And but nowadays you don't need to go to the library you go to the internet, which is this tossed salad of things to read
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:06.000]   If you want to find something to read you can but you're not going to go to the New York Times
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.080]   You're going to go to a news aggregator or facebook or twitter
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:15.120]   And you're going to see story a story you're interested in read that and then read another
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:18.960]   You know a crouton from the washington post and a
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:24.560]   You know a onion ring from the New York magazine and you're going to move around
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.360]   Is that a fair is that an apanology
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:32.480]   We all be asked your question to get you in trouble. Are you saying that libraries should close
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:34.880]   Well, I
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:37.280]   Yeah, guys repositories of books
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:43.200]   They they need to know they shouldn't close what they should do is that they need to rethink their role
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:47.680]   In an internet age. They're no longer the place you go to find facts
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:54.320]   They know that they of course they do it's the it's the thing librarians have been chewing on for 20 years
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:55:02.400]   Yeah, I really think they're trying what they should do libraries roles should be to provide community services for people
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.960]   To educate themselves
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:10.640]   Get access to things that they haven't been able to I know like our library is doing a lot with literacy adult literacy for example
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:14.880]   They're doing a lot with a lot of libraries are opening up maker spaces. I don't know how they do that
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:21.040]   Um in a quiet environment like like a library, but they open up maker spaces and they have 3d printers and other things
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:26.880]   And it's an investment, but I think those are the types of things that libraries can be a wonderful resource
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:30.800]   Everybody knows where the library is or most people do so you go there to
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:35.760]   Uh to learn a little differently. You might not check out a book, but maybe you'll learn how to 3d print
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:41.520]   Uh a holder for your tablet or something like that and so to extend my analogy
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:47.200]   Perhaps to the point of breaking just as a library has to rethink its role in an internet era
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.600]   So does a news journal?
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:54.720]   Because you can't expect able to go to the front page and read from the top to the bottom and see a
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:56:01.600]   A giant full page ad for macy's it doesn't work that way. I think maybe the publishers have to I mean
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:08.880]   Most journalists think of their job not as they think of their job as providing information. I think right most of people I do
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.800]   Do the better way to hold it
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.800]   The business model though
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.480]   God help us all
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:19.200]   Well, that's the real problem isn't there? I mean, uh, and frankly the libraries also face that
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:23.040]   If you're in california funding for the library is so bad that libraries are now not open
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:27.120]   But a few hours a week in the public library in many in many cities
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:33.920]   And and and and our library here is basically just a place where books are that nobody wants to read
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:36.640]   And so it's homeless people there using the bathrooms
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:43.040]   Uh, our degrees are great. We've got people coming in using the computers. We've got I mean
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:49.760]   I will I will confess I check out still probably five or six books a week because you have a nine-year-old
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:53.600]   Not not just because I have a nine-year-old. It's because I don't like paying for like
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:59.920]   Kindle downloads because they're so freaking expensive. I'm like $10. I could get this at the library free
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:03.920]   Uh, but you are in a minority. I doubt it's really crowded there
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:09.360]   Actually, there's a lot of people on the computers. Okay. And yeah using the internet
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:12.000]   Using it. No, I mean, I've I've done
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.960]   I do workshops there teaching people how to use
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.480]   You know software for like job training and I think that's actually a really
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:23.040]   Like I think that's why better broadband access to libraries is so important. I think
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:32.000]   A good library can serve is like a digital ambassador to people who otherwise are going to be left behind so
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:39.280]   And it's a good place for books. Yeah, I completely agree our library has been very
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.920]   Good at partnering with our maker space
[00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:47.520]   Uh, we've done learn to solder days or learn to solder workshops there where people just come in
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:53.440]   They solder a little thing and learn a new skill. I'm going there on the sixth of july, I think
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:58.160]   Uh, and we're going to do a take a part night where kids middle school kids can bring in whatever they
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:02.320]   Electronics or anything they want and we're just going to tear it apart and learn how it works
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:06.960]   So I I think there's a huge role and I think that most libraries like you said leo
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:12.720]   Or trying to figure out what what it is that they're going to do but I think there's a huge role for libraries to
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.480]   um
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:18.720]   Uh supplement education in their local communities
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:25.680]   They really just need to stay to learn the code sign out there and then taxpayer dollars will just flow right to it
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:30.240]   But but as with newspapers
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.760]   um
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:36.640]   Do we adapt the legacy institution and and try to fit it into a square hole
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:41.840]   Or should you just create a whole new institution where people can go use and learn the internet and use the bathrooms?
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:45.840]   Or should we rethink how we do news or should we rethink education?
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.520]   um
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.520]   That's what
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.520]   And innovation do
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:58.560]   And then the inevitable that the legacy players will wind their heads off and argue that they're being killed and newspaper people are the
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:02.000]   Haughtiest of all I think we know back to your question about vidcon the difference is
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.240]   Yeah, they're all affected by the platforms
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:11.440]   Put the haughtiness of the news industry versus the the reasonableness of the vidcon people is of stark contrast
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:15.120]   Were there any mainstream media people at vidcon or was it all new media?
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:18.560]   Uh, no kid that was there
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:20.320]   There was some
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:24.720]   Unfortunately, but they're there on a field trip. They're there to cover it. They're there to learn. What are they there for?
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:32.400]   Well, here's my line. The first floor of vidcon literally is the fan 17 000 from the second floor of vidcon is 5 000
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:37.760]   Creators the third floor is 3000 industry executives old white men who exploit the two floors below
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:41.440]   Okay, you agree with me
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.440]   That's exactly what i'm saying
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:46.640]   I'm part of the employer. Oh, i'm so nice
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:50.000]   Doing them doing my best to exploit everybody
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.480]   Anyway
[00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:55.680]   Not as effectively as some as susan wojiski
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.800]   She's good. She's really good
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:05.600]   All right, let's take a break. We'll talk more about all of these issues in there's some actual hard news as well like a new
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:10.080]   700 trillion pixel cloudless satellite map
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:14.400]   from google a chrome book pro
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.480]   and a 2.8 million dollar space
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:24.240]   Where google is is uh supporting black girls code? That's really cool
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.560]   Uh right now though, we're going to uh talk about a company supporting us
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.720]   with uh
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:35.360]   With their great products. It's at lassian. We use it lassian like crazy here at twit
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:37.840]   Uh, we use jeera
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:44.400]   Which is a great way to track manage and assign tasks in a big coding project first experienced jeera in our website
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:47.280]   And new website design the the team that was building it used jeera
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:51.920]   It was great. We were able to put our ideas our needs are requests or desires into jeera
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.360]   They were able to parcel it out into little tiny chunks
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:00.800]   And then assign that to an engineer then the engineer can move the chunk along and it's a great way. It's agile
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:05.120]   Sprint based and it's fantastic. I've never seen such
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.840]   An easy way to take something hugely complex and make it simple keep everybody on track
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:15.680]   No, everybody knows exactly where you are. That's jeera. Then there's confluence. We use confluence here in the studio
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:20.960]   Uh our engineering team uses it to create documentation and about our workflow and our hardware
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:28.640]   Um instant messaging via hip chat is the best we use it like crazy. I should show you our hip chat
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.880]   Uh room. I mean we have
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.040]   people uh, we create
[01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.880]   The beauty of hip chat is it's easy to create a new room and we create rooms every time we've got a task
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.720]   We've got a room of course
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.400]   for our um
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.160]   New studio
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.280]   We've got rooms for engineering. We've got rooms for booking hip chat is more than messaging though
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:51.280]   Because you can also integrate in a lot of other tools like jeera
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.600]   Uh so that you can get alerts and information about how things are working
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:59.280]   We have server alerts and things like that. We love these Atlassian programs
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.640]   And if you use git if you're a programmer, you'll love bit bucket
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.280]   It's a better way to get test review and manage code
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:08.320]   In real time it all comes from Atlassian
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:13.840]   Putting together tools to make it easier to collaborate to work together
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:19.520]   We use it for everything from planning events to working on operational issues all of our communications
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:27.440]   It's better than emails better than phones. It's Atlassian at lassasin.com and you can try it free see how jeera confluence hip chat
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:32.480]   Bitbucket will give your team everything you need to organize discuss and complete shared work
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:35.600]   Atlassian helping teams everywhere team up
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:42.480]   To create what's next we used it for our uh, like it so much we used it for the app development for our new apps
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:46.240]   Um, we just end that scrape for the studio design stuff
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:51.600]   And the build and the engineers use it was interesting to get the contractors using it at first because at first
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.040]   Our project manager says well i'll email you and lisa said no
[01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:58.000]   Put it in hip chat. Oh
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.720]   Okay, but once he got used to it like the flow is so so good
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.680]   Thank you at lassian for your support of this week in
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.840]   Google i love steven levi's article, uh in medium
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.400]   Back channel by the way who bought back channel?
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.280]   Condi right
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:21.520]   That is weird bought by them because it wasn't it a microsoft no back channels the meat is medium
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.400]   Remember and they hired steven levi away from wired to run it and everybody's wondering well
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.560]   What is it have thinking how are they gonna make money?
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.000]   Well, it was backed by i think it was my
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.440]   Oh, that's interesting they paid like a one-year
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:41.840]   Sponsorship of it basically that oh for steven. Oh, I did not know that
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:50.080]   Um, well, they've got a great team and now they they're they're still on medium. This is boy talk about an interesting experiment in journalism
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.840]   They're still on medium
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.200]   But now condi owns it. I still don't see any ads in it
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.000]   And they have a new editor don't they?
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.640]   Jesse hempel. Oh wired. I love Jesse. Yeah, I think I just got an email from her. Oh interesting
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.120]   Oh, that's really interesting
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:13.200]   So let me let me see where she popped up. Yeah, because I I love back channel. I love I read it all the time
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.200]   it's become really a go-to um
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.280]   It's weird magazine within a magazine within a site. I don't you know, it's a very
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:26.400]   Jeff you write for medium all the time you've been the one I've been telling me all this time and I'm the one laughing at you
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:34.240]   Oh, Jesse is the new head of editorial for back channel. Oh cool. So there you go. That's she's writing for them. I have seen her byline
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:41.840]   And she's awesome. Yeah, she's very good. So great article last week. Uh, how google is
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:46.000]   Remaking itself as a machine for learning first company
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.040]   How they're putting as I've as I've said in the past the thin layer of machine learning
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:56.560]   All over everything one of the he buries way down if he's talking about how they've got
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:03.200]   A program to become machine learning ninjas for their coders and they're trying to train everybody as fast
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:09.040]   They can and adding machine learning but way down in the article he kind of buries what I thought was very interesting
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.400]   Which is there's a machine learning tool called rank brain
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:17.600]   Uh that they've been using for some time for some small percentage of
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:24.480]   Google searches in an interview that uh, Stephen got with somebody at google the guy had a search. I think at google
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:29.600]   Um, he said, yeah, we're using rank brain for like 90 of all searches now
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.880]   I I don't know enough about
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:38.240]   What rank brain does to know what that means, but that's so this is um google
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:42.880]   rank brain is evolved in according to uh, uh, uh,
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:48.720]   Dean who is not amit segull who's the master of search, but um
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:55.120]   Who was it who left really recently? What was the guy who's he left recently from google
[01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:02.480]   He had kept them from using yes machine learning. So this is how steven cook. I think in a kind of nicely
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:06.320]   Categorizes is there are two schools of thought when it comes to search
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.800]   There's the what he calls the retrieval school
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:14.080]   Which is how you how you and I probably think of search which is you go out you spider everything you
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:20.000]   You bring it all you index it and then somebody retrieves it like looking up in a card catalog at the library
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.440]   Uh, the search results and then there's the more in more difficult but more interesting
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:34.320]   Artificial intelligence technique and that's the one that is now uh winning winning out rank brain is involved in every query and affects the actual rankings
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.360]   Probably not in every query but in a lot of queries. What's more?
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:43.440]   Hugely effective leave he writes of the hundreds of signals google search uses when it calculates its rankings
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:47.200]   Rank brain is now ranked as the most third most useful
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:52.880]   There's no that that makes sense. There's always this battle between the
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.960]   Retrievers and the machine learning people the machine learners have finally won the battle
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.800]   I think I think it's probably a better way to characterize it would be
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.280]   uh
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:12.960]   You've got the machines you let them do their thing and you let the people come in every now and then and tweak it so less of a battle and more of a
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:16.000]   Oh god singularity. Ah
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.880]   Cooperation the machines and the humans are working together at last
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:25.280]   Yeah
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.800]   All right, nothing more to say about that. I thought it was a very interesting article anyway
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:36.000]   Um google maps is getting a new 700 trillion pixel remake facelift
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.280]   Uh cloudless now the satellites
[01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.160]   Pictures are cloudless
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.800]   It's the first time google map satellite map has been updated in three years
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:53.120]   I didn't know this but a billion people use up all the clouds on earth. Yes. That's the that's the headline
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:57.840]   Write it today more than a billion people use google maps every month
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:04.160]   Um, you you may not have it already, but it will be you'll be getting it soon 700 trillion
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.880]   pixels of new data
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.320]   what
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:09.280]   Wow
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.960]   what
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.520]   Think about the bandwidth that's gonna suck up if you're like trying to find something real fast out
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:21.920]   Um here's an example. I mean go ahead. Oh, go ahead. I was just saying this is from the atlantic article
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.440]   Here's an example
[01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:28.640]   uh christmas island which is in the middle of the pacific a thousand miles off australia
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:34.800]   Is so remote that actually is in the indian ocean. It's so remote that it's frequently obscured by clouds
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.280]   But there are no clouds in the new map
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:46.400]   Oh, yeah, say this is this is interesting in the scope of it and the enormity of it
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:51.760]   But at the same time, I mean I know for me I almost never use satellite anymore. I use
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.360]   Um the regular map view really use
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.640]   Don't you like those pretty pictures? I like the pretty pictures
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:04.800]   My daughter now it's easier for me to navigate and find out where i'm going if I use the regular map if I use
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.560]   It's all yeah, yeah abstract version
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:14.880]   I use it only to snip to scoop on my neighbors and see how is it like couldn't otherwise see because we're back
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.160]   That's okay shameful admission. I do the same thing
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:26.080]   Like do they have a pool over there? They have a pool. Yeah, you zoom in. Yes, it's a pool
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:35.040]   So part of the problem, I guess was the pictures that they were getting
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.640]   From lansat 7
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.640]   Were marred by these diagonal lines. This was a physical malfunction on the satellite
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.360]   but now they have a new satellite lansat 8
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.760]   And it doesn't have the same problem. It's been operational for us since the spring of 2013
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:56.800]   So there's a lot better crisper newer
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.760]   Data
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.760]   So that's kind of cool
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:08.720]   Need article. I like the Atlantic they're pretty they've been getting more and more geeky
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:16.000]   They're very good. Yeah, they are good. That's where the money is geeky geeky stuff. Yeah, I said that for years
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   But it took nobody believe me
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:25.200]   You might be a little too geeky. Oh, I know I'm in I'm in the two geeky camp too. So I'm like, oh, I'm a little too geeky
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:30.160]   Uh, I want to talk about google fiber and buying webcasts or did we?
[01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:36.240]   Yes, no, this is a great story and uh, there's a there's a side story that's related about
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:40.000]   This this comes from a medium opinion piece
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.280]   By an apartment dweller about house how Comcast and the other incumbents
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:50.960]   basically have a monopoly and make exclusivity deals with apartment buildings
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:56.160]   And as a result a lot of apartment dwellers, which is the majority of people in the United States
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.160]   Are forced into poorer situations if you live in an apartment
[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.120]   you of course you have no choice but to uh
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:09.120]   to to get your internet from whatever the apartment offers and and Comcast and others
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.160]   Use their leverage to uh
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.240]   and kickbacks
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:19.040]   To ensure you have very poor connection web pass is I think all mallex
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:23.840]   apartment building maybe you can remember it does it does have web pass because home's always
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:28.080]   Saying oh you I have the best internet access. It's so good
[01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:32.880]   He started complaining about it in recent years, but for for the like the longest time
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.840]   He had like 200 megabits per second when right it was like back in 2009
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:44.080]   So and that was because the apartment owners it worked as a co-op and made a deal with web pass
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.920]   and web pass
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.920]   put fiber in
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:51.200]   So they are they've just been bought by google fiber
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.480]   Which will give google a foothold into this
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.680]   Big apartment market in san francisco, san diego, miami
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.160]   Chicago and boston
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:07.600]   Yeah, they're buying the so the web pass is a point-to-point service, but the fibers throughout the building
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:12.960]   So what I think web pass does it use microwave? Oh, that's interesting
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:19.200]   So it gets a high speed con connection to the building and then the building distributes it to its customers
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:24.880]   That is my understanding of how web passes. I mean unless recently they've changed things
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:30.720]   So I was because I remember i'm talking about it and I wasn't I could thought I think that's what home's using
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.200]   So that good it is yeah
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.920]   um so
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:40.720]   Yes, so in susan crawford who's the person who wrote there you go
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:49.680]   Ida martykel, she's the one who actually was very prescient talking about how the cable companies were basically building up a high speed broadband monopoly
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:52.960]   A couple years back because none of the telcos
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.160]   a warrior for the good guys here she calls it to
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.520]   what is the phrase she uses the the uh
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.000]   the new paola
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.320]   The new paola so it's not I was kind of I read this and I was like come on susan
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:07.920]   um because
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.920]   This isn't new. This has happened for
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:15.120]   decades and the FCC actually made rules trying to prevent it, but the problem is
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.440]   You have to wire up these buildings and so
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:24.240]   The cable companies like they're all through san Antonio. You can go and find
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:25.440]   uh
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.960]   Uverse only buildings because that's the infrastructure they put in
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.960]   and
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:35.760]   It it's sucky, but if you get enough people my understanding is now you can
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:39.600]   Change those rules, but you do have to get enough people and go like
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.160]   it is a paint and it's it's
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:45.120]   horribly unfair and it's kind of a legacy
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:51.920]   of our crappy internet infrastructure plan from way back in the night Crawford who's a professor of law at harvard
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:59.360]   Uh rights that the FCC made a rule eight years ago that says landlords cannot have exclusive agreements
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:07.360]   Uh, in fact they knew there was a problem and this is the FCC incumbent providers commonly engage in a flurry of activity to lock up
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.160]   MDU's that's multiple dwelling units and other real estate developments and exclusive
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.080]   Arrangements as soon as it becomes clear a new entrant will be coming into town
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:21.200]   Um, the problem is that you can make a rule
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:29.440]   But these big isp's are not dumb. So they do sort all sorts of interesting things she quotes a story
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.320]   uh about
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:39.520]   Apartment building and here's a letter from Comcast saying i'm running to you regarding an incident that occurred recently a nearby apartment
[01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:43.600]   Community served by Comcast a new provider google fiber
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:50.320]   Had set up an on-site marketing event on the property in violation of the exclusive marketing provisions
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.560]   So you can't have an exclusive, but you can't have an exclusive marketing deal
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:15:02.640]   Unfortunately it put the property in a difficult situation as they were required to remove the google sales team immediately
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:09.680]   Fortunately the property owner recognized the error when we contacted them and worked with us to rectify this
[01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:14.640]   Situation or as she says put down that google donut and get the hell out
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:20.080]   So there's ways and ways even if there's a rule against it
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:27.280]   Uh shenanigans are everywhere she says the isp's are super smart
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.320]   They're not dumb. I mean, but this is also
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:36.720]   Sure you guys have probably covered this back when it was announced, but I mean google is you know trying to get around this by laying their own
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:40.640]   Yeah fiber and they I guess the the new uh trans specific
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.640]   60
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:48.400]   Terabit per second cable is going live on june 30th. Wow apparently I don't know if you saw that
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:54.080]   But it was it was in the news probably like a year ago or maybe more that they were going to do this and um
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:57.520]   And apparently it's it's ready to go live here
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:01.840]   The other side of this is you as an apartment renter have some
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:10.080]   Power because after all is that the one of the first things you ask about before you rent a new apartment is what kind of internet you got?
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:14.800]   It depends on the I mean if you're in san francisco finding a place you're like can I
[01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.440]   Yeah, yeah
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:21.760]   So I don't know it's not a very it is definitely a seller's market in some cities
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:24.400]   But but where it's not you should really insist
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:30.160]   We you know, we we're moving studios and one of the one of the real incentives for the move
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:34.400]   When we moved in here five six years ago, we got Comcast to trench
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:38.800]   From way down the street there all the way up to here to put in fiber
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:45.840]   And we spent a lot of six thousands five thousand dollars a month or something for 150 megabits megabits of symmetric fiber
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:47.680]   the new place
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:53.520]   A local provider one of the really best internet independent internet service providers in the country sonic net
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:17:00.320]   I love sonic. Are they great? Well, they're local. They're from san francisco. It's amazing. Yeah, okay. Yes. So it turns out
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:07.360]   I'm we're looking at places right and everywhere that we go. I see a little thing that says oh, yeah, we have gigabit here
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:10.640]   And i'm going hey, this place has gigabit. This is awesome
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:15.120]   So we i'm friends with dane jasper the founder sonic that i've known him for years
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:18.800]   He's the guy with the linux license plate. We've interviewed him before and we talked to him. He said dane
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:25.760]   What can you do for us? So we're getting get ready for this 10 gigabit symmetric in a new studio 10
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:37.200]   Well, we we as it turns out we do consume bandwidth like popcorn. So we'll
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.160]   We'll find ways to use it
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:45.360]   So well, we were really thrilled. I mean that's but that's a cell the point is that's a selling point
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.480]   To have gigabit
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.640]   It is it is I won't say it a hotel anymore unless it has fast internet jeff jeff you should learn the lesson
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:57.280]   I won't do it. I won't come to a country anymore
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:04.160]   So anyway, there's a there's a crappy hotel down in
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:09.520]   Silicon valley that I stay at when I go down there and the only reason I stay there is because they have
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:15.840]   Normal wifi throughout that they don't you just sign on you don't have to sign into a page you don't and it's super fast
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:17.920]   I can watch Netflix. I can do what I want
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:24.080]   Um, and so that's my top choice even though it's a crappy room with a crappy bed all the rest that can get work done
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:30.400]   Think the same is true. It's becoming increasingly more the case that you want to have fast internet no matter where you go
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:32.400]   Here's the problem. Here's the problem
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.400]   There isn't what we what the world needs is an honest
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:43.360]   fact-check database of actual speeds in prime times in hotel rooms number one
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:48.000]   Number two we need suits against hotels for false advertising
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:52.400]   We need a definition of high speed and a definition of what's not high. It's just awful
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.360]   Oh, you know, so I talked to the people who run
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.760]   Hilton and
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:19:02.720]   Is it Marriott? No, hi, um those two hotel chains to actually ask about how they
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:07.600]   When these companies franchise out or I don't know if it's really franchising when you're a hotel
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.680]   but they actually have standards for
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:11.920]   internet access that they
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:15.200]   Make their hotel chains follow. What's crazy is
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.800]   Oh, yeah
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:23.120]   It differs based on location. So like the type of city how many stars a property has
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.880]   like like the
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:26.880]   the status of a property
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.240]   um
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:33.040]   I think those are the two big things and so I was actually surprised because some of them are like
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:39.200]   Relatively decent, but some of them are like, you know, oh and how many rooms the size of the property?
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.800]   um
[01:19:40.800 --> 01:19:45.120]   But some of them are like 300 megabits per second for a property that would have like
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:48.720]   300 rooms and I'm like, yeah, no, that's not legit
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:56.080]   Um, so I was kind of shocked that that even existed. So jeff hotel yfi tests.com
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.120]   It's a crowd source crowd source
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:03.200]   I think guru for hotel. It's like secret for hotel. Wi-fi. It's a crowdsourced
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:07.520]   Database and what you do when you go to a hotel you test the Wi-Fi and you upload
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.800]   The data to the website and they have 350
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:14.240]   395 hotels in london 139 hotels in sev with sisco
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.200]   200 hotels on bar cilona. I mean all over
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:24.000]   So you can actually uh, you know if I were in a hotel right now, I'd say yes and it would test the speed and it would upload it to its
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:29.280]   server automatically. So you're right. I think this would need but I think what what you're seeing though already
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:35.840]   Is a considerable improvement in all of this because more and more people want high speed internet and as that becomes more and more
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:42.400]   Expected there's more pressure. I mean the days there's still are plenty hotels that charge you 15 dollars a day for internet
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.800]   But there are far more hotels now that start that are saying free will free internet
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:53.360]   Uh, well the baby gate now is free basic. Yeah, uh, if only you wanted to email and then pay for
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:56.880]   The high speed but then you pay for the high speed they don't deliver
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:59.600]   I know but I think that this is we're in a transition
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.000]   But I think there's a significant market pressure now
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:06.880]   Not just on hotels but on apartment buildings and on renters and every and rentals and everything
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:09.440]   But I want the legal pressure too the ftc
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:12.160]   The federal so cute should make itself useful
[01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:18.880]   And and be enforcing the definition of high and the delivery of ftc has a definition of broadband, right?
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:20.960]   But I don't know if that's well, but it's for different
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:27.280]   It actually is different in two different places. I'm going to give you a shred of hope here jeff because last year
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.960]   They gave the first hotel to offer Netflix in their guest rooms
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:34.720]   And as part of that deal with netflix they had to actually guarantee
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.080]   Their broadband speeds to each room
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.560]   So
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.680]   I'm going to marry on the board. I try to save your ass when I can or who could news
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:47.200]   So there you go. Um, it's so it's enough to stream
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:51.520]   Netflix in the room because that was actually one of their big issues that in figuring out how to make sure people
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.680]   How to sign people out automatically if they didn't sign out of their netflix accounts
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:59.600]   Um, so we might actually see those kind of deals because I mean
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:02.400]   Do you I don't even turn on my hotel room tv?
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.720]   I just sit there and find something on you know, I can
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:10.240]   And watch it. That's what I do too. I I think this is a potential business opportunity for google frankly
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:11.760]   I mean look what they've done with starbucks
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:18.480]   What if they picked a few hotel chains and said hey look will provide your internet access to your guests if you let us be
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:24.880]   You know have the soul soul proprietorship of of the internet and just just just outsourced
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.520]   I mean, I think it's a win win
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:30.160]   We're paying really there and really brilliant
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:34.000]   Wow, it's just as i'm brilliant i'm feeling
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.600]   Google's also responding by building its own internet speed test
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:43.360]   Tool and I haven't got this feature yet. Although some people say they have
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:45.040]   So
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:50.320]   One of the problems with one of the problems with speed test on that which is run by ukla or nephlix fast
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:57.040]   Dot com website is that isp's know about these and they will you know see that you're going there and they'll
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:03.120]   Hoke the results. So if you search for speed test or or
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:09.360]   Uh, what's my speed test or check internet speed on google some people at least are getting
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:15.040]   A button in the search results that say run speed tests from google's measurement labs
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:22.080]   Well, they also did for youtube. I don't know if when you if you guys noticed this but you could actually check your broadband
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.800]   Quality on youtube and it would show you if your
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:30.080]   Isp was this was back during the peering debates, but I thought fast.com was by
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:37.920]   Netflix it is netflix built that yes, not speed test no no okela does speed test and fast.com is done by netflix exactly right
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:43.360]   Uh and now or sometime coming to a browser near you google may have its own
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.480]   Measurement lab does a lot of really cool testing
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:49.200]   So that should be fun. So
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:55.760]   Measurement lab is not google. It's another company. It's a third party measure bit lab is a non-profit from the
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:58.720]   OTA hold on
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:03.200]   I used to work with them when I was doing all the peering stuff. They're really m lab
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:06.080]   Google has backed them, but I think it's the
[01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:09.360]   This is kind of neat
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:11.360]   Open technology what OTI?
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:14.320]   I'm terrible with acronyms
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.600]   Anyway, you can find out more at measurement lab.net
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:23.520]   There you go. Oh new america's open technology institute. There we go. Cool and
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:31.760]   Academic researchers google and planet lab consortium and the planet lab consortium speaking of which you might wonder where's matt cuts
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:37.760]   These days because he may not be able to join us for a while because I guess he's gone to work for the pentagon
[01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:41.520]   Uh oh matt cuts in a uniform
[01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:43.840]   I don't think he has to wear a uniform
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:48.720]   Though we queried him. He said well, I might be able to but I'm am starting a new job and I'll let you know
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:52.800]   After I ask them if I can continue to do this week in google. I'm sorry
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:56.960]   It's it's kernel cuts to you kernel cuts. I'd like to say that
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:03.360]   Tan hut. I like that. Yeah, he's not leaving google, but he's joined the pentagons digital team. This is actually
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.640]   Uh, it's the defense digital service
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:15.120]   Which was formed last fall to improve the dod's ability to uh, solve complicated it issues and develop new technologies
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:20.720]   And so this is kind of cool. He he's wanted to as a lot of coders have wanted to
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:27.360]   Um kind of take his skills and bring him to government to improve transparency to make government work better
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:33.600]   Uh for us. He says uh over the last couple of years. I've seen more and more people in technology trying to make government work better
[01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:36.320]   They're idealists who are also making a large impact
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:39.840]   It's like code for america people like that there are people I can respect
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:43.600]   Some of them have worked to fix health care.gov for example
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.760]   I think a lot of googlers went on loan for that
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:51.120]   From take talking to many of them. I can tell you the energy is contagious and they're trying to improve things in all kinds of ways
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:54.320]   I want to see whether I can help too for the for the next few months
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:59.120]   I'll be taking a leave from google. I'm joining the us digital service family specifically
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.160]   the defense digital service of the pentagon
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.760]   And he's moving to dc as part of the chain it changed
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.360]   Wow
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:08.160]   So
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.880]   Let us now please pay tribute to matt
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:17.120]   For bringing his wonderful club to bear to solve the incredible best of the year moment on
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:19.360]   Trig last week with poor jason
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:22.320]   Was matt on last week
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.360]   No, but matt rescued him after the fact you oh he rescued. Oh, I should tell you what happened
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:32.320]   Were you here for that jeff because I wasn't on vacation. Yes. I was it was it was it was jade
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:38.160]   Jason is wonderful. He threw himself on his sword for the sake of a show for the sake of the entertainment
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:44.080]   I would have gone completely completely crazy insane had to leave he kept his good humor
[01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:47.760]   He uses the lesson, but he needed matt's rescue now explained
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:51.040]   So he decided to turn on two factor while he was on the show
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.560]   on
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.960]   on google and unfortunately
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:58.080]   And this is a bug if you ask me
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:03.360]   um the phone number that he uses and would use to verify
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:09.760]   That he was in fact, you know getting the right codes and everything was a google voice number
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.720]   So of course as soon as he turned on two factor
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:17.440]   He was logged out of google voice and then was unable to as a result
[01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:21.360]   Get the confirming text message that would allow him to use it
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:25.840]   Thereby locking himself out of all google services. Is that correct?
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:33.840]   Yes, he was in a recursive loop of hell that the only way to get out of it was to do what he couldn't do that doesn't seem possible
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:38.480]   As as we pointed out the show as she said
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:44.640]   Google should know a google voice number and say uh, you know, it's doing that which martyrs are you?
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:48.320]   Yeah, so I haven't talked to Jason since he's on vacation right now
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:51.120]   But so matt cuts that helped him fix as usual by the way
[01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:56.400]   We love you matt and I know you're listening right now even though you're steep within the confines of the pentagon
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:59.440]   But um, I think they still have reception there
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:05.040]   What kind of bandwidth do they have at the pentagon you think they have 10 gigabits per second?
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.920]   anyway
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:11.360]   You're gonna list leo
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:13.360]   Yeah, no, I got it. I don't need it
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:14.560]   Um
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:18.560]   But he's saved our bacon a couple of times too when when we when we screwed up
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.640]   He intervened for us as I think you know and he's interviewed many times
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:26.720]   So thank you matt for uh interviewing me once again for the twit family
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:29.760]   You're a good man matt cuts a good man
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:35.280]   And he also put in a bug report that said uh, you know, we might want to change our ui on that park which he's very matt
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.440]   Can't be the only person he's done that
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:43.360]   I've talked i hope not i've talked to people in other tech companies and other divisions of google
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:48.480]   And it's funny how matt is now a touchstone because when they get into trouble and whole lack of trust
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:54.560]   When I hear people say honest together i've heard this from three or four places, you know, they need they need a hat cuts
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:03.200]   And it's true. He he is such a human being you know, he's gonna listen. He's gonna trust it's gonna be reasonable. He's gonna level with you
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:05.600]   and um
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:11.600]   He's the best you feel in good hands. He's the best. He's the best so matt all your jog right now. I hope you're gritting
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:18.320]   So I see moving his whole family. I guess he is to dc. I don't know. That's committed to
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:23.680]   public service. Thank you matt for doing that and I don't know what the term of his service will be and I don't know what
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:27.200]   whether he'll come back a colonel or just a staff sergeant but uh
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:29.920]   hats off to you
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:31.600]   Colonel matt cuts
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:37.440]   I don't think colonel cuts. It sounds a little bit like something from a clue game like colonel cuts with the lead pipe in the
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:45.360]   Study sounds like a movie from the vietnam jungle. Yeah. Oh yeah, the horror the horror cuts
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:48.480]   I
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:54.480]   I love the smell of chocolate in the morning. Did he somebody saying uh, did he did he come from the government to google?
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.000]   I can't remember
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.480]   Somebody said that in the chat. I don't know if that's true or not
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:02.800]   Uh, it's funny how little we know about matt cuts
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:09.360]   I'm gonna have a t-shirt made that says ww mcd. What would matt cuts do?
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:17.280]   Let me just see started his career at the university of north carolina at chapel hill. So he's kind of going home
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:20.240]   and joined google in the year
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:24.080]   2000
[01:30:24.080 --> 01:30:26.080]   Can you believe that?
[01:30:26.080 --> 01:30:31.120]   Um, so I don't I think he must have come straight out of college. He was working on his phd
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:34.000]   at the unc
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000]   Is he dr cuts?
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.400]   Uh, he might be abd cuts. I don't know. We'll have to ask matt
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:46.320]   All but dissertation right. I don't know what I don't know. Yeah, that's a good question
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:51.360]   Um, he was working on his phd at unc matt
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.400]   I'll call him dr cuts from now on
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.960]   He has an ms
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:02.480]   He's an ms. It looks like he didn't get his phd if wicki pd is correct, but he's from that area
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:08.240]   He grew up in i don't know this he grew up in katucky, which is why he's such a nice guy that explains a lot
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:12.640]   Um
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:15.840]   20 what is it 2.8 million dollar facility?
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:18.640]   for black girls code
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:24.160]   in uh inside the google headquarters in new york city. It's a non-profit
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:28.320]   hoping to give better opportunities for students and increased diversity
[01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.360]   in the tech industry
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:35.840]   And that's more than just you know paying lip service to getting some diversity
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:40.800]   I think that's fantastic. It's a gift from google by the way
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:46.640]   So I have a I have a lot of questions about this. Did you read? I mean
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:55.200]   When teaching or when saying that you're going to teach someone how to code and expecting that to like solve problems
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.880]   No, it doesn't of course not
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:02.320]   So like oh, I like this does it also help, you know provide training on how to
[01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.560]   interview well, right?
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:07.840]   Money for clothing so you can get a job if you want it
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:09.040]   Um
[01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:16.160]   All of these other and sort of thing in some ways. I think the first step and the most valuable step in diversifying silicon valley
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:22.080]   Would to be get some perspective and some different culture into the products that we make in silicon valley
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:26.800]   That would be a very good first step to make not merely making it
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:30.080]   I mean obviously eventually you'd like to have lots of jobs too
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:34.160]   But even just having it not be less of a mono culture
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.640]   Would be hugely valuable
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:42.080]   You saw the last episode of silicon valley where they they made a great product, but only engineers liked it
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.080]   Nobody else could figure it out
[01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:46.560]   And that's a kind of a problem in silicon valley
[01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:50.480]   And that's why you need diversity. That's exactly right. Yeah
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:54.880]   Yeah, no, I've been arguing that for years, but the best way to make that happen is
[01:32:54.880 --> 01:33:00.560]   I mean, well, it's a start to bring people in and say here you're working in google
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:04.960]   I agree. I understand in fact one of the things I love about app camp for girls is they really emphasize
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:09.600]   It's not just coding. There's we they you know if you're designing an app you need all kinds of
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:13.680]   Skills you need to be able to do this. Maybe some people are designers
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:18.640]   Some people are marketers. There's lots of skills and I think that that's really the way to look at it is
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:23.200]   Is there's a variety you know you can contribute to technology
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:26.240]   from with more than just coding
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:29.360]   I agree with you stacey. I think
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.760]   emphasizing coding is
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.760]   Is probably a bad idea on the other hand
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:37.360]   It's not I don't I don't actually disagree with emphasizing coding
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:42.640]   I'm just saying that it takes a lot more than coding right in teaching someone to code to make them a good
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:46.960]   Potential employee, right? I do think I would like to see coding
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:51.360]   um and actually maybe uh you and erin can weigh on on this because
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:55.200]   You both have younger kids. I'd like to see coding
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:01.920]   be at least an equal partner to math in schools these days in other words the skills that you learn in math are
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:07.840]   Not math. I mean you're not going to use algebra in real life unless you're a coder probably or a
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:13.440]   An actuary, but what it teaches you is rigorous thinking how to solve problems
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:20.160]   You know how to stay with something until you understand it has there's all these extra life skills that you learn over and above math
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.240]   And coding could do exactly the same thing
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:25.280]   Yeah, I completely agree
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:29.680]   Uh, I talked to my son about this all the time about you know, he always asks well, what is all this math?
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:33.200]   I'm learning good for I'm never going to use it once I you know get out of school
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.760]   And you say this is an example
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:37.920]   You know, he comes to me
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:41.600]   Uh, he said a while ago. He said oh, I want to you know, he's big into video games of course
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:45.200]   I want to learn how to make video games. I'm like well, that's what you use your math for
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:49.440]   You're going to have to know this stuff. Um, you can do some really cool stuff
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:52.480]   How old is he?
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:54.480]   Oh, so so he just turned 17
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:58.000]   Um and interestingly enough, uh, I was on vacation as well
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000]   I'm glad we synchronized our vacations leo
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:06.000]   Um, I was on vacation last week as well and we I took him to kind of a college tour back east was we're visiting some family
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.160]   so we stopped in at cornell
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:09.520]   and um
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:12.240]   It was a great tour. We took the engineering department tool
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:18.640]   And one of the questions I asked them what's the ratio men to women in the engineering department?
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:21.920]   And they said that it was above 50 women actually
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:26.000]   What in their engineering group, which I thought was a fantastic. Um, great
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:29.360]   Number to have but but they said accept
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:32.720]   Computer science. Oh, yeah
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:35.600]   Except computer science. So all the other engineering
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:41.680]   Majors are 50 percent, you know, if you take them and average it out, but but computer science is still a lot less
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:44.400]   So I think programs like this are really really necessary
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:48.480]   Like you said leo just to introduce the concept and
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:51.920]   All the additional learning that you can get out of coding we use coding
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:58.240]   It's not just coding in the maker space. Anyway, we we teach coding, but you have to know the coding in order to do something
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:02.400]   It's all make something right in a mark. Right exactly. So you're doing a project
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.800]   The laser maze I mentioned before is a great example of that
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:09.040]   We need the code to get the thing to work. Otherwise it doesn't work. So you start with this
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:13.840]   Ah, I think it would be cool if you could do this and then the coding is one piece of that giant puzzle
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:18.160]   Um in in making something come to life or bringing your idea to life
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:21.920]   Um, and so that's what we teach in the maker space, but I think this is fantastic
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:26.560]   Um just to introduce coding someplace where it may not be introduced
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:32.160]   Um otherwise I think it's fantastic. Stacey, does your nine-year-old daughter have an interest in tech at all or?
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:35.840]   So sometimes and and this is actually worth
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.880]   I don't know if this is because
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:41.600]   Why? Okay, but as a girl
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:44.880]   When she's there's a robotics club in her school
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:50.880]   And they do a lot of it's not just battle bots, but it's making robots and she is
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:54.960]   So not into that she's like screw that like straight up like
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:01.600]   Robotty things, but she is interested when I showed her like projects about using our doinos to
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:07.680]   There's a project to teach to use an Arduino to program a lemur feeder for the Oakland zoo
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.320]   Oh, me. Awesome. Yeah, she was like
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:13.120]   We could feed animals with this and that so
[01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:17.200]   And then there's a girl they started a girls kind of oriented
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:24.720]   Tech club at her school and like the project that they were working on was building a trash can that when you stuck a new piece of trash in
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:29.040]   It would weigh it and give you like data on how much space it would take up in a landfill
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:31.200]   Um, wow
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:34.080]   And they so I think part of it is
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:39.040]   When my daughter thinks about making something she's thinking about making something
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:42.720]   A lot of times with more of a social component and I'm not saying it's
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:46.320]   That's her. That's not gender specific, but that's her
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:50.480]   And so like I think once we brought in tech out to like
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:57.600]   More applications beyond just like video games or something that has historically been a little bit more
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:00.160]   I don't know
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:03.360]   Male or loner or whatever. I mean I built computers with my dad
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:09.200]   So I I've always been more of the guy side of tech maybe but that's the argument about bringing diversity silicon valleys
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:14.160]   Instead of thinking the same applications that we're already doing is to get some diversity in there
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:17.520]   Maybe you'll come up with something like way and garbage. I mean, that's the whole point
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:22.160]   Yeah, or you'll put a period tracking app and health kit or you'll I mean
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:24.480]   Isn't there one?
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:27.040]   There is now. Yes, but it launched without one
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:33.120]   Right because well and uh, I mean along the same lines apple made a big deal about
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:37.280]   Oh, we've adjusted the apple watch now for people who are not walking but in chairs
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.760]   Um because I mean talk about insensitivity and if you had more people in wheelchairs in the apple campus
[01:38:43.760 --> 01:38:47.360]   Maybe this wouldn't have happened the apple watch tells you to stand up every hour
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:50.000]   Which must be very
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:56.240]   Frustrating so they've they've now they've changed that and then in io and the new uh apple watch o s
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:01.920]   They'll you'll be able to say, you know get active or something else and they're even instead of just measuring
[01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:09.760]   pacing and steps they're at they studied how people use their wheelchairs how they move their arms apparently there multiple ways of doing that
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:14.480]   And making the watch work with that and all of that comes from having diversity
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:18.320]   In the building otherwise you don't think about other people
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:22.960]   So it's true. Yep, this is good. We all agree
[01:39:22.960 --> 01:39:30.240]   Uh, I'd be interested to see what's going on with the chrome book pro so
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:36.960]   Google initially at wwdc said that you will be getting the play store on three different
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:43.360]   Chromebooks in june one was the chrome book pixel 2015 one was a asus flip when was an asir
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:49.840]   It has arrived on one and only one the asus flip, which I don't think anybody has around here. I wish I did
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:54.400]   I'm cross crossing my fingers. It'll arrive on my chrome book
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:40:00.240]   This is the pre release you have to be in the developer track to get that now that apparently now
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:03.120]   I wouldn't expend I wouldn't expend too much energy on this
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:09.200]   But do any of you use the google opinion rewards app? I do and you get these surveys and some of the surveys
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:13.760]   I'm and I'm so pissed. It does. I've not been asked question. You're about to say
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:20.240]   Is that the same thing that asked me questions about restaurants? I've been at or is that a different? That's that's another thing
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:23.920]   It's different the opinion rewards is actually you must get it because here's what happens
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:26.720]   First of all
[01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.440]   There's something satisfying being about being asked your opinion
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:33.920]   As if they care right as if it matters as if it matters
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:39.840]   But so the the it's actually quite satisfying to take these little surveys and sometimes they're very just two questions
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:42.720]   Sometimes there's one question like, you know, do you hella ski?
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:45.840]   No, thank you for participating
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:54.080]   But you get money you get credits in the google play store for participating in it, which is really cool
[01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:58.240]   Anyway, the expert points I get for answering questions about restaurants
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:01.920]   No, this is much better that you must be that must be four squares of them
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:08.320]   All right, that's google local which is separate sometimes they will ask you for reviews, but this asks you
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:12.720]   But there's also wonderfully freaky because it knows he does that people stores you've been in
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:15.040]   Oh, I do see that sometimes. Yeah
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.120]   Yeah, yeah, so I don't have any surveys at this time
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:21.680]   Nor do I pernold any credit
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:26.560]   But a redditor says look what I got on my google opinion rewards the other day
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:32.400]   How would you think a Chromebook Pro is different than a Chromebook?
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:40.880]   And if I were in marketing all kinds of surveys, right? I don't think it's meaningful at all
[01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:47.680]   As state to state to your right. This was a marketing question. Not a product of all but a question. I'll bet anything
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:50.240]   Right, but what would a Chromebook Pro be for you
[01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:54.000]   Actually, the pixel is a Chromebook Pro, right?
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.800]   Yeah, plus lt
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:01.120]   I love my pixel. I think it's great, but you're right. It's missing that one feature lte
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:06.800]   It's also heavy. I'd love to see it as nice and robust and bulletproof. It is. It's still pretty heavy
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:08.880]   It would be nice to be a little lighter
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:14.320]   But with the same great screen the same great keyboard. I actually love the four by three aspect ratio of the pixel
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:18.400]   The nice thing is there are lots of good choices. Dell's now making an excellent Chromebook
[01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:20.000]   um
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:24.720]   Many companies are there's some really good Chromebooks out there and some of them even are not very expensive
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:28.240]   There's some high quality Chromebooks at 250 to 300 dollars. So
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:32.160]   Yeah, we looked at getting a Chromebook for my daughter as our first computer because
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:35.520]   We ended up passing out a Macbook error, but
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:38.400]   I know
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:41.120]   If you're nine, you'd be lucky to get a raspberry pie
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:48.080]   Yeah, she's she doesn't always realize how lucky she is with the hand me downs. I know hand me downs. Yeah, that's it
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:51.600]   That's it my my 13 year old stepson has a
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.760]   20
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:55.760]   probably a 2012
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:59.920]   Mac pro cheese grater running windows so he could play his steam games
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:02.560]   Wow, that's lucky
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.960]   I just lucky
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:13.600]   Hand me downs. It's the probably the only benefit to having a father who's a tech journalist or a mother who's a tech journalist
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:16.640]   Good. What does Brexit mean?
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:19.040]   Actually, jeff i've been dying to ask you this
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:22.160]   What does Brexit mean to all of these eu
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:30.000]   Suits against google and others in fact apparently the eu according to the journal is set to fat set to
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.320]   Set for issue fresh antitrust charges against google
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:40.480]   Yeah, I think you know, I was thinking about this and I was asked to write it up head
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:44.720]   You know blog post for an eu commissioner which I've kind of figured what it would be
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:49.760]   And I think what I would say is that it's a time for europe to make friends more than enemies
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.240]   I know that you'd expect me to say that but I think that um
[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:57.280]   given the break with um
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:03.600]   Uh, you know, the uk and god knows what's gonna happen there and it's just so trumpian
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:06.720]   Um and people don't email me for saying that
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:08.320]   Um
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:14.720]   But uh, I think the i think the european union could be more isolated the more they try to be the power broker and the tough guy
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.720]   um
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:18.720]   I personally believe that the west
[01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:26.000]   Success are gonna have whereas if they take the power they have to say how could we be collaborative and how could be the friendly people of europe rather than those
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.360]   Idiots in the uk that did what they just did. Uh, they'd be in a better position, but I don't know where it's gonna go
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.600]   It's just so wacky
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:36.800]   Margarit vestaya the uh, eu's anti-trust chief
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:45.920]   Who has already skewered google and is currently investigating for uh favoring its own shopping service and search results and for how it
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:49.760]   imposes
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:52.400]   restrictions on android phone manufacturers
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:59.760]   Says that she's advancing investigations into whether google is abusing its dominance with its advertising
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.000]   service
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.920]   Advertising is 90% of uh google's revenue of course
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:13.520]   At issue is whether the company prevents or obstructs website operators from placing ads on their website to compete with google's advertising business
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:21.200]   What that doesn't make sense. What are you saying if I use google ads since I can't use some other advertising
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.760]   Uh service of course I can well
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:30.000]   Well, you know the thing I've always said quietly and you know i'm google fanboy and all that but the one area where they are the most vulnerable
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.920]   Where they do have a monopoly is in advertising sales
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:36.480]   If you are an advertiser
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:40.640]   And you decide not to use google you have a tougher time in life. Oh really
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:46.800]   Yeah, I think so you mean in search results, uh, or well you're using
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:51.920]   Well, that's search results. Um, um, but but it's a double click and everything else
[01:45:51.920 --> 01:45:58.400]   You know google has a considerable hegemony over the ad business. It's better to be a google customer than not
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:46:06.000]   You know whether they use it properly or not is another question ftc closed a similar investigation in 2013
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:10.800]   After google committed to removing restrictions opposed on advertisers
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:15.040]   Trying to coordinate their online advertising campaigns across several platforms
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:20.400]   I'm reading from the wall street journal and the journal mentions that its parent company news corp
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:25.280]   Has filed formal complaints with the commission about google's business practices
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:30.880]   So there you go. Thank you for the disclaimer at the point at the end of the story
[01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:34.320]   Um
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.680]   Anything else we want to say before we wrap this thing up
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:42.960]   Can we talk about the AI that defeated, uh, the army not the army
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:49.840]   The jet jet pilot the alpha alpha AI. I thought that was like both kind of scary and cool
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:52.400]   Yeah, and what was it and what was it powered by?
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:54.320]   It was um
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:59.440]   It was a pilot AI developed by a grads a doctoral glad student from the university of sincinati
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:01.920]   Um and a virtual dogfight
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:07.440]   In a vert. Yeah, this is not a he's we're not real planes. It's not autonomous air force yet, but
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:13.840]   um, it was I think two us air force, uh, yeah retired us air force colonel
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:16.880]   um and a um
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:23.920]   An actual pilot a current pilot. I don't know. I mean, um, the kernel was a pilot. He is retired
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:30.000]   He's more like a battle tech technician. Okay. Tech tactician. They defeated several experts
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:34.000]   This is from let me let's go to the original the paper is from the journal of defense
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:41.440]   Management, which means I probably can't read it without, uh, I thought they were using a raspberry pie though. I thought you're no
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:43.600]   No
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:44.560]   Yeah
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:52.240]   genetic fuzzy based artificial intelligence for unmanned combat aerial vehicle control in simulated air combat missions
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:56.000]   Breakthroughs in genetic fuzzy systems
[01:47:56.480 --> 01:48:03.520]   So fuzzy logic, um, so it's it's this says it's breaking it breaks the tasks up and it
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.840]   Does it do statistical waiting in fuzzy logic? That's the question i'm trying to figure out
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:13.200]   Fuzzy is robust adaptable high performing computationally efficient and provides an excellent framework
[01:48:13.200 --> 01:48:17.360]   To synthesize formal models for the purposes of verification and validation
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:23.120]   However, today it suffers heavily from the quote curse of dimensionality end quote
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:30.320]   That is as the scope of the problem increases the computational cost of decreases rapidly. That's why by the way they chunked it up
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:35.840]   So this is not yet something you're going to put in an airplane and send it into the sky
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:44.000]   To beat the bad guys. It says a standard fuzzy based system would be extremely computationally intractable for a problem like air-to-air
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.520]   Combat, I guess they've made a breakthrough that makes it a little bit more
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:52.160]   uh, computationally inexpensive using a genetic fuzzy tree
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:58.240]   Got it, which sounds like a doctor's sous plant. It sounds like that plant with the yeah
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:02.400]   What can I get the Spanish dagger spanish dagger my my yukka
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:05.120]   Is a genetic fuzzy tree?
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:10.800]   Oh, and now I found a pdf a comparison of fuzzy Bayesian and weighted average. Oh, please
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:15.440]   Oh, I told you didn't I maybe you weren't here when I told you I bought a book because I want to learn about this
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:17.920]   Using python for machine learning
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:23.760]   And I literally even though I was reading it in the early evening went comatose after the first chapter. I was like
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:29.920]   So I'm going to recommend jeff hinton has oh, I like I like jesserah
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:34.880]   Yeah, so they've got he's got a corsera on convolutional neural nets. That's great
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:35.600]   Well, there you go
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:39.120]   And if you can find anything with yon lacoon who works at facebook
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:44.640]   Having yon explain how a machine learning network and unsupervised machine learning works
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:46.960]   Wow your brain is just like
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:50.000]   Oh, it's so awesome that I'm a journalist and I'm a stressed
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.480]   It's it's good. So I I encourage that because
[01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:59.600]   Or just take the corsera course with jac did you take the course?
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:06.560]   I took the first like part of it and there's an AMA actually his reddit AMA is actually really good. Okay
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:09.440]   So I would jeff hinton's
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:12.480]   Geo f f I think
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:14.960]   Let's see
[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:18.960]   My buddy. Yes je je je je o f f
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:27.440]   He's at the uh, he's a distinguished researcher at google. Yes. He's the google guy at the university of toronto
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:32.000]   Huh huh?
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:37.360]   So I put I put a link in the rundown because I saw this on reddit earlier and I didn't know it was it was in there
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:41.840]   Um, but I saw it because it they claim it was powered by razberry pie
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:48.480]   I wasn't kidding. Oh, um, so there's a new week article that actually claims that they were using razberry what this uh test
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:55.120]   That's even more scary. Are they the are they the five dollar pie zeros? Are they what?
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:51:00.720]   Oh, no, I'm sure these are the 35 dollar versions because it's they have quad core cps and
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:05.040]   Actually, we need like five hundred dollars to build an AI that can take out
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:12.160]   Well, hey, i'm all for it just put it a little plane and you know
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:15.760]   Send it up in a drone or something in the protector shores
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:20.400]   We'll have like enders game happening right right here in a few years
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:24.880]   Wow, oh no ender was an actual person never mind. Yeah, but he was
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:30.560]   He you know if you maybe maybe we could control him with a raspberry pie
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:35.440]   We could create it. We could call him ender. That's what they should call it ender
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:39.040]   Got alpha. It should have been ender. I'll call it ender. Riggins
[01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:46.800]   Okay. Wow. That's a wild story. That's amazing. Yeah, I mean I was looking at the the research pdf. They didn't mention
[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:50.080]   The fact that they were using razberry pie
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:54.160]   And that was in that was in real time that they were doing that they were
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:52:01.120]   Wow, that's what it's a has to be right it has to be in real time. How if it's a dog fight
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:03.520]   Yeah, it's real time
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:05.760]   Oh, it's just I think it's just a matter of time now
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:11.520]   Wow robots over
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:16.240]   Superful is your project a razberry pie fighter pilot this week, Aaron
[01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:18.240]   No
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:20.240]   Okay, can you work on that for next week?
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:24.320]   Yeah, I'll have it ready for uh for next one razberry pie powered
[01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:29.920]   Oh, you know, if you could download that code onto some pies run it on a drone
[01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:33.600]   You could have some really cool aerial battles happening. Look at that
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:37.760]   Doesn't seem possible
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:45.520]   By the way the uh the colonel said it was the first time he'd seen an AI consistently beat a human pilot in uh in tests
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:48.560]   US Air Force colonel jean lee
[01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:51.920]   Then it beat lee every
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:55.520]   Single time by the way this beats your vibe
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:58.560]   holy cow
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:00.640]   one of these
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:05.600]   Oh, that was too short only six seconds of excitement
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:09.360]   Wow
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:12.560]   All right, let's uh, let's wrap this thing up. It's time
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:18.160]   If anybody has a tip, why don't we start with you, Aaron? Because you brought us a little a little project here
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:24.240]   Yeah, I actually sent a video which is in the rundown because I know I'm not usually i'm in the studio, but I
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:27.840]   Was too late. No, that's fine kind of last minute for me today. So yeah, thank you
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:33.520]   Join we were sure we weren't sure if uh jeff would be able to get through but he's managed to do it anyway
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:37.440]   Oh, it says they're still processing the video. There's still processing
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:41.520]   There's another link below that I'll do the photos. Yeah, google photos. See if you can bring that up
[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:46.720]   Anyway, this is what it is. It's a project. I actually made for my son as part of one of his uh
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:50.640]   His things that he was doing for class and this is really simple
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:56.240]   It's very similar to the the 20 sided die that I brought in one time that told you what position it landed on
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:00.960]   Um, but all it is is a keypad. He keypads are real cheap. You can get him for a couple of bucks on ebay
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:08.080]   Um mounted to a little project box with the speaker inside and when you hit the code it actually will
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:11.760]   Uh, uh, do a message. Let's see if I can
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:15.360]   There it goes there's a message for you
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:16.800]   Got the box here
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:20.080]   You just put in the code and if you put in the correct code it plays whatever message you want
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:22.880]   And of course you can have multiple codes and multiple messages
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:28.640]   Um, but on the inside it's all powered by an Arduino. This one happens to be a pro mini
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:30.480]   It's very similar to the nano
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:34.320]   Uh, so it's uh, you know again very cheap three or four bucks on on ebay
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:40.080]   You can get these things and a sound module that when you get the correct code in it triggers the sound to play
[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:43.920]   Um, and that's it and you could easily modify this
[01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:48.640]   Um, that little sound module there again is probably about five bucks on ebay and it stores
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:51.440]   I think about two megabytes worth of
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:55.120]   Sound files and you can trigger those either through a serial
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:59.920]   Command back to that module or you can trigger it just by shorting a pin to ground
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:04.720]   And it'll play the first or second or third sound that's loaded on the uh on the board
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:09.680]   Um, and then the case was uh, you know, just a project case that we had I milled out
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:13.200]   Some little mounts for it and a hole for the led and all that
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:18.240]   Really simple project to do. Um, and uh, it works quite nicely
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:20.240]   Nice hand work there carol mare
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:22.320]   Yes, that's right. Why have to be vanna?
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:29.360]   You could also use this instead of uh, you know sending that signal to play a sound on that
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:32.880]   On that little board I showed you could also use this to
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:34.880]   We trigger a thermonuclear war
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:36.320]   Oh, okay
[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:40.000]   Well, that's actually the the advanced version of this will be in the white house in case
[01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.320]   Uh trump ever gets elected
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:45.120]   Um, just to trick him from his team
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:46.880]   Trump I haven't given you the code yet
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:50.400]   Hang around a little
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:55.440]   Um, no, but you could use this you could modify this really easily and put a servo instead of the mp3 player board
[01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:59.360]   I showed and you could have like a little electronic latch so you can make your own
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:05.760]   Uh combination lock for a box or for something or make something for the kids where they have to know the secret code in order to get
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:08.480]   Into their toy box or something like that. Uh, I like it
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:13.280]   Yeah, so there's a lot of really cool. It's like a starter project, but there's lots of really cool applications
[01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:19.200]   You can take it to next levels if you want to so, uh, have you posted the plans anywhere or did you find them anywhere?
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:22.480]   Not not yet. I just made it up, but I'll I'll put
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:25.760]   A few if you're interested in doing this self
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:30.240]   Reach out on twitter and I'll send you a link to to choose some instructions on how you can do it
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:32.320]   Aaron nukem. What's your twitter handle?
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:35.440]   Uh, erin nukem. Oh, that's either
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:38.800]   At erin nukem. Yep. Yeah, you know, jeff Jarvis who's in mexico city
[01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.480]   I meant to uh
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:43.040]   meant to ask you give you a chance if you want
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:46.640]   um, hilary clinton's campaign has released her
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:53.040]   Uh kind of policy paper for a technology and I was very impressed and I know you're uh,
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:57.520]   I haven't read yet. Yeah, i'm a clinton supporter. I have not read it yet. I'm eager to yeah
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:01.920]   I mean the problem of course I have is that it's easy to say anything
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:04.880]   um, but um
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:10.960]   It's what you do in office, but but but as since nobody's in office yet we have to decide
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.680]   Um from what they say they're going to do and this is pretty impressive including
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:21.360]   Uh, I think an understanding obviously she's got staffers who have a deep understanding of what some of the issues
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:27.680]   Are she wants to invest in computer science and stem education provide every student in american opportunity to learn
[01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:32.640]   computer science train up to 50,000 computer science teachers in the next
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:34.720]   uh decade
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:39.760]   Build a human talent pipeline for 21st century jobs is kind of what you were talking about uh stacy
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:45.760]   Uh open the higher education job trading landscape reboot job training running the street needs and job credentials
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:51.920]   A lot of this is aimed at by the way silicon valley and concerned silicon valley has about a a workforce that is not
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:53.760]   sufficient
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:55.760]   To provide the brains they need
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:02.400]   Diversify the tech workforce increase access to capital for growth oriented small businesses and startups of the focus on minority
[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:04.640]   women's and women and young entrepreneurs
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:10.400]   Uh defer student loans to help young entrepreneurs attract or retain top talent from around the world
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:17.360]   Uh, and I think she also talks about uh closing the digital divide in terms of uh bandwidth
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:22.320]   Uh and providing um something I've said for a long time
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:27.680]   Uh internet access as we had in the past provided electricity
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:32.960]   Uh to especially to rural areas through a government uh, uh, you know,
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:35.120]   internetification uh projects
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:37.680]   Reduce right now that go ahead
[01:58:37.680 --> 01:58:40.560]   I was going to say now that we have better technologies like the
[01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:45.840]   FCC's 5g plan keep an eye on that because that's going to help us get gigabit wireless
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:52.720]   Which will be way less costly to dig than fiber every she talks about that deploying 5g wireless and next generation uh wireless services
[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:57.440]   Connect more anchor institutions high speed internet. I mean all of this these are all the right words
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:59:00.080]   Absolutely fight for an open internet abroad
[01:59:00.080 --> 01:59:04.560]   Go ahead jeff
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:08.960]   I got a great plan
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:12.240]   I'm smarter
[01:59:12.240 --> 01:59:16.480]   Defending that neutrality improves the patent system to reward innovators
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:19.760]   Uh reduce excessive patent litigation
[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:26.960]   Uh effective copyright policy and of course there's going to be some IP stuff in here that uh, some of us may not be thrilled about but
[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:31.360]   You know, uh some security stuff, you know, anti-stoating stuff
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:35.680]   Yeah, but I like this protect online privacy as well as security
[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:41.680]   Clinton rejects the false choice between privacy interest and keeping americans safe. That's going to be an interesting uh
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:47.680]   Uh, not to react. I reject that too, but yeah, but how do you what the devil's in the details exactly
[01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:53.840]   Make couple government simpler more friendly transform government services. There's a lot of good stuff in here
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:56.400]   I know it's worth reading. It's long and there's a lot of information
[01:59:56.400 --> 02:00:03.120]   But there needs to be long because I think there's a lot of detail in here and uh, I think the key on this is uh, if she is elected president
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:08.800]   And I think she will be uh keeping this document in front of us and and holding her feet to the fire and saying okay
[02:00:08.800 --> 02:00:10.880]   Is what you promised?
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:12.880]   Let's see that uh, you do it
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:15.840]   jeff you have a number for us
[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:21.120]   Well first, um, uh on my twitter feed. I give you the scene where I am calling this
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:25.040]   I thought you were in your hotel room. Would you decide to go out late at night?
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:30.720]   I keep I kick on the fly. No, I'm not that I'm out of the uh, the courtyard here with a pool
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:33.440]   Uh, and i'm on the fly with a better Wi-Fi
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:40.480]   But now this looks like a murder scene, but in fact she is a model and they are uh, they're taking her picture not shooting her
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:46.560]   Yes, yes, and I just treated another one where there's tim jarmus standing behind her. What? Jim jarmus is there
[02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:51.360]   I like your i like your pool side. Uh, this is where you are right now
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:57.680]   Yeah, dude a little survey, so dude. That's why are you talking to us? Yeah, really?
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:01.840]   I know that's not that's how kind of kid it. I have not felt foolish. I am
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:04.880]   so, uh
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:08.400]   Number so in I won't blame you for a little distracted jeff
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:11.760]   Yeah
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:15.520]   Well, you but you can't stare, you know, no, you can't that would be wrong. Um
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:18.720]   so, uh
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:20.080]   in her
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:22.080]   keynote at vidcon
[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:29.360]   Uh to youtube ceo Susan will just keep it up a swine that said and I quote 40 percent of letio say youtube creators
[02:01:29.360 --> 02:01:32.640]   Understand them better than their friends. Wow
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:38.960]   Wow, they say that I saw that's depressing. I saw people
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:42.560]   Yeah, I guess teenagers have always thought that
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:45.920]   Yeah, and some of them are quite cute and wholesome, right?
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:50.720]   Yeah, I always I always thought micky dolans understood me better than my friends
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:54.320]   Well, it's also if you're a geek and aren't we all
[02:01:54.320 --> 02:01:59.760]   That's a place youtube is a place where you can find people like you people who do you know
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:04.000]   It would be empathetic to you would understand you when you feel connected you know what that is really true
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:08.560]   If you're a geek you probably don't have a lot of geek friends, but you can go online and find those geek friends
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:14.720]   Okay, wait youtube is not just for geeks. I go on there for makeup tutorials and hair stuff all the time by the way
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:18.160]   It's working beautifully. Oh, yes, no
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:25.360]   But if you want to learn how to make up me. I wait a minute. You're nine year old you're making you're having her look at makeup and
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:32.240]   The makeup is for me because like I was a geek and I had no idea how to really do makeup still don't but you know
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:33.200]   I'm getting there
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:39.440]   Um, but for she's got really long hair and so we do like these I did a elsa hairdo with her because she really wanted one
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:42.160]   After frozen came out. Oh
[02:02:42.400 --> 02:02:44.400]   It's a thing and then you see all these
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:48.720]   Anyway, you can learn french braids you can learn how to do
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:54.000]   Yeah, yeah, uh, youtube's great for that. I agree 100%
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.480]   I just you know, I wouldn't want people to think it's only for you
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:02.880]   But do you well, let me ask you stacey do you think your youtube friends understand you better than your real life friends?
[02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:05.840]   So I don't have youtube friends
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.560]   I'm your youtube friend. I'm your internet
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:17.840]   We've never met but i'll be your internet friend
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:23.760]   We have never met leo. Isn't that weird? Are my internet friend. Yeah, we'll meet someday
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:27.600]   Someday, we'll all go to mexico city
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:30.880]   Why is jim jar moush at the pool there?
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:34.240]   Who is your speaking as the same comfort great director
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:38.400]   Yeah, film maker not yeah more film maker

[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:53.760]   When you walk they spin
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:55.760]   Dollars at target
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:01.440]   For everyone are you gonna wear them on monday? Oh heck. Yeah, we have a big fourth of july party and
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:04.000]   Like at your house at our house
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:07.920]   We have you're about to see because i'm going to show you for the thing i'm showing you
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:11.440]   You allowed to do safe and sane fireworks in your neck of the woods
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:18.320]   So we have this rooftop deck that overlooks the austin country clubs fireworks perfect
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:24.240]   Yes, and basically it's really beautiful because like all the people are out in the lake
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:30.080]   Under next to the country club so that you get the boats on the water and their lights and then you get the fireworks above you
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:32.560]   It's super awesome
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:37.840]   And lest by the way, lest you think that the what kind of fireworks could the austin country clubs
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:39.840]   offer here from
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:43.120]   2014 the fireworks over lake austin
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:45.760]   You're gonna get in that you're gonna have fun
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:51.200]   They're like literally at eye level like i'm not even a mile away. Yeah, it's it's awesome
[02:04:51.200 --> 02:04:52.720]   They're so we have a party
[02:04:52.720 --> 02:04:56.640]   um, i would love to do this as my tip and show you so what i'm
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:59.920]   What i'm doing is i set up the
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:05.360]   Arlo the net gear arlo cameras because i'm doing a thing where i'm testing outdoor cameras
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:08.400]   This one isn't set up obviously because it's still got the thing on um
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:14.080]   Now i will say that these just had a security issue that was a big deal on reddit
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:16.720]   That's not the one those aren't the cameras where the guy
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:22.480]   Set it back and then the the next guy had it and he was able to watch the next guys
[02:05:22.480 --> 02:05:25.200]   Through the camera. That's the one
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:29.200]   Have they fixed that yet?
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:33.840]   So what the so here's here's the scapegoating that's happening there is there like well
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:39.120]   When when someone returns them the retailer is not supposed to sell them
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:42.320]   Oh put it back on the shelf that makes sense and that's what happens
[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:45.200]   They're supposed to send it back to net gear for reset. Yeah, right?
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:48.000]   So i'm like
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:53.520]   I want fewer chains. I want fewer like possible weak links in my chain or fewer links in my
[02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:57.840]   Be weak. Yeah, that's yeah, so but i still like the camera
[02:05:57.840 --> 02:06:00.720]   Minor brand new from net gear. So
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:04.320]   Maybe you should buy them online. Yeah
[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:09.920]   These are this is actually so i my camera pack came with four of these in a base station
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:16.720]   I don't really love that they have a base station that I have to use a port for but I do like these cameras. This is maybe
[02:06:16.720 --> 02:06:24.720]   Maybe 1.2 pounds probably i'm trying to see have you used the drop cams or as they call them nest cams now do they
[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:27.920]   I use the drop cams how do they compare um
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:32.080]   The drop kit this is oh, oh, here's what's key. This is wireless
[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:38.000]   In this indoor and outdoor. Yeah, these are to me a totally different use. Yeah, drop cams can't be used outdoors
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.440]   They can't be used outdoors and they're wired. Yeah, um, so
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:45.840]   It comes with this magnetic mount. I actually just
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:53.760]   Stuck I have silver railings and I just stuck these on the railings and they've so far been up through a rainstorm and some decent winds
[02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:54.880]   Wow
[02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:56.000]   Outside
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.440]   The magnetic mount comes with like a little keyhole thing in the back
[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:03.040]   So you could just stick it we're gonna stick a nail in one of the trees and just
[02:07:03.040 --> 02:07:07.440]   Dunk it on there for the other side of the house and here's what the camera looks like
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:09.840]   So you guys can see
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:12.880]   Um, I don't love the app. I'm gonna be honest here. I'm
[02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:16.480]   Let's see. Is it too bright for y'all still? Yeah, it's too bright. Hold it. Yeah
[02:07:16.480 --> 02:07:19.360]   Okay
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:20.800]   Okay
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:24.880]   Let's get my text out of the way. Oh, let me set up the camera so you can see
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:27.680]   um
[02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:29.520]   and it's
[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:34.400]   It takes a minute for it to like load it's got motion sensing all that other good stuff
[02:07:34.400 --> 02:07:41.440]   So here is it's still loading. Do they need power or when you say wireless? Do they not need their battery powered?
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:48.080]   So the bottom camera is working. This one's still trying to load. So they're battery powered. They're battery powered nice
[02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:54.080]   Um and presumably they'll last what a month two months. I mean, they're not on all the time, right?
[02:07:54.080 --> 02:07:56.960]   That's why it's starting up because it has to come. Yeah. Oh
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:01.920]   That camera failed to work. Well, press it again. Maybe it'll I am
[02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:07.040]   But that's how that's how these battery cameras work. They can't stay on all the time. Otherwise they die very
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:10.320]   But they do have a motion sensor. So there's there's oh there you go
[02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:12.800]   nice
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:16.640]   Wow, you're gonna have a good view of the fireworks. That's that's why we have the party
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:20.720]   I was actually looking for I shared it with kevin
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:24.640]   I was looking for a place to like show it publicly like to share that camera publicly
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:27.120]   During the fireworks because I thought yeah, super fun
[02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:34.000]   You should but I can't if he wants dream it to us and we'll show it there you go. We got more bandwidth than god now
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:39.040]   Indeed. Yeah, I think dang for that. Yeah, so I I like these
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:46.320]   Um so far. I'm actually going to be testing a bunch of these out over the next couple of months because i'm in the market for
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:52.960]   This and I get a lot of questions about outdoor kind of capable security cameras. This is a huge category
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:56.560]   Yeah, it is and I put them on the roof because during our party
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:09:02.640]   We often get kids trying to climb those railings and it's a tall drop if they go over so I'd like to be able to see
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:10.880]   I ordered a and it doesn't come yet and I ordered it a long time ago a weather station that has a built-in cam
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:15.200]   Huh, and then it uh it makes it public
[02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:18.320]   Uh and makes a time lapse of your locale
[02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:20.000]   locale
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.680]   public
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:26.720]   So that's so you can I can go see my neighborhood. I can go see downtown, New York
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:29.440]   The name of that is
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:32.320]   Um while i'm while i'm trying to find the name of that have you used the ero?
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:36.000]   Wi-fi devices yet. I'm on them now
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:40.320]   I I actually bought them for my house. I liked them. They're so expensive
[02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:48.560]   So yeah, the lumas out and then there's a new system called plum that's coming out. I'm waiting for my lumas. I pre-ordered the lumas
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:55.280]   Check out plum. That's a really interesting model. They're they're actually just the radios and instead of uh
[02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:59.440]   Processor on the on the box. It's actually all in the cloud
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:02.960]   So the ero is like 500 bucks for three units
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:07.040]   400 bucks for the luma and the plum is how much
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:10.960]   Ooh last I would guess
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:14.880]   It's well, it's a different thing and so
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:20.560]   The theory the theory of all of these is is they make it easier to do Wi-Fi extenders, right?
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:28.320]   Um, so they're not Wi-Fi extenders. There's actually they're actually a Wi-Fi mesh. It's a mesh. It's not plum. I'm sure. Oh, yeah
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:29.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:34.880]   Forgive me plum is a light switch. That's a Wi-Fi light switch. The IOT is getting to you now
[02:10:34.880 --> 02:10:37.680]   There's too much IOT
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:41.680]   That that is true. So I but I I had I've actually had two ear
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:48.400]   This is my third ear of the first one I got was paired to somebody else and you have to get the person who originally used it to deactivate it
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:50.240]   Kind of like that camera
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:54.400]   Yes, but that was a review unit and they obviously said it to a some other journalist first
[02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:56.720]   So the second unit I got I never got it to work
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:11:00.240]   I had to put all three units in the same room, which doesn't really create much of a mesh
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:04.240]   But I but they said please try one more time
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:09.200]   We we must have given you a bad unit so I tried one more time and you know what wow
[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:12.480]   It really does work
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:15.680]   Yeah, I don't know if it's worth $500
[02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:19.920]   But we have a very challenging house and it and lisa
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:25.600]   Who drives me crazy all the time saying the internet doesn't work god damn it. I thought you were the tech guy
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:31.200]   She's nicer about it, but that's the that's what I hear she goes honey. The internet's down and I hear all right
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:35.200]   I have that voice too. She's happy
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:39.280]   She's the first time I've ever seen her say wow it's been working everywhere super fast
[02:11:40.080 --> 02:11:45.680]   So I'm I'm now gonna revise my opinion of the hero. I was wondering if you tried it. So you like you're on it
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:51.920]   I'm on it. And incidentally normally on a Wi-Fi. Are you you not a Wi-Fi though? I am on Wi-Fi Leo
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:56.960]   Okay, well carsten move out for we don't let people do his Wi-Fi because it's so terrible
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:59.920]   I wasn't gonna tell you well, but you can
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:06.320]   Because this works great. You haven't had a single dropout. It does now. I will say here's the caveats
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:09.040]   my heroes
[02:12:09.120 --> 02:12:12.000]   Are on a land so each hero is plugged into the land
[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.800]   If you have your heroes
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:18.160]   Doing okay, there's words for this and I'm gonna mess them up
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:26.720]   Minor not on a lamb. I have a base unit and then I have extenders for every hop you're gonna lose a little bit of capacity
[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:28.880]   That's the way it is in life
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:30.880]   But it's not like an extender
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:35.120]   For every hop you take in life you lose a little capacity
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:37.360]   That that is true. Yes
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:39.360]   Wait, is that shots or hops?
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:44.240]   But anyway, these these are working really well
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:47.040]   So each one of them is plugged into the a wired internet
[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:50.080]   Yeah, because I built my house in 2013 so I have it for the
[02:12:50.080 --> 02:12:54.000]   But they're still meshing
[02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000]   They are still meshing
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.240]   and
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:02.080]   All of the new mesh routers are gonna work pretty much the same is
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:05.200]   Kind of my understanding. The plume is a little bit different
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:07.920]   Yeah, but we can go into that if you try those
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:12.480]   We'll get reviews as you try the various things I have the luma on order as well
[02:13:12.480 --> 02:13:16.960]   But I was very I'm very pleased that the hero worked so well this by the way is the bloom sky is the
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:20.960]   I'm gonna put this on my roof. It's the camera with a weather station
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:24.080]   So you can see people's time lapses and they have an app
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:27.760]   So you can see people's time lapses if they if you share them
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:33.680]   Can you get the temperature data? Yeah, it's a little weather station that also streams
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:36.720]   And you don't need to have
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:38.560]   The weather station to use the app
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:41.520]   But I ordered the weather station so that I could be
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:44.800]   We're gonna I want to put this on the new studio on the roof of the new studio
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:47.760]   So you can see what the weather also runs on battery
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:51.760]   Uh, that's a good question. I guess it does. How does it do it?
[02:13:51.760 --> 02:13:55.600]   How do it work? I don't see it. Oh, no, there's a little
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:59.520]   Power over ethernet maybe oh no solar see that that's a solar panel
[02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:03.360]   Oh, yeah, go solar would solar baby
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:06.640]   That's super efficient solar baby
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:11.040]   Isn't that you see a ring doorbell added a solar panel. Yes
[02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:15.280]   We even have a deal for our uh, our uh, listeners, but I
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:20.000]   I'll save that for another show because we're running out of time. I got one more thing one more thing to show you
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.080]   I'm this comes from kitzi
[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:25.040]   uh real name christian that is tofsky
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:31.120]   If the biggest problem with speech interfaces is remembering what the syntax is and what things it can do
[02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:37.120]   I have to say alexa has improved considerably the alexa store. This is for google
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:40.880]   Uh, okay google folks. This is a website
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:43.760]   Okay, dash google.io
[02:14:43.760 --> 02:14:45.920]   that lists
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:47.520]   all of them
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:53.280]   All the google commands so you can play with them you can get to know them in one place
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:56.080]   Which you'd think google would have done
[02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:01.520]   What does it say the tip is I wonder what its tip big rate was did you see that one which
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:07.920]   Said what what's the tip? Uh, it was under under math probably right math or conversion conversion. What's the tip?
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:10.800]   Uh, what's the tip for 60? I don't know
[02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:16.000]   What do you think the rate is? Is that what you're saying? Yeah, is it like tipping at 20 or 15?
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.240]   Well, you just try it and let me know
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:20.080]   I was gonna say
[02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:22.080]   I think what it does is gives you a choice
[02:15:22.080 --> 02:15:23.840]   Oh
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:27.680]   But this is cool. Isn't it and and by the way, he's really into
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:32.640]   Yeah, this is like a react.js site. So he's really into all the kind of stuff
[02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:34.960]   So as you hover the mouse around things happen and
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:39.280]   It's kind of fun. I don't know. I just I kind of like it google
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:43.920]   I like that because I always forget yeah, uh, you know, I forgot about a skew for example
[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:46.000]   If you do okay google and then say a skew
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:51.440]   It gives you the definition for a skew, but as it does it it turns your web page slightly sideways
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:55.280]   S K e w just hilarious. Wow. Yeah. Wow
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:16:00.080]   So these are these are obviously for the I think for the phone one this doesn't have those those
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:05.760]   Easter eggs in it, but it's handy. Okay - google.io and kitzie. Would you now write one?
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:10.320]   For Alexa for echo, please because I can't remember what I can ask my echo
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:14.800]   Oh, and yeah, well, we'll talk about it next week. Yeah, you want it next week
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:17.440]   Will you come back and join us next week?
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:24.160]   Me? Yes, please. I will be here. Please. Jeff Jarvis. Will you be back in town next week?
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:30.000]   I reschedule the trip around so by god, I'm gonna be whole. Oh, you don't have to reason
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000]   I know summer times you travel time
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:42.000]   I'm I'm travel up there. All right. Yeah, I bet you are well enjoy your surveys and the view and say hi to Jim jar mooch for me
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:49.200]   Will do all right. Jeff Jarvis is at the city university arc where he teaches during the uh during the class year
