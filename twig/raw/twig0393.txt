[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Jeff's here, Stacey's here. Lots to talk about. What did Mark Zuckerberg's 6,000 word letter to the Facebook family mean?
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Ben Thompson says Mark wants to take over the world. Jeff disagrees. We're gonna have a little debate over that.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   And Jeff doesn't like that new Chromebook that I like so much. The Samsung Chromebook plus the debate about that as well.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Plus Stacey has a new browser that will change the lights in your room. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   This is Twig.

[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google. Show where we cover...
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I don't even know what to say these days. Everything.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   In the media, in the Google, in the Internet of Things. Thank goodness we have Stacey Higginbotham here.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   She covers I-O-T on her podcast, Stacey on I-O-T, and I-O-Tpodcast.com.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And she joins us from Austin, Texas, the most gerrymandered county in the country, apparently.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Oh, yeah. We are. I live in this tiny little sub-segment that goes all the way up to Waco.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   You're in a blue slice.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Oh, no. I am in the red slice.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   You're in a red slice, okay.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Jeff Jarvis, he's in New Jersey. There's no color you can apply to Jersey.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I'm in a red slice. He's in a red slice, too, from BuzzMashine.com.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York. Author of one.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Our governor is up for a job on sports radio in New York.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   You're talking about what's his name?
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Christie.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Chris Christie. He'd be great at sports radio.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   He'd be great. It's a bit of a come-down from the job he was hoping to get, but it's...
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I think sports talks pretty good.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Actually, that brings me to Ben Thompson's great article in Stratecary today.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Ben is really a great and insightful analyst.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   We've had him on many times on this show and on Twit.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   His piece actually from yesterday, Manifesto's and Monopolies is his discussion of Mark Zuckerberg's
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   6,000 words "screed" on Facebook as to what the new Facebook mission statement was.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Facebook went from a one-sentence mission statement to a 5,000-statement mission, 5,000-sentence.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   But the line here that I thought was very interesting is kind of germane to our speculation that Mark Zuckerberg might be,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   you know, interested in political office.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And he points out that Zuckerberg, as the CEO of Facebook, has probably a much better bully pulpit
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   than any president. Let me read you the paragraph.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Given this reality, Ben Thompson writes,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   "Why would Zuckerberg want to be president? He's not only CEO of Facebook.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   He's the dominant shareholders, well, answerable to no one.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   His power and ability to influence is greater than any president, subject to political reality and checks and balances.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Besides, as Zuckerberg made clear last week, his concern is not a mere country,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   but rather the entire world."
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   All right, he's president of the globe.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Yeah, I got... I put like four more reactions to Zuckerberg's essay on the rundown,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   and they all pissed me off.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Because if Zuck sat back and just said,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   "You know, I just want a business. I don't give a crap about the world."
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Sorry about that.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   You know, that's all I do is run a business, tech with all you all.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Then we'd be smashing them like crazy.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Oh, and he said all along when he kind of sheepishly and self-deprecatingly said,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   "Oh, we didn't throw... we didn't change the results of the average show."
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Yeah, he's always done that much power.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Yeah, but he's always said he cares about a connected world,
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   and that connected world's a better world. He's always had that mission.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Right.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And so now he goes into more depth about it and more detail about what he wants to do and where he thinks he can help.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   And everybody smashes him.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   This passion for trying to take over the world that was one theme.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And the other theme, of course, was journalists feeling terribly entitled.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Emily Bell at Columbia, I thought, you need to know all the tech companies.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I didn't begin.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   All the tech companies should give a billion dollars each to some fund to pay for journalists.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   No, they should be helping to strategically.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And Steve Waldman, who's a friend of mine, wrote a piece of the New York Times saying basically the same thing.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   And I'm tearing my hair out because then somebody else just wrote a piece of something for getting into it.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Charlie Beckett from London School of Economics wrote a piece saying,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   "Whoa, if you're going to demand they give away money, which is pretty cheeky as is,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   why should they give it away to journalism? Why not health? Why not saving lives? Why not other things?"
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   You know, who's to say that we're so entitled and that they owe us anything?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   They don't owe journalism crap. They owe the public a lot.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   They don't owe journalism anything.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Well, okay. So that aside, Zuckerberg, I tried to read the 6,000 words.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It seemed like a lot of, I couldn't quite get through the whole thing.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Daisy, did you make it?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   No, three quarters of the way.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Whatever you started talking about, civility.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Oh, I was like, oh, stuff in there.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   She just screamed "F" you and stormed away.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   It was a lot of, it was a whole bunch of abilities.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I said you needed an editor.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Yeah, that's what I said.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   He did. It could have probably said the whole thing in a pair of,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   but what Ben Thompson points out is that is the global aspirations that Zuckerberg's talking about here, right?
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I mean, and of course, that's Facebook is a global company.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It's not an American company anymore.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   It's a global--
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   So was Exxon, you know, so was Walmart.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   But I thought what was interesting and actually the upshot of Ben's article is we should be worried about Facebook
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   and we should do what we can to reduce its growing influence.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   For instance, it should be prohibited, and I'm not sure I disagree with this.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It should be prohibited from buying companies like WhatsApp and Instagram
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   or any social media companies because that just boosts its network, you know, its graph.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   That's the--
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   We have laws about that. We have anti-trust laws about that.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And it really is an anti-trust-- because he says, and it may be too late to stop Facebook at this point
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   because their social graph is so massive and everybody's in it
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   that no one else can get a word in edge-wise in effect.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And anybody who does--
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   That's weak.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Like Instagram or WhatsApp, Facebook just goes, yeah, we'll take that.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   22 billion, no big deal.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And now when you're on Instagram, you're on Facebook.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   When you're on WhatsApp, you're on Facebook, really?
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And next week, we'll have stories claiming that the Facebook's over.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It's over. Everybody's on it.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Well, he's responding to that, though.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And by the way, the article-- I think there's a very good case to be made
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   and there's certainly numbers to back it up that Snapchat, which is about to go public, snap,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   is actually at its peak and in fact, Instagram, as soon as they started doing stories,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   started to eat away at Snapchat's audience.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   And that Snapchat may be on the way out just because Instagram has the--
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   Again, has the social graph.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Stacey, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   No, I was actually just going to-- one, everybody's always too big
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   and no one else can get-- like, once a company reaches a certain size,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   that's kind of an accepted argument.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   But I don't know if you know this, Jeff, but it's the Herfindahl Hirschman index.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I know that applies to mobile companies, but has the FTC ever applied it to any social media M&A?
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   What is it? Tell us what that index is.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   What's that? I don't know what that is.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Oh, OK. It's a market share index.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   The only reason I know about it is because we talk about it a lot in wireless
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   or like when the carriers are doing M&A.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And I have no idea if it applies because I'm not an antitrust lawyer.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   So this would be the FTC in the US Department of Justice, I guess.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   It measures market concentration.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Yes.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It's calculated by squaring the market share of each firm competing in the market
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   than summing the resulting numbers.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   [laughs]
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   And actually, the Department of Justice uses this to pinpoint merger issues.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   You know.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Well, when you were talking about buying, I mean,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   because what you're essentially making is kind of an antitrust market power argument
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   against these guys, right?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   In social media.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Yes.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And so if you can't buy like to art to say, now the problem is these are private companies,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   so I don't think the DOJ gets to say.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   But Facebook's not private.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   Yeah, Facebook's not private now.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   So I don't, this is something to pose to someone far smarter than I am, but I was just curious
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   if there was a there there or a way to prevent market power.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Thompson says it's terrifying.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Given their power, he wrote this last year, given their power over what users see Facebook
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   could, if it choose be the most potent political force in the world, of course, it doesn't
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   do that because, you know, that becomes, then it becomes a real problem.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   There'll be a furor over this.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   And so Facebook has strong, instead of not to become overtly political.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I was at a roundtable of media executives and Facebook last week.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   It was off the record, so I can't, you know, go into details.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   But I was very, I mean, I'm impressed about how careful Facebook is about that.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And there were times when the funny thing about it was the media people were pushing Facebook
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   saying, you know, people are wrong about that.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Just correct them.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Just do it.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Just fix it.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Just make them smarter.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And we can't do it.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Oh, no.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   I mean, you know, and they...
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Fake news argument rebound, by the way, in a very damaging way.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And it's now being used incorrectly, in my opinion, to tar all media.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   By Donald Trump.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   It turned out to be...
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   And I was a little...
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   I have to say, I was a little concerned about this, this super...
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Okay, of false news, because it had this little tint of...
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Well, it's false news because it's against what I believe in.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   You know, it was already had that seed, and now that seed has been planted and bloomed.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And now...
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   How many things fake news that disagrees with me?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Exactly.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Exactly.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   So fake news...
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   I said in a piece I wrote this week that we're stuck in a paradoxical loop.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   We can't use that phrase anymore, I would submit.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Right.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   No, no, you can't roll.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   It never should have.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   It's propaganda lies and fraud.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   There's three separate things.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   There's propaganda lies and fraud.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   That's good, I like it.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Claire Wardell, who's the head of the first draft coalition, is just brilliant.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And it's a coalition of a bunch of news organizations.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Google started funding that Night did, Facebook did.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   She put up, I don't have it.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Let me have it handy.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   It's a taxonomy of...
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Oh damn, no, it's on Twitter.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   I'm upset.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.400]   She has a taxonomy of fakery from simple mistakes up to full fledged fraud and different motives
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.400]   for each one.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.400]   Yeah, fake news is ridiculous.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:27.000]   And now it's used so that anything that one side disagrees with, it's just fake news.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Let me go on though.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   This is what Ben says.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   This is why, you know, going back to...
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.440]   As you said, Facebook's now very sensitive about not, you know, about staying completely
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.440]   neutral.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:43.320]   And really, as I've always said, it's only motivation is the simple financial motivation
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.440]   to improve engagement.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.640]   Of course, that leads to filter bubbles.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.440]   But he says, "This is why I read Zuckerberg's Manifesta with such alarm.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:55.160]   Zuckerberg not only gives his perspective on how the world is changing and at least in
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.160]   passing some small admission that Facebook's focus on engagement may have driven things
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.440]   like filter bubbles and fake news.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.240]   But this is the worrisome part from Ben's point of view.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.980]   For the first time, explicitly commits Facebook to playing a central role in affecting that
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:15.880]   change in a manner that aligns with Zuckerberg's personal views of the world.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:21.840]   It is a manifesto building global community based on Mark's personal vision of what the
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.040]   world should be.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.040]   Okay.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.640]   So this is, that's like what every newspaper in the world is built on.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.640]   Exactly.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.080]   These newspapers don't have the power that Facebook does.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.880]   At what point in time they did?
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.880]   Well, I know.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.880]   I mean, Hirsch was able to start a Spanish American war.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.400]   There is no such thing as objective anything.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.680]   I mean, if we're talking about humans, there's no such thing as objective.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.160]   But in the other, in the old days there, at least we're multiple newspapers and multiple
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.160]   voices.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.280]   And Facebook enables more voices than we've ever had in the history of mankind.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.080]   So people don't follow them.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.080]   Just like they didn't subscribe to the competing newspapers.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.080]   Exactly.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.080]   Bingo.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.080]   Sorry.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.080]   Stacy.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.080]   Jeff and I almost never agree so strongly.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.480]   I'm like, especially about journalism.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.080]   Stacy's now very worried.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.080]   Like what is happening?
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.080]   Hold on.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:22.160]   And one of the things, one of the things that Ben is arguing for is, you know, he,
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.680]   Zuck says that, you know, progress now requires humanity coming together, not just as cities
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.040]   or nations, but as a global community.
[00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.640]   This is, you know, new world order stuff, the global community.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:39.160]   There's just one problem says Ben, first he may be wrong.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.720]   It's just as plausible to argue that the ultimate end state of the internet revolution
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:50.040]   is a devolution of power to smaller, more responsive, self selected entities, local
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.040]   government.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.040]   Well, not necessarily geographically local, but local to interest.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.640]   And Facebook is a platform for Josh that as well.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.480]   Facebook is a platform where you can find people who are like you.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.680]   You can speak, thus be found, find, organize, and act.
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:08.360]   Well, so you're going to dispute this, this key sentence then because Ben believes he's
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:14.720]   proven that Mark wants to kind of get involved in global governance.
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.200]   In other words, Mark, he's saying Mark doesn't want to be president.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.720]   He wants to be president of the world.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:23.720]   That's the worst conspiracy theory language trilateral commission.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   Yeah, it is.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.320]   He says even if Zuckerberg is right, that it's all about global community, is there anyone
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.960]   who believes that a private company, well, that's not really true, but I guess it's private
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:39.200]   in the sense it's mostly owned by Mark Zuckerberg, run by an unaccountable, all powerful person
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.280]   that tracks your every move for the purposes selling advertising is the best possible form
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.720]   said global governance should take.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.960]   So you would dispute that notion that Mark wants to rule the world.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.240]   Yes, A, B, it's not global governance.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.960]   It's a platform that people can do whatever they want.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:01.720]   But didn't his letter kind of imply that, hey, we can use Facebook for global governance
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:07.880]   or some sort of- No, we can use Facebook to connect people better in the civic dialogue.
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.880]   It's so, she's right.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.560]   It's exactly the same argument the journalism made for years is that we drive civic engagement.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.200]   We get you to care about your world, do something about it.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   That's all he's arguing.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   And then the journalist who knows it.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   He knows.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   Hey, that's our job.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   Don't take that away.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   Right.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.000]   He actually talked about things like with site search and raising money.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.240]   So that goes beyond a conversation in enabling people to take action.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.760]   So I suppose if you look at it, it's like a government's providing a service.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:33.120]   He's providing some services.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.680]   Yeah, he'd like to.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:40.600]   He'd like to, for instance, with internet.org, provide internet to a billion or two people
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.000]   who don't have internet right now.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.440]   And the internet and his vision is primarily Facebook.
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.400]   The internet and a lot of people's vision is Facebook.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.040]   I know that's where it is.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.400]   Yeah, so well, a lot of users you mean.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   Yes.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.400]   So this is normal.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.880]   But you know, boy, that's how AOL was in the early days, right?
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.880]   It was the internet.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:05.080]   So I'm talking to some Google folks lately and I sense that they're engaging in Shaden
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:14.200]   and the writer that they said German word time and the shameful joy in the, in the, in
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.840]   the disappointment of others in the, in the misfortune of.
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:22.000]   And so Google was on the, Google was on the hot seat for a couple of years.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.640]   Google was the internet and Eric Schmidt said this.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.000]   Anytime the internet's going to become white about Google is going to be complaining
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.640]   because we're the largest thing on it.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.640]   Everybody's going to go after Google and they did.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.480]   And the last two were short-threat and all this stuff came along now because of the fake
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.480]   news thing.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.040]   Suddenly Facebook is on the hot scene.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.280]   Google's saying, whoo hoo, it is.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:46.560]   You know, they're loving it because all of the privacy arguments, all this stuff now is
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.120]   not about Google, which it used to be.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.600]   It's all about Facebook, right?
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.600]   Facebook has taken a lot of heat up.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.600]   But it's the same, but they had the same problem.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.120]   If Google had the same problem, Google was taking over the world now, Facebook's taking
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.680]   over the world, Microsoft was taking over the world before then.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:17:59.680]   So you, okay.
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:05.080]   So you guys, Stacey and Jeff, it's your opinion that there's nothing.
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.000]   First of all, congratulations on having read the almost entirety of Mark's comments.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.960]   It's like, oh, Jeff.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.680]   As far as I read, all I just seemed like marketing gobbledygook to me.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:24.960]   It was very difficult for me to tease any, you know, initiatives out of it.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.040]   Were there initiatives in there?
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.200]   I mean, Ben saying the initiative is global government.
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.760]   Oh, yes.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:33.080]   I don't know if that's just a smart guy, but BS.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.360]   Again, that's trilateral commission talk.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:37.200]   That's anti-globalism talk.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.280]   It's not only a global, global now, but somebody's going to take over the globe.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.360]   Well, he does.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:47.080]   And I left out the first few paragraphs, which really set the stage for all of this.
[00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.600]   And I thought these were quite insightful.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.280]   He's very, very well written, very smart, but I think he's wrong.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:19:01.360]   He says that in his little cartoony way, in the old world, somebody made something and
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.960]   sold it to a consumer.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:08.680]   Of course, in the industrial era, it got sliced up into three slices, manufacturing
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.720]   or content creation and then distribution and then consumers.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.720]   But what's happened in the internet era is this whole distribution thing has become not
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.160]   only commoditized but devalued.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:26.720]   So, the fundamental impact of the internet is to make distribution itself a cheap commodity
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.520]   or in the case of digital content completely free.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.840]   By the way, that's what Twit Piggybacks itself on.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.000]   We can reach our audience directly because distribution is effectively free.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.800]   He says that's why I've long argued the internet revolution is as momentous as the industrial
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.160]   revolution.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.840]   And then he gets Gutenberg.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:50.680]   Gutenberg baby, and then what he's saying now is the funnel is the new model.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.120]   He says in this brave new world power not comes not from production, not from you and
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:00.360]   me, Jeff, and Stacey, the content creators and not from distribution, obviously, but from
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:03.040]   controlling consumption.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.360]   All markets will be demand driven, the extent to which they already are as a fucking out
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.360]   digit.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.480]   I think he says Facebook is the funnel.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:17.760]   Is that but that's still an old world, Veltan, Channel, third German word, worldview.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:24.240]   That is arguing that we're in a production based rather than a service based economy.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.000]   Google is a personal services company.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.120]   Facebook is a services company.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.080]   Content does not have any value anymore.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.120]   It's not a product that we need to make anymore.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.720]   That's a Gutenberg era notion and that's out the window.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.160]   Well, that's bad news for you and me and every newspaper and journalists in the country.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.160]   We're content.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.400]   It's because you have the people, the dear people who are watching us now for even longer
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:49.680]   than it would take to read Zuckerberg's essay are a community built around you, Leo, and
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.880]   around the shared interests.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.040]   That's different from saying we make a product called content that you're going to watch.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.360]   The interactivity that exists, the relationships that exist.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.200]   This has to be more about relationship than it is about content.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.760]   But without content, there's no relation.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.800]   The relationship is based on a trade of information.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.640]   The content is merely a vehicle for carrying information.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:22.680]   But you trade your attention, gentle viewer and listener, for my information or entertainment
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.080]   or I don't know whatever it is you get out of it.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.440]   So the idea is...
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.920]   That's content.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.120]   I think you're arguing and I don't know the distinction here, but what you're talking
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.480]   about what Zuckerberg is talking about is the attention economy kind of concept.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.480]   Yes, I think so.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.320]   I think what I'm talking about is based on services.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:45.280]   And so yes, people are giving you their attention in the exchange, not for your content, but
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.880]   the service you actually provide in their life, which is things like how do I work with?
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.880]   Okay.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.160]   How do I look at my Microsoft without the different browser?
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.160]   So it's a service.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.160]   Okay.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.880]   I think that's a difference with that distinction.
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.880]   I mean, it's...
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.920]   No, no, it's a big distinction.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.560]   It's a big distinction because it changes the economic basis.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.800]   I mean, look at Google Home, right?
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   Is this content?
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.480]   No, this is a service.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:09.480]   Now it's going to tell me things.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   It's going to give me information.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.200]   Well, it's a distribution mechanism.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.200]   Yes.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.200]   Well, in Ben's...
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.200]   It's not an aggregator.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:20.480]   In Ben's worldview in his model, that's exactly what he's talking about.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.640]   That Google Home is the equivalent of the Facebook funnel.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.920]   It's the aggregator that becomes the conduit.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:28.920]   It's the new...
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.920]   The value to me...
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:33.000]   Unless I'm playing music, the value to me is not that I consumed something.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.040]   The value to me is that I learned something that I wanted to use.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.040]   Yeah, but that's...
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   Jeff isn't...
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.520]   He's not paying attention to it.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.080]   It's not seeking his attention.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.720]   All it is is providing a service.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:49.680]   Again, it's not a difference without a distinction without a difference or whatever you just
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.680]   said, Leo, I can't remember.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.240]   I can never remember that phrase.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:57.200]   It's just a really nuanced way of looking at how this works.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.200]   Yes, too nuanced.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.200]   Thank you, Stacy.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.200]   I don't get it.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:01.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.400]   I apologize, Stacy.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.400]   You're right.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.400]   You're saying it better than I can?
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.600]   I'm just going to sit back and let you guys...
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.200]   See, this is terrible when Jeff and I actually agree.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   We just gave up on Leo.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.200]   That's fine.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.200]   That's fine.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.200]   You know what?
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   I'm so wrong with that.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.200]   I like being ganged up on.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.200]   I don't know why.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.680]   I'm a little kinky.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.200]   But truthfully, I do like being...
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:26.240]   Because the risk of sitting in this chair is that I gang up on everybody else.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.200]   So I want you guys to speak in concert against my country.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.040]   It's kind of like Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:38.040]   I want you to knock me down for a knock me down a peg.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.040]   All right.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.040]   Well, anyway...
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.040]   It's tone.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.040]   Okay.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.280]   I mean, I've tried to get some sort of handle on this.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.320]   I've been asking every smart person I know.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.320]   What did Mark say?
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.320]   What does that mean?
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:53.160]   And I think your position, Jeff, is...
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.200]   Mark was widely misunderstood, I guess.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.120]   Yeah, I think people...
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.120]   What's behind the black box?
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.120]   What's the big mystery?
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.120]   What are they doing?
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.120]   What's going on there?
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.800]   Well, then he takes 6,000 words to say, "Here's what I'm trying to do.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   Here's where I see value."
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.440]   What is he trying to do?
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:11.960]   Also importantly, he says, "Here's where we haven't gone far enough."
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:16.520]   The end of another post I wrote about how Trump kills media and media kills Trump, I
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:19.120]   kind of put in my wish list back to Zuckerberg.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.200]   And I put it in a comment to his post.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.240]   And I think that the...
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:27.880]   I said it on the show a few weeks ago where I think that the internet is built to speak
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.080]   not yet to listen.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.880]   And Facebook, ironically, is a platform to speak and to show off your world and signal
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.200]   not so much to meet new people, not so much to understand people, not so much to have
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.200]   dialogue.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:45.360]   And what he was saying was, I think, we know we have to develop this to a next level.
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.880]   And if we're going to have civil...
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.920]   Civility in society, we're going to have to have information, we're going to have to
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.800]   have the mechanism to connect, we're going to have the mechanisms to talk.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   That's what he's saying.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.520]   He's saying, we're only 13 years old.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.640]   A Baseltop Bar Mitzvah just happened, right?
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:10.160]   And here's where I want to go with the product and the service that I've made and that I
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.320]   give you for free, what's that?
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.560]   And yeah, I mix money on it, hell of a lot of money, more ever more money.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.800]   But it's up to us to how we use that, but it's up to him to create an architecture.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.080]   So I would argue this.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.640]   Twitter has not solved the problem of openness and civility, for example.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:28.560]   They've got to work on that in some way or another.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.240]   Facebook, I think, has to work on mechanisms where people can tell their stories and save
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.240]   spaces, meet other people, understand people, be brought into dialogue that can be informed
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.040]   dialogue with media's help.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:45.400]   That's the kind of next leap of what Facebook can be in a civilization as an enabling technology.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.640]   Just as print was an enabling technology.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.600]   And no one was all controlled by one person, difference.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.240]   But it was an enabling technology for society to learn how to operate in new ways.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.800]   That's what we have now.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.120]   What is Facebook now, though?
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:03.720]   Isn't it still a platform for broadcast more than a community conversation or is it?
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.080]   It's a broad, not broadcast, the word there, broadcast.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:08.080]   It's cast.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.080]   It's a committee.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.080]   No, it's this cast, but it's cast.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.760]   But it's still, it's still a talk.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.720]   Don't listen mostly one way media, right?
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.720]   Twitter is all one way.
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.520]   Well, I mean, there's conversations on Twitter.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:24.360]   There's conversations, but it's really pretty much announce, announce, announce.
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:26.960]   And I would, I mean, just maybe it's only lately.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:32.400]   What's really interesting about Facebook is how it changes from minute to minute.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.880]   Like this month's a very different Facebook than it was last month is very different from
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.080]   how it was last summer.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.800]   It's very, which is, is that good?
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.000]   I think that's good, right?
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.560]   It's somehow reflecting a zeitgeist.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.920]   Fourth German word, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.560]   These are Volcker in Google.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.440]   Actually, if you could like doing Zeke's practice, they're fifth.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.040]   No, I think I already counted that one.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.040]   That was a disjuring.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.040]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.600]   Well, one thing I've, so I've been around Facebook more because of this fake news thing,
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:08.200]   and I'm going to be around them a lot more because I'm going to a conference.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.200]   I had a conference a week ago.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.000]   I'm going to another one this weekend, I'm going to another one the weekend for that,
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   and Facebook's president all over.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.560]   So I'm getting a different window on to Facebook.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:22.000]   I also had somebody from Facebook talk to a community of practice that I convene in product
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.920]   development for four and a half hours.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.560]   I learned a lot from that.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:30.800]   But what I see is the whole notion, the chaotic development, the thrown on the wall, get it
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.280]   out there, try it.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.240]   They see it as an organized chaos.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.640]   They see it as less try stuff.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.640]   They look at the data.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.640]   They see if it works.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.640]   They kill it.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.440]   They do the next thing.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.440]   And that's hard for us to get our heads around because we're used to institutions that
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:47.600]   work toward permanence.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.000]   It's like a snake that sheds its skin every five minutes.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   I mean, it's just so society.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.440]   I mean, I guess it was weird was that you had the permanence of books and magazines and
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.200]   newspapers that permanence was what they were going to do.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   Sorry, I'm going to do it.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.520]   Gutenberg parenthesis.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.440]   That was a myth of the Gutenberg era.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.440]   That was just permanence.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.440]   Oh, I just...
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.800]   Yeah, but no, I think before Bass Media or Media of any kind, it was much more permanent.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:18.120]   I mean, the culture of Europe before Gutenberg hadn't changed for 500 years.
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.960]   Well, indeed, they didn't respect their own current culture.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:26.160]   So the goal of the Scribes was to preserve ancient knowledge before we saw it.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.160]   It's a world budget.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   Right.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:33.240]   So Gutenberg, I think, was the first, actually, the first shot in what has become now this
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:38.000]   kind of whirlwind of jail the time.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Pop culture.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Pop culture.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.680]   Well, 15 minutes of fame, Andy Warhol got it wrong.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.160]   It's 5, 15 seconds.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.840]   It's like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:46.920]   Although Warhol was kind of...
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.840]   He was kind of prescient, wasn't he, when he said everybody in the future, everybody
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.320]   will have 15 minutes of fame.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.400]   I don't know how he knew that 40 years ago, but he was right.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.560]   And it's only getting worse.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:06.120]   And no wonder people are stressed out and dung.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:14.400]   I was just looking at a graph of the life expectancy in South Korea compared to the United States.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:19.840]   And South Korea has started to outpace us considerably as the United States life expectancy
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.360]   kind of not only plateaus, but might even be going down.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:33.040]   And as I think of it, I don't think it's food or lifestyle, or I think it's stress.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.680]   Maybe I guess it's stressful in South Korea.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.680]   I don't know.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.920]   I feel like this has become unhealthy.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:45.320]   And ever since the election, and I'll cop to this, Farhad Manji wrote that great article
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:49.000]   about trying to do a week without political news.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   And he couldn't.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   It's like, he says, "Trying to eat a fruitcake without it getting the nuts and the raisins."
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   It's everywhere.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.360]   And we're all kind of stressed out.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:05.520]   And whether you're pro-Trump or against him, the polarization and the conversations
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.880]   become very heated.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:13.720]   And I think it's a death spiral of attention and stress.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.720]   Oh, no!
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.560]   Well, that part, that part.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.560]   Yeah, it is.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.560]   Is it?
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:22.200]   And my wrong, I mean, Twitter is ready to kill me now.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:25.960]   The number one thing I hear nowadays is, I don't want to...
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.000]   Me, me, me, me, me, put my fingers in my ear.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.080]   I don't want to hear anything.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.320]   It's like, don't...
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.920]   I think people are going crazy.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.280]   Anyway, I don't know.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:43.400]   I really globalized that into our life expectancy plummeting.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.920]   You are happy today.
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:48.840]   I tuned all of that out because I found it stressful.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:49.840]   Exactly!
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.840]   Done.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.840]   I'm feeling a bit of a backlash.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.800]   I keep waiting for this backlash against social media and the internet in general.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.400]   People are just tuning in.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.440]   Can we go back to a simpler era?
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.440]   No.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:03.440]   No, what are you?
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.440]   A Let-I-Gee-bus.
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.440]   Oh.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:10.560]   Who are you guys sitting in Leo's chair?
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:16.040]   I'm ready to go to an island and turn off the no internet.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.400]   Make it darn hard to do these podcasts.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.400]   You would...
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:23.240]   We'd have to have little styrofoam Leo.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.920]   Let's talk about something else.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.560]   We're going to take a break and we're going to talk about something else.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.120]   You're good.
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.120]   Stacey, you're good.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.440]   She is on fire today.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:36.360]   You must do yoga, transcendental meditation.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   I do both.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.360]   Yeah, I could tell.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.320]   You know what we can...when we come back, you know what we can argue about?
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.960]   It's exactly.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.960]   Exactly.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.200]   Jeff took my advice and, boy, is he sorry.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.520]   The last time I'm going to do that.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.520]   Wow.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.520]   All right.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:52.520]   Well, I have a positive thing that I want to share with you.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.280]   No, Jeff and I are going to get in a fight.
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.280]   Okay.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.280]   Dang it.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.280]   All right.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.280]   Then you're going to make peace.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.280]   And I tried the Amplify HD.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:03.560]   And now I think tried most of the major mesh systems.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.800]   I could talk about that.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.280]   Oh, we can't.
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:08.280]   Can you see the satellite behind me?
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.280]   You have...
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.280]   Is that...
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.280]   You know what?
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.440]   The Orbeez is the one that's given me the best results, but we'll talk about that.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:14.440]   All right.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.440]   Stay tuned.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.440]   Yeah, stay tuned.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.440]   But first to word...
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.440]   Well, I like to tell the lower third of the key minute out.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.440]   I wish you did it more often.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.440]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.440]   That was nice.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.440]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.440]   Leo's moving.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.480]   Carsten is on vacation.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:33.480]   And so Brian Burnett, who is one of our most creative technical directors, is running the
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.480]   board.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.480]   Isn't he?
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.480]   Brian is really...
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.480]   Brian does crazy stuff.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.480]   Can I have a top hat?
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.480]   Yes.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.480]   Yes.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.720]   Brian's the guy who put the elf on the shelf and all of that stuff.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.720]   He can do it all.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.720]   Oh, I like you, Brian.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   But first...
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.920]   Now the board goes with the spot.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.920]   Where's the fricking...
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   No, no, no.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.080]   Brian enjoys this.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.080]   I really do.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.080]   He's very good at the Tri-caster.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.000]   He's also the host of a show at KnowHow.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.740]   And he's a great editor.
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.740]   He's a great guy.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.000]   And he's one of the most... the best looking men in the world.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.460]   Well now we got to have a camera on him though.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.460]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.460]   Where is he?
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.460]   Get the camera on yourself, man.
[00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:10.460]   Go ahead.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:11.460]   Put the camera on yourself, Brian.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:12.460]   He's a very good-looking gentleman.
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:13.860]   Brian, you got to do it.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:14.860]   Yeah.
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.860]   Take care of him with us on.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.320]   Okay, now we are harassing this guy.

[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.680]   I know.
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:37.680]   I am the boy who cries lemon.

[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:46.840]   To me, this is the CR 48 of whatever the next operating system is going to be.
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:48.680]   That was the first Chromebook we all got.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:51.760]   It was a black clunky thing.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.160]   And this thing is clunky.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.160]   Okay.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.160]   So the problem is it's slower.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.000]   I am so spoiled by my Chromebook.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.280]   And you know it would be because you had a pixel with eight gigs of RAM or no, maybe
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.280]   even 16 gigs of RAM.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.600]   So I'm looking for machine for a place that's I'm going to tell you what depressed I am.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.160]   I cannot buy a pixel.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.160]   You can't find the mini-boo.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.160]   No.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.800]   You just can't use it anyway.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   And then I almost got caught in a scam today.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.920]   Guy put up a thing on Amazon and I quickly found out it was a scam.
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.880]   What's wrong with your old Pixel?
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.480]   It's fine, but I'm neurotic and I want a backup.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.600]   I want to know what I'm going to use next.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.320]   So I see this as the next machine.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.320]   Okay.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.960]   That's unfair maybe because I'm off a pixel.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:32.120]   It's half the price or less.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.840]   Or well, but it's okay.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:34.840]   It's way too slow.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:39.000]   When I'm typing in Preetec, I've got a lag in typing.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   Typing.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.600]   That should be.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.240]   The scroll is jumpy and bad.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   The internal is plastic.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:48.760]   The external is metal, but the internal is plastic.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.120]   To my mind, they took the basic machine they had.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.520]   They put on a much better screen screen.
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:54.520]   It's beautiful.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.520]   You're absolutely right.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.680]   They put on a metal exterior, but it's still a tinny.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.960]   Chromebook and all Chromebooks are tinny.
[00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:05.040]   And that's disappointing because I put my life of these things now.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.120]   Everything I do is on Chromebooks.
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:09.720]   I've got my machine, if it's eyes, I'll do.
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.720]   Do they tell you?
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.440]   No, it just means your life is in the cloud, Jeff.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.360]   And you just grab another computer and start working.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.480]   He's doing because he can't find one as good as the one he's got.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.480]   Exactly.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.480]   Exactly.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.480]   I mean, that one is a good backup.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.800]   Just think of that as your backup.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.040]   If you had to use it, you couldn't live with it.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.560]   Well, here's the other question.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:30.520]   So I say, okay, do I do I replace my Pixel C with this, right?
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:34.840]   Pixel C is a million times better tablet than this thing.
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.120]   I couldn't get the sound.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.480]   I can't you kick an Amazon to load on it.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.040]   I won't let you do that.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.400]   I tried to play a video last night with my just plug it in headset.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.160]   Couldn't get the sound working.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:51.680]   Well, I have to go through to get because of G-spot, but I have to do to get to get
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:52.680]   absolute on this.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.680]   You would not believe.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.600]   Well, you're going to have that problem with any Chromebook, right?
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.600]   That's true.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.600]   That's true.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.000]   But I'm just so well, but don't forget, I mean, either replacing my laptop or I'm replacing
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.800]   my tablet.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.160]   Each that I have now is miles better than this combination of both.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.400]   That's what I'm saying in the end.
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.400]   Okay.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:15.480]   And if it could operate decently, it would be the thing I'd travel with.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:17.480]   But I can't type well on it.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:19.240]   I can't scroll well on it.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.040]   The trackpad is plastic and crap.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:24.400]   You did complain about the trackpad.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.400]   It just doesn't have.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:32.160]   And that's almost emailed to you after our show saying, don't buy this.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.160]   You're going to be complaining.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.600]   No, I saw this coming because it isn't.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.600]   You're absolutely right.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:41.600]   If what you want is a Google Pixel, Chromebook Pixel, it's not that.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:42.600]   It isn't.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.880]   It's a third of the price or a little more than that.
[00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.240]   But less than half the price.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.880]   Neither is it a Pixel C.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:54.360]   Yeah, I don't know very many people who like the Pixel C. I think you're one of the few
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.360]   on that one.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.360]   I'm weird.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.360]   I'm admitting I'm weird.
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:02.880]   But I, you know, I comment was on the Samsung Chromebook Pro.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.080]   He had the Pro.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.240]   And maybe the Pro would be faster.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.240]   I'm not good for the faster.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:08.800]   It might be, but I'm not convinced it will be.
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.880]   I think what you really want is more RAM.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.920]   Well, so the surprise they didn't put more RAM in that.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.920]   I'm very surprised.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.920]   I didn't make an option.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   The Asus, I think, enables.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.920]   Here's the other thing.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.920]   Here's the reason.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.680]   There are better Chromebooks.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.000]   Dell makes one that's seven or eight hundred dollars.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.480]   It's a Chromebook for work, though.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.120]   It doesn't have touch.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.040]   That's exactly its problem.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.240]   So I bought this one versus the Asus because of you.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.720]   For one thing, because you are my...
[00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:34.720]   I don't know if it's...
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.440]   I don't know if the Asus is any better for you.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.440]   Well, I'm not sure.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.760]   But, well, but I also bought this one because of the stylus.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.240]   But I have horrible handwriting.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.720]   I'm never going to use the stylus.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.720]   Okay.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.880]   So the Asus, I think...
[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.920]   I thought I read that you could get it with more RAM, but I can't find that.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.000]   The 302, is that the one you want to get?
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   I think so.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.320]   I thought that I read somewhere that was going to come available with more RAM, but I can't
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.640]   find that anywhere.
[00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.640]   So as a...
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.640]   It's expensive.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.640]   You know, in terms of functionality, it's very similar.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.640]   Sure.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:07.640]   Sure.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:08.840]   You know, I wish to.
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.320]   They had the twist.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:15.000]   Instead of doing the 180, do the twist so you're not as close to the same.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.560]   It does turn off the keys when you have it flipped around.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.880]   It does, but I'm always worried I'm going to catch a key on my briefcase or something.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:22.880]   Sitting on the train.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.880]   So, you know, I know I'm a...
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.880]   Yeah, there's...
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.800]   This is limited to four gigs as well.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:35.280]   And the processor in both of the Chromebook Pro and the Asus is just an M3, which is not
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.960]   a very fast processor.
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.960]   I don't...
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.960]   You know, it's an interesting question.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.240]   Why did they...
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.320]   The Asus looks almost identical, frankly.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.880]   I don't think it's going to be that much different spec-wise.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.560]   Yeah, it looks like it more RAM.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.760]   I know from my old days, in the early days of Chromebooks, when I started using them,
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.520]   the four was never enough.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.520]   Just not enough.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.520]   I know that you're running...
[00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:03.800]   You may be running the browser, you know, five tabs in the browser plus one or two Android
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.880]   apps.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.520]   It went berserk on me when I tried to do that.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.840]   It was starting flashing and it couldn't...
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.320]   I couldn't do anything with it.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.320]   It was...
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.480]   It is a little odd that they...
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:14.280]   I'm not sure why...
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.600]   It feels artificial that they've limited it like this.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.160]   Why wouldn't they have a range?
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:20.600]   Well, it's actually Dell of all companies.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.600]   Well, Dell does.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.600]   But Dell doesn't have touch.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.600]   I wish...
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.600]   Exactly.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.280]   I wish Dell gave me every option I could have.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:31.680]   A touchscreen, LTE, 8 gigs of RAM, large SSD.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.560]   I'd pay 1,200 bucks for that.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.160]   And no, they don't have to have a market for it.
[00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.320]   But I guess Dell's out of the custom business.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.680]   Yeah, they used to be the most customized.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:47.400]   I think there must be something going on with Google and licensing because...
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.960]   Yeah, Google, why Google?
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:50.960]   Why Google?
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:51.960]   Why Google?
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.960]   So here's why I'm sort of questioning...
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.000]   And will they make another Chromebook Pixel?
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   That's my plea.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   That's my plea.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.760]   Just keep the Pixel line going.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.760]   It's all I want.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.400]   Because I know your own people use it.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.600]   And I know it's not a big market, but you're wildly rich.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.600]   I would...
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.080]   I mean, there's no question at all.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:10.240]   I completely agree with you that the Chromebook Pixel 20...
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.240]   What is it?
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.240]   2014, 2015.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.240]   2015.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:15.200]   Is the best Chromebook.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.440]   And what everybody should experience.
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:17.720]   But I think most...
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:21.920]   I think they've concluded that the market's not interested in spending 20...
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.880]   $1,299 for Chrome OS device.
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.480]   Because they all they've made, except for the Chromebook.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:32.240]   That's all they've made is the tinny little Chromebooks for education and low-end work.
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.960]   They've never really pushed this.
[00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.960]   They need more apps on it.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:35.960]   There was a story...
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.280]   I forgot to put it in the rundown, but there was another story about the new operating system
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:45.040]   that's rumored that it's going to finally bring together Android and Chrome and how it
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.040]   would do that.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.040]   Now...
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:51.480]   If you could really use great photo applications on this and video editing on this, and that
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.280]   kind of stuff, the Dell might be the...
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.720]   The Dell might...
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:59.480]   Because they may have a 13.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:04.080]   You know, this is the one you couldn't find on Dell's site because Dell doesn't admit
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.520]   to making this yet.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.360]   We don't know what the Dell specs...
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.120]   Well, even if I found Dell computers, it was weird on Dell's side, I found them in the
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.120]   business section.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.120]   I couldn't find a buy button.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.120]   Yes, there's no buy button.
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.120]   What gives?
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:20.760]   I don't know.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   It's not available yet.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.160]   I don't want to resort to my first well-known computer complaints on Dell.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.160]   I'm trying to be nice to Dell.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.160]   You might have to call them.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.080]   I don't know.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:33.480]   I tried to buy one too after we talked last week because I understand what you...
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.520]   I completely understand and sympathize with what you're saying.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:38.360]   I need a better processor and I need more RAM.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.360]   It's a computer.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.360]   Yeah, you build your own.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.360]   Oh, you...
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.360]   Actually, Chrome OS...
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.360]   I mean...
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.360]   There is a Chromium OS.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.480]   It is open source.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.720]   So in theory, you could, although it's apparently very difficult.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:57.440]   There's one company that does offer a Chrome OS installer based on the Chromium OS.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.440]   But...
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.680]   But then you're not going to get the updates.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.680]   It's weird.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.680]   It's like a hack and touch.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   You're not having an Android and you're not going to get all that stuff.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.680]   For some reason, it really is tightly coupled to hardware.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.680]   All right.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   Okay.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.680]   So...
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:10.920]   I can't hear you with you.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.520]   I understand exactly what you're saying.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.600]   My depression is not about the Samsung.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.400]   My depression is about the end of the Pixel Chromebook and Pixel C.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.720]   Well, WWDC, they might announce something.
[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:24.520]   That's not for a while, but...
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:25.520]   Google, please.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.520]   Please, Google.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.520]   And meanwhile, I'm trying to buy...
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.520]   And meanwhile, I'm trying to buy...
[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.400]   I think you have to kind of adjust your expectations.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:35.120]   And you're right, if you're trying to buy a replacement for the Chromebook Pixel, the
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.480]   Samsung Chromebook Plus is not a good choice.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.800]   At least I didn't like it either.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.720]   But I'm perfectly happy with it.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.240]   For what it is, I love it.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.240]   If...
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   Here's...
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   Go ahead.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.240]   Go ahead.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.240]   You can finish up.
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.240]   I was just going to let...
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.240]   So you always get to...
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:57.400]   If you go back in time before I get the Pixel C, then I was hauling around the Chromebook.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:01.320]   For this to be my briefcase machine, I probably wouldn't have been pretty unhappy.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.320]   Yeah, because it is light and thin and small.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.800]   But the Pixel C is faster and better.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.800]   And this.
[00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.320]   And faster and smarter.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.560]   And Android works well enough now across all the Google Apps.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:20.080]   And indeed, it's better with identity by far than Chrome is.
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:27.640]   That I've now traveled exclusively with the Pixel C, though that's going to go away too.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.120]   So that's my comparison now.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.120]   So it's a traveling machine.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.120]   The Pixel C...
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:32.120]   The tablet is actually better.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.120]   So you know what I was thinking about?
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.120]   You know what?
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.120]   Surface.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:39.560]   My mom loves their Surface.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.560]   Yeah, they're great.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.560]   They're actually really good.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:43.920]   That goes to Stacey's point.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.880]   It's just, Jarvis, stop complaining, get a machine and put a browser on it and shut up.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.880]   It might be...
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.880]   You might be right.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.880]   Actually, that might be.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.680]   You could get a max out of Surface, you know, and you'd be very happy.
[00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.360]   It's thousand bucks, but that's not going to be more than a Chromebook is.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.360]   Right.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.880]   And you just told us how you're going to...
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.680]   You're willing to pay for this.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:05.600]   And hardware is used to be your hangup.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:06.600]   And...
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.320]   Stacey, you didn't tell him to buy a Surface.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.800]   I didn't hear that part, but you're exactly...
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.440]   No, no, I did not say it to buy a Surface.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.880]   I was thinking Surface.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.760]   You were thinking and he just picked up on that.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.760]   No.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.760]   You guys have really been on a...
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.720]   No, I totally did not do that.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:23.720]   Surface Pro 4.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:24.720]   What are you working for?
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:29.280]   Let's say you can get it with an i7 and 8 gigs of RAM.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:34.560]   Actually, it looks like you can customize even further here.
[00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.560]   Let's configure it.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:42.400]   Yeah, you could go up to 16 gigs of RAM.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.320]   You don't need an i7, but you know what?
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.640]   That's what I would get.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:54.000]   I would get an i5 with 16 gigs of RAM and a 256 gig hardware, $13.99.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.920]   Then you have to add $129 for the keyboard.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.000]   What I don't get...
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.920]   Oh, I don't know what I get it.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.080]   In terms of being able to do Google Play, I can't do on it.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.440]   You can't do Android, you mean?
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.440]   Yeah, I can't do my store Google Play.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.880]   I don't know if I can do Netflix or not.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.960]   I don't know if I can do Amazon download or not.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.800]   So that's part of the reason that I can do Amazon download.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:23.200]   But Google Play is where all my stuff is.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:27.400]   Add the Surface Pro cover with a fingerprint ID.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.960]   Another 160 bucks.
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.960]   Yeah, it's a little...
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:31.960]   It's priced here.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.320]   Let me go back to Stacy's question.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:43.720]   Why isn't it possible to easily install the Chrome OS on most any machine?
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:48.000]   What's special about the Chromebook hardware that makes it?
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:54.960]   There's a trusted boot system for security.
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.960]   There is.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.960]   If you go to the chromium.org, there's a Chrome OS.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:04.080]   If you're sophisticated enough, there's a Chrome OS download and you can install it.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.680]   There are companies that make it a little bit cleaner.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.840]   But yeah, it's not...
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.840]   By the way, it wouldn't...
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.000]   Well, let's see.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.560]   You can do firmware from Core Boot or UBoot.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.960]   I guess you could get it pretty close.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.600]   It might be an interesting project.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.760]   I was being such a blokey for that.
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.560]   Yeah, well, I think this is not a user.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.560]   It's not for a...
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.920]   Yeah, I don't do anything that's like...
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:36.160]   If I'm going to work on the machine or work on a product and have it expected to work,
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.160]   then I don't...
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.160]   Yeah, good rule.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.160]   This kind of stuff.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.560]   It's otherwise you'll just need that guy.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:44.960]   So you need to have Ubuntu installed on it.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:45.960]   You might like Linux.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.760]   We should get you into Linux.
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.800]   Well, I tried that from the original Chromebook.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:50.800]   Did you?
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.520]   Yeah, I did the dual boot thing.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.480]   You know, that actually might be a better solution for you than Windows.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:01.760]   You get a good Lenovo Carbon X1 touch.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.320]   I think someone said that in the chat room.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.320]   But Linux on it.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.320]   Really?
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:10.840]   That's a really nice, very lightweight, very powerful laptop.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:11.840]   I'm not crazy about...
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.080]   Somebody's mentioning Ami Duo.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.560]   I've played with that for a while.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:17.480]   That's not a good choice.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:18.640]   It's too clunky.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:19.640]   All right.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.640]   Enough of this.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.640]   Enough of that.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:22.640]   Now, stay safe.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:23.640]   I didn't mean to be whiny.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.640]   How's the thing?
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:26.640]   The thing.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.720]   Guys, today is National Margarita Day.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.720]   I noticed.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:36.360]   I'm like, I bring you the waffle day, possibly donut day.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.000]   And today, Margarita Day.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   Margarita Day.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.800]   I can also talk about tech.
[00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.400]   What are we doing to celebrate National Margarita Day?
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.400]   That's the question.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:48.360]   I am going to make a Margarita.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:53.360]   I used to go camping with a family that specializes in something they called the juggarita.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:50:02.960]   Which was a giant cooler filled with Margarita.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.360]   And you can imagine the outcome there.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.920]   There was a Margarita machine at my wedding.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:08.920]   It was a good wedding.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:09.920]   Wow.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:10.920]   Well, you are in Texas.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.920]   Wow.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.280]   A Margarita machine at your wedding.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.280]   Wow.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.200]   And classy wedding.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:20.760]   I was going to ask you guys if anyone here because you can now...
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.360]   Oh, look at me.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.280]   I'm so fancy.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.560]   You wanted a top hat, right?
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.560]   Well, we decided...
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:29.920]   I'm going to sit right here and curl my imaginary mustache.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:34.640]   Or with a top hat, you need a monocle, a handlebar mustache and a bow tie.
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.960]   That's a fancy wedding.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.800]   That's for your fancy Margarita wedding.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.520]   There we go.
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.960]   This mustache quite doesn't quite fit my face, I guess.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.640]   I need to be squishier.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.240]   Wait, if I back up, does it?
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:48.680]   Okay, I'm going to do this all day.
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.680]   All right, I'll stop.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.680]   I can size it, just stop moving.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.680]   Staying still.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:59.200]   I was going to ask if you tried Google Express because you can now do it from Google Home.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.440]   What is Google Express?
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:02.080]   Is that ordering food?
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.080]   It is.
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:05.280]   It's ordering food, which apparently covers...
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.280]   Or Costco.
[00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:08.560]   Or Costco or Bed Bath and Beyond.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.320]   I haven't tried it yet.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.200]   Because I buy stuff on the Amazon Echo all the time.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:17.240]   I mean, like every day, I'll say, "Oh, we're out of..."
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.680]   You know, we were out of Splendid yesterday.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.680]   I ordered 1,200 packets.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.680]   Like a pair.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.680]   God.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:27.680]   I'm going to not even silently judge you for that.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.680]   Okay.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.280]   I'm not the Splendid consumer.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:35.040]   I never touch the stuff.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.520]   So this is...
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:40.040]   Google has made deals with lots of different stores.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.040]   Yes.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.520]   Have you done it?
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:43.520]   Have you done it?
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.520]   No, I've got it.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.240]   I signed up so I could do it.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.240]   Let's do it right now.
[00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.240]   What would you like?
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.240]   I'm a margarita mix.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:53.280]   I already have margarita mix.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:54.480]   We always have margarita mix.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.360]   I think Bevmo is one of the...
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.360]   Let's see.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.360]   Oh, you should order some tequila.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.360]   Fine-mole.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.560]   You probably can't get alcoholic.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.680]   I would guess you can't get alcoholic beverages.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.440]   What good is this service?
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.640]   I'm willing to bet.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.800]   But you can't get lemon and lime juice.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.640]   And you can get a can of goat milk.
[00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:13.640]   Goat milk.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:14.640]   Curried people.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:15.640]   Donut shop coffee.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.360]   Hey, they have fries.
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.360]   They have fries.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:19.360]   I know.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.960]   But I don't think we have a fries near here.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:24.000]   I'm just going to South Bay because I love fries.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.040]   Do they have king cakes?
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.680]   It's Mardi Gras, huh?
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:29.680]   It is.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.800]   Let's say Le Bonton Rule, baby.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.280]   Let me see here.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.800]   King cakes.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:41.520]   Yes, I can get gluten-free king cake.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.920]   Okay, that is disgusting.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.920]   No, it's all mixes.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:53.640]   But they have Sir La Tom, which means you can get some pretty serious cooking stuff.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.120]   So you're having to look online to see this?
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.160]   No, that's just because we're browsing it.
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.160]   Oh, because you're browsing it.
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.920]   You know what you want.
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:07.360]   If you, let's say I run out of, I don't know, snacks.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:12.160]   I could just, I would go, hey, goo goo.
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:14.240]   Buy me some Doritos.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.240]   And then what does it, does it query you?
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.240]   Is there a process?
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:20.480]   You have to probably have to put your card in, right?
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:24.240]   Well, yes, you would have, but don't you, it doesn't Google have your credit card information
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:25.240]   on it.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.800]   You could buy a nest.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   You could buy a lot of stuff.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.680]   All right, I'm going to have to try because I do do a lot of shopping that way.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:36.680]   There is a fee, but it's waived up until a certain time that I do not remember.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.320]   I think it's the end of April, maybe.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:46.440]   Try express membership free for three months, free same day delivery, ineligible orders.
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:50.000]   Otherwise, membership is $95 a year or $10 a month.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.040]   And then deliver, there is a delivery fee you're saying.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:57.120]   I don't, let's see.
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:03.920]   I think it's the fee for Google Express that is waived so you can try it out with the $95.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.800]   I can try it free instead of 95.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.680]   So I'm going to become a member.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.680]   All right.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:09.680]   That's pretty easy.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.600]   You're right because I have my credit card and now I could shop either on the web or
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:14.760]   better with Google Home.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.440]   I could say, send me something.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:19.960]   That's kind of neat.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:20.960]   Or problematic.
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:29.320]   Well, you know what I find with the Amazon Echo is it's often stuff, staples or things
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.840]   I just ran out of.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:38.160]   And I just rather than make a shopping list, just go send me some, which is probably good
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:41.040]   for the because of the pollution of the truck and stuff.
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.760]   But they don't, I don't know.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.760]   Is it bad?
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.760]   Tell me it's okay.
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.800]   I don't know if it's okay or I think it's kind of bad.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:53.000]   I would love, you know, I would love to say, hey, add this to my list and at the end, like
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:56.280]   every Friday or something, say, consolidate my list and send me these items.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.280]   That's a good idea.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.280]   Stacey.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.840]   We actually, you know, that was one of the key, it was one of the key insights when McDonald's
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.000]   started is the consolidation.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.800]   Rather than having the catch up truck go to every single McDonald's, they went to a
[00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.320]   good solidator and all the catch up was put together with the pickles and with the mustard
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.200]   and then delivered to the McDonald's, right?
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.200]   That's right.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:17.720]   We would get one thing to a week with a big, exactly.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:23.040]   That was a big supply chain innovation in the day.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.000]   So why not at a consumer level?
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.440]   Do you want this now or for a slight discount in your in your in your every week delivery?
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:35.320]   Well, Amazon, if you had that, that habit of knowing every Friday you're going to get
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   delivery.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:40.600]   You buy a hawk of a lot more because you just throw it into your delivery.
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:44.440]   Amazon's funny because they will put them together and sometimes you'll buy something
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:47.520]   and they'll say, well, we're not, we can't deliver this unless you buy some other things
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:49.400]   and then we'll throw it in the box.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:53.000]   And then sometimes you buy six things all at once and they send you six different boxes.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.720]   It's just unpredictable what Amazon's going to do box wise.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:00.000]   Well, they also, not everything comes from the same distribution.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000]   I think that's probably why.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   It's my guess.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   And I can get a hardware too.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.160]   Light bulbs.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.880]   I can get all my a dollar 99 LED light bulbs from Max.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.320]   Wait, if there's a capacitive touch sink, you just buy that sucker right now because
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.320]   it is awesome.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.400]   You just touch your sink and the water flows.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.400]   Really?
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.400]   It's really, really have a very modern home.
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:25.400]   I do.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.080]   It kind of like the Jetsons.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:32.040]   It's the best thing ever except when like people come over or I go to other places and
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.640]   then I'm hitting people's sinks and they're like, what are you doing?
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.640]   And I'm like, it doesn't work.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:37.640]   Use the keyboard.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:38.640]   The keyboard.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.640]   Exactly.
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.440]   Oh, Queen, talk to the talk to the sink.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:44.920]   Does Andrew have a good built that he can walk the dog on?
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.680]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.440]   Should I tell you about how Andrew got very upset with me?
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.280]   Oh, yes.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:56.080]   This is in regards to the Logitech home hub.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.880]   So we had and I don't think this is Logitech's fault.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:56:59.880]   I think this is user error.
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:00.880]   You got the harmony, right?
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:01.880]   This is the harmony.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:02.880]   I got the harmony.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:08.160]   So first, the harmony hub only accepts eight connected objects that's virtual.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.160]   That's right.
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.160]   Yep.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:11.160]   So I broke the harmony.
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:14.760]   They have a bigger one that's more expensive than can handle more, I believe.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.160]   Yes, they do.
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:19.320]   But they don't really market that as much to normal people.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:20.320]   Right.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.520]   So I was like, okay, I'm not going to add my light bulbs and all this.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:25.160]   Auto discovery was lovely.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.160]   It found a lot of things on my system like all my sodas.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.880]   Yes, my experience also because we both did this at the same time.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:30.880]   Yes.
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:36.600]   So I have a Roku 4 Plus thing, I think.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:41.400]   And so I installed that and that was, again, the installation was actually super easy.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.120]   The first time it didn't work.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:48.680]   So I should say I tried the Logitech Harmony two years ago and it was a much more difficult
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:49.680]   set of process.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.680]   This was really pretty easy.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:51.680]   I agree with you.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:56.400]   Yeah, because if it didn't work, it was basically the most common issue is apparently needing
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.240]   to add wait times to things.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.240]   Right.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:03.080]   So I automatically do that, which is great because most people are not going to be like,
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:07.200]   oh, that's a hard thing to think of if you're not used to that.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:08.200]   Right.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.120]   So that was really nice.
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:14.200]   But I didn't buy the remote control because I really just wanted the echo turn on the
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.200]   TV thing.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.440]   Me too.
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:21.240]   It does break the Roku controller, which I also expected and I had my phone.
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:24.920]   Wait a minute, you can't use your remote or Roku remote anymore.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:31.080]   So the Roku remote doesn't work and my husband bought it because he wanted, you can actually
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:33.160]   plug in the headphones on the remote.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:36.960]   And listen to him and that feature just went away completely.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.520]   No, I didn't have that problem.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:42.680]   My Roku remote still works.
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:44.120]   So there we go.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.440]   Because that was my question and the crazy part is.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:54.420]   So because last night, Andrew, who is a very patient tolerant person, he kind of.
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:57.640]   He kind of kind of had a final straw.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:58.640]   Exactly.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.600]   I put up with the lights that go on in the middle of the night in purple hue.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:05.900]   I put up with the oven that automatically cooks the bacon.
[00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:11.240]   I put up with the sink that you don't have a faucet, but this is the last straw.
[00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:12.240]   Honey.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.040]   It was kind of that.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:17.960]   And I feel bad because the poor man just wanted to watch TV.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:18.960]   You should meet Lisa.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:19.960]   I know.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:20.960]   It's the same thing.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:30.300]   I spent like Friday evening, like half an hour going echo, turn on Roku.
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:33.220]   Turn on Roku.
[00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:35.140]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:36.940]   Roku.
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:39.020]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:43.140]   The stupid thing is I said to Lisa, come on, watch.
[00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:45.380]   Let me show you how this works before I actually.
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:47.260]   Oh, no, don't ever do that.
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:48.260]   I'm learning.
[00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:55.680]   I should have a private session with the harmony and the Alexa before I invited spectators.
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:56.680]   Okay.
[00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.980]   So everyone's telling me the Roku still worked, but what's crazy is I uninstalled everything
[01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:07.100]   because I wanted to go into your Roku set up because you can repair your remote.
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:08.100]   So I did that.
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.640]   I repaired everything.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.740]   Then it still didn't work.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:13.800]   So I then I took everything.
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.300]   I manually removed all the devices.
[01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:18.300]   I took everything off the network.
[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:19.300]   They'd be cool.
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:20.300]   It'll be a reboot.
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:21.300]   It still doesn't work.
[01:00:21.300 --> 01:00:22.300]   It still doesn't work.
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:27.360]   Yeah, I think that that was independent because I never, I never, in fact, I wouldn't have
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.180]   done it if I had thought that that would break the Roku remote.
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:34.780]   I mean, you can't, you can't, I don't want the hub to replace existing remotes.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:37.940]   I just want it to be an adjunct.
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:38.940]   So this, okay.
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:42.220]   So that means because I'm like, is this because I didn't order the fancy remote?
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.220]   No, no, no, no.
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:45.940]   In fact, everybody in the chatroom saying no, no, including me.
[01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:53.220]   The Roku remote continued to work for me without a problem, which is good because I
[01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:56.300]   echo turn on Netflix.
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.580]   Watch Netflix.
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:58.580]   I couldn't.
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:03.740]   There's some I haven't, I have to sit down and spend some time with it.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.740]   Okay.
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:05.740]   So, yeah.
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:09.220]   So, okay, I feel better and I will, I will go back to this with renewed vigor and purpose
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:12.140]   because I was just like, yes, I did check the batteries for the moment.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:18.380]   And I did have a kind of a frustrating period of time where it was turning off the Tivo
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:21.660]   instead of turning it on, you know, would get out of sync.
[01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:23.460]   It wouldn't be state.
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.460]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:25.460]   And I know, so fine.
[01:01:25.460 --> 01:01:29.700]   But if you go to the computer app, you, you can't do this on the phone, but if you go
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:34.940]   to the website and do us, you can say, don't touch, don't mess with the Tivo.
[01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:38.940]   That's, that's, I know the Tivo is needed to change channels, but don't turn it on or
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:39.940]   off.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:43.340]   And there's some refinement to the commands you can give it when you're actually online
[01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:45.420]   with it.
[01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:46.580]   But it's pretty good.
[01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:47.780]   It's got a lot better.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:48.780]   It was already good.
[01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:53.740]   The Harmony one was a fan was fantastic because Logitech, when they bought Harmony, one of
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:57.980]   the things Harmony did that they have a database of all the home entertainment stuff.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.460]   And over time, that's become super complete.
[01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:02.340]   So you don't have to enter in codes or anything.
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:04.780]   It just knows everything.
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:05.780]   That's what I loved about it.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:08.260]   I was like, dang, A V E's.
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.860]   And I thought, I really thought this was going to be a quick setup.
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:12.660]   And I should never think that anymore.
[01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:16.300]   Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever is.
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:19.300]   I can show you if I can log into my account.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.380]   Is it my, it's probably my harmony.com, right?
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.860]   Oh, Lord.
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:24.860]   I don't know.
[01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:25.860]   Why?
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.260]   I've just been working from the app.
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:33.700]   No, the computer, at least for the setup, you're going to want to use the computer.
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:34.700]   Okay.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:35.700]   Because the app worked just fine.
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:37.740]   I know, but there's more you can do.
[01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:38.740]   I think.
[01:02:38.740 --> 01:02:39.740]   Okay.
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.060]   Like turn on my, use my Roku remote.
[01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:42.060]   Yeah.
[01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:46.660]   Was it the app or the, no, no, it was a desktop software, not the app.
[01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:49.780]   It has desktop software.
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:52.500]   That's put that on the computer.
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:55.940]   And then, but that's just for the, that's like for the fine tuning.
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:57.820]   And then you don't have to ever use it again.
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:59.820]   Oh, you got my vampire face there.
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:02.300]   Let me see that again.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:08.420]   I just sprinkled holy water.
[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:13.340]   Oh, is that what you call it?
[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:14.340]   I didn't know this.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.340]   We're, we're not getting voice over LTE on a project.
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:23.940]   Fi, I thought we were, but apparently they're now testing volt or volts or voice over LTE
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:28.020]   calling for a small group of users on Google Fi.
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:35.660]   So we do get on T mobile anyway, we get a Wi-Fi calling, which sounds very good.
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:41.500]   And VOLTE would sound probably as good if it started using it.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:46.020]   So if we have Wi-Fi calling on TBL all the way back in like the dark ages, it was hardware
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:47.020]   dependent.
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:50.140]   Yeah, T mobile started supporting it, but your phone had to support it as well.
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.020]   But when a phone does, it's awesome.
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:56.540]   In fact, Lisa was going back to Verizon, said, I'll miss that.
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:00.260]   It's really when we talk, it's, it's like, I'm at home on Wi-Fi.
[01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:01.700]   She's here on Wi-Fi.
[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:02.900]   It sounds like we're in the same room.
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:04.500]   It's like Skype or is like this, right?
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.060]   It's like Skype.
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:15.340]   So if you go to cellular network settings on your pixel or your Nexus, let me just see.
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:19.980]   You may have an additional update on this phone in a while.
[01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:20.980]   Really?
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.220]   You're going to take a look at our, I got an update last week.
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:23.220]   Are you pixeled?
[01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:25.220]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:28.900]   We got the February, am I the pope?
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:33.460]   Are you the old pope or the young pope?
[01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:37.980]   I got the security update, the February security update last week.
[01:04:37.980 --> 01:04:40.180]   You should have gotten that at least, Jeff.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.620]   So where am I going?
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:42.620]   The settings.
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:44.620]   Yeah, your network.
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:45.620]   Right.
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:46.620]   The cellular network settings.
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.540]   And then you should see enhanced LTE mode.
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:52.980]   If you, if you, it's apparently not everywhere.
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:55.660]   So I don't see it online, I don't think.
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:56.660]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:57.660]   Cellular networks.
[01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.460]   I only see data roaming.
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.380]   I don't have all that stuff.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.380]   Yeah.
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.660]   All that fancy stuff.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.100]   So maybe that's because I'm on Wi-Fi.
[01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:09.060]   Maybe you have to go outside.
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.020]   And I'm still, it's a setting.
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.020]   You'd probably put it on.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:15.420]   We think, right?
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:19.680]   It's only testing it on T-Mobile's network because Sprint and US Cellular don't have
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:20.680]   faulty support.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.080]   But if, if you're, you know, your phone will use it.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:27.580]   So if you move from one place to another, you're on.
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:28.580]   It just depends.
[01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:31.500]   You know how your phone chooses the best network.
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:35.060]   So if you, if you're always in a T-Mobile area where T-Mobile's strong, then you should
[01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:38.620]   be able to use it then.
[01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:47.540]   Um, can you now tell which network you're on?
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.540]   Well, if I, you have to use that.
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:50.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:51.540]   That program I told you about.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:52.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:53.540]   Yep.
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:54.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:55.540]   That was a smart signal.
[01:05:55.540 --> 01:05:56.540]   Spy signal spy.
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:57.540]   That's it.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.920]   Google is making blue jeans.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:00.920 --> 01:06:04.040]   Wait, is this the only vice blue jeans?
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:06.040]   No, it's because they're really blue blue.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.480]   Oh my God, they are blue.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.640]   Isn't that, isn't that horrible?
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.440]   That's to go with the really blue phone.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:15.880]   They have a new pixel that's really, really blue.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.520]   I like that color blue.
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.600]   And I wouldn't wear it.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.880]   If I wore it, I would, people would think I was the mailman.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.600]   That's about as bad as wearing red pants.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.600]   I have shoes that color.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.600]   Yeah, but you're a woman.
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.600]   You're allowed to.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:34.140]   Here's a, it's the color of the lower third.
[01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:36.280]   Andrew has a belt that color.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.980]   Leo, you would blend in.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:40.680]   It's the color of the lower third and the background behind you.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.680]   I could stand up and you wouldn't.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.680]   I was wearing pants.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:45.680]   Dear Google boss.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:48.360]   Or does it show you have a lower half of your body?
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:50.480]   Dear Google boss, my name is Chloe.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.440]   And when I am bigger, I would like a job with Google.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.240]   I also want to work in a chocolate factory and do swimming in the Olympics.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:59.400]   I go swimming Saturdays and Tuesdays.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:04.560]   My dad said I could sit on beanbags and go down slides and riding carts in a job in Google.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.120]   I like computers too.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.280]   And I have a tablet.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:11.440]   I play games on my dad, gave me a game where I have to move a robot up and down squares.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.880]   He said it will be good for me to learn about computers.
[01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:17.800]   My dad said he will get me a computer one day.
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.880]   I am seven years old.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:24.520]   My teachers tell my mom and dad I am very good in class.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.920]   So she wants a job.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.680]   She's from herford, UK.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:37.920]   And she got a response to her Pichai answer.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.920]   Here's the reply.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:43.440]   Dear Chloe, I look forward to receiving your job application when you are finished with
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.000]   school.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   Thank you so much for your letter.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.560]   I am glad you like computers and robots.
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:52.280]   And hope you will continue to learn about technology.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:53.840]   Cute, science and Darpechai.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.800]   Isn't that sweet?
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:56.800]   It is.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:58.800]   I don't know.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:00.800]   He could have set her a Chromebook if they were still making them.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:05.000]   You know, that would help better than that robot, than that tablet.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.400]   Oh, I thought you were talking about one of the Boston Dynamics robots.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.200]   Here you go, kid.
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:26.120]   German parents have been told destroy my friend Kayla.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:29.120]   She was spy on you.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:36.520]   German watchdog classifies the my friend Kayla doll as an illegal espionage apparatus and
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:41.600]   says shops and owners could face fines for selling her.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.160]   This is how you do IoT device security.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:48.960]   You actually have an effective stick and then companies will be like, oh, ladies, buy that
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.960]   or make that right.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:54.920]   I have visions of parents tearing off the head of the doll with a crying daughter.
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:57.200]   Ziegogel told me to do it.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:03.800]   Apparently in a German law, you may not sell manufacture or even possess surveillance devices
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:09.800]   disguised as other objects with the potential jail term up to two years.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:16.880]   This doll was one of the top 10 toys of the year in 2014 awarded that by the German Toy
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.240]   Trade Association.
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:22.240]   But get ready.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.120]   This is exactly what you're saying, Stacy.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.160]   Access to the doll's camera is completely unsecured.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:29.320]   There is no password.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:34.000]   Workers could access the doll via its Bluetooth connection from 15 meters away listening and
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:40.640]   on conversations as well as speaking directly to the child playing with it.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.640]   You know what?
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.640]   You're right, Stacy.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.560]   You just need a stick.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:48.880]   I mean, also this doll is creepy as heck.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.760]   My friend Kayla, does your daughter have my friend Kayla?
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:52.760]   No.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:53.760]   She does not have any--
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.880]   Did your daughter into this American girl?
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.280]   She was for like a hot second.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.280]   Mine was.
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.280]   Three of them.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.840]   Yeah, I had the complete set.
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:09.720]   We went to Chicago to the American Girl Doll store and museum and had surgery performed
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:14.680]   on one of them because she'd cut the hair off of the doll because she did not know that
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.680]   it didn't grow back.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.680]   She just thought, "Oh, you should give them a little trim."
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.760]   We got new hair put in.
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.760]   Mine?
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:26.240]   Anyway, there's a boy now, American Girl Doll Boy.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.240]   He plays the drums.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:31.280]   He's kind of like a super expensive accessory for your American Girl Doll.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.720]   Exactly, like Ken.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.360]   That's all Ken ever was.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.520]   But Ken was not $110.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.520]   Here's my friend Kayla.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.520]   You ready?
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.520]   ♪ I'm a million something ♪
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:42.520]   Ask Kayla almost anything.
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:44.160]   What's your name?
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.640]   My name is Kayla and yours is Abby.
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.280]   She understands you.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.280]   Yes.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.520]   And so does the neighbor next door.
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.200]   He's looking at you right now.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.760]   Let's play a game.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.760]   What's this?
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.760]   The Eiffel Tower in France.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.760]   Incredible.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:00.760]   Nice move.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:01.760]   Kayla's so soft.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.480]   And what are you wearing, little girl?
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.480]   I hear that a lot.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.480]   Hi, I heard that.
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.480]   It talks.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.480]   It's fun.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:08.480]   This is techno panic striking again.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.480]   Well, this is actually important.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:12.280]   If it's not secured, that's not good.
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.280]   Oh, not secured.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.280]   Yes, that's part true.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.440]   But having a camera in a doll.
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.600]   Yeah, I don't care about you.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.600]   But her parents buy it.
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:23.120]   Why is the camera available via Bluetooth?
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.080]   What is that all about?
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:27.360]   You couldn't send visual data via Bluetooth.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.360]   It's not unless it was really the result.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:32.680]   Your parents could spy or something.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.080]   I don't know.
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:37.720]   Google wants people to be able to see you while you're doing VR.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:45.640]   So they're experimenting with a fake face on your VR headset.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:46.800]   Can you pick a different face?
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:47.800]   Because that would be awesome.
[01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.640]   Well, you only get different eyes.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:53.240]   Well, that could still be the first photo.
[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:57.000]   They've also-- oh, that's so creepy.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.480]   Now, is that his face-- are they clear or no?
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.760]   It makes believe it's clear.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.400]   Oh.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.720]   So it's still an opaque headset, but your face
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.840]   appears on the front of it.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:15.240]   Because it's using a 3D scanned model of your face
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:19.640]   that they apply to the outside.
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:20.240]   Really?
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.720]   Oh, man.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.440]   Oh, dude.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:28.320]   I would totally buy little cat eyes or funny things,
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:30.880]   but I don't want my actual face.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.240]   Gaze is in blink, so it actually scans a variety of expressions.
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:37.240]   So you see his eyes are blinking and looking,
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:39.760]   and it also color-corrects the face
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.960]   to match the lighting of the rest of the user.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.520]   Oh, Jeff, you would be--
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.880]   You'd be white.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.240]   We should get this for you, Jeff.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.400]   This is weird.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.600]   It's just trying stuff.
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.400]   [SIGHS]
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.160]   Yeah, no.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:01.240]   The-- I don't think registration is-- oh, it is open for--
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:02.840]   so you have a week.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:07.360]   You have to-- February 27th till Monday to register for Google
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:12.560]   I/O. They're, of course, going to do a drawing again.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.160]   So you sign in, and let me see.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.160]   Should I do this?
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:18.680]   I probably should.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.520]   I'm sure it already has.
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:20.120]   I'm already signing.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.200]   I'm already here to have.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.480]   OK.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.040]   Yeah, but I want to get press.
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.920]   I don't want to-- or should I apply anyway?
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:29.040]   They're not free, right?
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:29.880]   No, they're not free.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.760]   We want to do Google I/O--
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.600]   do our show from Google I/O again this year if we can.
[01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.320]   Jeff will be there, probably.
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:38.120]   Talk to your buddies at Google.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:38.440]   Buddies.
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:40.720]   I have not buddies at Google.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:45.000]   Now that Matt-- is Matt still running the Code for America
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:45.800]   group?
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.200]   See, the digital defense agent.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:49.440]   The defense digital.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.280]   Matt, he's still there.
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:52.040]   Yep.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:52.480]   Yep.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:55.280]   I talked about-- he's the boss of a couple of people I know.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.560]   Good.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.680]   So the Wall Street Journal, for a long time, when you
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:04.760]   clicked a link to the Wall Street Journal from Google News,
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.200]   you bypassed-- it was an end around the paywall,
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.960]   and you could read the article.
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.760]   First, click free.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.840]   It was a feature that Google offered to--
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:13.240]   Google--
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.240]   to sampling.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.280]   Do Google pay the journal for that?
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:16.880]   No, no, no.
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.240]   They offered it for sampling, so that you could
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.800]   get through--
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:21.280]   I see.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.960]   So it was a Google program.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.720]   It was a-- yeah, it was a Google option.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:25.480]   First, click free.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:29.280]   Wall Street Journal is pulling out of it.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:30.720]   So now you have to pay.
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:31.640]   There's just no way around.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:35.400]   Paywalls are a religion there.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.480]   I pay for the Wall Street Journal, so it's part of my--
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:40.000]   It's-- it did for a while.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:40.680]   A couple years ago.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.760]   I kind of have to for the show.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.240]   You're right.
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:47.080]   Oh, we could talk about Joanna Stern's article
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.240]   about what was it.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.200]   Oh, let's not talk about it.
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:54.720]   And it's about female-- it's about female assistance.
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.120]   But I realized I don't have it a opinion on it, so--
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.640]   Oh, OK.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:14:59.640]   Why--
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.440]   The problem with all female digital assistance, yeah.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:04.320]   Or where was it?
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:10.520]   I was told years ago that GPS in Italy had to be men,
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.840]   because the Italian men wouldn't listen to a woman
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:14.240]   giving directions.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:15.240]   Is that true?
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:17.000]   Is that true?
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.480]   I always thought that it was--
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.800]   it came from research.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.720]   And it turned out that this was debunked.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.720]   That fighter pilots were more likely--
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:29.800]   this goes back to the voices in the cockpit
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.360]   that would say things like, pull up, pull up.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:37.520]   They were always female, because men respond,
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.280]   like when they're blacking out or redding out,
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.840]   to female voices better than men.
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.840]   That gets their mother.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:49.720]   So that I was always told that's why in fighter pilot--
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:51.120]   they called her bitch and Betty.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.200]   Did you know that?
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.480]   Mm-hmm.
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.760]   Did we talk about that on the show?
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:55.400]   I think we did.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.560]   I feel like we have.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:59.160]   I was like, I've learned a lot about fighter pilots
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:00.400]   while participating in the show.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:03.080]   Show is all about the fighter pilots.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:06.600]   However, I have my Siri for my iPhone out with a male voice,
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.440]   because you have the choice.
[01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:12.680]   But you don't with Google, and you don't with Cortana,
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:13.920]   and you don't with the Echo, right?
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:15.280]   You're stuck with that one voice.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.760]   What does that say about you?
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:18.040]   You want to hang around with guys?
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:18.680]   War?
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:20.560]   See, this is the problem, right?
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.680]   Right here is the problem.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:23.480]   This is the problem.
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:24.560]   You can't have a man's voice.
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.000]   But I do.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.520]   Because your buddies will say--
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:29.480]   Oh, you like him better than her, huh?
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:30.680]   That's America.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:31.960]   That's where we are.
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.280]   For some reason-- actually, this is more of an issue,
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.000]   because I don't know if Joanna mentions it.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.040]   These female voices all sound a little snarky, don't they?
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:41.280]   And I--
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.400]   Siri sounds snarky.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.080]   I don't think the Echo sounds snarky,
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.680]   and Google doesn't sound really snarky.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.520]   I think they do that, because if what they're trying to do
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:53.000]   is bend over backwards not to sound all high.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.280]   I'm the female assistant.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.680]   I don't think so.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.160]   No, but it's not low.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.880]   Well, maybe it sounds like that to you,
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.280]   because you're thinking women should only sound available
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.120]   or angry?
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:04.840]   Yes.
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:06.760]   Isn't that the way?
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:09.080]   Because they don't sound that way.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.560]   A veil of art or angry.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.360]   Is that my choice?
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:16.840]   Well, that's how some people, that's how they view women.
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.160]   If they all were angry.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:21.240]   Yeah, no, yeah.
[01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:22.760]   Yeah, well, it's almost like they chose
[01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.840]   angry over available, right?
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:28.440]   Well, maybe not quite angry, more like passive aggressive.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.360]   She's not that way, though, or it's not that way.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.960]   You don't think Siri sounds that way?
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:36.360]   OK, Siri kind of does sometimes.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.160]   I'm sorry.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:37.840]   Well, let me see.
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:38.360]   OK.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.040]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.640]   I don't think that Google Assistant sounds that way.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.680]   You're right.
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:46.320]   And I can't remember what the echo--
[01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.600]   No, she just sounds kind of robotic.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:52.000]   I would almost prefer a robotic voice, actually.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:52.360]   They--
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.920]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.520]   They're robotic.
[01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.200]   They do sound robotic?
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.240]   I think they sound robotic.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:17:59.520]   Yeah, they say--
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.040]   I mean, I would never know if they sound like humans.
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:01.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:07.640]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:08.320]   Who are you?
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:11.960]   I know you're Google Assistant.
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:13.680]   And I know a lot of interesting things.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:14.680]   See, she's perky.
[01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.680]   That's perky.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.680]   Well, that's perky.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.680]   Well, that's full of sex.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:18.920]   She's friendly.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:19.440]   Friendly.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.400]   She's enthusiastic.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:28.440]   She's-- you figure that an Apple product would sound snotty.
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.360]   Yes.
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.280]   Yeah, it does figure, doesn't it?
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.160]   Kind of in their conscience.
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.160]   Consciousness.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:39.680]   Anything else?
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:40.640]   What should we talk about?
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:43.280]   I got-- I'm just looking at other stories.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:44.720]   Oh, there's a stuff here.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.320]   Did you see that there--
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:51.520]   we found a sun with seven Earth-sized--
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.200]   That excited me.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:52.960]   I watched some of that.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.280]   That's very exciting.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.080]   Until I realized that they said a jet speed would take 44 million
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:58.720]   years to get there.
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:18:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.200]   It's--
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:00.880]   Well, that's a jet speed.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.560]   No one's going to travel through space at jet speed.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:06.040]   It's 40 light years away.
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.840]   It's quite-- it's a long way away.
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:12.560]   It's long enough that that's why these people haven't visited us.
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:14.720]   It's a long trip.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:16.880]   They need to get it like a camper van.
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:20.720]   So what I want to know is if it's a red dwarf, does that mean
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:25.600]   that the light you get is red?
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.400]   Uh, it's red--
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.680]   Red-ur.
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:29.240]   Red-ur.
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.200]   So it's just a--
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.200]   Really?
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.200]   It's a cool universe.
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:36.480]   I just read a long article by Yonatan Zungar, the Google engineer.
[01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.480]   Which is greatest.
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:38.480]   Who is--
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:39.480]   The greatest.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:42.240]   Who is explaining-- it really goes the long way around to explain
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:45.880]   why barns are painted red.
[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.320]   That's the kind of thing you do.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:52.120]   In that, I learned that for life at least as we know it,
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:57.600]   there's a very fairly narrow range of colors from the sun.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:20:02.360]   And of course, we have evolved to see that range of colors,
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:06.240]   not ultraviolet, not infrared, but the colors--
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:09.640]   the primary, main colors from the sun.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:18.680]   And then it goes on to explain because of the life cycle of stars
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:23.200]   and supernovas and novas that there's
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:30.720]   a lot of iron oxide, a preponderance of iron oxide in the Earth's crust.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:36.400]   And it turns out iron oxide is a perfect pigment for red paint.
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:38.640]   And because it's plentiful, it's cheap.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:42.760]   And that's why barns are painted red.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.400]   And not purple, because you've got to get purple from slugs.
[01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:48.800]   I thought it was sea snails.
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:49.800]   What did I do with the sun?
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.480]   Yeah, sea snail mucus.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.680]   What did I have to do with the sun?
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.760]   Yeah, where did the sun go?
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.320]   I get the iron, me.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.000]   Well, what I'm saying is if these are Earth--
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.960]   they're Earth-sized, and they do believe these are--
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:06.480]   at least several of them are Goldilocks temperatures, right?
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:09.760]   Well, that really limits the range of colors that the sun could be.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:15.320]   It could be slightly redder than ours, but not too much redder.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.920]   So all of our cheap red barn paint we could bring there,
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.000]   and it would still be reddish.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.960]   Well, that's what's interesting.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:27.160]   If aliens have eyes, they probably see the same colors we do,
[01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:28.000]   or something close.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   I don't know.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.600]   Well, no, dogs and other animals see in infrared,
[01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.720]   but I don't know if dogs see in infrared.
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.600]   But other life forms on the Earth and evolved.
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:39.880]   Into different ways.
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:43.440]   Yeah, for their particularly niche.
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.280]   Super cool stars known as red dwarfs have become popular
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:49.400]   for exoplanet hunters, because you
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.200]   can see the planets better.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.080]   The sun's aren't so bright.
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:57.080]   That's like the joke about the drunk looking for his quarter.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:22:00.560]   He's looking under the light, because he can see better.
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:00.920]   Yes.
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.720]   Yes.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:05.680]   That's me and-- that guy at exoplanet hunters.
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:06.920]   That's a dad joke.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:11.280]   Definitely a dad joke.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:11.880]   OK.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:15.040]   There's an AMA with the NASA scientists.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:15.880]   He's not cool.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:16.360]   He'll do that.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:16.880]   It's very open.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:17.560]   It's very nice, yeah.
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:22.240]   NASA is really good at this, because they realize
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.880]   if they're going to get funding, they better
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.200]   be good at marketing and outreach.
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:29.200]   They should find a really easy to get to asteroid
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:31.560]   with lots of very expensive metals on it.
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.600]   Because that's what Trump would put them to use for.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.120]   That's what we want.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.680]   Well, gold would be the best.
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:41.200]   Gold is the best color.
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.520]   You know, what are some of the minerals
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.720]   we're running out of?
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:45.760]   Like, well, helium--
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:49.560]   Actually, water would be a good choice these days.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.640]   The transporting water from space
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.280]   is going to be very expensive.
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.760]   Well, the thing about the desalization plants--
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.280]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.680]   These seven planets, they're much closer to each other.
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:05.520]   They're five times the distance from Earth to the moon.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:10.040]   So you could export things from one planet to the next.
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:14.280]   You could get all pissed off and move to the next planet.
[01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:15.480]   Trump's president?
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:16.720]   I'm moving out of here.
[01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:18.360]   I'm going to another planet.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.120]   I'm going to another planet.
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:22.360]   All right, now--
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.680]   Go ahead.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:27.160]   I just wanted to say, somebody said to the scientists,
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.600]   that was your chance to use the phrase
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.200]   prime directive in a serious way.
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.400]   You blew it.
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.520]   The prime directive is you can't do anything
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.320]   to change the civilization of the planet.
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:39.040]   So then the scientist comes back and says,
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:40.680]   LOL, we don't have a prime directive.
[01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:43.480]   But we do have a planetary protection policy.
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:44.040]   Really?
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.800]   It's sort of like the prime directive, but very real.
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:49.920]   Basically, we don't want to go looking for life only
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:52.360]   to find that we brought it with us from Earth.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.600]   That's kind of the same thing.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:54.600]   Yeah.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:57.160]   Oh, oh, hold on.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.640]   This just in.
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:23:59.640]   This just in.
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:04.280]   Somebody did a profile in the woman in charge of that.
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:05.600]   And it's awesome.
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.040]   Here it is.
[01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.040]   I think it's this one.
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.920]   Let me just make sure.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:10.240]   It's a woman in charge of it.
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:13.080]   And she talked to this thing in this profile
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:17.680]   about how basically everybody hates her.
[01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:18.960]   Oh, it's wired.
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:19.480]   It is.
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:20.760]   The article headline is,
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:21.840]   "Marshans might be real.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:25.440]   That makes Mars exploration way more complicated."
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.160]   And it's from last year.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:30.160]   And this woman named like, I think it's Cassie Conley,
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.480]   basically, is in charge.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:35.880]   This is her job is to prevent NASA
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.560]   from contaminating life on Earth.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:38.000]   Oh, really?
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.880]   They hate her because she comes in and she's like,
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:43.280]   "Nope, we got to spend 10 more hours."
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:45.840]   She's like fixing this so people don't,
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.600]   so we don't bring bacteria to Mars.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:49.000]   Good for her.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:49.600]   Isn't that cool?
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.760]   I thought this was cool.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:52.520]   Yeah, Cassie, you're right.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:56.200]   Cassie Conley.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:56.680]   So.
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.360]   There are a lot of women in NASA, actually.
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.200]   We've interviewed--
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.280]   Did you see hidden figures?
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.080]   Yes, no, I didn't.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.960]   But I saw the trailer.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.120]   Does that count?
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.360]   No, you should go see it.
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:09.360]   I took my daughter.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.120]   It's on my list.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:12.360]   Yes, it would be a good thing to take your daughter to,
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.440]   absolutely.
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:17.240]   All right, that was my excitement over Lady at NASA,
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.960]   whose job it is to ruin people's lives.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:23.760]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:27.960]   Oh, we didn't talk about Uber.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:28.720]   Oh, boy.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.040]   You read that was unbelievable.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.120]   So an Uber--
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:39.880]   engineer at Uber wrote a medium post talking about--
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.920]   she no longer is at Uber--
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:46.600]   talking about her experiences with Uber HR
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:49.240]   and sexual harassment.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.320]   And while she was there--
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:57.680]   not only Susan J. Fowler, her name--
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.880]   not only did she experience really just horrific--
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:02.000]   I guess it wasn't on medium.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:02.640]   It was on her blog.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:03.160]   I apologize.
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.840]   SusanJfally.com.
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:06.880]   A horrific experience.
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.760]   But she noted that female engineers declined--
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:14.080]   I think by the time she left from--
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.360]   was still not a massive proportion,
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:21.240]   but of over 150 engineers on the team that she was on,
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:26.640]   which was a software reliability, only 3% were women.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.880]   By the time she left.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:31.320]   Her organization was-- when she joined Uber,
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.160]   the organization she was part of was over 25% women.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.120]   3% was 2% left.
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.840]   She was trying to transfer to another engineering
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:38.880]   organization.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.440]   It had dropped down to less than 6%.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.040]   And she was there what?
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.400]   About a year, right?
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:48.280]   And in that time, it's just--
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:54.560]   it's almost Kafka-esque the way she was treated, the denial.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.520]   And then, of course, Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber,
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.560]   said, well, I can't believe--
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.960]   I'm shocked.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:03.880]   And they actually-- I mean, to their credit,
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:06.920]   they appointed Eric Holder, former attorney general,
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:11.120]   Eric Holder, to an independent investigatory commission
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.280]   committee to get to the bottom.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.720]   And Ariana tried to cover her tracks as a board member.
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:18.320]   Oh, she was serious.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.160]   She was furious.
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.800]   I mean, I saw her response right away--
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:23.720]   Tell us about her response.
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.880]   --that led me to Susan Fowler's piece.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.280]   I happened to read-- somebody tweeted the piece right
[01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.320]   after it went up.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:33.840]   So I happened to watch the storm, which was fascinating to see.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.080]   But I'm sorry.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:39.640]   We've known that Uber is a culture of jerks and worse.
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:40.240]   And begin it.
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.480]   It's the real-- really the programmers thing.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.840]   And the sad thing was that--
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:44.200]   The worse.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:47.400]   HR was protecting--
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.040]   The bros.
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:52.160]   The bros and managers who were acting completely,
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:56.400]   horrifically towards female employees.
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.960]   And it's just-- it's very sad.
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:02.880]   I got it.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:03.680]   It's terrible.
[01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:09.920]   So I think this is going to really add to the no Uber movement.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:10.600]   What is it called?
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:11.920]   The way you hashtag--
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:12.400]   Delete Uber.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:15.400]   Delete Uber.
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:17.680]   Well, Stacy can't have it anyway.
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:21.920]   There's no Uber in Austin because you got taxis.
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.040]   Oh, you know, guys coming in, people
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.240]   who are coming in for South by Southwest,
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.520]   let me just tell you right now.
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:31.320]   Right, Austin, Fair, Asin.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.400]   Good.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.840]   And wings with a G.
[01:28:33.840 --> 01:28:34.800]   Right, Austin.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:35.840]   Wings with a Z.
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.680]   Wings with a G.
[01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.360]   With the just wings.
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.800]   Wings with a Z.
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.080]   Wings-- well, I actually--
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.600]   the last time I was at South by Southwest,
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.760]   Uber was sponsoring the--
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.120]   Petty Cabs.
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:52.120]   My friend is a co-owner in that Petty Cabs business.
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:53.440]   It was a good deal for them.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.360]   Oh, I was-- I was fun.
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.000]   I rode it everywhere.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:01.680]   Wait, we have to go back to this because I read this
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:04.680]   and not only did my head feel like it was about to explode,
[01:29:04.680 --> 01:29:11.480]   but I feel like in watching some of the original comments--
[01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:13.640]   because I also saw this when it came--
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:19.360]   when it went out because this stuff I live for.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:25.040]   So many people were, A, saying to her, stop whining,
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.280]   or how do we know this is true?
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:26.800]   Really?
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.000]   Yes, yes.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:28.560]   She really used.
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.160]   She really used.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.160]   She had a lot of that.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.560]   But you still see this here is there's a lot of comments in here
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:37.080]   saying get thee to a lawyer, which--
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.720]   because that's the only way we're going to hold these guys
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:40.680]   accountable.
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:43.200]   In one sense, totally correct.
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.960]   But I think it is so frustrating when women
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:50.600]   report these things and the instant responses, well,
[01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:53.680]   God, why didn't you sue when we have seen women sue
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:57.960]   for sexual harassment and seen how hard it is?
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:58.760]   Yes.
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:02.200]   So I would like to say, yay, lady, for doing this.
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:06.760]   I have a friend who runs HR at a very--
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:09.160]   a large publicly traded company and has done a couple
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.640]   of these in the tech world.
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.440]   And she's like, I would never hire for anyone
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.960]   who's worked in an HR capacity at Uber.
[01:30:14.960 --> 01:30:17.280]   She's like, none based on this.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:20.240]   And that's what we need.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:23.240]   We need people like the board members say, because I'm sorry,
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:24.920]   this is not an isolated problem.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:28.720]   And this woman clearly paints how not an isolated problem
[01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.000]   it is.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.640]   But people who think they are engaging in quote, unquote,
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.520]   locker room talk in the workplace just freaking stop it.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:37.360]   It is--
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:40.080]   It is in raging.
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:41.840]   And there are so many women--
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:42.640]   I mean, we see this.
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.680]   We saw this on stage at the presidential debate.
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:47.960]   But it's not funny.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:49.440]   It's not helpful.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:54.000]   And if you do it, you are just alienating half the population
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:57.040]   around you, your customer base, and people like me
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.480]   who are way too aggressive, not too aggressive,
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:01.120]   who are really aggressive and will speak out.
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.120]   But--
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:03.200]   [GROANING]
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:05.080]   Well, it also makes me sad because this
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:10.240]   is why there's so little diversity in tech.
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:13.160]   It can be very hostile too, not just one of the minorities
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:14.080]   that are kind.
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:15.640]   It should make you angry.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:16.520]   Well, it makes me angry.
[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:18.800]   But it hurts everybody.
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:21.600]   It hurts-- it absolutely hurts everybody.
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:22.080]   Yep.
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.000]   People don't think that it hurts everybody.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.920]   Even if it's not about a self-- it's wrong.
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:29.480]   It's incredibly wrong.
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:36.320]   Diversity is not just a political point of view.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:39.640]   When it comes to tech, if you don't have a diverse workforce,
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:40.880]   you don't have diverse products.
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:43.560]   You don't have products that work for everybody.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:45.840]   You have products that work for programmers.
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:47.880]   And it's not good for the business.
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:50.640]   It's not good for us as users.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:51.040]   So even--
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:52.400]   Well, I do have that.
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.560]   Yeah, because people complaining about sexual assault
[01:31:54.560 --> 01:31:56.600]   and that sort of thing.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:57.680]   Was it the prone--
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:00.360]   You know, uber pronoun problem too.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.120]   All sorts of things.
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.400]   You know, a little big and little.
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:06.360]   But obviously what happened to her was very big
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:08.000]   and is a little shameful.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.840]   And you know, I think, writing a blog post,
[01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:12.280]   that's a pretty good way to get back at them.
[01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:12.880]   Oh, it was--
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.160]   It was well documented.
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:15.160]   I mean, she did a really well done.
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:16.560]   Really good job.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:20.880]   It wasn't-- you know, she had been documenting it all along.
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:24.600]   And at one point was told to stop doing that.
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:25.920]   Yes.
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:27.600]   Well, this is kind of different.
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:30.560]   So you remember the woman who complained about not having
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:35.240]   a living wage while working on customer service for--
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:36.360]   was it Airbnb?
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:40.400]   Was it-- help me out here, guys.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.080]   This is like a year and a half ago.
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:48.720]   It was in some Bay Area company.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:53.400]   And everyone got mad at that company for a hot second.
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:56.640]   And she kind of came across as more entitled
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:59.400]   than this woman who did a really good job, I guess,
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.800]   in that line.
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:02.240]   Anyway.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:08.700]   Yeah.
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:10.600]   And there's also the Ellen Chow--
[01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:11.280]   not Ellen Chow.
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:11.560]   She's--
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:12.280]   Ellen Powell.
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:13.360]   Ellen Powell, that's right.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.800]   Yeah, Bob.
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:18.160]   There's an example, by the way, of why women
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:19.840]   don't go to lawyers often.
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:22.920]   Because it can-- who did she sue?
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:24.320]   She went against--
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:25.640]   Planner Perkins?
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:27.160]   AP, that's right.
[01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:34.440]   And lost in a very brutal, repulsive trial.
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:38.360]   And it was damaging-- very damaging to her.
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.560]   That's why people don't.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.760]   She left Reddit then next, right?
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:44.440]   She went to Reddit, was there briefly.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.120]   And now she's running, as we know,
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.800]   because she was the one complaining at YC
[01:33:49.800 --> 01:33:51.480]   about Peter Thiel's presence.
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:56.120]   She's running that diversity focus startup with--
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:57.200]   I don't know if she's in YC.
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:59.000]   I think she is.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.280]   Anyway.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.200]   But that's exactly why you don't sue,
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:05.040]   because you don't want to go through that.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.560]   Right.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:07.600]   Among other reasons.
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:08.680]   Yeah, there are lots of reasons.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:09.200]   Yeah.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.000]   And it's not a good way to change culture.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.800]   The blog post worked.
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.040]   I think that was a good way to do it.
[01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:19.560]   It had to be really hard to write it without anger.
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:22.080]   It just let the facts speak for themselves.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:23.160]   It was really well-written.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:24.840]   It was very directed.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.760]   She deserved anger.
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.640]   She deserved a few effumes to the place.
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:29.640]   She didn't.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:30.160]   She didn't.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:33.000]   And of all the complaints that we've been seeing all along
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.560]   about Uber, this is the one that seems like this might do
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:39.480]   the most to either change the culture or bring Uber down,
[01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:41.280]   I think.
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:42.280]   We'll see.
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.280]   It's a pretty big company.
[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:45.120]   It's lots of funding.
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:46.480]   Yep.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:50.960]   Google is just having so much fun with artificial intelligence.
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:55.160]   It's new one is a music playing piano bot
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:58.280]   that digests whatever keyboard melodies you give it
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.920]   and tries to respond in kind.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.640]   It's called AI duet.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:05.360]   Hi.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.080]   I'm your Tom.
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.400]   He's a coder and musician.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.920]   This is an experiment called AI duet.
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:12.320]   It uses machine learning to let you
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:13.560]   play a duet with the computer.
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:17.960]   Wow.
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:18.800]   Making music using code is new.
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:20.640]   It's like dueling Vangios.
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:24.000]   But machine learning gives us a different way to go about it.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.280]   If I was trying to make AI duet with more traditional programming,
[01:35:27.280 --> 01:35:28.760]   I'd have to write out lots of rules.
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:32.760]   Do you feel like we're at the daisy-daisy moment?
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:33.280]   Yeah.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:38.200]   We're getting closer to Hal 9000.
[01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:38.680]   This is neat.
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:41.800]   This is-- your time did this in conjunction
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:45.600]   with the Creative Lab and Magenta, which is Google's open source
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:48.160]   computational music and art project.
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:49.640]   So I want to analyze tons of music
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:53.800]   to understand how it should continue on rather than a rule set
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:56.440]   and learn.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:58.720]   What about a-- I haven't seen this-- a phone app that
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:02.200]   wraps about what it sees through your phone's camera.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:05.400]   It's called Giorgio Cam.
[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:08.640]   This is another one from the same group, AI experiments.
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:09.960]   I haven't seen this one.
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:11.280]   Hi, I'm Eric.
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:11.800]   Hi.
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:12.480]   Hi, I'm Utah.
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.280]   Oh, it's Yotam.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:13.800]   He's back.
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:15.280]   There are coders and musicians.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.440]   With machine learning, you can now take a picture
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.720]   and have a computer tell you exactly what it sees.
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:22.080]   I wear glasses, vision care.
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.520]   We wanted to see if we could do something fun with this,
[01:36:24.520 --> 01:36:25.480]   and we had an idea.
[01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:28.360]   What if the computer turned the things that it saw into lyrics
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:29.480]   of a song?
[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:30.600]   It could even rhyme about them.
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:32.640]   We've got glasses in this spot.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.600]   Could be I wear, but maybe not.
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:35.760]   There are two parts.
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:37.840]   Human recognition for seeing things.
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:38.340]   Speechless.
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:39.520]   What can you why?
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.240]   This is just throwing up.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:42.000]   What can you why, everyone's so wild?
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:43.800]   We use the Cloud Vision API.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:46.280]   You can just send it a picture, and it returns labels
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:49.480]   for what it sees, along with the confidence scores.
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:51.800]   It started really getting fun when we brought in a song made
[01:36:51.800 --> 01:36:55.040]   by one of our musical heroes, Giorgio Moroder.
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:55.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:57.400]   Oh, right.
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:37:00.440]   And for the computer's voice, we used an open source project
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:04.000]   called Mary TTS, combined with the Web Audio API.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.240]   This led us out effects to the computer's voice
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:07.680]   and sync it to the beat.
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:09.440]   We've got glasses in this spot.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:10.920]   Pop, pop, pop.
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:12.960]   We had our friends try it out, and had a lot of fun
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:14.400]   pointing it at all kinds of things.
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.520]   Is that food I see?
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:16.680]   Shee, shee, shee.
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:18.000]   Just pretty close.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:19.160]   I'm too mean.
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.160]   That's plot string instruments on my screen.
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.200]   Screen, screen.
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:24.080]   Could be profession, but maybe not.
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:25.080]   Nah, nah.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:26.400]   Looks like world to me.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:28.840]   Me, me.
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:30.840]   Taking that camera operator you've got.
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:31.840]   No!
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:33.840]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.400]   We call it Giorgio Cam.
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:37.160]   And it's just one example of how you can use machine.
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.160]   I want it.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:39.160]   I want it.
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:40.160]   How do I get it?
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.440]   You can play with it and get the code at g.co/aixurbs.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:43.560]   That's how.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:46.800]   g.co/aixperiments.
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.840]   It's on GitHub.
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:51.080]   Anything else you guys want to talk about before we
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:55.120]   take a break and do our picks and numbers and all that stuff?
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:38:00.560]   Oh, wow.
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:02.640]   That was really sharp.
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.640]   Yeah, you pissed off some people that you put that tool in here.
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:06.560]   I really did with that five kilohertz tone.
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.040]   That really annoying people.
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:09.680]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:10.680]   That was really annoying.
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:13.200]   I really apologize.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.120]   I didn't want to come back.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:16.280]   No.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:17.520]   I don't have anything.
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:21.840]   I feel like we're always on the brink, Stacey.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:26.840]   Any given show of it being your last show, of you just walking out
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:29.040]   the door as I'm never coming back.
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:30.640]   Is that my-- am I an error on that?
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.360]   Or is that actually true?
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:32.880]   No, no.
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:33.960]   I love coming on.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.200]   I'm a banter-y, teasy kind of person.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:39.200]   We didn't talk about Wi-Fi.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:41.000]   It's going to be, well, do that in my pick.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.040]   How about that?
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:43.040]   OK.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.760]   So I did find the taxonomy of fake news
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:48.120]   that Clare Wardell did.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.280]   It's on the rundown.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:50.040]   I see it as I just--
[01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:50.960]   You want to look at it?
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:51.840]   No, just real quick.
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:53.480]   Real quick, it's kind of interesting.
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:56.480]   Authentic material used in the Ron context.
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:00.920]   Imposter news sites designed to look like brands we already know.
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:03.320]   Fake news sites, its own category.
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:10.640]   Fake information, manipulated content, parody content.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:11.920]   So there's a range.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.560]   And not all of it is fake news.
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.080]   I think that's much--
[01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:17.840]   I really was so uncomfortable with this whole fake news thing.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:20.360]   And it couldn't quite put my finger on it.
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:22.200]   But I think the taxonomy helps a lot,
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:25.200]   because not all fake news is created equal.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:26.600]   That's just kind of the economic piece.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:29.560]   There's also the political piece, which is propaganda.
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:30.520]   Right.
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:31.440]   Propaganda--
[01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:32.680]   Necessarily lies.
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:35.640]   It's slanted, but it's not necessarily lies.
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:39.120]   In fact, it's best if it has a grain of truth in it.
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:40.760]   You're bringing nuance to this argument,
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:42.800]   and that's like bringing a knife to a gunfight.
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:44.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:46.760]   I don't know if this is going to help anything.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.920]   I've given up.
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:50.360]   I've decided to--
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:55.240]   my new motto is, take a nap.
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.720]   No worries, is I'm taking a nap.
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:58.960]   Mine is shopping.
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:39:59.600]   Go shopping.
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.120]   See you online at Nordstrom's.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.440]   Keep the economy going.
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:05.640]   I'm going to shop with my Google home.
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:09.120]   All right.
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:09.920]   Yes, this is good.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:10.960]   I'm going to read this.
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:12.520]   This is good.
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:14.480]   I mean, is it helpful to have a taxonomy?
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:15.240]   I think it is.
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.200]   I think so.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:19.880]   It's certainly helpful in the process of filtering.
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:22.120]   If you saw Don Lemon on CNN, somebody came on
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:23.920]   and just wanted to disagree with something.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:25.280]   You see the guy said this--
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:26.680]   He walked out.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:28.440]   Lemon said, you know, that's--
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:29.600]   He's ended the show.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.400]   He said, I'm done with that.
[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:32.320]   That's it.
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:35.040]   Just because you don't like something doesn't make it fake.
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:39.200]   And he not only kicked the guy off, he ended the show,
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:39.960]   which--
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:41.840]   There was their genetic.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:44.120]   I'm not a huge Don Lemon fan, but Don did great.
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:45.440]   I am now.
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.320]   I've done that, but this is a podcast.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:48.440]   It's like it'll walk out.
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:51.080]   But I can't.
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.000]   I mean, that's CNN.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:52.520]   They got this.
[01:40:52.520 --> 01:40:54.160]   Something's got to come back after this break.
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.760]   Stacy's going to do that to us next week.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.120]   I know.
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:56.840]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.280]   That's the only moment she said, you guys--
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:58.960]   Well, I can--
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.560]   Have fake hair and just boom, gone.
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:04.600]   Yeah, just stuck on a thick--
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:04.960]   Oh, wait.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:06.920]   No, I've got a better solution.
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.080]   Ooh.
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:09.840]   Oh, hey.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:12.400]   You're not the only one that can do that.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:19.120]   All right.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:21.080]   Let me-- actually, I shouldn't have done that
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:23.680]   because I have to wrap this thing up.
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:27.800]   Our show today brought to you by a little robot pal
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:29.680]   that's happy to be with you.
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:32.000]   And you will be happy to have-- by your side,
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.040]   I'm talking--
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.400]   Curry for Mayfield Robotics.
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:37.320]   So cute.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:39.080]   I was just looking at my pictures of Curry.
[01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:40.920]   And I took pictures of all the Curry prototypes.
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:42.640]   It was so much fun.
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:44.680]   We went down to Mayfield Robotics and visited.
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:46.600]   And I have to say, I didn't really
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:50.600]   get how lovable Curry was until I really encountered her.
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:53.440]   Anybody went to CES and spent some time with Curry.
[01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:54.720]   Probably will agree.
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:55.320]   She blinks.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.200]   She nods.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:57.080]   She doesn't talk.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:57.960]   They were very smart.
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:02.040]   They made some decisions about Curry, not to make it too
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:04.840]   humanoid so that it stays away from that uncanny valley,
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:06.880]   that creepy effect.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.400]   She's not-- she's not anything but creepy.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:10.560]   She kind of reminds me of Rosie from the Jetsons.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:11.760]   She's kind of tubby.
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:14.160]   But she's got a lot of sophisticated technology.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:16.920]   She's got sensors in her head, cameras.
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:18.680]   She's got radar.
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:22.120]   She's got a heart light, like ET, that can light up
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:24.640]   in any color of the rainbow.
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:27.640]   Special sensors that keep her from falling downstairs.
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:31.240]   But she's got treads in her feet so she can go over door jam.
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:32.720]   She can wander around your house.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:34.160]   She can patrol.
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:37.880]   As she patrols, she makes a radar map of your home.
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:40.640]   And then you can assign names to the room.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:41.560]   So you can say, this is the--
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:43.640]   Curry, this is the kitchen.
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:45.160]   Curry, this is the living room.
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:46.880]   And then you can say things like,
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:49.600]   Curry, go check the couch in the living room
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:51.040]   and see if the dog's on it.
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:53.680]   And send me a picture back because Curry's camera
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.280]   is connected to the internet.
[01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:58.800]   Curry also has very good stereo speakers and a ray
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:42:59.440]   mics in there.
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:07.400]   She's got four MEMS based ray mics so that she can hear and respond,
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:09.880]   play music, listen to podcasts.
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:11.680]   She can come and wake you up in the morning.
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:14.160]   And then you can say, OK, Curry, continue to play my podcast.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:15.560]   I want to keep listening to Twig.
[01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:17.040]   But follow me around.
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:18.840]   And you can go make breakfast, brush your teeth.
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:20.720]   And she'll just follow you around.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.600]   If she stands in groups, she'll look from person
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.800]   and she recognizes people.
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:28.600]   Very expressive eyes.
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.360]   And her beeps and boops, pretty soon you start to--
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.400]   and this is smart.
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:34.280]   You project onto her.
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:36.400]   This personality, it's so cool.
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.080]   And of course, when she gets low on battery,
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:41.200]   she's smart enough to go back to her home dock and charge up.
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:45.120]   Kids lover, you can have--
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.960]   Do you have a video over with the cats?
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:48.640]   I don't.
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.880]   I didn't bring her home.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:50.720]   We went down there.
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:52.000]   I'm on the list.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.480]   You can actually get on the list if you want.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:59.680]   A pre-order, you have to put in a totally refundable $100
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:01.200]   deposit.
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.720]   And I have one because I told him I want the first one off
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:04.320]   the line.
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:09.000]   599 remaining a time of shipment, which will be later this year,
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.760]   probably around holidays or just before, maybe the fall,
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:14.600]   including taxes and shipping.
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:16.360]   Curry, K-U-R-I.
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:21.760]   You can find out more at haycurry.com, H-E-Y-K-U-R-I
[01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:22.640]   dot com.
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:24.320]   This will be-- I really think.
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:28.400]   I believe your kids will later in life when they grow up.
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.040]   They'll say, I remember when we got our first robot.
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.760]   It was in 2017.
[01:44:31.760 --> 01:44:32.680]   She was so cute.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:33.560]   I loved her so much.
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:35.000]   Curry.
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000]   And then I went to college.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.080]   And she couldn't come with me or whatever.
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:45.640]   Hey, Curry, H-E-Y-K-U-R-I dot com.
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:46.280]   Take a look.
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:48.640]   And if you want, put down a deposit $100.
[01:44:48.640 --> 01:44:50.720]   And it's completely refundable to get
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:53.000]   Curry later this year.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000]   I think it's so cool.
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:56.120]   I'm excited about this.
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:02.000]   Now, now, let us talk--
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.320]   I'm just going to look stacy.
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:10.080]   OK, I see what you're going to do.
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:13.960]   But we can open the conversation about this.
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:16.040]   This is actually-- yeah, can John, can you plug this in?
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:18.160]   Because I want to show you the screen on this.
[01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:22.720]   This is the Amplify mesh Wi-Fi from Ubiquity.
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:25.840]   Ubiquity pretty much created this category
[01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:28.760]   for enterprise of mesh Wi-Fi routers.
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:30.000]   And they're really great.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.920]   A lot of people use them.
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:34.600]   Wouldn't you say Meraki created it?
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:35.360]   Meraki did.
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:38.280]   But Ubiquity has been around longer than Meraki.
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:38.880]   And--
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:39.560]   Oh.
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.560]   Yeah.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:41.080]   Really?
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:41.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:44.240]   Ubiquity's been in business for a very long time.
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.720]   And the problem with the Ubiquities,
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:46.640]   they're used in enterprise.
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:48.840]   We've used them for years.
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:51.640]   Well, they started out making equipment for Wisps.
[01:45:51.640 --> 01:45:52.800]   And I knew about them.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:54.640]   But I didn't realize they were doing enterprise routers
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:55.440]   that long ago.
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:56.160]   I think so.
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:57.080]   When did Meraki start?
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:46:00.080]   See, I remember Meraki when their original business--
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:04.080]   Yeah, their original business was to be captive portals, right?
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.040]   You would have a Meraki router in your house
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:07.360]   and it would become a captive portal
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:08.960]   that you could share with other people.
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:10.480]   And then they pivoted.
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:11.560]   They pivoted.
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:12.320]   Oh, OK.
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:14.040]   Because--
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:14.360]   All right.
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:16.160]   In any event, we don't have to debate that.
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:18.120]   But Ubiquity's been around a long time.
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:18.880]   Let's put it that way.
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:21.160]   They make all sorts of great network gear.
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:24.840]   And the enterprise Ubiquity Wi-Fi is the best.
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:26.320]   But they never made a home unit.
[01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:27.520]   And in fact, they're enterprise stuff.
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:29.000]   A lot of people used in their homes,
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:29.840]   but very complicated.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:32.440]   I don't have Java-based browser on a PC to control them
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:33.280]   and so forth.
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:37.720]   So they've created now a home version.
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:38.440]   Now, there's two.
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:42.400]   There's the Amplify HF and the Amplify HD.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.080]   This is the HD.
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:46.560]   So a little over $300 for three units,
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:47.600]   like a lot of these meshes.
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.480]   This is the base unit.
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:52.320]   It has a WAN port for your--
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.760]   go to your cable modem.
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:55.520]   And then it has-- or your DSL modem.
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:46:58.880]   And then it has four ethernet ports, gigabit ethernet ports.
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:00.600]   It also has a USB jack.
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:03.440]   And I'm guessing that that's--
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.480]   actually, I didn't read up on it,
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:06.640]   but I would guess you could put a hard drive in there.
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.800]   It's very nicely designed.
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:10.800]   I would say of all of them, this is the prettiest,
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:13.800]   including an OLED screen that you can tap.
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.200]   It'll tell you the time of day once you've configured it.
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:18.160]   It helps you configure it on the screen.
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:21.680]   But it also-- if you tap it, you can see how much throughput.
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:23.960]   So you can see how much bandwidth you've used this month.
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:26.280]   Right on the front screen, you can see it's IP address.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:28.160]   A lot of the information you'd want to know
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:29.840]   is available right there on the front of the router.
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:31.400]   And when it's not doing that, it's
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:33.600]   just showing you a nice time of day and so forth.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:37.760]   It has a little-- you can turn all this stuff up, off, or down.
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:38.840]   Totally control it with the app.
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:41.840]   It has a good Android and iOS app.
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:43.960]   And it's got a nice, lighted base.
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:48.240]   You mentioned this, Stacey, I know you've had the Amplify.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:50.760]   You mentioned these are the base units.
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:54.480]   And the pro on these is there's no wires.
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:56.440]   It just plugs right into the wall.
[01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:58.320]   And these just snap off.
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:00.840]   This is just a magnetic ball joint
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:03.400]   so that the antenna not only can be aimed,
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.800]   but if somebody-- some kid comes along and hits it,
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:09.160]   it doesn't break it off, which is great.
[01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.400]   The base unit, as I said, for a little more than--
[01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:16.080]   I think 325 includes two satellite units.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:18.320]   I would say the-- stick with the HD,
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:21.280]   because this is the one that does AC-- 802.11ac.
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:25.680]   The other one only does ABG and N. This does all of them, plus AC.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:31.680]   It also has more MIMO antennas, more frequencies.
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:33.760]   I set it up in our home where we already
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:36.840]   have the other systems, other Wi-Fi systems,
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.080]   because they have two networks.
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:40.200]   And I've always had problems with clashing.
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:42.040]   But one of the things that this is--
[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:44.480]   it's great to test in that kind of environment,
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:47.040]   because many people do have congested Wi-Fi environments
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:48.960]   from neighbors and houses nearby.
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:52.040]   This did a very good job of finding unoccupied channels
[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:54.560]   and picking the right place to be so that it did not
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:58.280]   interfere with the existing Wi-Fi setup.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:48:59.600]   I found it worked quite well.
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.880]   I was really impressed with it.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:04.080]   The price is good compared to others.
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:07.480]   Ubiquity has a very good name in this business.
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:10.400]   And I thought the software was excellent.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:12.080]   This is the easiest one to set up.
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:14.720]   You don't have to configure the satellites at all.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:17.680]   You just plug them in, and they work,
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:19.640]   which I don't know why the other guys don't do that.
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:21.360]   But it's fantastic.
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:25.120]   It updated itself automatically the moment I plugged it in.
[01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:26.000]   And it worked quite well.
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:27.800]   Throughput was good.
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:31.640]   It was pretty comparable to the ERO, to the Google.
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:33.800]   They're all about the same.
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.160]   The best throughput I've gotten and the best speed I've gotten
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:39.600]   is one that isn't really a mesh system exactly.
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:41.520]   And that's the one you're using right now.
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:44.680]   Are you ready to talk about the Orbeez or not?
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:46.000]   Yeah, I could talk about them.
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:46.520]   Yeah.
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:51.840]   I-- and we actually talked about them on the show
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:53.080]   that we recorded this morning, too.
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.160]   So you can just skip this part of the podcast
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.040]   if you listen to me there.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:04.520]   But I found that the EROs did a better job providing coverage
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:06.600]   to all areas of my house.
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:09.400]   But I think it's because my house is long and skinny.
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:12.000]   So I've got this running in my office.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.760]   But I had originally had it running--
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:16.400]   this is the satellite and the other ones
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:19.360]   downstairs in the middle of my house.
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:21.800]   So I had this one in the middle of the house.
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:24.960]   And it didn't quite reach the camera in the backyard.
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:26.080]   So I had to move it.
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:28.640]   And then I saw less throughput.
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:30.240]   You know what my experience has been?
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:34.040]   Because I've tried the ERO, the Google,
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:38.360]   the new Amplify and the Orbeez is,
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:40.720]   I think it really depends on your house a lot.
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:42.800]   Which one's going to be best for you?
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:45.160]   Because I use the EROs at my mom's house.
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.280]   And it was spectacular.
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:52.360]   But because of whatever the configuration of our house
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:55.080]   and because of where the base station had to be,
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:59.240]   the ERO was not as good as the Orbeez.
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:50:59.440]   So--
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:00.840]   Yeah.
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:03.240]   I think that's-- for our house, it's
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:05.880]   imagine a skinny rectangle.
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:09.520]   So in the middle of it is we have the main router.
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:11.560]   And then for the EROs, we have two set up
[01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:14.360]   on each end of the rectangle.
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:17.480]   And that works really well for us everywhere.
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:18.080]   And I've got it.
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:19.920]   I mean, because I have to have coverage outside,
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:23.640]   inside, up on the roof, down in the garage, it's ridiculous.
[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:25.880]   And that works.
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:28.920]   The Orbeez doesn't give me full enough coverage.
[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:30.080]   Yeah.
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:32.400]   I did find that the Orbeez was the fastest
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:33.400]   of all of them.
[01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:35.960]   I've had the fewest problems with the Orbeez.
[01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:38.120]   Orbeez doing something interesting.
[01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:41.720]   It's dual channel as are all of them, I think,
[01:51:41.720 --> 01:51:43.520]   are 2.4 and 5 gigahertz.
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:48.360]   And what's nice compared to other more traditional systems,
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:50.240]   these all these mesh routers automatically
[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:51.480]   switch back and forth.
[01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:53.880]   They really find the best path for you,
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:55.560]   depending on where you are.
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:56.320]   So if you're--
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:51:58.080]   Go ahead.
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:00.600]   I was going to say if your gear isn't optimized for that--
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:03.200]   so this is actually something I had with the Canary Flex
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:04.720]   outdoor camera.
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:07.560]   And I've had it with the light switch that I've installed.
[01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:08.760]   They don't actually work.
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:12.160]   Their Wi-Fi isn't configured to work well with the ERO.
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:15.840]   And I talked to ERO about why that is.
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:20.120]   And they blame it on the way that people are implementing Wi-Fi.
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:21.160]   I think that that's true.
[01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:23.000]   It's a mess.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:23.360]   It is.
[01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:24.000]   Well, it is.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:25.880]   I mean, a lot of the connected device makers
[01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:28.520]   have to do extra work because they're
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:30.600]   used to Wi-Fi being one way in mesh
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:32.560]   is just a totally different animal for them.
[01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:34.640]   Right.
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:35.680]   So I was going to ask it.
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.200]   Do you ever get to the point?
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:38.600]   Is it foolish to everything that there's
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:39.960]   kind of an open standard for these things?
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:41.480]   And you can mix and match them?
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:42.160]   I think the issue is--
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:43.760]   Called 802.
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:45.440]   I think there is a standard.
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:47.280]   There's also a wireless distribution standard.
[01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:49.760]   The problem is that these specs are loosely written.
[01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:54.600]   And companies are very widely go-off spec.
[01:52:54.600 --> 01:52:57.000]   So it's just inconsistent.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.960]   And that's the problem.
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:01.000]   It didn't use to matter.
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.400]   Only some kid-- Apple is really good at making the best
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.720]   use of the available Wi-Fi and channel hopping.
[01:53:06.720 --> 01:53:08.080]   Their devices are.
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:09.520]   They put a lot of attention on that
[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:11.960]   because they're freaking Apple.
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:13.800]   If you've got--
[01:53:13.800 --> 01:53:15.320]   Well, I'm going to disagree with you.
[01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:20.000]   I have the most recent airport extreme and retired it
[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000]   because I never was able to get it worked properly in my house.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.960]   And that's why I have been on this quest.
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:27.760]   And I've tried every single-match solution.
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:30.120]   And every one of them worked better than the Apple Airport
[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:30.680]   extreme.
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:31.600]   There's also the official issue.
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.040]   I was talking about the devices.
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:35.120]   Oh, the computers?
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.000]   Sorry, the computers and phones and tablets.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:38.360]   A lot of people know.
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:40.960]   In fact, Apple's-- several times, Apple iPads
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:45.720]   have been banned from campuses because of how they handle Wi-Fi.
[01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:48.120]   They're problematic.
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:49.680]   They are sticky.
[01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:51.960]   Yes.
[01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:54.600]   They pick a band and they hug that band like nobody's business.
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:56.600]   So yes, I think Apple works well,
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:00.560]   but it doesn't necessarily play well with others.
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:02.440]   You know what I mean?
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:05.200]   If you're the only person using it, it's fine.
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:05.840]   Well, yeah.
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:08.320]   OK.
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:10.480]   Anyway, so--
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:11.200]   So I don't know.
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:14.000]   There isn't a kind of a flat recommendation
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.320]   because it's just-- I think it is very specific to your terrain.
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:21.200]   Having tried them all, I really like
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:25.000]   the Amplify in terms of looks, in terms of convenience.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.240]   You made a good point a few weeks ago
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:29.800]   that because the base unit is plugging to the wall,
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:32.080]   you really don't have the luxury of putting them high up
[01:54:32.080 --> 01:54:34.200]   where they'll work better.
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:37.120]   And that's true unless you have high up plugs for some reason.
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:38.440]   But I didn't find that a problem.
[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:39.520]   Boy, it was so easy.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:42.600]   This was easily the best setup of any of them.
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:44.080]   And I think it works quite well.
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:45.920]   I'm going to give this to Megan Moroni.
[01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:48.280]   She's buying a new house and she needs a system.
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:49.760]   And I'm going to give that to her.
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:52.920]   The Google Home has gone to my daughter's house.
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:54.120]   My mom has the ERO.
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:56.480]   And of all of them, the Orbi worked best for me
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:58.320]   in terms of raw speed.
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:54:59.680]   And I've been very happy with that.
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:01.680]   Now, Lynxis has a new system.
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:03.680]   A new one that I'm getting that one, actually.
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:06.040]   So you and I are both trying all of these things.
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:08.160]   Which one is best for you right now?
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:10.960]   Right now, it's still--
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:11.680]   it's hard to say.
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:14.200]   So the ERO is probably the best from a coverage standpoint.
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:18.040]   I actually really like the Omen, the Secureify ones from Omen.
[01:55:18.040 --> 01:55:20.720]   They're mesh networking capabilities, not as good,
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:22.560]   but they have some really nice software features.
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:26.320]   And I don't have too much respect for ubiquity
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:29.880]   and the high level stuff that they do.
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.920]   So that's why I feel like this is probably
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:34.320]   a good choice in terms of keeping it up to--
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:36.360]   You know, they're Edge Max Router, though.
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:38.560]   If you've got-- it's an industrial one, not
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:39.880]   or a non-industrial enterprise one.
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:45.160]   Their Edge Max Router has been hit by the Marai botnet.
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:47.160]   So if you have one of those, make sure you change
[01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:48.160]   the default password.
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:51.720]   And we actually have been recommending on security now
[01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:56.240]   ubiquity is Edge Router X, which is a $50 four-port switch
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:59.160]   that has amazing capabilities.
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:00.920]   It's a full operating system.
[01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:02.160]   It's very sophisticated.
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:04.320]   A lot of geeks have been using the Edge Router X.
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:06.200]   Because for $50, you get an amazing switch.
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:07.520]   And in fact, what you could do is you
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.880]   could put your mesh router on one of those ports
[01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:12.480]   and keep your-- maybe you have two--
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:15.120]   and keep one for IoT and one for your home network
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:18.200]   and have complete isolation thanks to the Edge Router X.
[01:56:18.200 --> 01:56:20.520]   I've been trying to do that for like six weeks--
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:21.720]   no, six months.
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:23.680]   Do you have an Edge Router?
[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:24.160]   No, sorry.
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:25.160]   I wasn't doing it that way.
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:26.160]   But I've been trying to do it--
[01:56:26.160 --> 01:56:27.000]   That's the easiest way.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:27.560]   --and work for my IoT.
[01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:28.800]   50 bucks.
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:30.200]   No, but you still have to--
[01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:32.160]   my phone still has to be on the same network
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:33.400]   and my computer still have to be on the same--
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:33.400]   Oh, I know.
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:34.760]   I'm in the pain in the butt.
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:35.880]   It's just not--
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:36.720]   [GRUNTS]
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:37.680]   --paying in the butt.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:39.840]   It is.
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:41.560]   We'll get back to you because you have a pick,
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:43.360]   but Jeff, let's get your number of a week.
[01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:44.520]   Oh, all right.
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:45.720]   I gave you one if you want.
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:46.720]   Give me one.
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:47.560]   Yeah, I got another one.
[01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:48.080]   I like two.
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:51.960]   So the one number is that Quant Media says Trump got a record
[01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:55.920]   $817 million in free coverage in January.
[01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:59.520]   I guess you could argue that once you win,
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.920]   it's not so much free coverage in the same way.
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:03.320]   It's part of the office.
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:04.160]   But still--
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:09.080]   Well, Obama never got higher than $500 million in free coverage
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:09.600]   in eight years.
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:13.400]   Which says this is how we now reward entertainment.
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:15.720]   You know, however you feel about Trump,
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:17.360]   there is no question in my mind.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:19.160]   He's incredibly entertaining.
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:21.720]   I think one of the reasons people are obsessively
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:26.120]   reading and watching him is because you can't take your eyes off him.
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:27.520]   Well, his master name--
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:32.840]   Well, the extreme of him is Milo, right?
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:34.360]   I could take my eyes off Milo.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:38.520]   I tried to watch Bill Maher, and I was so revolted.
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:40.440]   Did you ever get attacked by Milo?
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:41.960]   No.
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:42.480]   Well, I don't--
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:43.520]   Have you?
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:45.840]   Oh, yeah, back in the day.
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:47.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:47.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:48.840]   I hope we first the last--
[01:57:48.840 --> 01:57:49.280]   Then he got a good one.
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:49.840]   He was a business.
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:50.320]   Geez.
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:52.680]   But his business went out of business.
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:55.760]   He kind of became a sheepish and apologetic for about 30 seconds,
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:57:56.960]   and then went back to being Milo.
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:58.480]   Well, his sheep is an apologetic right now.
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:00.120]   We'll see how long that lasts.
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:02.120]   But I think this actually serves his purpose.
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:04.920]   I think he wants to be as outrageous as possible.
[01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:08.000]   He wants $817 million a month in free advertising.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.560]   That's what he wants.
[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:13.840]   There's another number that I thought was worth doing to CNN's.
[01:58:13.840 --> 01:58:15.120]   A study--
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:19.200]   I don't know where-- University of Maryland.
[01:58:19.200 --> 01:58:24.000]   So 70% of the people who attended the Women's March in Washington
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.720]   heard about it on Facebook.
[01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:26.000]   Wow.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:30.440]   Beating friends and family, which was 61%.
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:34.200]   Only 13% heard about it through Twitter.
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:35.800]   Ah!
[01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:38.000]   Isn't that to say everything?
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:38.920]   Doesn't that say a lot?
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:40.480]   It's kind of the nature of Twitter, though.
[01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:44.040]   Everything goes by in a Russian or a Roar in Twitter.
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:45.040]   I know.
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:46.440]   Kit.
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:49.320]   Researchers interviewed 528 people who attended the march
[01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:51.440]   and found that in addition to Facebook driving attendance,
[01:58:51.440 --> 01:58:55.600]   33% of attendees were first-time protesters.
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:56.040]   So I just--
[01:58:56.040 --> 01:58:56.680]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:58.560]   --back to your Facebook argument earlier
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:01.760]   that the impact it has in this way.
[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:04.480]   Right after the show, there's a town hall for my congressman
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:07.520]   here in New Jersey, the 7th District.
[01:59:07.520 --> 01:59:14.040]   And the Democrats are focused on him for the next two years.
[01:59:14.040 --> 01:59:15.040]   And I wanted to go.
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:15.800]   I registered.
[01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:16.920]   They never got any confirmation.
[01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:18.280]   So I can't go and appear.
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:20.040]   So I'll watch-- there would be a stream online,
[01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:21.240]   which would be entertaining.
[01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:25.400]   But watching the organization online has been fascinating.
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:30.440]   They came up with a list of questions, the Facebook group
[01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:33.160]   that's-- or the liberals.
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:35.480]   And they said, please take a long list of questions.
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:38.160]   If you get called on, ask number one.
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:39.880]   If you get called on next, please ask number two.
[01:59:39.880 --> 01:59:40.880]   You can ask your own question.
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:43.160]   But if you want one, please ask number two.
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:44.840]   If he refuses to answer number two,
[01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:48.080]   and your call on is number three, ask number two.
[01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:49.840]   Exactly what you wish would happen in the White House
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:50.960]   Press Room.
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:52.280]   That doesn't happen.
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:54.880]   There are pre-in-up memes that just say, listen,
[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:57.280]   this guy is one of two Republicans in the state
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.360]   who's holding a town hall.
[01:59:58.360 --> 01:59:59.480]   So be respectful.
[01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:01.440]   Be decent.
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:03.440]   Here's where you sit so you can get called on.
[02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:04.760]   It's just the organization of this.
[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:07.200]   And by the way, nobody's paid.
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:09.000]   But the organization, the Facebook
[02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.880]   role of self-organizing groups, which
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:12.760]   I would go back to earlier discussion,
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:14.320]   that's not Mark Zuckerberg organizing.
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:16.320]   That's him providing a mechanism where
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:18.960]   you can organize anything from the alt-right to the Bernie
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:19.760]   left.
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:21.080]   And it's there as a platform.
[02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:23.400]   And God help us how we organize our own society.
[02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:25.600]   But we're watching it happen for our very loud.
[02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:27.040]   Kind of amazing, isn't it?
[02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:27.520]   It is.
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:28.520]   It is.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:32.360]   That's the world is changing so fast in unpredictable ways,
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:32.640]   too.
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:37.560]   That's the thing that's fascinating to me.
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:38.520]   Who would have thought?
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:40.240]   Who would have thunk it?
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:44.200]   And Stacey, you've got an interesting pick.
[02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:47.600]   So I thought this was kind of fun.
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:49.360]   And I've been kind of playing around with it,
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:53.480]   not very successfully because I'm here in my lights
[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:54.160]   or elsewhere.
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:56.880]   But I've been playing with the Vivaldi browser, which
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:58.840]   is a new browser.
[02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:02.240]   And the reason I picked it up and started playing with it
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:06.040]   was because you can actually connect it to your Hue lights.
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:06.840]   And--
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:07.440]   Wait a minute.
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:09.000]   Your browser?
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:09.760]   Yeah.
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:11.080]   To your lights?
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:12.960]   Yeah.
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:15.280]   Do you mean-- well, what happens then?
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:18.560]   Well, so right now, it's just the lights turn color
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:20.520]   based on the site.
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:20.520]   No.
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:21.560]   You're browsing?
[02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:22.000]   What?
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:22.640]   Yeah.
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:25.600]   So you go into-- if you download the browser,
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:27.400]   then you go into-- hold on.
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:28.320]   Let me do this again.
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:30.320]   That's hysterical.
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:31.400]   Is it under appearance?
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:36.000]   That's what-- so I was playing with it on another computer,
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.320]   which is-- and so I had to put it on this computer.
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:42.480]   Let me find my--
[02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:44.520]   where did that-- because the settings thing is huge.
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:46.560]   Oh, under network, I think is where it is.
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:47.080]   Nope.
[02:01:47.080 --> 02:01:49.880]   That is so funny.
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:50.720]   I'm going to find it.
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:51.720]   And we're going to figure this out.
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:55.240]   So what is the point of Vivaldi?
[02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:58.640]   You know, it's the guy who did opera.
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:01:59.560]   Yeah, it looks a little--
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:01.520]   it does look operatic, actually.
[02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:03.880]   Yeah, John von Tuchten?
[02:02:03.880 --> 02:02:05.760]   Tuchten?
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:06.600]   I can't say his last name.
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:08.720]   And he says it's a browser for our friends.
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:09.920]   What is the--
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:11.960]   So it's a personalized browser.
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:14.040]   I mean, it's basically a new browser.
[02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:15.600]   Oh, it's under themes.
[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:17.640]   So you can enable your Hue--
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:19.840]   enable Hue theme integration.
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:20.840]   I will say it's in Vivaldi.
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:23.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:26.000]   Requires a Philips Hue lighting system
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:27.840]   from on the local network, finds the bridge.
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.320]   So you just click in.
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:32.640]   And then changes the lights to match your theme?
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:34.320]   Is that why you had to run downstairs before the show
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:35.360]   and turn them on?
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:37.880]   Yes, because I wasn't playing with it on this computer.
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:39.480]   So I thought it was connected to it.
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:40.800]   I see now.
[02:02:40.800 --> 02:02:41.880]   OK.
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:44.560]   So yeah, you click that button and then you connect the lights.
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:48.440]   I will say, challengingly enough, it did not find--
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:55.560]   it only found four of my 10 or many Hue lights.
[02:02:55.560 --> 02:02:58.200]   Well, Stacy, in all fairness, your house--
[02:02:58.200 --> 02:02:59.560]   it's a little crowded with--
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:02.240]   There's a lot of stuff going on.
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:02.760]   There is.
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:03.760]   So I'm like--
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:05.720]   It's talking to the toaster.
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:08.200]   It's talking to the doorbell.
[02:03:08.200 --> 02:03:10.400]   It's talking to everything.
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:12.200]   So yes, right now it's not as cool.
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:16.000]   But I'm hoping if this becomes really popular,
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.200]   we can do it because how cool would it be--
[02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:21.920]   just imagine this with me, you guys, when Twig calls--
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:24.800]   Oh, your lights change.
[02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:26.320]   And my lights just blink.
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:27.400]   Yeah.
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:30.280]   Because actually, that's not the other web.
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:31.120]   You're not a browser.
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:32.320]   It would be on the browser either.
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:32.880]   You'd have to.
[02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:33.520]   Yeah.
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:34.240]   OK, hold on.
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:34.600]   Hold on.
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:35.880]   Let me pick a browser thing.
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:36.720]   Hold on.
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:38.240]   New mentions in my tweet stream.
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:39.600]   That would be too overwhelming.
[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:42.800]   But my husband likes using Hangouts.
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:45.840]   He's the only one.
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:49.120]   So when he pings me on Hangouts and I'm sitting here going,
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.160]   oh, that's Andrew.
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:52.120]   My lights could go on.
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:52.760]   Yeah.
[02:03:52.760 --> 02:03:54.840]   It's like having a ringtone.
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:56.640]   Only it's a light tone.
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:58.640]   The wall is free.
[02:03:58.640 --> 02:03:59.640]   Yeah.
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:00.640]   Which is nice.
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:01.640]   Phillips use or not.
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:03.640]   But if you have them and you want to play with it,
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:04.640]   check it out.
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:05.640]   That is wild.
[02:04:05.640 --> 02:04:06.640]   So yeah.
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:10.640]   A browser that changes your lighting color.
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:12.640]   And it changes actually the browser.
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:16.640]   So if you do it, the cool thing is, because I'm a freak who
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:17.640]   likes my--
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:19.640]   what's it called?
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:22.640]   The dock on the side of my computer instead of on the
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:23.640]   bottom or the top.
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:25.640]   You can actually change your tabs.
[02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:28.640]   So my tabs now run instead of across the top.
[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:30.640]   They run down the side in the full faulty browser.
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:31.640]   Oh, my God.
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:32.640]   I know.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:35.640]   Your whole thing is on its side.
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:37.640]   I'm surprised your head isn't like this.
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:38.640]   All the time.
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:42.640]   I like that cute puppy look where they're like, oh.
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:43.640]   Oh.
[02:04:43.640 --> 02:04:46.640]   No, actually I keep-- you know what?
[02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:48.640]   Your dock should be on the side.
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:51.640]   Because your screen's wider than it is tall.
[02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:53.640]   So there's more room on the side.
[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:54.640]   Exactly.
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:55.640]   Thank you.
[02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:56.640]   That's just logical.
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:04:57.640]   That's how I felt.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:04:58.640]   Yeah.
[02:04:58.640 --> 02:04:59.640]   OK.
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:00.640]   So now you can put your tabs there.
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:02.640]   I don't know if I want my tabs there.
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:03.640]   I guess so.
[02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:04.640]   I guess so.
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:09.640]   And it changes like I think Twitter is blue.
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:10.640]   I'm trying to think of what else--
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:12.640]   So it's a very aesthetic browser.
[02:05:12.640 --> 02:05:13.640]   It's very pretty.
[02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:14.640]   It's fancy.
[02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:15.640]   I haven't spent like ages.
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:18.640]   I haven't done like master tabs or done anything crazy.
[02:05:18.640 --> 02:05:21.640]   I'm so hooked on Chrome that every time I try one of these
[02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:25.640]   alternative browsers, including Opera, I just go, hmm.
[02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:27.640]   It doesn't look right.
[02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:29.640]   And that is fair.
[02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:32.640]   But this is highly customizable.
[02:05:32.640 --> 02:05:33.640]   I'm going to play with it.
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:36.640]   I always force myself if I'm going to use a browser to use it for a week.
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:37.640]   Yeah.
[02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:38.640]   And then I can make it--
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:40.640]   It has some nice-- I'm looking at some nice features.
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:41.640]   Yeah.
[02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:46.640]   I mean, I haven't hated it using it for 24 hours.
[02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:47.640]   So--
[02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:48.640]   There you go.
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:49.640]   I like that.
[02:05:49.640 --> 02:05:55.640]   I'm going to tap our position and do like Stacey does and put it on the left.
[02:05:55.640 --> 02:05:57.640]   And now-- ooh, which start page?
[02:05:57.640 --> 02:05:59.640]   Purple Lake.
[02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:01.640]   Purple Lake.
[02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:03.640]   Purple Lake.
[02:06:03.640 --> 02:06:04.640]   Nice.
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:06.640]   Start browsing.
[02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:09.640]   I wonder how Facebook looks in a purple lake.
[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:12.640]   See, oh, see, they change Facebook to be blue to match your site.
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:14.640]   Now go to like red--
[02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:15.640]   Oh, you mean like the--
[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:16.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:19.640]   Oh, let's see.
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:20.640]   I'm YouTube.
[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:22.640]   I'm YouTube Red is the--
[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:24.640]   Let's see.
[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:25.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:25.640 --> 02:06:26.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:28.640]   And so my tabs would reflect that too.
[02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:30.640]   Oh, and these aren't just tabs.
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:31.640]   They're thumbnails.
[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:32.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:32.640 --> 02:06:33.640]   Nice.
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:34.640]   All right.
[02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:35.640]   It's fancy.
[02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:36.640]   So, yeah, get in a world.
[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:37.640]   It's a Vivaldi.
[02:06:37.640 --> 02:06:38.640]   It's up to you.
[02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:40.640]   It's the Vivaldi browser.
[02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:42.640]   I think it's Vivaldi.org.
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:43.640]   Nope.
[02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:44.640]   Vivaldi.com.
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:46.640]   If you want to find out more.
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:48.640]   A browser for our friends.
[02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:54.640]   You know, there's-- I think the reason that you see people still write browsers.
[02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:55.640]   It's one of those categories.
[02:06:55.640 --> 02:06:59.640]   A lot of times, you know, people will go, well, Microsoft owns the word processor.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:01.640]   I'm not going to make a word processor.
[02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:03.640]   But they don't do it about browsers.
[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:07.640]   And the reason is you can make a lot of money with a browser through search referrals.
[02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:13.640]   And so, you know, this is one of the few pieces of software you can give away and actually,
[02:07:13.640 --> 02:07:16.640]   you know, make a killing on.
[02:07:16.640 --> 02:07:19.640]   It's hard to get through the rest, though.
[02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:20.640]   But that's right.
[02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:22.640]   It's all about getting a critical mess.
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:28.640]   And we actually had this-- I talked with John for-- because we were talking about bringing
[02:07:28.640 --> 02:07:30.640]   open web standards to the internet, I think.
[02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:34.640]   So, this guy is a very-- he's got so many lost causes and windmills he's tilting at.
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:35.640]   So, you know, good for him.
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:39.640]   Well, it's one of those apps that's written in Node and JavaScript and React.
[02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:42.640]   So, the only drawback to that, it's really cool.
[02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:45.640]   I'm seeing a lot of open source projects work that way.
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:49.640]   So, it's basically a browser written as a brain, a browser.
[02:07:49.640 --> 02:07:52.640]   But it can be-- that could make it sluggish.
[02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:55.640]   So, do you know-- does it feel a little slow?
[02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:59.640]   I haven't-- you know, today was podcasting in this day.
[02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:02.640]   So, I haven't-- I don't have like a thousand tabs open.
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:03.640]   That's Catholic.
[02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:06.640]   Let's see if it breaks Jeff's non-pixel.
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:09.640]   It will break his Samsung Plus, that's for sure.
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:10.640]   There it is.
[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:11.640]   You can't use it on Samsung Plus.
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:16.640]   So, no, no, actually, actually, when I was trying to figure out how to get Amazon loaded,
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:21.640]   one of the workarounds involved putting a different browser in so that you could use that to then go into the settings.
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:24.640]   I couldn't-- it wouldn't let me do it unless I went to Dev Mode.
[02:08:24.640 --> 02:08:28.640]   But I could download another browser under Android.
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:30.640]   Oh, you can.
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:31.640]   Yes.
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:32.640]   That's right.
[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:33.640]   That changes the--
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:34.640]   Backy, huh?
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:35.640]   Yeah.
[02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:40.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have completed this journey down the-- the-- the--
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:47.640]   the highways and byways of the minds of Stacey and Jeff and Leo that we call Twig.
[02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:50.640]   Let it be known that Stacey and I agreed a lot.
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:52.640]   I don't think we disagreed that much Stacey.
[02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:53.640]   No, we didn't.
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:56.640]   I'm trying to, you know, heighten the drama for people.
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:08:59.640]   She's trying to create some tension.
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:02.640]   I'm getting all real house-worthy on you.
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:07.640]   Real housewives of Austin, Texas.
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:11.640]   The real housewives of IOT, now that's a show I'd watch.
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:12.640]   Have you ever had--
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:13.640]   My God.
[02:09:13.640 --> 02:09:14.640]   --kind of a--
[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:15.640]   Oh.
[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:18.640]   I got so excited because I was like, "Oh, the pranks you could pull on people with IOT?"
[02:09:18.640 --> 02:09:19.640]   I know.
[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:20.640]   I'm telling you.
[02:09:20.640 --> 02:09:21.640]   This is a podcast.
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:22.640]   Oh.
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:25.640]   This is Desperate IOT Wives.
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:28.640]   Actually, in your case, Desperate IOT Husbands.
[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:30.640]   Yeah, poor guy.
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:31.640]   Stacey.
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:32.640]   Hey!
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:34.640]   I got to-- I got to figure out what's wrong with the road.
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:36.640]   What did you do with the remote, Stacey?
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:37.640]   Hey!
[02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:42.640]   Oh, I asked Mr. Watch TV and get out of the escape from this house.
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:44.640]   I'm at Dr. Feltz.
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:46.640]   It's Stacey Egan-Botham.
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:48.640]   She's the queen of IOT.
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:54.640]   Stacey on IOT.com or IOTpodcast.com, that great show she does every week.
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:59.640]   Now at episode 100 with Kevin Toful in her second year.
[02:09:59.640 --> 02:10:00.640]   Woo-woo-woo.
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:03.640]   She's on the Twitter @gigastacey.
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:05.640]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:10:05.640 --> 02:10:10.640]   Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism, those lucky kids at the City University of New York,
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:16.640]   where he's creating a new generation of people without jobs.
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:17.640]   Hey!
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:18.640]   Hey!
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:19.640]   They got jobs.
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:23.640]   I was joking last night with my son, who really wants to be a journalist.
[02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:30.640]   And you know what, he's smart because he realized he wants to intern advice or, you know, he
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:34.640]   realizes what the future's going to look like and he's learning photography and writing
[02:10:34.640 --> 02:10:35.640]   and the whole thing.
[02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:37.640]   And he could come to CUNY, you know.
[02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:38.640]   I know, I know.
[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:39.640]   I told him.
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:40.640]   I said, Jeff wants to talk to you.
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:42.640]   I would love for a good CUNY.
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:48.640]   I think what he's going to do, and this would be my advice, is to get some job experience
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:50.640]   first, a couple of years under his belt.
[02:10:50.640 --> 02:10:54.640]   I think going to graduate school, having worked a little bit, makes you appreciate it a lot
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:55.640]   more.
[02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:56.640]   Yeah.
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:10:57.640]   You know what you're getting out of it?
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:10:58.640]   Yep.
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:10:59.640]   You can also read Jeff's books.
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:00.640]   What would Google do?
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:07.360]   Public parts, Gutenberg the geek, and of course, geek-sparing gifts.
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:10.640]   And he blogs a lot at Buzzmachine.com actually less lately.
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:12.640]   Medium, more on Medium.com.
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:13.640]   I don't know.
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:21.640]   And joins us each and every Wednesday, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2130 UTC for this week in Google.
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:23.640]   I hope you'll do the same.
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:24.640]   Join us live.
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:29.640]   You can watch live on our website, Twitter.tv/live or live. Twitter.tv or YouTube.com/tv/live.
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:40.640]   If you do watch live though, please take advantage of the chat room.
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:46.640]   Be in there at IRC.tv so we can interact with you.
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:51.640]   And if you can't be here live, you can always be here after the fact on your schedule.
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:55.640]   We have on-demand audio and video of every show we do.
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:56.640]   It starts at our website.
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:11:57.640]   Wait, there's video?
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:11:59.640]   Yes, I know.
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:00.640]   I know.
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:02.640]   I've tried to keep that from you.
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:04.640]   I just thought it was audio.
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:06.640]   I didn't realize there was video to go forward.
[02:12:06.640 --> 02:12:08.640]   Try to hide that from you, Stacey.
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:09.640]   I'm sorry.
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:12.640]   Oh, I just downloaded the podcast.
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:14.640]   Twitter.tv/twig.
[02:12:14.640 --> 02:12:21.640]   Actually, at some point, I shouldn't say this, but at some point, I'm thinking most of our audiences
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:24.640]   audio would be all right just to do these as audio.
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:26.640]   There's nothing to see here.
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:28.640]   Oh, I wouldn't have to put makeup on.
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:29.640]   That would be awesome.
[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:30.640]   Neither would I.
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:31.640]   See?
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:37.640]   And Jeff wouldn't have to spend so much time getting to be less white or pink.
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:41.640]   That we wouldn't see Jeff in his famous little towels around the world.
[02:12:41.640 --> 02:12:43.640]   That would be sad.
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:44.640]   Yes.
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:45.640]   Yeah.
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:46.640]   I mean, we did video because it's fun.
[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:51.640]   And if you get to watch the video, even if you don't do it all the time once in a while,
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:56.640]   you develop a stronger bond to the show and to the hosts and stuff because you're seeing
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:59.640]   them and they become more people like it.
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:01.640]   It had a lot of cost for you.
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:02.640]   It has cost and trouble.
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:03.640]   Yeah.
[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:08.640]   And if I want to move to Ecuador, I really don't think I can do video anymore.
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:09.640]   Why?
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:10.640]   They've got broadband and Ecuador.
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:11.640]   I don't want to build a studio.
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:16.640]   I just think I want to go down there, have a microphone, have a, you know, nice patio.
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:19.640]   Don't they have a nice murder rate in the Americas?
[02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:20.640]   Ecuador?
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:21.640]   Okay.
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:23.640]   I'm not going to Ecuador.
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:24.640]   Somewhere.
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:25.640]   I was thinking maybe Costa Rica.
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:26.640]   Yeah.
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:27.640]   I'm going there.
[02:13:27.640 --> 02:13:28.640]   That's a good place.
[02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:29.640]   You should go to Costa Rica.
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:30.640]   We're all in the.
[02:13:30.640 --> 02:13:33.640]   I don't know about all of this.
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:36.640]   I need somewhere that I can go and they would just let me be there.
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:37.640]   Have a margarita.
[02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:39.640]   It's margarita day.
[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:40.640]   Wait.
[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:41.640]   It's a big one.
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:42.640]   It's a big one.
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:43.640]   Beautifully time.
[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:44.640]   Oh, that was perfect.
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:45.640]   Here you go, Stacy.
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:47.640]   They have margaritas in Sweden.
[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:49.640]   I might grab a.
[02:13:49.640 --> 02:13:50.640]   Let's go to Sweden.
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:53.640]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:13:53.640 --> 02:13:56.640]   See if we didn't have video.
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:58.640]   We couldn't do that, Leo.
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:13:59.640]   That's true.
[02:13:59.640 --> 02:14:02.640]   We're talking about taking Brian out of a job here, possibly.
[02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:03.640]   That would be terrible.
[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:06.640]   Oh, no, no, no, Brian will always have a job.
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:07.640]   He can.
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:08.640]   You can do so many things.
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:13.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, he's giggling in fear and horror.
[02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:16.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, I do appreciate you are being here.
[02:14:16.640 --> 02:14:19.640]   If you want to help us out, there's a couple ways you can do it.
[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:22.640]   Of course, sponsors are our lifeblood.
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:29.640]   So if you ever hear a product you were interested in, please take advantage of that and make sure you mention us.
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:32.640]   You can also help us get new sponsors by filling out the Twitch survey.
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:33.640]   Just take a couple of minutes.
[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:35.640]   Twitch.tv/survey.
[02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:41.640]   We're not looking for information about you specifically, but just in aggregate who listens and watches and that kind of thing.
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:44.640]   It also helps us tune our programming.
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:46.640]   Because we are curious, do you watch video?
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:48.640]   Do you listen only to audio?
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:49.640]   That kind of thing.
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:50.640]   Twitch.tv/survey.
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:57.640]   If you want to get a nice Twitch hat, it's available in red and it just has the Twitch logo or it says Twitch.tv.
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:02.640]   We've got the snap brim flat brims for you youngsters, for you oldsters.
[02:15:02.640 --> 02:15:03.640]   We've got the curved brim.
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:04.640]   You get your pick.
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:11.640]   It's all along with T-shirts and mugs and all sorts of stuff at our store, Twitch.tv/store.
[02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:12.640]   We'll be back next week.
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:13.640]   I hope you will too.
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:15.640]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:18.640]   And we'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:19.640]   Bye-bye.
[02:15:19.640 --> 02:15:29.640]   (music)
