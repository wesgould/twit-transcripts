[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, wow, we've got a great conversation ahead for you.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   Robert Stevens joins us, formerly of Best Buy, a Paul Boag of Boag World, and of course,
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.000]   Jeff and Gina talk about all the Google announcements and a whole lot more.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   This week in Google is next.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   This is Twig.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   This is Twig. This week in Google, episode 170, recorded October 31st, 2012.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   No Google for you.

[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. We've got a big panel for you today.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Let's introduce the regulars first starting with Mama Gina Trapani of SmarterWeird.org.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   That's her blog, founding editor at LifeHacker.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Hello, happy Halloween.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Happy Halloween. What's your costume?
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   I don't have one, but my six-week-old daughter has a Wonder Woman onesie on.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Aww.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   I mean, I like you guys, but you're not nearly as cute as my kid.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I just got to tell you.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Well, if little later on she'd like to make an appearance, a little cameo.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   She's taken a nap, but if you go to my Flickr, there's a picture.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   There's a picture of the Wonder Woman.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Look at that com/guitarpani. You'll see a picture of my girl.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Maybe, yeah, if she wakes up me, we'll bring her in here.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   That's a Wonder Woman. So no princesses for her, huh?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Not yet, not until she requests them.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Not until she requests them.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   She gives up.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   There's a new Disney princess, Princess Leia.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   So that's...
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   She's not so bad.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And she's easy to do with the cinnamon buns. It's very simple.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Leia, I'm good with.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Most versions of Leia, I'm good with.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   You know, I have costumes for Aussie, and I've been waiting all year to put them on him,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   and I forgot.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   What?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   I might have to run home and get them.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   He's got a Bumblebee costume. He's got a Santa costume.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   He's got a little Mexican hat and sauropie.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   You know, this onesie is for a six-month-old.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   She's only six--
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   She's not quite filling it out.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   No, she's not filling it out.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   That's all right. She'll grow into it.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   You got to eat.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Oh, please. You got to put on the costume.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   So cute.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Also here, speaking of cute Jeff Jarvis, the chat room is wondering what color skin you'd have for how long.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   That skin you'd have for Halloween, and you've decided to pink.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   You usually want to appear as the top pink.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I'd pay to see you in a onesie, Leia.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I have a onesie. I could put it on. Don't tempt me.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   I literally have a onesie.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Isn't that in the other room?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I don't know how I would get it on here. Maybe during a long--
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   If you do a long monologue, Jeff, I shall pull my onesie on.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   It's a tie-died onesie.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   We also want to welcome Paul Boag, who is a longtime friend.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   We actually have had Paul on years ago.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   We were going to do an international news update.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Paul joined us for that. He is a web designer.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   He co-founder of the web agency Headscape in Great Britain, and also of the Boag World Podcast.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Paul, it's great to have you.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   It was great to be here.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   He was in town and just thought we'd bring him in.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Yeah, I only wanted to know he's round. The next thing I know I'm on the show, which is great.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Well, I'm sure you'll have something to say.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   We actually have another guest who is on his way, but he's running a little late because I guess
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   there was a World Series and somebody won and there's a parade, and I don't know what's going on.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   But apparently traffic in San Francisco is kind of tough.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   But joining us in just a few minutes, because I think he's getting close now, Robert Stevens.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And you set us up with this, Jeff. He's a former CTO at Best Buy, right?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Guy who invented the Geek Squad.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And then he became CTO at Best Buy, and there's a very, very nice, smart, opinionated guy.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I think he'll enjoy him.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   This is going to be interesting.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   This is going to be interesting. But first, let's get right to the news.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And then when Robert joins us, we'll bring him into the game.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   So there was no Google announcement on Monday.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   We thought there would be, but because of the storm, they canceled it.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   However, they still pushed out all the new stuff.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Maybe this would be a good time before we go much farther to have Gina tell us what's new at Google.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   What do you think? It's time for the change lock.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Yeah, I'm going to kick off the change lock.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Google change lock.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Oh, Lord.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   This is quality shot.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   The way I want to do that before Robert got here.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   There's a lot of stuff new this week, and I didn't even count the Nexus launch.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   So we'll talk about the Nexus launch separately.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   But a lot of little product tweaks here and there.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Google search for iOS came out, added voice functionality.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Have you tried this out, Leo?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   It's really cool.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   It's kind of like a super fast.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   It's really good.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It's kind of got a Google now-ish.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   So yeah, if you just update your Google search app on iOS, you'll be able to ask your questions through voice.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   If it has answers, it will read them back to you.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Otherwise, it just shows you Google search results.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   But it's really fast.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   As you speak, you can see the words, the translation, the words update, kind of like Google suggests as you type.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's pretty neat.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Gmail got a new compose functionality.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   In Gmail now, when you click on the compose button inside the web interface, your new draft email opens up in a panel on top of your inbox.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   So you can actually search your inbox.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   You can refer to other emails as you're drafting an email inside this compose window.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   It's pretty neat.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And when you reply as well to an email thread, there's kind of a new layout.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   It looks actually kind of dare I say, Google Wave-ish.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   The reply kind of shows up at the bottom of the thread as you type.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   So you know, you used to be able to, if you hold down the shift key and click on the compose button, it would open the compose window in a new window.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I'm sure that no one was actually using that feature, even though it was very useful.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So you can actually now search for email while you compose an email.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And I got that on my Google Apps account and my vanilla Gmail account.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I just refresh my inbox and you'll get a little notification that says, "Hey, we've got this new compose feature."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Not me!
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   No, not you, not yet.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Do you not have to apply for it?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   So it's going to roll on out.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   No, I just --
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   It just happens.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   -- shift reloaded my inbox.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I got a little notification.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Oh, there it is.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Got it.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   That was even new compose.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Excellent.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Excellent.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Google Earth for desktop, Google Earth 7 just got the new features that rolled out on mobile a while back with Tor guide and new 3D imagery.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I got a test.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   I got to say I haven't used Google Earth in a desktop in a long time, but I downloaded Google Earth 7.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And this new Tor guide feature lets you click on sites of interest and it kind of walks you through and gives you some history and pans around.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Got some new 3D imagery as well.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   For those of you who have Chromebooks, Chrome Remote Desktop, which is a Chrome add-on that lets you remote control another computer, came out of beta, and it has a couple new features.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It supports audio feeds, real-time audio feeds for Windows machines.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   So if you got your Chromebook and you're on the road, you can remote desktop into your Windows machine.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   You can listen to your music on the way.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   You can also copy and paste between local and remote computers as well.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   So Chrome Remote Desktop out of beta.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   The store I'm also delayed by my Chromebook was supposed to arrive Monday.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   The least of my problems right now, but I got no Chromebook.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Yeah, Sandy's fault.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Google Translate got a couple new features, reverse translation, so you can check a translation to see how well it goes back and forth between languages.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Google will list translations based on frequency, so how often a word is used, and offers synonyms as well.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   So Google.com/translate, you can try those out.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   And every election season, Google has a voter tools.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Last week we talked about the Explorer, the election explorer.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   There's a voter info tab now.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   If you go to google.com/elections, you can look up your polling places, you can check out information about the candidates.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And there's quite a few different tools here on this page, but that voter info tab just launched this week as well.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   And that's all I got.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And that's the Google change log.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   [Laughter]
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Okay, we're going to have to dump that at some point, because this is a serious show.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Thank you, Gina.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Sure.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Yeah, and you left out all the Google announcements that would have come out Monday.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   The big two, well, there's three.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   There's Jelly Bean 4.2.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   There's Nexus 4 phone, the LG.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Basically, I think it's an optimist, right?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And then, of course, this new tablet.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Right, the Nexus 10.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Yeah, so.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   And the price reduction in the Nexus 7.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Yes, that's right.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   It's important too.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Actually, Jermaine to that, Aces Tech has just told the Wall Street Journal that Nexus 7 sales are pretty good approaching a million units a month.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   It's a beautiful thing.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   We knew it the minute we saw it.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And I think everybody did.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   This works.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   It's a great device.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   We're starting to hear early reviews of the iPad, many that maybe it doesn't work quite so well.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Well, I even think the added, it's an inch wider, right?
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Yeah, I've had many.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And I think that's too wide.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I try to say.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   7.9.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Yeah, and I put mine in the hands of people with short and stubby fingers and said, "Okay, now add an inch."
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   And they all grimaced.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Is it the price or the size?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Do you think it's the size?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   I think that if you have the chance to hold the two next to each other, it'd be the size.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   The problem is, where do you go to hold in Nexus 7?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Right.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   The other problem when it comes to the size is if they've made it any smaller than that, they wouldn't have been able to go with the 1024 by 768 screen size, which means that you would have had a load of developers complaining there having to redo their applications again.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Right.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   To some extent, the iPad mini was kind of defined by the developer audience, I think.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Well, you know, Android doesn't have those kinds of problems because there are so many screen sizes anyway.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Yeah, well, you do it.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   They've got to suck it up.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Well, and people, even John Gruber, who is no one doubts a major fan of everything Apple, is a little down on the iPad mini.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   His wife said, "Wow, it feels like a Kindle. Ooh, the screen is terrible."
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   And there seems to be a lot of... Now, we're going to get our mini on Friday, but it seems to be a lot of the reaction of the early reviewers is, boy, this really should be red now.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Why is it not red now?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And Google may be stealing a little March on that because while the Nexus 7 is not red now, it's higher resolution.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And now they've announced a new 10-inch tablet that is super high resolution.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   I think that might be the most sick.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   That's very interesting.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And they're going right up after Apple.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I don't think actually they solved the problem that they thought they had by keeping it at the same resolution anyway because what's happened is you've taken the 1024 that used to be on the iPad 2 and shrunk it down for this smaller device.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And you're saying to all the developers, "Oh, you don't need to do anything. It'll just work."
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   But what's happened is all the buttons have ended up so much smaller.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   So it's now much fiddlier to try to track.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Isn't that what Steve Jobs said?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   He said, "You'd have to sand your fingers down to your 7-inch tablet and maybe that's what's happened."
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   He was right.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I've been playing with the Surface RT, the Windows 8 tablet.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   And that's... It is exact.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   One of the problems with it when you get to desktop is the touch targets are really small.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   So they'll put Excel up on the screen, but it's no longer... You've got to use the mouse and keyboard.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   It's not a touch device anymore.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   So the new Google Samsung tablet, the Nexus 10, is 300 pixels an inch.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   That's higher than the Retina iPad.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   2560 by 1600. Is this going to have the same problem?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Because the dots are small.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   I mean, but it's not such a problem if you're designing the application from scratch specifically for that device.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Gina, doesn't it resize?
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   Gina's the Android developer.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Do you say the size of a control in pixels?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Oh, it's relative. On Android, you develop a sort of...
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   It's a relative.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Yeah, it's a relative layout.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   So that shouldn't be a problem.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Right.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I mean, you provide assets for various resolutions.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   So there's low resolution, medium, high, extra high.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   So you have to provide images that have the right pixel density.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   But, yeah, no, you're not defining layouts in pixels.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Well, we'll see when this comes out.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   It goes for sale November 13, 399 for 16 gigabytes, 499 for 32 gigabytes.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   So it's less expensive than the iPad.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   That's the Wi-Fi version.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It's manufactured by Samsung, has a A15-based XNS5 chip, 1.7 gigahertz quad core.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   It has a Mali T604 GPU, which you need for that kind of resolution.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   That's one of the reasons I think I've had revved its...
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Apple had revved its big iPad because they needed some speed on that high res.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Four times the pixels of a 1280 by 800 screen, which is the previous Nexus tablet.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   And 300 PPI is...
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Let me do the math.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   36 PPI better than the iPad.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   Pretty impressive.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   You've come a numbers game at a certain point.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   You wonder whether people do this just so they can say, "Oh, it's better than the iPad."
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   I think the iPad is good enough.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   It's camera and megapixels, same thing.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I just put up a link, Leo, at the bottom of that section.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Leena Storvalds had a rant on Google+, saying, "Can we please stop with the retina crap
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   and just call it a reasonable resolution?"
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   So even a 399 tablet has 2, 565, 1600 pixels-wise.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Can we please just make that the new standard laptop resolution?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   The fact that laptops stagnated 10 years ago.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   And even the request of many cases at around half that in both directions is just sad.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   It is nice to have retina, but of course the GPU's really get sluggish on that.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Hey, let's welcome, by the way, our fourth...
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   One, two, three, four...
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Fourth panel.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Well, do I count?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   I don't know.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Fourth or fifth, depending on whether you're counting me.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Robert Stevens is here.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Robert, thanks for joining us.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   We appreciate it.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Good to meet you.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   Can we get his mic on?
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   He's on mic three.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Mic three.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Mic three.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   There we go.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Robert, former, not current, former CTO at Best Buy.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Former, you know, actually, my father passed away and I stuck around the house in Chicago
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   to look after my mom.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   And three weeks after I left, they had fired the CEO.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Oh.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   So my timing was amazing.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   So that was good?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Well, I mean, I wasn't happy that they fired him.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   I mean, I knew they were going to fire him, but I think it would have expected him to be tossed out eventually
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   for lack of business performance, not for an inappropriate relationship with an employee.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   That's right.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   That was--
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Oh, it's all rushing back to me.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Yes.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   And founder of the Geek Squad.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Right?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Yes, almost 20 years ago.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   What?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   It's been around the world.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   That's how good of a job I did.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Everybody thinks Best Buy invented it.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I was running it for 10 years before I sold it to Best Buy.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Yes.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   It was a-- now it's coming back to me.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   It was a business and then Best Buy acquired it.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   I started in college in 1994 and I ran it for six years and then I called it Best Buy and said,
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   most of my employees used to work at Best Buy, so I know you have good people.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   I don't know why you take forever to fix laptops.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Why don't we join forces?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Why don't you suck so bad?
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Like having a Starbucks inside of a Barnes and Noble.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Oh.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   And we dated for two years before we got married, which--
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   That's interesting.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   So-- and Robert has now gone from the Geek Squad white shirt black tie to San Francisco hip black t-shirt.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I'm too old to be hipster, so I can't--
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   I have no Warby Parkers.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   I can't be held to any of that stuff.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Thank you, though, Jeff.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Too old for a hipster.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   I'm glad you have electricity.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   You're never too old for a hipster, Robert.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I'm just going to tell you that right now.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   So we've been talking about Google's non-announcement.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   They just slipstreamed all this stuff out since they couldn't have their big event.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Do you use any tablet in particular, Robert?
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Is there one?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   I'm all Apple.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   I mean, as a tech support person, you want to buy a car, talk to a mechanic.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Ask my wife who doesn't really like technology, and we used to have HPs and all that other crap in the house,
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   and links to this router, so none of it worked.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Get rid of the HPs, I agree.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   I tell people, you know, Geek Squad will make more money off of you if you do not own Apple products.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   It's as simple as that.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   That's funny.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   My brother-in-law wanted to buy a computer a couple of years ago, and I said, "Well, I would buy a Mac if you combine anything you want,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   but only expect support if you buy a Mac, because I'm not going to help you if you buy one of them."
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   God help you.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Yes.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   There's still a problem, actually.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   I see a lot of the perception issues.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   During the '90s, Microsoft Windows was a better operating system, but starting with OSX.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   But that perception in people's minds is still that Windows is better, and the perception also is that Apple's expensive.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And I'd say $499 for an iPad kind of blows all out of the water.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   You played with a new Windows 8 Surface stuff?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   No, not really.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   I like it.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   I actually have to say I like it.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   There's lots of issues, so generation one product.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   The hardware is awe-inspiring.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   I got to say the keyboard.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   I got to get towards with that.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   I like Metro.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   Really?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Hey, I'm Rootenform.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Before I left, I really was trying to convince HP not to dump Paul Muth.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   You ought to pay for it.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   And developers were saying at the time, they would consider WebOS in their top three.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   It was a decent operating system.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   I think it's probably going to be a couple of years.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Not all will survive, but they will rebuild their software acumen to do this.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   I just don't know how the whole OEM thing is going to play out with Microsoft doing hardware too.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   So that'll be interesting to see.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   But yeah, I hope they do well.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   I've got huge respect for them.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   They've taken a brave step with Metro.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   It's very different to what was there before.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   And I think that is a big thing to do when you've got a huge user base of people that have been using your software
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   happily for years to step out and do something completely different.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Whether you like it or not, you've got to respect them for being brave enough to do that.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   I feel like they had to.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   I think that they recognize the writing on the wall that Apple was eating their lunch.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   That the world had changed.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   It was a post-PC world.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   But to their credit, they bit the bullet.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   I mean, it was not an easy shift to make when you have such a successful incumbent to say,
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   "All right, we're going to go touch.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   We're going to go tablet.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   We're going to go portable."
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   I didn't do the easy thing, which was to follow Apple.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   Metro has taken a very different direction in its user interface than Apple has.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   And I think that's brilliant.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   I think that's really brave of them.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   They haven't gone down the skimorphic route.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Apparently Apple's turning back from that dead end.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Thank God.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   But I think it's great that Microsoft are moving in the direction.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   "Oh, will it be a success?" I don't know.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   But at least it's nice to have something out there that doesn't look like
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   either an Apple product or a knockoff of an Apple product.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Robert, you mentioned WebOS.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Did you see the LG, which was making a Google TV-based smart TV, is apparently considering
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   WebOS for a smart TV.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   I like WebOS.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   I wonder how it will be in a TV interface.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Well, the WebOS, if it were to even be viable, would probably have to be obviously updated
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   and retooled.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   You'll see, not everybody can have their own ecosystem.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   But I think you'll see--
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Did you now?
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Sam's so hell, everybody is.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Well, the whole bottom.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   It's very frustrating.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   I think in terms of what we see in integration with iOS, I could see an average max of three
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   consumer operating systems and maybe an additional two that also have more enterprise blend
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   of the companies.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   What are the three?
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Android or Chrome?
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   OS.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   I don't count Chrome OS.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   I don't either.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   I don't either.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   I have to tell you something else.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Now that I'm for Best Buy, I can save it ever I want.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   I worked for years.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.200]   I told Eric Schmidt, I said, "You know, ten years ago, we didn't know what an Apple store
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   would look like.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   Now we do."
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.200]   What would a Google store look like?
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.200]   It would look like a Best Buy.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:02.680]   I said, "Why don't we partner up a black cable in the center of the store?"
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.760]   But what I found out is that there's not one Google.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.760]   There's 4,000 of them.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.760]   I used to be all Google.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.760]   Same with Microsoft.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.840]   I used to be a Google notebook.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.640]   But I pay for Evernote now.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.760]   I only trust companies that focus.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.920]   And Google TV, I told them I said, "We could sell more Google TVs for you."
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.000]   The day they bought Android, oh, Econo 7, I went to Best Buy and I said, "Let's go
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.080]   all in on Android.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.480]   Every picture frame, every TV, we were going to sell Mike Arrington's Crunchpad."
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.480]   See, we're in secret negotiations.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.480]   Oh, you know.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:34.240]   And then Arrington threw up his hands and said, "I give up Robert DeWars over Apple
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.240]   One."
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.960]   I'm like, "Don't give it the fight."
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.480]   Because Apple was doing its own retail thing, you needed to find a new niche.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:44.080]   I mean, there were Apple stores in Best Buy.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.840]   I don't think Best Buy is like, Best Buy is not going to win trying to beat Walmart
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.840]   on price.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.120]   And you're not going to beat Apple on design.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.800]   And neither is Microsoft either.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.800]   Microsoft should be--
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.000]   What should they be?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Where's their niche?
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.320]   I think if you believe in the theory of that there's a creator, an intelligent designer
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.400]   in the universe who has set your life in motion--
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.640]   Johnny Ive, I think.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.640]   That's Apple.
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:11.440]   If you understand Darwin's natural selection by many life forms randomly mutating, then
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.440]   that's Android.
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.960]   And that's also good.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.800]   I think Microsoft could be a blend where they're more open than Apple, but they're more consistent
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.800]   than Google.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.800]   I think that's where they are right now.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   That's exactly--
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   That's what they're doing.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.320]   But Google-- let's look at Google Voice.
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.760]   I use it, but I have now only using it to transcribe voicemails.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.080]   You still can't do MMS.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.320]   You still can't do international text.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:38.480]   I hope Larry continues to be more disciplined and design worthy because they have been so
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.720]   unfocused on everything.
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:45.200]   Well, that was kind of-- we were talking about Chrome OS last week and I was bitching about
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.200]   it.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:51.680]   And of course, Jeff has now decided he's going to go all Chrome OS just to see how it is.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.680]   Well, shit.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.880]   But somebody came to me after the show and said, "You know what?
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.160]   Really the main point you showed brought up is they've got two OSs and Android is in
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.800]   every way superior to Chrome OS."
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.000]   It is really true.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.360]   And I'm dreading-- that's the one thing I'm dreading is that I'll be used to doing one
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.120]   thing on my Nexus 7 and then another thing on the Chromebook.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:11.320]   And why not just do all Android?
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.000]   That's a real operating system.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.880]   It's good enough for me on the desktop.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   Here's the problem.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.280]   I thought about that because you can get the Asus tablet with-- which is very much like
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.200]   the Microsoft product, the model for it, right?
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.960]   With the clickable keyboard and all that.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:30.080]   But the applications on Android aren't quite as robust as the Chrome applications and as
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:31.760]   I don't think.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:35.080]   And so if I'm trying to do some serious business stuff, I'm just fearing it's not going to
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.080]   be as good.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.080]   And part of this too, I want to go back to the retail thing.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.400]   Robert was raising the second to go.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.680]   And I talked to Robert's former colleague Barry Judge, who was then CMO of the company
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.400]   about this before they went out and visited with Google.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.400]   And I talked to Google people.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.600]   I think that Google should have a retail presence, best buy-- you know, imagine if you
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.760]   had a Google corner.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:57.000]   There's now a poor guy in a white shirt standing by Chromebooks sloping lonely in various best
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   buys.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And airports too, by the way.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.640]   They've taken over from the Hare Krishnas.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:06.880]   By an Android, by a Chromebook, from the Chromebook.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.880]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.880]   Go ahead.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.880]   I did really--
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.880]   Imagine if you had-- I mean, Google was cool to people.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.680]   If you had a place where you could go touch Google things and Google stuff and play with
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.720]   Google games and things like that, it makes sense.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.720]   It's not-- and they don't have it.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:25.000]   So what we were talking about before, if you want to compare an Nexus 7 to a Kindle
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.600]   Fire to the Microsoft thing to an iPad Mini, you can't unless you have a friend who has
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.600]   one.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:34.600]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.680]   I just saw this and I can't get somebody in the chat room.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.080]   Thank you, Kevin and Dublin.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:45.320]   Samsung is making a dock for the Galaxy Note 2, which is, of course, the giant phone that,
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.520]   by the way, how do you like my sporty white leather case?
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.520]   Oh.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.520]   Very fashionable.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.520]   It's like real skeuomorphism.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.960]   I made an error somewhere.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.960]   I'm wondering.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   Anyway.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.960]   Jupyau.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.920]   I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.080]   This is so bad.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:05.000]   But anyway, this goes with my white buck shoes that I'm wearing in my way, pal.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.280]   But their Samsung is making a dock for this thing with HDMI, two USB ports, a speaker port
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.280]   out.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.280]   That's--
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.280]   That's--
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:19.280]   Yes, this will essentially turn it into a desktop computer.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.880]   I wish the Nexus 7 had that.
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.120]   I'm clusion together a keyboard for the Nexus 7.
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.920]   I would love that.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:30.760]   Now see, when I see products like this, I don't think, oh, I'm a design snob.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.760]   They'll never make it.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.760]   I look at-- this is exactly another life form.
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.760]   That's what it is.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:36.760]   In this Darwinian model.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.760]   You nailed it.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.680]   So sooner or later, Samsung and LG will bump into something genius.
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   And that's how they do it.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.680]   Apple is intelligent design.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.680]   Survival of the fittest.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.680]   The consumer's all in.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.680]   The consumer's all in.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.680]   We need an increase choice.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.120]   And Microsoft, we figured it out as the Scientologists.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.120]   Something.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.320]   I mean, choose whatever metaphor you like.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.880]   Talk about our space.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.880]   So--
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.800]   does that really work?
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:08.280]   I mean, they've been saying this for years about open source and about all kinds of different
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.280]   things.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.000]   If you just kind of open it up and you let everybody do stuff, then something wonderful
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.240]   is going to appear at the end of it.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.920]   And I'm not actually sure that works.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:22.000]   Because oftentimes, the people that are developing all these gizmos and gadgets and add-ons and
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.160]   extras and all the rest of it are developers.
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:27.160]   They're people with an engineering background or a coding background.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.680]   They're not somebody that's focused on design.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.760]   And I think that why Apple's approach works so well is because you've got people-- it's
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.200]   been driven by design rather than technology.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:43.520]   So I'm not convinced necessarily that we are going to see some kind of wonderful evolved
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.920]   creature come out at the other end of this because I think sometimes you do need somebody
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.920]   to design the creature personally.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.640]   Well, that's Johnny Ive and that's at the Appleware.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.640]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.640]   I agree with you.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.640]   But that's also--
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.280]   That's at the base, not an ecosystem.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:04.760]   I know is merging-- technology-- I don't mean to say that programming is going to become
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.120]   a commodity.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:10.120]   But storage like Amazon are helping to make that some of a commodity.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.280]   Design is one of the differentiating factors.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.160]   It's part of-- I don't distinguish now.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:20.000]   I don't think you can be a great developer without having some either design talent or
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.440]   focus because absolutely you won't survive.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.960]   I mean, obviously I'm biased being a designer.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.640]   But that's why I quite like what Microsoft are doing because like you say, they're kind
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.960]   of a hybrid the halfway in between where they're much more open than Amazon, which-- sorry
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:38.160]   Amazon-- much more open than Apple, which kind of encourages innovation.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.280]   But they still seem to have some kind of design direction behind them.
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:47.840]   So if I was putting money at the moment on the major competitor with Apple, I have to
[00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.240]   say I would say Microsoft rather than Google.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.640]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.640]   Wow.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.960]   That's-- that may be completely naive of me.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.960]   Well, OK.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:01.960]   Fair enough.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   Even in the accent, the accent doesn't rescue you that one.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:05.960]   Doesn't rescue you that one.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.560]   Here's another way to agree with you.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:10.400]   It's like the Gecko Gekko.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:15.360]   Regardless of how well Microsoft does or doesn't do, there's room for at least three
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.360]   major ecosystems.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.800]   So those are the three that you predict--
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.800]   Microsoft and Android.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   Do you know which one?
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.200]   Well, if HP, when they got rid--
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.200]   WebOS had a chance.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.120]   Before they got rid of Leo or whatever, I didn't know anything about him.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.480]   But when they had WebOS and John Rubenstein was there and I thought, if they-- they'd
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.760]   developer interest, there was room for that third one beyond Android.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.920]   Now it's going to be Microsoft.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.040]   But there'll always be a battle for three no matter how strong a fourth one is.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.040]   So that's another way.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.520]   Google and Apple don't have to lose from Microsoft to do OK.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.520]   No, absolutely.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.440]   But I think the other thing-- it goes back to what you were saying earlier.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.680]   One of the things that concerns me about Google is their lack of focus, as you were saying.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.600]   It's almost like Yahoo all over again, that they're going in so many different directions
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.360]   that they're lacking focus.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:06.000]   I feel like Microsoft have almost passed through that era of where they're beginning now to
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   feel a little bit more focused to me in certainly in their design aspects.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   You're shaking your head.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.280]   Yesterday, just yesterday, Palmer said Apple hasn't actually made a product yet that consumers
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.280]   use.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.280]   Like--
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.880]   Yes, Google it.
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.320]   What world is he living in?
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.320]   Exactly.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.320]   As long as--
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.520]   A hundred million iPads, but no one's using them.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.520]   Exactly.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.760]   He said something to that effect, almost verbatim yesterday.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:29.760]   Unbelievable.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.480]   And of course he's going to say that.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:36.760]   But I think you're forgetting that there are decades of cultural inertia at that company
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.880]   that have yet to play themselves out.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.440]   I don't know that they could sustain anything they're releasing right now.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.440]   Maybe.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.440]   I mean, what am I?
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.440]   I'm just a designer.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.440]   What do I know about these things?
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.640]   I'm just looking at some of the stuff Microsoft is doing.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.600]   I'm more encouraged at the direction that they're going than I have been for a long
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.600]   time.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.600]   That I--
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.520]   Fear is a good motivator and it's a good way to get focused, right?
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.680]   When you're scared about someone else doing something really well that you haven't been
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.680]   able to pull off.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:08.280]   On the other hand, looking over your shoulder is a pretty bad way to design technology.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.480]   Well, that's true.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.200]   I mean, that's why it is pretty cool.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.880]   I mean, I think the point that Metro is something new and different.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.200]   I think that Microsoft definitely deserves credit for that.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.200]   I agree.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.200]   I agree.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.200]   Sorry.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:24.880]   But, you know, Leo, you said you really like the surface.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.880]   I'm curious to know.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.200]   Is that going to be your tablet?
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.200]   Is that going to be your tablet?
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.200]   No.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.200]   No, no, no.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.200]   They're like a tablet.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   That's crazy.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.200]   They'll get crazy on me.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.160]   Lots of people said they liked it, but is anyone really going to use it full time?
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.800]   You could easily use it full time.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.080]   But the problem I have with it is it isn't a tablet.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.720]   It's really just a very small laptop.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.240]   I'm going to bring it to Australia.
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:48.520]   You know, I should mention that this show will be handled by others for the next couple
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:54.240]   of three weeks because I'm going to go on a geek cruise leaving on Sunday.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.240]   And I am going to bring that.
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.240]   I'm going to bring an iPad mini.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.200]   I'm not going to have an iPad fourth generation by then.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:02.520]   So I'll bring the old iPad.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:08.480]   A Galaxy Note 2, a Galaxy Nexus 7, which will be useless because there's no Wi-Fi on the
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.120]   ship.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.000]   And then I'll bring a Windows 8, which is also Surface RT, which is also useless without
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   Wi-Fi.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.640]   So when I go on conferences and things like that now, I mainly just take my iPad.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.160]   I notice that's all you're using.
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.160]   I see it.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.160]   You know, it's interesting.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.120]   This might be a good measure because people who do panel shows usually bring on this network,
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.080]   usually bring their own computers or devices.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.200]   Far more and more and more are bringing iPads often with keyboards.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:39.640]   I was going to say that what I haven't got on the desk here is the Logitech Ultra Thin
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.640]   keyboard.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.980]   But I would say if that's what you're doing, then you should look at Surface RT because
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.980]   I think it's exactly that.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.980]   Right, okay.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:46.980]   Yeah.
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:47.980]   It's basically a tablet.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:48.980]   The keyboard is better designed.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.980]   The keyboard, you know, the keyboard.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.980]   I love the keyboard.
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.440]   The touch keyboard is a tablet.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.120]   Well, yeah, that's a little weird feeling when you do that because you've got keys on
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.120]   the old computer.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.120]   Oh, love the keyboard.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.280]   They say you can do that, but it doesn't feel right that you've got, even though the
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.600]   keys aren't live, I'm typing.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.600]   It's not good.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.560]   What's the keyboard actually feel like?
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.560]   Is it?
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.480]   Well, I wish I had brought it today.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.480]   So there's two keyboards.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.180]   There's a what they call the touch keyboard, which doesn't move at all.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:21.060]   It's just keys painted on a plastic surface.
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.060]   Do you have yours?
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.520]   Is Alex here?
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:27.220]   He might have his touch keyboard is like halfway between a screen keyboard and a real
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:28.220]   keyboard.
[00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.220]   Yeah.
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.220]   Well, it's like, it's like, it's chiclets, right?
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.220]   Oh, okay.
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:33.340]   So it doesn't, it doesn't move at all.
[00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.660]   I got the type keyboard.
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.220]   I mean, this, this is close.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.900]   I mean, it feels like it could be, but I could not.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.900]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:41.900]   I don't buy that.
[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:46.420]   But then there's the, which, what's worthwhile, there's the, the type keyboard, which actually
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:50.600]   is moving keys and it's probably no different than, than, than, than, say, very thin.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   Very thin.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.600]   Very light.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:53.600]   Is this a magnetic detach?
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   Very good.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   Now here's what I'm wondering.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.800]   Like when it's magnetic detach, that felt like something that's clearly patentable by
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   Apple.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.320]   And how did so quick, how does Microsoft so quickly get something that's obviously so
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.320]   close to it?
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.960]   Well, let's see if Apple sues.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:06.960]   It's a bet.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.960]   It's much better.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   Wow.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:09.960]   You can't do that with a smart cover on a, I'm shaking.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.860]   So I'm shaking. I, the Microsoft store on my mall, the day it was all announced and,
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:18.260]   and your, your Scientology references apt because it was like they were cultists.
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:19.580]   I'll try to, you were, you were, you were, you were, you were, you were, you were, you
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:20.580]   were trying to get people to come in.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:22.380]   It was so sad and so desperate.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.380]   So this is, so this is.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.740]   Marco wrote a sad post about that.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.660]   Oh, you know, Marco though, I, I, yeah, I read his posts, but it was a little snarky.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.660]   I was unnecessarily snarky.
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.660]   I agree.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.660]   I agree.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.460]   I don't, I'm not a big fan of making fun of people who make $14 an hour in a demo on
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.460]   a software.
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:39.780]   I mean, it was, it was a little rough, but, but he did make some, you know, points.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.480]   Some of the points were very well taken.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:43.780]   By the way, this is how Jeff said they were all very nice.
[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.480]   You don't, you wouldn't want to hold this.
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:50.040]   And the other thing is this is because it's 16 nine, it's just, it's a strange way to
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.040]   hold it in portrait.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.400]   It's, it feels odd.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.880]   There's also, even though it is not heavier than the iPad feels heavier than the iPad.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.600]   And even though it's not thicker, much thicker than the iPad because it's square, it feels
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.600]   thicker than the iPad.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:04.240]   You know, all, nevertheless, I think this is comparable to carrying around an iPad in
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.080]   a keyboard and I, by the way, the touch keyboard is very good.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.280]   I like the touch keyboard a lot.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.660]   You guys, you're giving all the attention here.
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:16.460]   We're not blaming you to the Microsoft announcement and to the Apple announcement and Google blew
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.460]   it.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.460]   They were going to hold it.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.460]   We're trying.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.460]   We were trying to.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:26.020]   I got derailed and I was going to go and on all that, but, but they just, it just fizzled.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:29.460]   And I think it's a bigger announcement than they are getting credit for right now.
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.900]   Well, I just, which, what do you think is the biggest story?
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:38.700]   The Nexus four, this high res, Nexus 10 tablet or $29 for an unlocked.
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:42.120]   The super phone is pretty easy.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.520]   With the wireless charger.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.120]   That wireless charger is so cool.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.120]   Oh, yes.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.120]   I want that so bad.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.800]   Is it an induction charger?
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.280]   Like the, like the power.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   I so want that on.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.280]   I have devices.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.920]   How long before you either way, can I just point out windows phone has that and has had
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.440]   that for some, you know, okay.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.640]   No, moving on from never mind.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:11.640]   And, and Android four two is really cool.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.640]   The calling.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.640]   It is not a key lime pie.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.640]   It is the new flavor of jelly bean.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.640]   Right.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.640]   And it's got a swipe typing.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:18.640]   So it's kind of like swipe.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.020]   So you drag your finger from letter to letter to type, suppose, leave better and faster.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:26.980]   It's got these not panoramic photos, but I forget what they're calling them.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.600]   You basically can take photos kind of in a three of a 360 area and it stitches them together.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.600]   They're called photo spheres.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:36.040]   Thank you, Chad.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.680]   And, and user switching, which, you know, I got to tell you, I, that's going to be great.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.520]   I mean, we, we leave the next seven lane around the house and my wife and I, you know, share
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:48.640]   it and it'll be awesome just for her to be able to switch to her desktop, her home screen
[00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.120]   and for me to switch back to mine.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.040]   Microsoft, by the way, did photos synth.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.440]   It was available in iOS that does the photo spheres.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.000]   That's been around for a while.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.360]   Let's not forget the Palm pre did the inductance charging.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.160]   It's like we're talking history.
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.160]   This looks cool, though.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.720]   One of the features of 4.2 is daydream mode.
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:11.240]   So when you plop your Nexus 4 on the, on the little thing, it goes into daydream mode and
[00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:16.600]   shows photo albums, news from Google currents and other content as it's, it's, it's a,
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   it's a chubby.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:24.120]   This, this, this charging sphere looks like they took a Nexus Q and kind of sliced it
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.120]   out in the middle.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.400]   And it's got magnets in it and you can, you can put the, put the phone and portrait or landscape
[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.920]   and then it goes in that daydream mode.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:34.480]   Oh, and Google now actually got, and I should have included this in the change on Google
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.880]   now got an update.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.880]   Yes.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.880]   Now shows you cards from Gmail and, and other, and give, gives you other answers.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:44.560]   And I think you can get that on 4.1, 4.1 devices and up right now.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.920]   I can't wait to get 4.2 onto my Galaxy Nexus.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.920]   I'm still not getting good stuff from Google now.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.000]   I didn't complain about last week.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.480]   I go into every possible setting.
[00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:58.320]   If anybody out there has, I've turned it on somebody's, came in and said I got to turn
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:36:59.320]   it on in my preferences.
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.320]   You're holding it wrong or something.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.320]   It counts.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.320]   Because look what I got.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.040]   Now this is completely spontaneous.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.240]   It's now giving me a card for stocks that change more than 1% in a day.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.280]   Facebook down 3.9% percent when the stock market reopened this morning.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.040]   Apple down 8 bucks.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.240]   It knows why stocks and I didn't get that.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.880]   Yeah, this is, it just telling me that some packages have shipped from Amazon.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:23.920]   It's, I didn't tell any of this stuff.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.080]   What temperature it is, my next show.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.280]   It showed me the Niners score, but yeah, I swiped that off because I've seen, you know,
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.680]   I said it was done.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.240]   I tied it to, I changed all my accounts last week.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:38.360]   So the only thing that's left on my old, uh, uh, plain old Gmail account is, is Google
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.360]   Plus.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:44.520]   Everything else, my phone, Google now, my browsers, everything else is my apps account.
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.400]   And I'm not getting crap on now.
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.560]   I'm just, I'm loving Android more and more.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:50.560]   Jelly Bean is great.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:51.560]   I can't wait to see more too.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:57.720]   Does Google Plus allow you, by the way, to do multiple, multiple initiate, multiple Google
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:02.000]   Hangouts of multi party on mobile or is it just person to person?
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.400]   I don't, I think it's just personal.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:04.400]   We try.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.400]   No, you can have a group.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.400]   You can do a group.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:07.400]   You can do a group.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.400]   I'm making like join a group, but can you host?
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.400]   Can I host a group?
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.400]   Good question.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.560]   I don't, I can't even find how to do it.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.560]   That's so hard.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.800]   So buried.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:16.760]   Where do I, how do I, I'll never mind.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.480]   I can never find this.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:21.040]   So you like it more and more, but you can never find.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.040]   I don't use Google Plus.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.040]   All right.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:28.080]   Well, at least they finally made Chrome the default browser in Android now, right?
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.400]   Chrome is the default browser in Android 4.2 now.
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.400]   That's good.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.400]   I think so.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.400]   Chrome is great browser.
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.400]   Love Chrome.
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.400]   So that's where it's smart.
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.400]   Where you have Android as like your native operating system.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.880]   And then you've got Chrome as like the backup.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.160]   This one thing I try to get Sundar Pashaj to do is to say, Hey, every best buy sounds
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.280]   like 25% of all laptops.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.320]   Every computer that goes out the door, let's put a second OS on there.
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:51.120]   So if your windows crashes, that's a good idea.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.160]   You could boot to a second, you know, 100 meg parts of Chrome OS and ROM.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.160]   Tried to talk them into it.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.440]   I think this is an outdo this for like no charge.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.560]   Well, you know why they didn't do it because it deprecates it.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.680]   It says, well, this is just your backup OS.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.680]   It's not a real OS.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.680]   I said they want it to be a real OS.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.680]   Go ahead.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.680]   Good luck.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.680]   You guys see it.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.480]   Get your Google back.com.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.480]   Yes.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:12.480]   This is for Windows 8.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:15.440]   Windows 8 users.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.080]   But it doesn't work for RT.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.080]   Oh, it doesn't.
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.080]   Okay.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.080]   So it's kind of a bummer.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.800]   They only have a metro app for the desktop version.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.120]   Get your Google back.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:29.280]   The problem was, of course, that you don't have a Google search widget on Windows 8.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.760]   So you can put Google on your start page with the Google search app, but it is not for
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.760]   Windows RT.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:39.000]   And I think Google better hurry up and make one for Google RT.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.600]   Windows RT, not Google RT.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.640]   Get your Google back.com.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.640]   How long before this is this weekend's surface?
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.360]   Has that come up yet?
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.960]   We're launching it, actually.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:51.680]   What, December?
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.440]   We're calling it turning the tiles.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.520]   I like this weekend tiles better.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.200]   It won't be-- that's-- yeah, it could be this weekend tiles.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   We actually aren't sure.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.200]   But yeah, we're not going to launch a show.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   But it won't be surface.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.000]   It'll be metro.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.160]   But we can't call it metro.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.360]   It won't be just RT because it'll be Windows 8 and Windows Phone.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.360]   This is my point.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.360]   Vakers has not changed.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.360]   Yeah, they're the same.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.360]   It's still fragmented as hell.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.360]   But so is Google.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.360]   Like your metaphor.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.840]   I love that metaphor.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.840]   Intelligent design, Apple.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.080]   Evolution, Google.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.600]   Microsoft, we still--
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.760]   Scientology is a--
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.960]   It's not bad.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.960]   It's not bad.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.800]   It's close.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.000]   You keep going here.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.800]   So that means that Steve Jobs is God.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.280]   Larry Page is Moses.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   No, Larry Page is Moses.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:43.560]   Every Moses is a Google is a mindless slug
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.440]   that is just running--
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.440]   Darwin.
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.440]   Yeah, it's Darwin.
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.560]   There is no intelligence.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.560]   It is just--
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.560]   I think it's pre-accurate.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:55.880]   Because the PageRank algorithm actually mimics how insects use
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.160]   chemicals to find food.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.400]   Reproductive mechanism.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:03.720]   And so thus Steve Bomber is necessarily--
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:04.320]   what's his name?
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:04.760]   The fact that--
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:05.600]   Elrond Hubbard.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.080]   Elrond Hubbard.
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.080]   I think that's very apt.
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:07.760]   He's Elrond Hubbard.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:08.280]   Right?
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:08.800]   It works.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.960]   The weird thing is that Google's, though, all their
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.800]   evolutionary motive is powered by this parallel universe
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.280]   called advertising revenue.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.440]   That funds all their distractions.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.440]   Right.
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.480]   So in real evolution, it's the reproduction of the gene.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.480]   In Google, it's the reproduction of the ad.
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:24.280]   They just want the link.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:26.280]   The link is the link data.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.400]   I think that's very apt.
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.240]   And it is exactly how Google works, which is why they can just--
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.520]   all they have to do is generate.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.840]   They have to be generative.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.040]   They don't have to come up with good.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:34.840]   Just generate.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.440]   The more we use the net, the more they may have.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:38.400]   Well, you know--
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.760]   The most beautiful business model there is.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:43.560]   There's a certain amount that consumers can absorb
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.640]   but functionality.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.000]   There's a lot of things that even iOS does that most users aren't
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.080]   even aware of.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.040]   And nothing breaks my heart more than--
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:50.840]   this is afternoon.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.320]   I gave my wife her new iPhone 5.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.200]   I'm looking at does this.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.000]   She's like, I don't care.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:54.520]   I don't care.
[00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.280]   Exactly.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.720]   So this is where Android and Microsoft can actually make
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.520]   inroads to people because it's good enough.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.040]   I really wish I had the new--
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.360]   is it called Field Trip?
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:05.960]   I love it.
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:07.360]   I've been waiting for years.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.640]   It's annoying, but I love it.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.680]   I'm going to use it in Australia.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.200]   I can't wait to try it.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.160]   Now, so OK.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.520]   So if Google is evolution, the survival
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.800]   of the fittest Darwinianism, then I
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.560]   think France must be Tennessee.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:24.600]   Listen, here's my view on France.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.280]   Every country has a different take on fermented spirits,
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.400]   chicken and fish.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.760]   But I know of no culture, no pun intended,
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.560]   that can take bacteria, stick it in a cave,
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.200]   and come up with blue cheese.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:34.680]   The French win.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.240]   The French win on that regard and that account.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.480]   After meeting with Eric Schmidt,
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.720]   France stands by its threat to write a law forcing Google
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.760]   to pay to link to news sites.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.920]   I was on France 24 for a so-called debate on Monday
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.400]   as the storm was coming through.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.920]   I was already in a bad mood.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.320]   And the French got me in a really bad mood.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.880]   And I just started yelling at them.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:58.600]   It's Francois Halland.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:01.000]   I don't think Sarkozy is bad as he was.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.720]   I don't think even he would have done this.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.880]   No, this is beyond--
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.600]   This is the socialist, Touland.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.960]   And they keep going around trying to argue that, well,
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.440]   well, they make money on our content
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.960]   or we have to make money from content.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.960]   Well, no, they don't.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.640]   They send you options.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.760]   Well, we deserve the kind of this expense of, well,
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.400]   I don't care.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.640]   They have a better business model, the competitive.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:22.280]   Then they dropped that whole line in the debate and said,
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.400]   well, Google doesn't pay as taxes here, it pays it in Ireland.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.400]   We need to get taxes on it.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.440]   We just need money out of them.
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:27.960]   I don't even know why Google's arguing.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:28.800]   Just pull out.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.320]   Just stop linking to news sites.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.240]   Yeah, and finally, Google has threatened to.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.440]   Finally, Google has gotten--
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.000]   Google has gotten--
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:34.520]   Say fine.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:34.880]   --what's the frame.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.960]   We're going to hone in.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:36.800]   You'd want us to pay.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.840]   We're not going to pay, so we'll stop linking to sites.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.320]   Good luck.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.200]   Good luck with that.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.400]   They already took on China, and that didn't really
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:46.440]   work out so great for them.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.000]   But again, they don't really care.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.840]   It's-- yeah.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:53.400]   They don't need a link to French news sites.
[00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:57.360]   In effect, the French newspaper will disappear under the waves,
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.960]   and then that'll be it.
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.400]   It'll be goodbye.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:00.920]   Right?
[00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.720]   This is the contrary.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:02.600]   This is cool.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.000]   He was seeing a whole different Jeff Jarvis on TV
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.280]   than he saw on Twig, and I wanted to respond that, no, that
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.320]   is you, but we just softened you a little bit.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:10.820]   So what?
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.120]   So were you really harsh?
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.560]   Yeah, I finally just had it, because I'm also screaming at them.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.700]   I'm the only guy on Skype, and they're in the studio,
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.320]   and I just started going after.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.720]   Is there a video of this anywhere I really want to see this?
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:26.380]   Yeah, but they were using Google Translate to Translate
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:28.400]   you until it came across as half as a server.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.960]   Would Jeff speaks an interesting form of French?
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.320]   Did you speak French?
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:34.320]   No, no, no.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.320]   I got to speak French.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.360]   I still get credit for saying a German word right.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.540]   It's under related after the meeting with Eric Schmidt there.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.140]   There's video.
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:42.780]   It's long.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.700]   Maybe you can just randomly fast forward.
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:50.460]   I would really like to just get a clip of you fuming.
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.260]   I think it was Al--
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.180]   I was throwing truth grenades.
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.380]   I just had it with--
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:55.500]   Awesome.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.700]   Truth grenades.
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.500]   But nobody on the panel saw it your way.
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.380]   One woman did, defending the kind of the new media way
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:05.940]   to look at it, but the other guys were just so--
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.560]   it was just so entitled.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.960]   We are the industry.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.120]   We should be protected and covered.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.640]   And I said, why do you deserve that protection?
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.720]   You don't deserve it.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.840]   Well, just because Google makes more money competes with you,
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.640]   that means you should take money from them
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:20.880]   because you're screwed up.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:21.600]   Sorry.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.960]   That's a kind of-- for better or worse,
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.120]   that is a kind of French attitude.
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.360]   It's a cultural difference.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.400]   They have this very different attitude towards things like this.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:34.080]   And I don't agree with them, but it's
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.360]   there, right, if they want to throw a wobbly over this.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.180]   And Google a pull out, and that'll be the end of it.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.040]   Here's Jeff.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.840]   You look just as pink on French TV.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.500]   I know I do.
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.200]   I know I do.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.080]   Can you hear him?
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.560]   Is it me?
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.480]   No, I'm having that thing.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.100]   I have it in a little pull it up.
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.640]   Chad's got a better way to--
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.040]   What should happen right now is Robert
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.840]   Steven should swoop in and fix it for you.
[00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.920]   No, actually, I would like to dub my voice in.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.520]   And guess what you're saying?
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.760]   But miss you.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.640]   I could disagree completely.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.240]   Hi.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.320]   So is it all in English?
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:08.820]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:13.800]   It's really carrying the product of the devil.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.400]   You couldn't have this many bibles done that one.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.760]   Oh, he's referring to Gutenberg, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.160]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.760]   Again, with the religious.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.760]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:22.600]   Google ascending--
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:23.760]   Again with the Gutenberg.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.160]   --people to media every year.
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.320]   And it's up to media to then do something about that
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.160]   in the form of serving those people well--
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.720]   people pay us good money to send traffic to their websites
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:36.240]   in ads.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.640]   There's no reason to say that the old industry has
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.160]   to be protected by society when a new technology comes along.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:46.080]   But we're seeing old media and government institutions
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.120]   threatened by the internet joining together
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:51.760]   with this kind of Luddite efforts in Germany
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.560]   with the Lystrom Schutzrecht there.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.560]   Oh, look at that.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:55.160]   Look at that.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.680]   He threw in the Lystrom Schutzrecht.
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:00.800]   An absurd, laughable, but we're not so potentially dangerous.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.040]   Why potentially dangerous?
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:06.880]   This is fun.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.800]   I'm not going to speak to you.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.520]   I'm not going to say a word to you.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:17.840]   Because if suddenly you could be taxed for--
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.120]   And what is the-- is it random video they're showing?
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.360]   They had-- they-- whenever they--
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:23.920]   I hate TV.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.720]   Whenever they cut to Jeff, it was random B-roll.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.640]   Off to the side.
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.120]   These picture is mapped.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.440]   So we're going to show you a random B-roll.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.440]   So you don't get bored.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.800]   I feel really to distract people from this need to say
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.240]   what he's saying and some of this.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.520]   Look, at the very end, I took my webcam
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:41.120]   and I said to the journalist, I put it up by window
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:44.040]   and I said, we don't need you to tell us it's rainy here
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.520]   in New Jersey.
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.800]   I love it.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.160]   Jeff, you're the best.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.000]   So let's take a break.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.120]   We've got a good panel here.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:55.360]   Jeff Jarvis and Gina Trepani is usual from Boag World.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.120]   It's Paul Boag.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.960]   Web entrepreneur and visitor to the brick house.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:01.440]   Nice to have you.
[00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:01.940]   I know.
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:02.440]   It's nice to be here.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.800]   Yeah, it's great to have you.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:08.440]   Also, former CTO and founder of the Geek Squad, Robert Stevens,
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:10.360]   what are you up to these days, Robert?
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.960]   I just got my family settled here in San Francisco.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:13.760]   Are you moving down here?
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.440]   Yeah, two months ago and I live in the city
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.040]   and my daughter's out of high school.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.720]   So it was either now or wait four years.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:21.880]   And I'm taking a year off and then I've
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.480]   got a few things I'm thinking about doing.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.760]   But I won't be going back to any large corporations.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.880]   Are you sure angel investor--
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.800]   No, I would be a horrible investor.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.800]   I plan on funding my--
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.680]   I've funded Geek Squad myself and I plan on funding my next startup
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.200]   all the time.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:35.720]   Do your own thing.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.880]   So you're going to stay an entrepreneur.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.520]   Good for you.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:38.280]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:38.960]   We.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:39.880]   We.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.520]   We, we, as they say--
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:43.080]   May we.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:47.640]   Our show today brought to you by American Express Bank, FSB.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.320]   We all think we should save more, right?
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:54.400]   But this is a way to do it easily, simply and at a very high
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.040]   return.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:49:00.520]   Go to personalsavings.com/onlinesavings right now

[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.600]   Savings Bank.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.920]   It's a great idea as an adjunct to what you're already doing.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.800]   You could set up a savings account automatically
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.280]   transfer funds from your existing bank accounts.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.880]   You're not switching banks.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.160]   But you're getting the ability to keep track of your balance
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.560]   via phone or web 24/7.

[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.440]   And an APR that is higher than your banks.
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.480]   I'm pretty sure of that.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.640]   A great complement to your existing financial tools,
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.680]   give it a try.

[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.360]   American Express Bank FSB, member FDIC.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.280]   I always wanted to say that.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.360]   Member FDIC.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.280]   Battery's not included.
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.200]   We thank American Express for seeing
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.800]   the light on new media.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:07.360]   Support them because they're supporting us.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.040]   It's really great.
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:14.600]   Moving along, I think we're done with France.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.680]   It's obvious.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.440]   They're folly.
[00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:17.320]   Well, the whole nation.
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.360]   They make great blue cheese.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.440]   And that's about it.
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.280]   Google is testing same day delivery for shoppers.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.560]   This is something we'd heard Amazon was doing.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.480]   Yeah, this is the real war.
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:29.160]   Now the war.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.480]   This is where the war--
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.040]   What does this do to Best Buy, Robert?
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.280]   Oh, this is great news for every physical retailer.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:36.960]   What?
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:39.400]   Oh, this is huge news for every physical retailer.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.440]   The one thing that beats--
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:40.960]   You're going to deal with it.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.080]   Again, if you're going to compete against Walmart on price,
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:43.920]   you're going to be dead.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:43.920]   Right.
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:47.760]   And if you're trying to compete against Amazon on pure digital,
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.800]   you're not going to win.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:52.280]   But the one thing that beats free overnight shipping
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:54.320]   is in stock near you right now.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.240]   And Google-- and I can tell you, there's probably at least
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.440]   10 startups right here in the Bay Area that
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:03.320]   are working on same day dispatch because Airbnb, Uber,
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:07.160]   Instacart, Postmates, they're all dispatch algorithms.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.640]   And that's going to commoditize it
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.520]   and make it as easy as cloud computing
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:14.480]   for a small little sports shop that focuses on what they sell
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.040]   to make their inventory in squares,
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.920]   and how digitized people's inventory.
[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:21.520]   So over the next couple of years, this is great news.
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:23.520]   You know, it's--
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.000]   What did they say about Walmart?
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.600]   Expedia didn't put travel agents out of business.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.320]   They put mediocre travel agents out of business.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:33.160]   The good ones that survived-- focused, wedding tourism,
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.840]   eco tourism-- same thing will happen with technologies
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:36.600]   like this.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.680]   Let me understand this, Robert.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:41.640]   So what you're saying is that rather than putting
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.640]   a retailer out of business, this now
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:46.880]   makes their inventory able to be delivered.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.640]   Same day through a merchandising platform
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:54.240]   such as Google and eBay and through a delivery platform
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.800]   like what Airbnb is building.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:56.760]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.760]   If you look at what eBay's done, and I think they've actually
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.120]   done an brilliant job of their acquisitions of Magento and GSI,
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.640]   I met with John Donahoe a year ago.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:04.800]   And the first thing he said to me goes,
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.960]   we're not a competitor, best buy.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.680]   We want to enable commerce.
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:10.160]   And, you know, not-- again, not every little retailer
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.920]   can be able to build their own stack.
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:14.440]   So they're going to use Square and other services
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:18.560]   like Sanjay Delivery, which is vetted with reputation systems
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.000]   and varying levels of quality.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.200]   This is where Uber could become a verb,
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.800]   much beyond black car service.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:25.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:27.200]   And Amazon will have stock.
[00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:29.240]   I Uber'd by toilet paper today.
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.240]   Well, let's put this stock.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.840]   No, in fact, this is what they say.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.560]   Google is not intending to operate warehouses or a shipping
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.120]   service, but--
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.720]   So it won't have stock where it has a real amount of--
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.480]   They want to team up with retailers and delivery companies.
[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:42.680]   Now, here's my prediction.
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.480]   Google came to us as with everything else, Google Wallet.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.240]   And they only call you when they want something.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.240]   My prediction?
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.720]   Google will have a lot of money.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:50.920]   They'll make a big splash.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.040]   They will not execute very well, especially on this.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:55.080]   This is a company that doesn't even have an 800 number.
[00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:56.320]   Try and get them on the phone.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.800]   You think they're going to do well in the physical world?
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.720]   I will trust a company that's more like an Evernote or an Uber
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:02.640]   that focuses on--
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.800]   Or Amazon, right?
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.440]   Does Amazon have a head start here?
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.040]   I think you're going to see, again, a blended version.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.800]   One is where it's either a high end
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.840]   or they're independent contractors who may show up
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.920]   in a gene and a t-shirt, but they'll get the product to you.
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.480]   They may not be dressed very nicely.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:17.920]   I also really love these lockers.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.440]   Like a courier.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:18.960]   Like a courier.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.640]   Or these locker systems.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.520]   In fact, I predict that they're going to sell one.
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.400]   I would buy one.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.640]   Imagine a three-foot cube that you could
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.960]   lock outside your house and the side of your house.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.000]   And it could be unlocked with disposable codes
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.160]   for the UPS guy to--
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.200]   I would like that because I miss a lot of deliveries.
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:33.560]   That's a good idea.
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:34.520]   You're going to see--
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.840]   I bet there's at least one or two startups.
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.520]   I know one is doing it like that.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.760]   They're doing like the cart systems for that.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:44.400]   So if I had a Google locker in my front porch,
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.880]   things would arrive in there.
[00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:46.440]   Again, I don't think--
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.800]   It's like the mailman.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:49.800]   Or the milkman.
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.160]   Well, which these were placed in anyway.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:53.520]   This replaces the mailman.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.760]   So the Postal Service, not to go up on a tangent here,
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.520]   but the Postal Service is becoming purely
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.480]   an advertising delivery mechanism.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.480]   It is for just crap.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.480]   That's what it does.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.240]   So there are-- the only growth area in delivery
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:06.920]   is parcels and deliveries.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.480]   And it's super growth if you could now
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:09.840]   take the things you used to drive to
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.440]   and have them come to you.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:15.160]   Gina, you as a new mom, are you ordering things in more?
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.200]   Less than we're--
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.840]   Oh, definitely.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.560]   Definitely.
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:19.600]   Well, and that's the thing.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:20.800]   I don't want to go to--
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.320]   even if Amazon has boxes at 7/11, which they're doing
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:26.520]   in some areas, and I can go pick up my stuff,
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:28.280]   I want it at my doorstep.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:30.320]   I don't even want to get in the car at all.
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.320]   I don't want to leave the house.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.760]   But see, that's why I think brick and mortar's kind of troubled.
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.600]   Yes, people still go to brick and mortar
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:39.560]   because they need toilet paper now or a diaper now.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.600]   But wouldn't it be great if you could go online
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.560]   or to the diaper and still have it now?
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:45.120]   Isn't that what we're trying to get to?
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:45.480]   Yes.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.920]   If something could be ordered better and easier
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.800]   and faster and less expensive online, it will be.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:54.280]   But there is something about browsing.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:56.520]   Now, not every category of things,
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:58.520]   like consumer electronics, not everything that's
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.600]   sold in the Best Buy, is going to just remain in Best Buy
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.560]   even the same day delivery.
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:02.520]   I'm not saying that at all.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.280]   But new kinds of retail.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.960]   Physical retail has a lot of life left.
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.640]   It's a very social experience.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.400]   Well, that's what Jeff's been talking about.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.080]   Listen, when the CD-ROM first came around,
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.440]   they said, oh, it's the death of the book.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.840]   And there's still books and bookstores.
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:19.200]   When the DVD came out, they said, it's
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.440]   the Death of the Movie Theater.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:23.120]   I'm seeing more creativity and nice plush chairs
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:24.840]   and better food at movie theaters.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:26.400]   So I'm not worried about physical retail.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.360]   It's going to kill the mediocre retailers.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.120]   And that'll create a glut of real estate.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:33.960]   But if you believe that there's a retail
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:37.880]   god that smiles down upon little shopkeepers, GPS
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:40.520]   and same day delivery are just the beginning of good things
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:42.120]   for them and square.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:43.800]   If they can figure out how to capitalize,
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:46.600]   if they can be that quality shopkeeper,
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.680]   then those had to take advantage of this.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.160]   True.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.760]   Yeah, well, the food truck movement's very interesting
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.640]   because now people who are saying, I don't even know--
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.920]   I don't have enough capital yet to start a restaurant.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.560]   But I find it for a food truck.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.480]   Build up their name and then become a physical restaurant.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.600]   In Minneapolis, they're doing a light rail right now.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:06.080]   And there's this one Jamaican restaurant that got shut down
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:08.720]   because the construction ruined their business.
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:11.240]   So they converted to a food truck for two years
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.160]   until the street is restored.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:15.840]   So that's what's so cool right now because there's--
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.360]   you just can kind of go any direction you want.
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.680]   You'll love San Francisco.
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.720]   We have a little event every week.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.120]   We're all the food trucks gather.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:23.720]   Off the grid.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:24.440]   Yeah, off the grid.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.280]   You know about it already.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.400]   You're a head man.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:26.920]   You're with it.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.720]   You're doing it.
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.280]   Man, he's already did.
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.200]   I got my bread from Tartine.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.760]   And I got my mission bicycle company.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:33.880]   How long have you been here?
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:34.520]   Two months now.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.240]   Man, you just really acclimated.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.200]   Where were you from originally?
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.560]   I've been watching this show for years.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.840]   Where do you think I learned?
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.680]   Off the grid is really fun.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.280]   It's all the food trucks gather.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:48.360]   And it's a food bizarre.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.160]   And it's amazing.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:51.680]   This is the one in the upper hate on Thursdays.
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.640]   Right there at Golden Gate Park at the Panhandle.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:54.760]   It's pretty cool.
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:55.960]   Pretty cool.
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:56.520]   Makes you hungry.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:58.360]   Just think it about it.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.280]   There's a few few trucks here in San Diego.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.600]   But nothing quite like that event.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.160]   No, we used to call him Roach Coaches.
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:04.640]   It was like he didn't really trust which he
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.400]   were going to eat there.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.600]   Now it's like gourmet.
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.120]   It's the cremeble lei man.
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:09.880]   Comes.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:11.440]   Now it's the Silicon Valley of food.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.360]   It is.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:15.720]   Modern organic Filipino cuisine.
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:18.560]   That's that truck.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.960]   It only incends the fryer.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.480]   I can't wait till you do a cooking show here.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.040]   Organic balloon.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:24.760]   You've got a little picture kitchen in this studio.
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.200]   Mm-hmm.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.600]   Now, did you see on Sunday--
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:29.760]   Robert Scoble was on.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.880]   And he's writing a book on Google Glass
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:37.440]   and apparently got more access to glass than most of us
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.440]   was able to try it.
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.760]   Robert sees the world differently at all times.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.640]   Well, he's an enthusiast.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.840]   So I always-- he loves everything.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.040]   So I know when he--
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.320]   Until he hates it.
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:48.960]   Yeah, it's just because Robert says it's great.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:50.080]   Doesn't mean it's great.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:54.640]   But he was waxing on and on about Google Glass.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.440]   And he says it works.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.120]   You might think, for instance, that field trip program
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.600]   that you're excited about, Robert,
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:02.760]   imagine that's on your glasses.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.000]   Yeah, but Lord helps when the politicians walk around
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:05.480]   with these things.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.720]   Hey, Robert, how are you?
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:09.720]   Can you get a $1,78 donation last week?
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.640]   I also love your mother's alma mater.
[00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.560]   Exactly.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.960]   They're practically doing that already.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:15.800]   Automated sincerity.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.560]   You should see the text messages I get from Barack these days.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.080]   Now, but listen, I want to agree on one thing for Robert,
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:21.440]   OK?
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:25.600]   From now on, a year after Robert is really excited about any app,
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.600]   we're going to have to make him start reusing apps
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:28.920]   that he recommended a year later.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.280]   We live his own recommendations.
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:36.160]   Nothing wears out faster than a Robert Scoble app.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:36.600]   I don't know.
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:38.400]   I think Glass has a lot of potential.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:38.720]   We'll see.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.080]   He does not have it yet, but he was able to play with it
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:41.680]   a little bit more.
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:43.240]   And he's going to ask if he has him.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:43.880]   That's a good thing.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:44.280]   He has him.
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:44.760]   He's actually--
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:45.840]   He's just like you and me.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:46.720]   He's got his number.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.720]   He's got a low number.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:51.480]   You've got to live with something like that day in and day
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:52.960]   out, don't you really?
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:53.520]   I just think--
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:57.320]   My big problem is I have prescription glasses.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:58.400]   Well, they're going to solve that.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:03.080]   In fact, supposedly, you'll go to your optometrist,
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:06.320]   and they'll say would you like that with or without Glass?
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:06.760]   Oh.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:08.960]   I would like to have Robert's wet Mirian on some time.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:11.360]   I would just like to thank her and just say, you know,
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:14.320]   Mrs. Scoble, you're the most patient understanding woman
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:15.520]   I've ever--
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.520]   I mean, this feels like it could be kind of Bluetooth
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.760]   headsets all over again.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.400]   With Bluetooth headsets, I don't know about--
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:24.400]   It's so annoying.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.720]   But you just look a complete prat walking
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.840]   around with one of these headsets.
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:32.600]   And I'm just saying, unless the glasses look just like--
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:34.080]   the pair of glasses I'm wearing now,
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:37.360]   no different whatsoever, you're going to look like an idiot.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:39.640]   And also, the other thing is I've got
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.440]   feeling when you're having conversations with people,
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:42.840]   it's going to feel like you're not giving them--
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.040]   No, they're looking off to your left.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.880]   So we'll look at the screen about what that says,
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:46.880]   about what you're saying.
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:49.320]   So basically, you're seeing totally disinterested
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.240]   in whoever you're talking to.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.840]   But aren't people already doing that where they walk around
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:53.680]   with their--
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.320]   Yeah, better than looking down at your phone.
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.200]   Go downtown.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:56.760]   Just look.
[00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:58.120]   Nobody's looking at anything.
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.320]   They're all looking at their phone.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.080]   Downtown in San Francisco.
[01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:03.000]   No, not in wherever the hell you're from.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.320]   No, in the middle of what-- they don't even
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.120]   know what phones are.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.560]   They're all coming from you.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.240]   You really are from the-- oh, I'm totally out of the stick.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.200]   When I take out my iPhone, they call it the magic box.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.760]   No, no, I'm making it up.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:16.120]   But I'm going to capture my soul.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.920]   No, and it's what's nice about a really big phone like the Note
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:23.840]   2, you can really get lost in it as you walk in the trees.
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.840]   It feels like it's getting a little bit like the clergyman
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.120]   in the 18th century walk around with a prayer book
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:29.960]   constantly.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.420]   Isn't there an app, actually, that
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:35.040]   allows you to read email and stuff that shows the camera view?
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:35.560]   There is.
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.680]   So that you could see where you got--
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.880]   That seems very dangerous.
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.520]   I'm not biased.
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.520]   That's who Microsoft is.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:40.600]   They're the Gideon's.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:41.960]   They're the Gideon's.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:48.200]   A Bible in every hotel room, Windows 8 in every pot.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:48.640]   Let's see.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.640]   What else?
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.040]   Anything more about the Google announcement, I think not.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.840]   Did you see that a Google employee left the Nexus 4
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.920]   in a bar in service to--
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.040]   Oh, that's my memories?
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.080]   Actually, I was waiting for somebody to do that as a PR
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.240]   strategy, because that is the way to launch a phone,
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.440]   because it would get all the attention.
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.200]   You want coverage?
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:08.560]   Sure.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.200]   I think they should have left them in about 100 bars
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.360]   as they're launching out.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.200]   Because that would actually work making it look intentional.
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.160]   Not for sale.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:16.520]   I'm not kidding.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:20.080]   Special secret Google Project 194.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:20.960]   That is a good idea.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.120]   It's a good payoff stunt, that would be good, Mark.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.120]   I would have said in the exact one over and Walnut Creek
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.000]   or over that poor kid left it.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:36.200]   So the Nexus 4 299, November 13th availability.
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:37.120]   Where is it going to be?
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:37.920]   It's from Google.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.560]   So I guess it's T-Mobile or AT.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.520]   Did you buy it to Google?
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:40.880]   No.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:41.960]   Did you drive back to Google?
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:42.720]   Did you drive back to Google?
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.920]   AT and AT is the only one that's going to sell it.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.040]   There's controversy, because it doesn't have LTE.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:49.880]   And some believe that that's Google couchowing,
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.600]   caving to the phone companies for not including LTE.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:55.240]   T-Mobile is going to have an unlocked 199 version
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.600]   with a two-year contract.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.160]   But no LTE.
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:04.840]   Quiet, I just don't know if I want to go T-Mobile again.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.280]   Don't you feel like--
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:11.640]   I'm using my Nexus on AT&T, except for right now
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.080]   during the storm.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.880]   It works pretty darn well.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.040]   I'd just like to say for the UK listeners
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:20.040]   that it's going to be exclusive to O2.
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.120]   Because you always say--
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:21.920]   We don't know.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.840]   That's why we're living in a country that's exclusive to the O2.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.440]   Says here.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:29.240]   We're bordered by water all around.
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.640]   And the people in the other countries are far away.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.240]   They talk funny.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.400]   We are very long wildlife.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.360]   Far away.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.320]   We should mention something.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.960]   I was in Europe the last two weeks.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:41.440]   In Dublin, we're there for a conference.
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:43.160]   You can buy a 20-year-old.
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.520]   All you can eat sim.
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:44.800]   That will--
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:45.440]   That's from three.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:46.800]   Three, right?
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.140]   Yeah.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:48.180]   You can put it in your varieties.
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:48.960]   An iPhone 5.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.520]   Yep.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.240]   That's unlocked.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:50.880]   Unlocked.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.840]   And there's a Heathrow--
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:53.320]   Can you get a nano sim?
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.340]   No, you just take the little clippers and--
[01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:56.480]   I have a nano sim cutter.
[01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.520]   But also--
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.740]   That makes me nervous, though, because it
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.920]   cuts some of the metal on the contacts.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.060]   It's pretty tolerant, though, because up to the metal,
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:04.580]   you're fine.
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:05.740]   There's a lot of redundancy.
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:08.140]   There's a vending machine that sells data sims in Heathrow.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:08.840]   It's a vending machine.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.180]   I love it.
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:09.680]   Brilliant.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.180]   Unfortunately, it's not the same in other European countries.
[01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:14.340]   I wish it were.
[01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.820]   No, they're getting better on that slowly.
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:20.140]   They've now kind of capped how much people
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:23.460]   are allowed to charge on European countries.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:23.800]   Right.
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:24.300]   That's right.
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.500]   So that's better than anything.
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.340]   The roaming has gotten cheaper.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:26.980]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:29.100]   I'm looking forward to-- now, when I get to--
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.640]   maybe somebody in the chat room can help me.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.740]   When I get to Australia on Tuesday,
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.220]   and I will bring an iPhone 5 so I can pop a nano sim,
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:39.700]   will I be able to do the same thing with Telstra or one
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:42.220]   of the Australian carriers I'd like to?
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.060]   That'd be great.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:43.980]   Three, is it?
[01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.260]   Are they like a budget carrier?
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:46.140]   What's the deal with it?
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.380]   Australia, they're kind of--
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.900]   they haven't got the same reach as the other--
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.580]   They're the team mobile or sprint.
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:54.080]   Yes.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:54.580]   Yeah.
[01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.580]   So they tend to do really good deals.
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:57.540]   This is a very fun--
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:58.780]   They're very data for 20 pounds or something like that.
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:00.500]   They're very focused on data.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.180]   That's their big thing.
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.020]   So that's a brilliant deal.
[01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:06.860]   I'm going to move my wife across onto that deal.
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:10.260]   My son is on it at the moment, which he loves.
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:12.700]   He never makes calls, but he uses loads of data.
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:16.100]   So the reason no LTE is because Google wants, of course,
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:19.540]   to control software, no carrier intervention.
[01:04:19.540 --> 01:04:22.460]   And there's no LTE carrier.
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:24.500]   Apparently, we'll go for it.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.900]   Verizon and Sprint say, there's no such thing
[01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:29.460]   as an unlocked CDMA device.
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.500]   We're not going to do it.
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:34.380]   AT&T, which is GSM, is on different frequencies.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:38.780]   So Google would have to build a custom phone for the US,
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:41.060]   as opposed to worldwide.
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:43.020]   And if AT&T won't subsidize, it doesn't
[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:44.620]   make any financial sense to do it.
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:48.660]   Andy Rubin calls the lack of LTE a tactical issue,
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:51.580]   and also cites cost and battery life as another reason not
[01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:52.620]   to support LTE.
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:59.620]   So I have HS, what is it, the HSPA plus?
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:03.580]   Which, you know, the truth is, is not all that bad on T-Mobile
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:09.020]   if everybody-- I saw actually a speed comparison in New York
[01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:09.860]   since the storm.
[01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:14.020]   And a lot of people using other carriers, T-Mobile,
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.220]   nobody has a T-Mobile phone.
[01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:18.140]   So they were actually getting much better performance
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:22.140]   on T-Mobile, even though it wasn't LTE.
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.740]   Did you see in the chat room that you said
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.060]   that 3 is in Australia?
[01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:26.620]   So there you go.
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:27.620]   Ah!
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:28.620]   Ah!
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:29.620]   Ah!
[01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.500]   I have a nano SIM cutter.
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:32.620]   I'm going to bring with me.
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:33.580]   That'll get through the T-S-S.
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:34.100]   Do that line.
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:37.260]   Where do you buy a nano SIM?
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:38.220]   Somebody brought it to me.
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.780]   I think you can buy it online.
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:41.820]   Much to that.
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:46.100]   Did you declare that as income on your taxes?
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.860]   Do you know how you had to report that?
[01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.820]   It's only 50 cents.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:53.540]   I have a question for Gene if I make.
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:55.260]   Gene is a teacher, a developer.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:57.060]   What's your view on Android?
[01:05:57.060 --> 01:05:59.340]   You know, the fragmentation, the different resolutions,
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.740]   is that like it feels like it's not
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:04.300]   becoming any less of a problem?
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:04.820]   It's not.
[01:06:04.820 --> 01:06:07.780]   I mean, you generally, when you build your app,
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:11.500]   you have a lot fewer people using the most recent version
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.500]   of Android.
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.500]   I started doing mobile development on Android,
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:18.100]   so I was always thinking about different resolutions,
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.740]   different screen resolutions, different versions,
[01:06:19.740 --> 01:06:21.500]   whether or not the device had a keyboard or not,
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:22.500]   whether or not it had data or not.
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.500]   I was always kind of thinking about all those options.
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.500]   I think a lot of other folks started on iOS
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.500]   and were so used to, you know, everyone being on,
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.500]   you know, the majority of their users being on the latest version
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.500]   and it being one device to target,
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.500]   that the transition to Android was more painful for them.
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.500]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.500]   I come from a web development background where, you know,
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.500]   I started on the web when there were lots of different browsers
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:45.500]   and we were writing, you know, crappy JavaScript to detect
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.500]   which browser you were using and you had to think about
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.500]   targeting different versions.
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500]   So it didn't feel that different to me on Android.
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.500]   It's painful.
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:55.500]   It's something that Google really has to remedy.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.500]   I think that they're doing that in part
[01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.500]   by building up the Nexus line.
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.500]   I've been a huge fan of the Nexus line since the very beginning
[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:05.500]   and I basically, the Nexus phones are the only ones,
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.500]   devices are the only ones really that I get excited about buying
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.500]   because I feel like I know I'm going to get the latest updates.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.500]   I know I'm going to get to see the latest Android.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.500]   But as a developer, it's painful.
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:17.500]   They need to do a better job of getting people upgraded faster.
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.500]   But for me, it hasn't been as big a deal.
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.500]   I think other mobile developers, especially those who started in iOS
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:27.500]   and came to Android, feel like it's a much bigger problem.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.500]   Yeah.
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:32.500]   I think it's also an issue where you've got future devices.
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.500]   As a new device comes along, that's another screen resolution,
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.500]   another setup that you've got to worry about.
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:42.500]   And so it gets quite expensive for people that are hiring these,
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.500]   you're paying for these apps, that they've got to keep up grading,
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:49.500]   which is why a lot of companies now are looking at responsive design
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:52.500]   and being web-based in order to solve this problem.
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:55.500]   Of course, that comes with lots of limitations to it as well.
[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.500]   It's the biggest one being speed at the moment.
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:01.500]   But that's another way of dealing with it because when with responsive design,
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:05.500]   you're not designing for any specific device or any specific screen size,
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:10.500]   you're building something that essentially responds to whatever size you're currently working on.
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:13.500]   Yeah, responsive design is great for web development.
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:18.500]   And I think that the tools that Google provides for making your app work
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:21.500]   across different layouts are actually quite good.
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:26.500]   With the iPhone, when the iPhone 5 came out, I had to make a new bitmap image
[01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.500]   that would perfectly fit the new 4-inch screen.
[01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:31.500]   And that's the long...
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:35.500]   This app is a particular image, a bitmap.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:39.500]   And on Android, it's like you provide assets for different resolutions.
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.500]   And yeah, that's a pain.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.500]   A friend of mine just ported her iOS app to Android,
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:48.500]   and she tweeted out the list of all the sizes of all the images that she had to create.
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.500]   She was like, "This is crazy. It keeps designers in business."
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:55.500]   And it's a little bit of a pain, but the tools are getting better.
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:59.500]   But can I... I haven't done any Android development myself.
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.500]   Does it suffer from the same problem you get with iOS
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:04.500]   that the actual applications become quite big,
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.500]   because they're holding all the graphics for the different resolution sizes?
[01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:12.500]   So you have this problem, which is going to be an issue with people
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.500]   that have got low-end devices without a lot of storage,
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.500]   suddenly apps are getting so much bigger.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:18.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.500]   That is... That's why things like...
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:23.500]   ... new Android with user switching.
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.500]   If one user downloads an app and installs it,
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.500]   and plays the game and has a high score,
[01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.500]   and you switch to the new user, and that person wants to install that app,
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.500]   it does it instantaneously.
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:35.500]   It uses all the files that are already on the phone with separate user settings,
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.500]   so that was a nice implementation of that.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.500]   But yeah, that is a problem.
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:43.500]   So Linus... I like Linus' idea that we should have a standard resolution for laptops
[01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.500]   of now 2560x1600.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.500]   I wonder if we could do the same for phones.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:51.500]   No, I guess we can't, because there's four by three, they're 16 by nine.
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.500]   I just don't think it's going to happen.
[01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:55.500]   Wouldn't it be nice, though, to have a watch?
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:56.500]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:59.500]   I don't think it's particularly feasible, unfortunately,
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:03.500]   because there are always going to be people that are interested in different-sized screens,
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:08.500]   and you can end up with a very large screen, but a really low resolution on it.
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.500]   Right.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:14.500]   Google, the other last domino falls Google signs, finally, with Warner Music,
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:18.500]   which means now it has all the big four record labels,
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:21.500]   not just in the US, but globally.
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:26.500]   Green Day, Madonna, Neil Young, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.500]   Now on Play.
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:34.500]   Also coming November 13th, Google Play available matches in Europe.
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:35.500]   That's just for you.
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:36.500]   Oh, thanks.
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:37.500]   Yeah, thanks.
[01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.500]   I think the big- I have two teenagers at home.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:42.500]   I have to say the biggest surprise I've seen in the last year,
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.500]   besides my kids, almost, and all their friends,
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.500]   stop using Facebook and almost all go to Twitter,
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.500]   exclusively.
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.500]   Wow.
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:53.500]   And the other thing is my kids and all their friends do it.
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.500]   They're sitting there playing Xbox.
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.500]   My kid has this MacBook laptop open,
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:00.500]   and all their music is being listened to through YouTube.
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:01.500]   YouTube.
[01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:02.500]   Yeah, my kids too.
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.500]   No Spotify, you know, no iTunes.
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.500]   All YouTube.
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.500]   YouTube.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:10.500]   Spotify is more common in the UK, unsurprisingly, but they do.
[01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.500]   Yeah, a lot of- they have the videos running in the background.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:17.500]   I love Spotify, but YouTube has such a huge amount of attraction with kids.
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.500]   So are they making playlists of music videos?
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.500]   Is that what's happening?
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:23.500]   No, they- they- no, because I think they're just using their browser history,
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:26.500]   because kids tend to listen to, like, the same 10, 20 songs.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:27.500]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:28.500]   Right.
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.500]   You know, they're able to use Facebook in the background and switch it.
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:31.500]   And they're not looking at the pictures.
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:32.500]   They're just listening to music.
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:36.500]   I don't know this for sure, but I think what happened is Google
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.500]   works it out with the music company saying, "Listen,
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:42.500]   if we increase the quality of the audio on the YouTube video,
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:43.500]   it used to be crappy.
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.500]   Right.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.500]   If we increase the audio, we'll keep the kids in the browser.
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:49.500]   You'll get all the data with us and we'll advertise to them,
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:52.500]   not just on interstitials, but on banners on the side.
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:57.500]   And I will tell you, I just had a- I had a 25-year-old hipster yesterday in the Bay Area
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.500]   who told me, "YouTube's not doing that well."
[01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:03.500]   I'm like, "Dude, you're old school, man, because my kids-
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:04.500]   You're too old.
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.500]   All they listen to is through YouTube."
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:08.500]   And that really surprised me.
[01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:11.500]   And I think that's just the beginning of, you know-
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:12.500]   You know, I'm with you.
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.500]   I took the Google TV out of the television system,
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:16.500]   because it was just causing problems.
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:19.500]   And my son said, "Hey, Dad, what happened to that thing that let us watch YouTube?"
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:23.500]   They were- they were on the 70s, 60-inch TV.
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:28.500]   They would just sit around five guys, 18-year-olds watching YouTube.
[01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.500]   And it was- a lot of it was music, but a lot of it was also grind shots.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.500]   I mean, it was a variety of-
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:38.500]   I mean, my nine-year-old son doesn't watch TV at all anymore.
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.500]   It's YouTube.
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:40.500]   It's just YouTube.
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:41.500]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:42.500]   Here's what I think they're going to do.
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.500]   They're going to merge YouTube with Google Hangouts.
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.500]   So the-
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.500]   They already have.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:49.500]   You can do a YouTube- a Google Hangout where you're playing videos for each other.
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:50.500]   You're going to do that.
[01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:51.500]   Yeah.
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.500]   That, I think- I don't think the teenagers have discovered that yet.
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:55.500]   I think part of the reason they've jumped to Twitter, my guess,
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.500]   is partly just the iOS integration and celebrities that they follow-
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.500]   It's celebrities, yeah.
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.500]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.500]   But they've almost all stopped using Facebook.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:05.500]   I would guess your teens are not talking on Twitter.
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.500]   They're mostly seeing celebrities.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.500]   No, they're-
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.500]   They're talking-
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:10.500]   They're using the interaction.
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:11.500]   I've had to kind of talk to my kids saying, "You guys,
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:13.500]   Twitter's like all public.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.500]   It's public."
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:17.500]   This is not like your Facebook feed, you know, where your stuff is only seen by your friends.
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:18.500]   Yeah.
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.500]   That's weird.
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:20.500]   So-
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:21.500]   That's not good.
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.500]   Yeah.
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.500]   That Snapchat is the thing, though, that they're all using now.
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.500]   Snapchat.
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:26.500]   Oh, Snapchat.
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.500]   Google that.
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.500]   Snapchat is the hottest thing for teenagers right now.
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.500]   This basically is disposable text messages.
[01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:32.500]   It's in the app.
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:34.500]   Look, they're having fun.
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.500]   You send a photo-
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:36.500]   You send a photo-
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:37.500]   You send a photo-
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.500]   And these kids are sending every 60 seconds.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:40.500]   I think it's stupid,
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:41.500]   but they also learn not to judge teenagers.
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.500]   So it's on Google Play or on the App Store.
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.500]   So-
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:49.940]   When you send a text message or a picture, it is erased off the other person's phones.
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:54.820]   So it could be used for, obviously, less savory, unhealthy things for teenagers to do that
[01:13:54.820 --> 01:13:56.860]   they are known to do.
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:57.860]   But-
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:58.860]   Wait, wait.
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:13:58.860]   It's photo-
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:13:59.860]   Sharing.
[01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:02.740]   So if I send you a photograph, install this thing.
[01:14:02.740 --> 01:14:04.620]   I can then delete the photograph that you-
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:07.220]   No, it's automatically only lasts for 12 seconds.
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:10.220]   It's like the O'Reilly Ignite conferences in the-
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:11.220]   This is only got one.
[01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:13.220]   You can't see it now or never.
[01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:14.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:15.220]   Yeah.
[01:14:15.220 --> 01:14:16.220]   It's like disposable.
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:18.220]   So one of those girls are shocked.
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:20.220]   Now I understand.
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.220]   Look what-
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:22.220]   What do you think they're looking at?
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:23.220]   Take a look at that.
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:24.220]   Well, I get to show me what they're doing.
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:27.860]   A lot of times they're riding in the back of the car and they literally just do like
[01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:28.860]   10 per minute.
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:30.860]   Just constantly doing it.
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:31.860]   Yeah.
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:32.860]   It's bizarre.
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:33.860]   I can't even see the-
[01:14:33.860 --> 01:14:35.500]   This is how fast we become insulated, all right?
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.500]   Like, you're holding-
[01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:39.500]   You need this weekend teenagers because there's a whole other universe of content.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.220]   No, I don't want you because it won't snapchat next week.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.220]   So what's the point?
[01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:45.220]   Well, it's Scoville, shit-hosting.
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:46.220]   Scoville.
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.700]   You never even heard of Snapchat.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:49.700]   I'm downloading it now.
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:50.700]   I'm going to Snapchat Scoville.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:52.100]   Of course, he'll be on there already.
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.500]   I just had an article yesterday.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:54.500]   So somebody just covered it.
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:57.500]   They either raised money, but yeah, they're building a pretty big thing.
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:00.340]   Real-time picture chatting.
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:01.340]   Five stars.
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:02.340]   A lot of people are-
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:03.340]   Somebody in the-
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.980]   Joe Joe in the chat room has said a really good thing, which is, okay, might only be there
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:08.780]   for 12 seconds, but you can take a screenshot in 12 seconds.
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:09.780]   Right.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:10.780]   That's what these teenagers don't know.
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:11.780]   Yeah.
[01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:12.780]   They're going to learn that the whole-
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:13.780]   Wow.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:16.700]   No, actually, they disabled the screenshot.
[01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:19.020]   I tried to test it.
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:22.260]   They actually disabled that while the app is running.
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:24.420]   I just didn't know you could do that.
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:26.380]   Was this the least three days ago?
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:27.380]   This has updated-
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:28.380]   No, this has been-
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.620]   My kids have been doing it for at least three months.
[01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:31.620]   Right.
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:32.940]   It looks like the Android version.
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:34.700]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:39.900]   If you look at the Android version and the installs, it's a day.
[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:42.700]   It's one day and it's 100,000 to 500,000.
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:45.100]   Yeah, that's just the Android version then.
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:47.700]   It's been on iOS for about three months.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:48.700]   Wow.
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:50.700]   I think that 100,000 won, baby.
[01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:52.460]   I'm going to Snapchat you, baby.
[01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:55.340]   Yeah, why don't you Snapchat from your Australian-
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.340]   I will.
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:57.660]   I'm going to Snapchat.
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:00.940]   So can you do group or is it just one version?
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:01.940]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:02.940]   I think it's a group thing.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:06.020]   I mean, these WhatsApp and these other kind of text messaging apps.
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.020]   I use that.
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:09.740]   This is the iteration of that flavor, which has been kind of popular.
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:10.740]   I mean-
[01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:14.020]   It's definitely teenage colors, purple and yellow.
[01:16:14.020 --> 01:16:15.980]   No adult would want a color like that.
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:16.980]   Show the designer.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:20.820]   If you look at it in the App Store as well, the sample screens that they show have all
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:24.380]   got attractive young teenage girls jumping around on it.
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:25.980]   So it's very well-taught.
[01:16:25.980 --> 01:16:26.980]   My son is on it.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:28.980]   Your son is on it.
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:29.980]   Oh my gosh.
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:30.980]   This is the awkward portion of the-
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:31.980]   Oh, this is the awkward portion of the-
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:36.980]   This is the only one like the sex thing app.
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:38.220]   The sex thing app.
[01:16:38.220 --> 01:16:39.900]   Lisa's on it too.
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:40.900]   Yeah.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:41.900]   What the hell?
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:42.900]   And Apple Computer is on it.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.340]   No, that's just all of your-
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:45.340]   It's just a-
[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:47.340]   No, it says Friends on Snapchat.
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:48.340]   Oh, really?
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:49.340]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:50.340]   Kevin Rose.
[01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:52.140]   He's probably an advisor and that's-
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:54.140]   And Steve Wozniak's on it.
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:56.460]   I don't want to see that.
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:58.700]   That's quite terrifying, that's the-
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:01.940]   Alright, so now I get a picture and I'm going to take a picture of you and-
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:02.940]   I'm in Gina.
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.300]   And now where does it go?
[01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:05.300]   Send it-
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:07.020]   It does your two friends.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.420]   Team Snapchat.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:11.380]   Or anybody I add.
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:12.380]   I see.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:13.380]   Alright.
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:14.380]   And then- but they get it.
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.980]   You don't have your- do you have it on your phone?
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:16.980]   No.
[01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:17.980]   No.
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:18.980]   I'm installing right now.
[01:17:18.980 --> 01:17:19.980]   Are you?
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:22.580]   Okay, Gina, just tell her your username is as soon as you have it, I'll send you a picture.
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:23.580]   Okay.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:24.580]   Is it going to be Gina Trappani?
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:25.580]   Yeah.
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:28.900]   You can also type it in the Google Doc chat if you don't want it to be public.
[01:17:28.900 --> 01:17:29.900]   Too late.
[01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:31.460]   Alright.
[01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:32.460]   Just tell me when you're signed on.
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.460]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:34.460]   Okay.
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:35.460]   It's installing.
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.460]   You're having the worst picture, please.
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:39.300]   Do you have to accept people?
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:40.980]   Or do they- is it just go to them?
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:41.980]   We're completely deranged.
[01:17:41.980 --> 01:17:44.980]   This is like, you can't totally- you can't- they'll have to accept.
[01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:45.980]   Yeah, I'm sure you-
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.660]   Otherwise anybody could send you anything.
[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:49.220]   You've just announced your idea.
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:50.220]   Yeah.
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:51.220]   Right.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:52.220]   Yeah.
[01:17:52.220 --> 01:17:53.220]   You're ready for some snaps, Leo.
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:59.260]   This is- this is- so what you're saying is this is the chat roulette of text messages.
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:01.180]   Alright, I've added you, F, and done.
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:02.340]   Send me some texts.
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:03.340]   Alright.
[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:05.740]   So I'm going to send that to you, F, and done.
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:06.740]   And now-
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:08.620]   I would like to apologize for all your viewers.
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:11.900]   We're just completely hijacking this after-
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:12.900]   Who's team's Snapchat?
[01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:14.300]   I'm not an investor, by the way.
[01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:16.340]   I've no stake in any of this.
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:18.820]   I think Kevin Rose is an advisor though.
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:19.820]   Oh, look.
[01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:21.300]   See, they sent me a little welcome.
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:22.700]   That's why Kevin's on it.
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:23.700]   Yeah.
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:24.700]   Alright.
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:25.700]   Yeah, he's too old for this now.
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:26.700]   Alright.
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:27.700]   I sent you something.
[01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:28.700]   Alright, Gina.
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:30.700]   I'm glad to you now.
[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:31.700]   Oh boy.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.180]   Oh boy.
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.380]   This is so much fun.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:38.180]   This is how- this is- this is television history, baby.
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.580]   Alright, send that to Gina.
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.540]   Oh yeah, they launched an Android yesterday.
[01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:42.700]   That's why they're-
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:45.340]   Yeah, this is- this is new on Android.
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:48.380]   So this is completely appropriate for this show.
[01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:51.660]   Not too long to stretch.
[01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:52.660]   Not at all.
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:53.660]   It's correct.
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:54.660]   Well, here's-
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:55.660]   Plug yours in for like real-time screen-sharing of that.
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:56.660]   Alright.
[01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:00.100]   So, I'm gonna send it to my son and Kevin Rose and really confuse the hell out of them.
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:03.540]   Well, yeah, your son will now drop Snapchat immediately.
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:05.500]   Yeah, I'll say how it's dead to him immediately.
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:08.060]   So I just sent that picture to you guys.
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.060]   That's interesting.
[01:19:09.060 --> 01:19:13.020]   Yeah, that's how you actually protect your kids is you join the services they join and
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:14.020]   then they're off.
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:15.020]   Yeah, no, they won't do it.
[01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:16.020]   There it is.
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:18.020]   It works, but it's- now you can just-
[01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.020]   Now hold it up and see how long the world gets deleted.
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:21.020]   And then it's gone.
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:22.020]   It's gone.
[01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:23.020]   Yeah.
[01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:24.020]   I hope you enjoyed that quick.
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:25.020]   Yeah, so- oh, so you tapped it down.
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.020]   That's interesting.
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:28.620]   You have to tap it, you tap and hold and then it's just gone.
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:29.620]   Alright.
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:30.620]   Okay.
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:32.740]   TechCrunch says it's not sexting.
[01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:33.740]   So there you go.
[01:19:33.740 --> 01:19:35.940]   But if they say it, it's going to be true.
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:37.060]   If they say it, it must be true.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.060]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.500]   And you can set how long it lasts.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.700]   How many seconds it lasts?
[01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:43.260]   Up to 10 seconds.
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:46.580]   So it can't go past 10 seconds.
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:47.580]   That's insane.
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:48.580]   Huh.
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:49.580]   Interesting.
[01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:54.060]   I saw one who is obsessed with saving our web history.
[01:19:54.060 --> 01:19:55.540]   This drives me a little crazy.
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:56.540]   Yeah.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:57.540]   I think-
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:01.820]   I was created by Stanford College Kid, Evan Spiegel.
[01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:02.820]   I do funny.
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:04.180]   It's a really important point, Gina.
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:05.660]   That's really, really important, I think.
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:08.620]   Now to go up in the clouds, we pretend to do once in a while.
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:13.780]   But I think that this idea that something is public and permanent, this is probably your
[01:20:13.780 --> 01:20:14.780]   answer to privacy.
[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:18.060]   But it's really a shame and a tragedy that you have no record of things.
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:20.860]   Well, I think I would love to hear Dana Boyd's take on this.
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:24.580]   But it's clear that what's happening is that kids are going, "Oh, God, this stuff lives
[01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:25.580]   forever."
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:27.020]   And that's why they're gravitating to this.
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:29.460]   "Oh, this doesn't live hardly at all."
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:31.460]   It's the mayfly of photo sharing.
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:37.500]   But it is fascinating as well that the number of apps that exist that place limitations on
[01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:40.260]   you and that actually that becomes their selling point.
[01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:44.540]   So Twitter, 140 characters, this, it's only there for 10 seconds.
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:45.540]   Even Instagram, that-
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.540]   There's too much freedom.
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:47.540]   There's too much freedom.
[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:48.540]   It is all about pentameter.
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:49.540]   I know.
[01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:50.940]   I don't like freedom.
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:51.940]   It's too much.
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:52.940]   Too complicated.
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:53.940]   Too much.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:57.980]   and France the heads for them.
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:02.120]   All right, I just wanted to briefly show since we were talking about, we're going to take
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:06.700]   a break, we're going to come back with your tip and number and I'll have a tool for you,
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:10.960]   although I think Snapchat is a pretty good tool. I got my bespoke post box. Do you know
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.380]   about this? This is kind of fun. This is a whole trend in man?
[01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:17.480]   Is this a surprise box? Yeah. It's a Snapchat of in home delivery detail. You don't know
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:20.060]   what you're going to get. You don't know what you're going to get. You subscribe for
[01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:23.240]   somebody. It's a good thing for a geek because you don't want to give geek's gadgets because
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.660]   they already know what they want. You don't want to do that.
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:30.660]   So this one is coffee, but every month it's a different package. So I got some like artisan
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:38.140]   beans. I've got a ceramic burr grinder hand grinder. I've got, have you ever used this?
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:40.820]   The Arab press, the rubby Arab press. This is the best way to make coffee.
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:43.940]   No, but I was following your whole thing about which machine you bought.
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:48.380]   Yes, I love the one I got, by the way, the Breville dual boiler. This is a little less
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:53.640]   than that. I ran the math on it. Two lattes a day or two household family. Okay. Two lattes
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:57.760]   per person with a two person that's four lattes a day, a $1,200 special machine pays
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.880]   for itself in about three or four months.
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:04.440]   Okay, Leo, big question I have is what do you think of the new Starbucks machine?
[01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:07.920]   The Clover? No, I'm not a film. No, no, no, no, no, no. We did that. You and I do the
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:14.600]   news. The new machine is junk. It's a pod machine. It's a pod machine. Nobody who loves
[01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:19.360]   coffee would ever consider pods. Oh, excuse me. Please.
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.500]   Yeah, every company, I don't know. It wasn't something. It wasn't one King's Lane, but
[01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:28.140]   a company tried to do this where you pay a fee as the shoe company, shoe dazzle, I think.
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:32.580]   Yeah, it was tend use. And they were subscription and then they said, huh? It didn't work. It
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:35.460]   didn't work. It didn't work really well. I think the problem is because it's like regression
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:40.420]   to the mean. They have to, it's like the wine. Lexi, it's, Sosas was mad though, because
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:45.120]   she apparently had quite a few. You pay $39 a month and you build up credits. I think they
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.520]   went to subscription from an, I can't remember, but yeah, they had to change their money.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:52.960]   Yeah, well, they had to get every month. Inevitably, it's going to regress to the mean and you're
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:56.400]   going to be disappointed with 70% of the stuff you get and you're kind of.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:00.360]   You don't have to do it. You don't have to. You can any, you know ahead of time. I think
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:06.520]   this is cool. We'll see. They had socks. Shaving gear. It's for men. I love the idea
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:10.100]   of it. I love it too. Companies have to be really rigorous on, you know, what they're
[01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:15.220]   curating for it. It's curation, isn't it? That's what it is. We're all lazy. That, by
[01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:19.620]   the way, this same day delivery, the backlash against that will be the carbon output of
[01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:24.260]   everybody getting in home delivery. It'll have to be some regular. It's truck is going
[01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:30.740]   around anyway. Yeah. And it's not a big deal. I agree. It'll be a train. I want a box on
[01:23:30.740 --> 01:23:34.900]   my porch and tracks in front. Well, yeah, it'll go to that where you have a little
[01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:38.000]   thing go by and it'll be on the schedule. It could be electric. You know, they make these
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.420]   electric Ford makes that electric trans. Was it transit car that just goes around on
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:51.300]   a monorail? Another Disney owns Lucasfilm. What do you think of that? Well, first of
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:57.700]   all, the whole circular completion, the fact that jobs bought Pixar from Lucas came their
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:02.040]   biggest shareholder of Disney. And now Lucas is like the second biggest shareholder of
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:08.520]   Disney. I think that's quite poetic. I think, frankly, Lucas, after Jar Jar being deserved
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:13.640]   to lose control of his own franchise. Yeah. And he's retiring. Yes. He's saying I'm a
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:17.600]   seller to somebody who keep it alive. Somebody had a very good idea because Disney also owns
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:23.760]   Marvel. And what we really want to see is Hulk taking Jar Jar and going boom, boom, boom.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:28.600]   And then I think that would be I just go see that for two hours. I if I trusted anybody,
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:33.400]   I'd give me who knows, maybe even Pixar get a crack at some stuff. But I like the idea
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:38.160]   of them rejuvenating some Star Wars action. You know, it can't it can't be any worse than
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:42.680]   no, it'll be it'll be better. They'll get Chris Nolan. They'll get great directors.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:46.480]   Fincher. They'll do something really interesting. I think that's what I think will happen. John
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:51.840]   Fevro was awesome as a director of Iron Man. Exactly. What Disney their content guys, by
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:57.600]   the way, this is the future of home delivery. And I plan to have this soon is pneumatic tubes.
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:00.640]   You want to put this here in the brick house. You know, you put the thing in a tube. You're
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:07.720]   still steampunk. You're a steampunk. I worked at newspapers that had that. Yeah, works good,
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:11.560]   doesn't it? We said we said it to the composing room. Yeah, you can always blame it when it
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:16.560]   got stuck. You roll you roll up the thing. Yep. Everything has to fit in a tube. That's
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:21.240]   the only negative. You put it in the tube, you close it, you put it. You can put some
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:28.600]   very creative things in tubes. Leo, we learned that late at night. She sent a cheese steak
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:34.120]   sandwich through the pneumatic tube is not a good idea. I wonder if Mythbusters ever did
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:38.680]   anything with a pneumatic tube. Wasn't that how male was delivered all around the city
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:43.680]   of Paris, some of the streets pneumatic tubes only in Paris? Like probably how they still
[01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:52.360]   expect data to move there. I'm trying to find their space. Have you made an internet
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:56.600]   tubes joke? I was thinking about it. You all had it on the tip of your tongue. You all
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:00.600]   missed it. There are many companies still making these pneumatic tubes system. I guess
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:05.400]   they would exist. I mean, I can't, they always used to exist before email, didn't they, for
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:10.840]   moving memos around? So what, did they get used for? Oh, money. Thanks. The bank's using
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:16.520]   a driver. Yeah, driver's banks. We have one over here. You can't use it, but it's there.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.920]   It's just sitting there waiting for somebody to, oh yeah, instructables. They did. pneumatic
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:28.720]   soda can cannon. Okay. It was, I knew that Mythbusters would have done something like
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:34.800]   that. That's hysterical. Gina Trappani, do you got a, do you got, I don't know what
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:42.400]   happened to me? Hey, you got a, yo, yo, a tool for us there? Have a tip of the week. I have
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.960]   a lot of friends and family. I was where near Jeff, near where Jeff is. I'm in New Jersey,
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:51.680]   some in New York. There's still a lot of power outages around that area after Hurricane Sandy.
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:56.520]   And of course, Google set up a crisis map for, for Sandy pretty quickly. And they have
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:03.120]   power outage information on that crisis map now. It's kind of a layer that you can enable.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:07.360]   It's kind of helpful. I mean, you can zoom in on the area if you have friends or family
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.800]   that you want to check in, check in on. I'm trying not to text people because I know
[01:27:10.800 --> 01:27:14.200]   they're trying to save their batteries on their phones. But you want to see the status
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:19.560]   of where they're at, power outage wise. There are links to the local power company there.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.360]   So I was, I was zoomed in on New Jersey and I looked at, it's PG&E. Is that, is that who
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.640]   it is, Jeff?
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:30.880]   Yeah. PG&E really? Is it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not specific. It's something else. And
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:34.720]   you know, sometimes the sites are slow. There's lots of people checking on the status. But
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:39.120]   if you're interested to know who's still in the dark for Hurricane Sandy, Google's crisis
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:47.720]   map is at Google.com. It's apparently down. Oh, no. Google.org/crisismap. That's so weird.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:51.600]   How could it be down? Five minutes ago. Five minutes ago it was up. So I don't know, maybe
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:55.280]   maybe twig just took it down. But there's power outage information there and some more
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:59.840]   information. There's not chatting the crisis map though. You're getting into 11 seconds.
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:05.360]   I should check to see if I've ever seen it. Google's crisis map was really, really good.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:09.640]   You know, being able to see where the storm was, what was happening in one spot. It was
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.000]   a very good, good effort, I would say.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.840]   Yeah. What did you use, Jeff, to figure out where to go and what way?
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:22.000]   There was nothing. There was nothing. And the problem was that we lost, I guess I'll
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.760]   go into numbers now. There's 2.6 million of us in Jersey without power. Wow. And,
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:33.680]   wait a minute, YouTube is down and Gmail is down. What? Oh, Google.com's up. I was trying
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:36.600]   to go to G. I was trying to go to YouTube. Both of us were trying to go to YouTube and
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:40.720]   it wasn't working. Yeah. But I thought it must be a local disruption, but the chat runs
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:51.560]   reporting to you. Google's down. Whoa. My Gmail's working. Oh, YouTube is. It's up and
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:56.280]   down. It's up and down. You know what apps apps is working, but Gmail's no regular Gmail
[01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:05.360]   is down right now. This is Gmail. Holy cow. They're listening to us. I can't remember
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:17.480]   the Google wide outage ever. Yeah. That's crazy. It must be. Check Google wave. What
[01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:25.160]   does Buzz say? That's just the only thing. You don't know how cruel it is, Robert. Hey,
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.520]   you know, I spent years inside Best Buy telling Google, I'm practically a Google employee,
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:34.960]   a mole for you. I'll put Android across every device we sell, Chrome OS and every laptop.
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:41.400]   I got nothing. Now they're dead to me. Fair enough. There are some, I'm looking at the
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:47.240]   internet weather report. There are some servers and routers down, of course, in the East Coast,
[01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:51.960]   quite a few. It must, I have to think it must be related to Sandy. I'm actually, I'm using
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:57.320]   my Gmail. So it seems okay. YouTube is definitely down. I'm getting service unavailable. But
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:02.960]   Gmail, I'm okay. What's the app status dashboard? Yeah, the app status dashboard says everything's
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:07.800]   green, but that's obviously not right. Well, that's what seems to be seems to vary status
[01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:16.520]   dashboards down. Right. They went jigger treating actually this. I think it might be down. It
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:21.240]   seems like it varies in different parts. There's actually no history on the app status dashboard
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:28.360]   that's showing. Now, if you had a Chromebook, Jeff, you'd be screwed. I'd be screwed. That's
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:31.600]   true. But I'd be no more screwed than I am now, Leo, which is really kind of the point.
[01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:38.760]   Yeah, sure. I'll segue into the number. So 2.6 million numbers without power. I have
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:43.360]   my cell, the cell coverage is very, very bad, worse than usual. Not just because people
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:48.000]   were using it, I think because a lot of those cell towers probably lost power. And you know,
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.440]   it occurred to me that when we built the POTS system that played all television telephone
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:58.720]   system, there was an expected up there was an up expectation of the system and the way
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:04.120]   it was engineered. There was a monopoly that did it. And there was a safety issue. And
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:10.160]   you know, we've chosen not to invest in infrastructure to that extent. And one realizes ever more
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:14.200]   how dependent we are. I mean, I've got we've gone through only a hundredth of what people
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:18.960]   went through in Katrina here, though the shore here is in disaster. 2.6 million of us are
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:24.720]   without power. It's amazing. I'm on the air right now, thanks to the Gerald D. Dardaj
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:28.640]   Foundation, Morristown, New Jersey, which is a pocket of electricity in the otherwise
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:37.280]   powerless state. And you know, I spent yesterday with neighbors of mine tearing down trees,
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:41.120]   trying to get out of the neighborhood, which is also how I'm here because we were stuck.
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:47.600]   You don't want to see me with a chainsaw, by the way. If you, Leo, I put up the link.
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:51.200]   If you look at my Google plus, I can't get to it because it's on the Google dog.
[01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:55.840]   Oh, Jesus. It's down. By the way, this is the page. This is the page I'm getting right
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:32:03.680]   now when I go to Google Drive. If you go to 502, what is it? 502? It's a Google only Google
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:10.360]   has them. Go to Google plus is Google plus up? Nope. I just died.
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:14.720]   I have been seeing this. I haven't seen this. I haven't seen this much down in a long time.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:19.400]   This is gigantic. I don't know why data centers. I bet on the east coast started running out
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:24.920]   of power or whatever and back ups. But he's Google's a little bit more widely than just
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:27.840]   the east coast. Yeah, but they'll probably, I mean, they may have to replicate certain
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:32.600]   things across distances. And at some point though, you know, cascading failure. Maybe
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:36.200]   a cascading failure. You get people getting moved. That's my guess. I'm talking about
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:44.280]   Google. Google on Twitter. It's going nutty. This is this is Google plus. I get this, which
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:52.240]   is all Google accounts are down. I'm seeing messages on Google across all languages. Spanish,
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:33:03.520]   Russian. Yeah. Yeah. Not sure. German. Holy cow. I wonder if this. Wow. Japan, according
[01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:08.480]   to our chat room. So I got Google plus back. Here's the images. It's up and down. Yeah,
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:14.160]   it's going around, which would have the tweets says the world is ending people. Google is
[01:33:14.160 --> 01:33:20.960]   down. Holy cow. The question is, which is more shocking? Google going down or sandy.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:24.320]   I don't know. I mean, they're equally, you know, traumatic. Yeah, it's all right to have
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:29.600]   a hurricane. But if Google's down, I'm serious. People don't die. People's down. Now, the
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:33.480]   question is, why is Google calling the election? That's true. So if others want to try, you
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:39.040]   can go to downforeveryone or just me.com and it looks like mail.google.com is down for
[01:33:39.040 --> 01:33:44.440]   everyone. Wow. Well, I think what you see when you see these is intermittent outages
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:49.240]   up and down because there are people has many more than one server or knock. But maybe
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:54.280]   if North Carolina went down, then the Oregon data center gets hit hard and then that one
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:34:00.040]   becomes intermittent. Wow, that's just that's really kind of shocking. I've never, no, but
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:04.440]   I've never met there. They're so they're architected in such a way. This is, this is
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:10.840]   a big story and developing story. We'll continue to cover it. And of course, my Google Drive
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:17.840]   does sync so I can open the Google Drive folder and I can. I believe see whatever was most recently.
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:22.560]   Yeah. I mean, if you have offline enabled, wait a minute though, it has to tries to open
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:26.880]   a Google spread. You know, see, this is why. So you double click it. Yes, I have the file,
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:38.760]   but I, but thank you. I pad still work. We're sorry. Wow. Anyway, so my pick is still up,
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:44.160]   I think I voted today because you know, in California, if you want to mail your ballot
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:47.320]   today's the last day to mail it and be sure it gets there by election day. And of course,
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:51.680]   I'm going to be in Australia actually, maybe a plane during the election. But I was desperately
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:56.560]   trying to figure out how the hell we have 11 ballot measures in the state of California,
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:01.040]   intentionally written to confuse the voter, you know, yes is no and no is yes. They do
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:05.200]   this every every election season. And I was looking for a good place to find kind of a
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:12.840]   summary of everything. And I found a great site, ballotpedia.org. I'm not sure who does
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:20.800]   this, but it's based of course on Wikimedia. And it is a nonpartisan collection of information
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:26.840]   for not just this election, but previous elections. I went to the state of California and I was
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:32.120]   able to see in my case, all the ballots, but not just measures, but not just the ballot
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:38.280]   measures, but how much had been spent before, before and against who spent money on it,
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:44.720]   who's in favor of it, even summaries of the editorial positions from a variety of California
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:50.680]   newspapers. It was it took much of it comes from the ballot pamphlet, which I already have,
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:55.360]   but then there's a lot more it's kind of combining that with things like who gave money, how
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:00.440]   much money and so forth. And I find that just a very quick and easy way to figure out which
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:08.560]   way I want to vote on on a proposition. Really nicely done using the Wikipedia model to
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:14.640]   provide information about election. We have a very complicated election in California.
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:20.000]   I imagine that's true in many other states as well. And this is just really nicely done.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.120]   It's ballotpedia.org. And I'm sure there are other sites. Of course, Google's own election
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:28.360]   site when it comes back up will be a great place to find out. You know, googly. Oh, I
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:35.040]   think it's all back up. Wow, that was that was that was how we care. Holy cow. Yeah, you
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:40.800]   do that. I'm trying to back up. Yeah. Same. Yeah, I'd love to know about it. The sandy
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:45.400]   page that we were trying to get to in the very beginning. There it is. Yeah. By the way,
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:49.480]   we didn't we didn't mention, but Google has a fun Halloween animation, at least in the
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:55.600]   US on the front. Do you guys celebrate Halloween? Well, we kind of do. We know about it. So
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:00.120]   we don't do it as well as you. You guys really know how to do Halloween. We just kind of
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:04.240]   throw eggs at old people's houses. I don't have my audio again. It's gone to do that
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:09.560]   thing. But we do have the same graphic as you on Google. There you go. That's OK. It's
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.400]   just a metric is it? It's Halloween's an international lecture. Actually, the Imperial
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:16.880]   System. Yes. Robert Stevens, it's so nice to meet you. Thank you very much for making
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:20.160]   your way up here. I'm sure it was not easy to do, but we're glad you were here. I got
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:25.040]   no traffic as everybody's downtown for the Giants parade. Those Giants, they won something.
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:30.880]   Some game happened. Can someone explain to me why it's called the World Series? I'm
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:38.480]   very confused about this. It's a small world. It is my cricket to us. No, I can't explain
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:44.080]   pick cricket because I don't understand cricket. OK. See? No, no British Postam really understands
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:49.080]   cricket. Well, it's probably true with baseball. To be honest. Anyway, we're glad you managed
[01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:53.480]   to get through the traffic and really appreciate your being here. We look forward to seeing
[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:58.960]   what you start. Let us know. Either can I? You haven't you think in though along so
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:01.880]   I'm like it's like dating somebody for 18 years. The last thing you should do is jump
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:05.200]   right into another relationship. You end up dating the same person that you just left.
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:08.920]   You know, I mean, so time with your kids. Yeah, I might take a cruise in Australia pretty
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:12.320]   soon. I'm thinking about that. You know, I think there's still some room left if you'd
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:16.480]   like to come. Insightcruises.com. I don't think it's sold out. Believe it or not. It's
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:20.360]   going to be fun. We're going to see the total eclipse of the sun. We're going to be at
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:26.080]   sea for that. Google will be down for the entire. In December, the end of the Mayan
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:28.880]   to where he passed the end of the Mayan. Oh, no, that's December 21st. You got plenty
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:32.920]   of time. Plenty of time. Good. Live it up. Nice to finally see the break house. Thank
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:36.920]   you for coming up here. Be well, Jeff. Hope you're doing well. Thanks to Robert to
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:42.600]   POD your way. James, come on, Robert. Yeah. Paul Boag from Boagsworld.com, right? Boag
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:46.640]   World dot com. Yeah. Boag, no s world dot com. And there's a great podcast. What is the
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:50.800]   podcast about? Tell us about that. Oh, it's a web design podcast. Basically, it's been
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:55.280]   going almost as long as you have. You're one of the first. I remember. Yeah. In the early
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:01.240]   days and we haven't learned to quit yet. So it's an hour long of, well, what was described
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:08.280]   recently on an iTunes review, a review as constant drivel. So if you want constant drivel, I could
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:13.600]   beat you for that. Just a little bit of web design information, then it's worth checking
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:20.280]   out. The drivel is constant at BoagWorld dot com. Still drizzling in New York City. Thank
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:26.120]   you to the Gerald. Who is it? The Geraldinar. Geraldinar Dodge Foundation. My friend Chris
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:32.080]   Daggett down the way helped. Yesterday we were cutting down trees. And today I'm here in
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:38.720]   power. We're really glad. Maybe cook yourself a hot dog while you're there. Have a nice
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:43.240]   hot meal. So you're going home or are you staying at home without the power? I managed
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:48.720]   to get two nights in a hotel. Okay. And so when I, you know, going back there and then
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:53.560]   we don't know, we're without anything. And the power that not only the trees are down,
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:57.640]   if you go to, if you can now go to Google+, you can see the arbor side in my front yard.
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:02.000]   Not only were trees down, but those, the power lines are down all over. Right. And that's
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:06.400]   really the unexpected consequence of this, because we had a lot of rain. Those roots,
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:12.480]   the root beds get softened up and the wind was incredible. We had a tree hit the back
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:19.880]   of our house of very little damage. But yeah, it's fun. This is normal. It's just that
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:26.000]   there's houses there now. Yeah. But in the old days, that was how the, they called the
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.600]   herd. Yeah. Well, Jeff, take care. We hope you'll be
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:34.600]   able to be delighted to be to a minute here. Thank you, Gina Trapani too. And and both
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:38.480]   by ours, Leo. Thank you. Yeah, I won't be back. Wonderful trip. I'm really looking forward
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:46.120]   to the Mac Mania 15 crews were, we're setting sail. We're doing a meetup in Sydney on November
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:50.800]   and great. And Sydney, thanks to Twig. I met some great folks there when I was through
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:56.000]   the country. You'll meet a lot of the same folks. Yeah, I can't wait. I think Paul Keating
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:02.880]   is one of them. If you want to get the details, we're going to be at a pub in the rocks and
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:10.560]   MacTalk.com.au has details on the meetup because they're going to be there as well.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:15.040]   It's Melbourne Cup Day. Apparently there's a big horse race. Oh, and people are expected
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:20.400]   to be drunk early on. So I don't know what this is going to be like. Don McAllister will
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:27.520]   also be there from Screencast online. Allison Sheridan from Podfeed. And of course, MacTalk
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:34.600]   as well. We'll look forward to seeing you at the, I guess it's at the rocks or it's
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:42.600]   at a pub near the rocks. But details on MacTalk.com.au. And then we're trying to figure out a Brisbane
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:45.560]   meetup. But I don't know if I'm going to have time to do that because I'm going to go see
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:51.200]   some koalas. And I think I'm going to be busy in Brisbane. We'll do our best.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:58.040]   Does the next Android version? Koala? Koala. Koala. That's Kiwala Pie. It's Koala Pie.
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:07.040]   Kiwi. Kiwi fruit. Syrup. And thank you, Jana, Trippani. ThinkUp.com for the ThinkUp app.
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:16.400]   And todo.text. And smarterware.org. And ETA. Yeah, and in fact, I have a new story in
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:22.120]   Mark Rommands the magazine, the new issue about having ETA. So it's Iowa's only for now.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:26.680]   Sorry about that. And you have to buy it, right? There's no other way to see it. There's
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:31.120]   a free trial for a week. So if you have an iOS device, you can get the trial and read
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:36.080]   both issues. It's brand new. It's kind of interesting experiment and publishing. I thought I'd
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:44.800]   contribute. So there's that. Yeah. My free week has already expired. I guess I'll pay
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:50.240]   a book 99 to read yours. It's like, yeah, two bucks. Not too bad. There's a couple other
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:55.520]   good stories in there. All right. Thank you, Gina, Jeff, Robert, Paul. Thank you all for
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:59.720]   watching. We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern
[01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:05.160]   time 1900 UTC. Stop by next week. Who do you know who's hosting, Chad? Gina. I think
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:11.040]   I am. Yeah. Gina, Trappani. Yeah. Yay. Oh, yeah. So you're going to put together a unique
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:15.920]   panel of experts. Temporary upgrade. Jeff, are you not going to be here the next week
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:19.880]   or going as of now, depending upon travel at all, and whether I have power or not, as
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:25.240]   of now, I'm in back who in Istanbul. No, that might change. But as of now, next week, then
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:28.440]   I'll be back following me. Can I'll be a Gina? You're on your own. You're going to have
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:32.520]   to put together, get Marco on. He won't be on with me, but maybe he'll do it with you.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:37.400]   All right. I'll see what I can do. All right. Thank you all. We'll see you next time. I'll
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:43.520]   be back in a couple of weeks, a week after Thanksgiving, I guess, November 28th for this
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:44.760]   week in Google. Take care.
