[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.800]   Actually, I think it might be pretty cool. Google has a big announcement coming up March 19th.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.480]   It's all about gaming and what was Google up to when they attempted to block and blockers.

[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   And it's time to talk about Google, the Googleverse, Facebook, Twitter, journalism,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   the Samsungs.

[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   We know I'm better.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   One question. I'm going to have one question.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   We're going to get two minutes.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Are you going to buy one?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Already did.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Too late.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Already did.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Already did.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   He's the Leonard Taill professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Numbar Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Hello.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Jeffrey.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Also blogs@buzzmishing.com.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   He's at Jeff Jarvis on the Twitter.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Stacey Egenbotham is at Gigas Stacey on the Twitter.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   She's at Stacey@iOT.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   She's our sailor suited.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I was just thinking about it.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   No, it's a black and white striped shirt.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   It's not me being the striped, white enough and I don't have a boat deck.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Take that.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And she's landlocked.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You fashion fools.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Well, Kyle Lago fellas no longer with us.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   So somebody has to take his metal and I think it's going to be Stacey Chanel.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I'm going to call you Coco.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   You Coco Harris jacket.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   No, I didn't know anything about the Kamala Harris jacket.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Oh, there was a kerfuffle because reporters, which was going to visit small businesses.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   She went in this place and had this amazing multi-colored jacket and she tried it all.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   The reporters were laughing and she's saying don't take pictures.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And then the right way went crazy about the reporters are just cozying up and,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   you know, like the shop or shoe.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Tyler Durden, which clearly is a suit at him.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   CNN reporter sparks ethics controversy after Kamala Harris fashion shoot.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   It's been shared eight times on the internet.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Thank you, YouTube.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   YouTube always promotes the best content.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Well, but I want to hear the review of the jacket.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Oh, here's your seat like the jacket.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I didn't see the jacket.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Is it like Joseph's amazing color?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I think it's I want to see what I think.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Let me see if I can find an image.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Well, I will say having read because when House of Cards was happening,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I was all about Robin Wright's clothes.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   They were gorgeous and fantastic.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   And I was like, man, who are they using in this show because I want these clothes?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And it turns out she made most of them because many, they don't think about how to dress
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   the president.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   And I was like, oh, dang it.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   She should have her own line.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Oh, so the issue here is that Maeve Reston, who was a CNN reporter, tweeted, we kind of
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   forced, oops, I closed it.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Dang it.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   How does this internet work?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Did you use this internet log?
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I'm turning into my father.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   How does this internet thing work?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Take two.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Oh, Kamala Harris jacket.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   So, Maeve Reston, is she related to Reston's senior?
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I have no idea.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   The very famous, what is his name?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   James Reston.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   So here's the tweet we kind of forced Kamala Harris to try on this awesome oversized rainbow
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   sequin jacket.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   She snapped it up.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   She bought it.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   That is awesome.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   What's wrong with that?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Is that great?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I mean, I wouldn't wear it, but it's awesome.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Well, it's awesome, whatever.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   It's her style.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   That's fine.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.240]   Then Neil Bortz, the conservative talk radio host, says quite the objective journalist you
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.080]   are Reston proud.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.000]   And then, oh, God, Lord.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Yeah, I know.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I have to say CNN is under a little bit of a fire these days because of something else.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I was going to berserk last night.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I bet you were.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Is that in our purview?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Is this in our portfolio?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   No, I don't think this.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Talk about foldable phones.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I don't really want.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   So here's what's well, yeah, let's just talk about foldable.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Samsung had their big event.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.760]   We just concluded our coverage of it.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.000]   You can watch the whole thing on the Samsung streamer on our stream.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.400]   And they, by the way, I thought this was going to be super fast and we were going to be early
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.000]   today, but there was so much stuff.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   There was a lot.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.720]   In fact, they really skimmed the surface because there was a lot of things they didn't talk.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.000]   Did you hear Bixby mentioned?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.320]   No, but now it's.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:59.440]   Did you hear their new Android interface, the Samsung one interface barely mentioned.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.920]   They whip through it.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.440]   They didn't talk a lot about features on the watches.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.840]   They whipped through it.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.640]   And what's interesting to me, quite the opposite of Apple.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.320]   Apple usually will build to the end.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.560]   And then the one more thing, the reveal, that was always the traditional way of doing it.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.360]   But they usually saved the most important piece for the end of the show.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.920]   Samsung started at the beginning with the most important piece easily, the Galaxy Fold,
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.280]   which will be available April 26th.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.000]   It is, yes, a folding phone, a front screen, a little small four inch front screen that
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.160]   opens up to a seven inch screen.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.240]   And there's a handoff so that whatever you're looking at at the front screen, if it's a
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.640]   map as they demonstrated, you'll open up and that map will be full screen on the seven
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.640]   inch screen.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.640]   I thought it looked great.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.480]   Yeah, I was surprised.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.560]   I was going to make fun of it.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.560]   I was all ready to.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.240]   And then I got a little bit of lust.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.160]   Then of course they announced the price $1,980 and people choked.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:01.520]   But I think Samsung secretly went, yeah, choke because if you think about it, they already
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.840]   said it's a luxury device.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.840]   People will buy it.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.400]   And if they want to make the phone, they want everybody to know it's $2,000 because if you
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   have that phone, it's a status item.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.680]   If you open it up, everybody knows you spent $2,000.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.440]   Because it costs a lot to make.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.200]   And I don't think 2000 is actually that far out of the park, especially if it's a replacement
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.560]   for your computer.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.800]   And that's what phones are becoming rapidly, right?
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.600]   I don't.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.760]   You know, well, I know a lot of people looking at it saying I want it out of my reach because
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.760]   it's so expensive.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:41.280]   Do, I mean, like in a normal house where you have a computer at your jobs, people still
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.760]   mostly have computers unless they're in like a weird field, maybe designed or something.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:52.560]   Every home still has a computer unless you're, I know every home--
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.080]   No, millennials may not though.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.080]   Remember?
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.080]   No.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.960]   Because if you still have to write something or do anything, you have to do it on a computer.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   I am asking.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.960]   I'm thinking just through them.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.160]   I think you might be, that might be a generational golf.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.160]   That might be a old Stacy.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   I was a good Stacy.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.400]   My daughter spends a lot of time in her computer.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.560]   I mean, I'm willing for that to change.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.560]   She's a student.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.560]   She's a student.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.600]   But once you're not a student, you're not writing papers, you're not doing homework.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.040]   I think, I mean, it's already the case that we all, and I bet you're included in this,
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.520]   spend much more time on the mobile version of our computers than on the desktop versions.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.000]   Maybe you're not because you're a writer.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Right.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.760]   I do see your, I'm just, wow.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.760]   Welcome to the new world.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:40.080]   No, I'm just thinking about like paying bills or like buying stuff.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:43.880]   I mean, yes, I buy stuff on my phone too, but like, I don't--
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:48.960]   They demonstrated a three-pane interface, so you have tiled windows.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.160]   And it looked pretty easily easy to swap the windows around.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.360]   A keyboard, if you want.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.120]   I'm sure there's a keyboard available, yeah.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.400]   I mean, I was, I was clean, I cleaned up my office, doesn't look good.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.200]   And it looks better.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.200]   It looks completely different.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.200]   It looks different.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   It does.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.680]   I was, I was laughing because I'm like, what'd you find, Jeff?
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.280]   So I found, I found my, I think it was the tree.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.760]   It was Creo owned by Palm.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:14.760]   Yes.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.760]   So I found my trio.
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:16.760]   Well, they were owned by Palm.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   They did the Palm OS.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.840]   Well, I think it was, I think it was my trio.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.920]   I can't even tell.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.320]   But the point is, having the keyboard on it, I thought, how addicted we were and how,
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.320]   how keyboards.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.320]   Yeah, it's Palm.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.720]   It'd become less and less and less important and also in a less text based world.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.280]   Paying bill Stacy.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.280]   That's point and click.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.920]   It's writing stuff.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.920]   Sorry.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.160]   Well, you might not have to.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.240]   It just depends what you're right.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.040]   So I thought really interesting on this, and this isn't the folding phone.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:53.360]   They show this on the S10 was it's essentially an Instagram, dedicated Instagram device.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:01.000]   In fact, they had the CEO of Instagram, longtime Facebooker, Massari come up on stage and
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.080]   they showed how quick it was to share directly the Instagram without even opening the app.
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.920]   And of course, Samsung took some heat has taken some heat in years past because you can't
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.560]   uninstall the Facebook app.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.880]   Now, you, I'm sure will be unable to uninstall the Instagram app.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.200]   And that's very interesting.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.320]   That's an interesting play.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.720]   So Samsung is looking at how people use phones.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:32.040]   Remember, as a South Korean company, they may have culturally a different point of view.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.760]   And the family came out.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:36.760]   Right.
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.960]   Everybody said all those weird Koreans, only they will use it in the world.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.480]   Nobody's going to want a big phone.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.480]   That's the best analogy.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:47.360]   And in fact, I bought the first note fell in love with it, have owned every note since people
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.360]   laughed at me.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.360]   I put the note to my head.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.360]   Yeah, I think we did.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.520]   But that piece of lumber you're holding up.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.120]   But I loved it.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   And so I do think that's this is going to be I, I poo poo folding phones right up until
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.120]   this demo.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.120]   I was waiting for this.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:12.600]   And I'm like, you guys were all like, I'm like, let's see.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.280]   But I'm still stuck on this idea of computing.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.280]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.920]   I'm thinking about like, Oh, how do you book travel?
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.280]   How do you again?
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:26.040]   Maybe you're right that the only reason I brought that up is because $2,000 is such
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.800]   a, that's the price of laptop.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.440]   Well, yes, I'm like, you know what we need?
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.440]   We need another generation on this show.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.200]   We need, we need a millennial.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   Well, not even.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   We need a young millennial.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.480]   Yeah, I bet you Henry, this would be, he'd be happy with this.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.480]   Although he's,
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.480]   Did Henry, did Henry watch?
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   Was he around?
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.800]   He did watch, I think he is around.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.920]   He curious what his review is.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.960]   He does use a Mac book for video editing.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.320]   And of course he works with sale.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.000]   So he's doing a lot of stuff with spreadsheets and, and presentation.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.760]   And I watch a bunch of those decisions.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:01.000]   Kids like in college and that sort of thing, they use Mac books or laptops just as their
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.720]   video consumption device.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   Absolutely.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:08.880]   But I think though, I think though, wasn't it the case that in Japan, personal computer
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:14.760]   ownership was much lower than in the West and they had as a result, much smarter phones
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.760]   earlier?
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.760]   Yes.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   Yes.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   In Korea, South Korea.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.760]   Japan and Korea.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.680]   Well, Korea has a wonderful mobile infrastructure and carriers that are very innovative.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.800]   So unlike ours that are nickel and diamonds for everything, careers have been South Korea.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.160]   Well, that's another point because they spend a lot of time at the end of the show talking
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.160]   about 5G.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.760]   They're going to have two 5G ready phones available soon.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.640]   You can pre-order the 5G Galaxy 10 in a month.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.640]   No, not even.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.640]   This was 5G.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.640]   Where is 5G really installed?
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.360]   Well, that's my first thing as well.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.360]   Who cares?
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.360]   Nobody can get it.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.360]   And then I realized, wait a minute, that's a very parochial point of view because of course,
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.560]   5G is widespread in South Korea.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.560]   5G?
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.560]   Is it?
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.560]   I think so.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.560]   I didn't know if it was yet.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.800]   Furthermore, I don't know if it's that widespread.
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.800]   I mean, they...
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.800]   Well, more widespread than here, which is...
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.800]   Well, yeah.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.800]   Okay.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.800]   Zero.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.800]   We don't have any 5G from us.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:19.320]   It is by 2023, an entire 32% of the US population will have access to 5G in two years, 130.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.320]   That doesn't surprise me.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:27.080]   So as of December, South Korea launches 5G, but only for enterprise users initially.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.080]   But they're anticipating.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.080]   Furthermore...
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.080]   Is that...
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.080]   Furthermore...
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.400]   Because didn't Qualcomm just launched their 5G mobile chip that's actually reasonable?
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.400]   That's the chip.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.320]   Yeah, I suspect that might be the chip.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.320]   They're waiting on it.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.800]   I mean, that just happened this week.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.800]   Right.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:49.920]   Furthermore, what Chinese giant makes 5G gear that is currently being spanked all around
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   the world?
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.920]   Oh.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.920]   Wow.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   Wow.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.280]   And I thought, well, gee, this almost sounds like Samsung might make 5G networking gear
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.280]   for carriers.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.280]   They do.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.280]   Oh!
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.280]   Oh!
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:05.400]   So it's a competitive opportunity to grab us a market share.
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.520]   Oh, so 5G mobile routers and 5G...
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:10.520]   Let's see.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:19.160]   The SK South Korea Telecom provider offers 5G.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.920]   There's actually two service providers.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.560]   They both have Spectrum.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.320]   I guess it's coming soon.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.320]   Sooner there than here.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.320]   I'm not clear outside.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.320]   Okay.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.960]   And you got to figure out if it's mobile 5G or if it's just them using 5G like Verizon.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.800]   The plan to provide enterprise customers with 5G and Busan in Chan, Daegu, Dajian.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:37.800]   Okay.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.800]   That's fixed.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:40.800]   Guangzhou and Olsen.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.320]   Yeah, that's fixed mobile or fixed wireless.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.320]   But you're going to...
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:50.400]   In fact, we have fixed wireless, not the same standard, but we have fixed wireless in
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.960]   the US as well in enterprise.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   Right.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.480]   Well, we have fixed wireless 5G.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.360]   That's what Verizon's offering people right now.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.360]   That's right.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.360]   But it's their 5G.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.360]   It's not our...
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.240]   It's not the 3GPP standard that is used by cellular carriers.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.360]   Oh, I love it when you guys geek out.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.880]   That's not geek.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.880]   It's just accuracy.
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.760]   That was like the nerdiest thing I think I ever said.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.760]   Excuse me.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.960]   I'm going to be a pediatric for a moment.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:17.960]   Excuse me.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.120]   This is not pedantry.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.520]   This is accurate thing.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.920]   So I think that this is a very interesting...
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.000]   Remember that the immediate competitors to Huawei...
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.840]   You're yourself, Stacy.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.960]   Our Nokia and Ericsson.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.200]   But that sounds to me.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.320]   It sounded to me like a kind of a play by Samsung.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.680]   You know, you like South Korea.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.480]   So we're an ally.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.480]   We're saying...
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.960]   So that's interesting.
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.520]   They also announced three new Galaxy S10 phones.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.160]   We knew everything there was.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.640]   Well, I thought it was really interesting too.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.320]   This is from a point of view of technology, journalism.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.640]   Is that everything about the S10 phone had been completely leaked accurately in detail,
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:05.360]   including yesterday a Norwegian television station that accidentally ran the ad for
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.440]   it a day early.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.120]   So we even had an ad for it.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.520]   But we knew nothing about the Galaxy Fold.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.920]   It was a complete revelation.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.920]   We knew they were doing it.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:17.920]   That's all.
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.600]   Because they had said so.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:26.160]   So my guess is that means Samsung has the ability to keep the lid on some things and
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.240]   the desire to leak other things.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.240]   Well, especially if it's a little bit of stuff.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.840]   I mean, keep our...
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.840]   Keep our...
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.840]   What is it?
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.840]   It's not a red herring.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.360]   It's not a red herring because no, they're real.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.720]   But it's like a pipe releasing a valve.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.720]   That's it.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.520]   So they're releasing stuff to the media because the media is definitely looking.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.520]   Right.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.640]   And then you keep your good stuff seeking.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:54.440]   And also they keep the eye of the reader on them for an entire two week period leading
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.440]   up to the event.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.480]   I think at this point, they're going to have set a bar that's very high for every other
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:05.320]   carrier or phone manufacturer at Mobile World Congress this weekend.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:07.120]   This was cleverly timed.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.200]   They did it in San Francisco, not Barcelona.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.320]   They did it a few days early.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:17.400]   I think Samsung has shown a mastery of the media over the last two weeks.
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.160]   That's quite impressive.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.960]   Yes.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:25.360]   But not great taste in music.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.880]   You can't have everything.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.560]   So one of the things that they didn't talk about much to said that I'm very curious about
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.080]   is the one interface.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:37.280]   And all I know is what I read.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.200]   But Dieter Bone in the Verge has been playing with it apparently.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.080]   And he wrote a very positive review about it yesterday.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.040]   The best thing ever.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.440]   He said it's the best Android interface yet, better than Google's.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.080]   He really liked it.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.000]   So that's encouraging too.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.600]   Because if there was one negative, the one reason I don't care.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.000]   Always have some phone.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   I use the Google phone.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Well, there's two reasons.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.720]   One is the user interface.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.280]   It's pure, purer on a Google phone.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.440]   Although Bone points out really what is pure Android?
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.800]   AOSP maybe is pure Android.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.600]   But that doesn't have any of the Google stuff at all on it.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.560]   So really what's Google selling is their skin.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.000]   Or Pedentry out of you guys.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.320]   Yes, it's really pedantic.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.960]   I think of the Google version as pure Android.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.960]   Yes.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:30.760]   But Samsung's has gotten closer and closer, not to pure Android, but to equally good Android.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:37.040]   Do they still have, oh my gosh, do they still stick a lot of bloatware on their device?
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.040]   No.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.040]   Okay.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   Because that's always been the issue with Samsung.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.040]   That was from, yeah.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.120]   Well, but there is going to be that issue, which is you're going to have Samsung's gallery
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.120]   and Google photos.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.560]   You're going to have Samsung's browser and Chrome.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:53.560]   There are there and Bone acknowledged this that there are still double applications in
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.080]   many areas.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.080]   So if you call that.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.760]   Because I can still use my Google thing is I don't want to switch to Samsung's photo
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.760]   thing.
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.000]   And now we know Instagram will be on there.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Facebook has always been on there.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.040]   So if that's what you're talking about, I don't think that's changed.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.600]   But I don't just gets kind of questioning.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.600]   It is.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.200]   But you can remap the Bixby button now.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.200]   Whew.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.200]   Can you?
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:17.280]   That's when there was just an article saying that the, I think it's on the verge that you
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.760]   can remap the Bixby.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.760]   That's huge.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:25.880]   Because you could see that maybe in error again, they had the same story when the S9 came
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:26.880]   out.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.680]   It was modified so that you could not.
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.880]   Here's the verge.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.280]   You can remap the Bixby button on Samsung's Galaxy S10 to do whatever you want.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.080]   As of today, 12 minutes ago.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.160]   If it's according to Samsung, yeah, they were in the hands-on room, I'm sure.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.320]   So if it's according to Samsung, that's good.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.200]   The verge has confirmed that with the S10, the company is at its settings that allow you
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.960]   to customize the button beyond what's been allowed previously.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.640]   I'm starting to really be bullish on all of this.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.440]   And so there's actually, I'm going to make three things.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.480]   Three reasons I haven't used the Samsung phone.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.640]   That's one, the skin.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.760]   And I guess you can include the junkware.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.000]   Two, Google Fi.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.200]   It's not a iPhone.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.000]   I'm going to have to use it with a US carrier.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.080]   And three, security patches.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:17.440]   One of the issues has always been that security patches, especially those monthly updates,
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:23.040]   I don't mind that Samsung's been slow to put nine on its phones and they have.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   Because that's features, but I think security is super important and they have also been
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.640]   a month or so behind on the security patches.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.040]   That probably stay the same, even with trouble.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:40.880]   So those, for some people, may still be compelling reasons to stick with the Pixel.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.440]   Pixel, as we talked about last week, doing very well.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.040]   And now it looks cheap.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.040]   And it does.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   It's cheap.
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.040]   It does.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.640]   This, the Samsung S10 is $750.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:58.880]   S10 is $899 at its base model.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.000]   The base model of the S10 plus is $999.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.200]   But the one I ended up getting with a ceramic back and 512 gigs of storage was a whopping
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.200]   $1250.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.360]   How much did you spend today?
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.040]   Just that because I couldn't get the fold.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:14.040]   You can't buy the fold.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.040]   I'll buy the fold.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.040]   We have to.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.040]   We review them.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:25.120]   If I were not doing what I do, if I were just a civilian, so to speak, I don't think I would
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.120]   buy either.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:32.960]   Well, if you were a civilian with a budget, you don't, but like gadgets.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:38.640]   I mean, this is not a phone that probably will appeal to the mainstream until some super
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.720]   cool people have it.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.720]   So.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.720]   Like we do.
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:48.280]   No, I think I love the Pixel and especially with the price cuts now, you can get pixels
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:49.680]   a lot less expensive.
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:55.320]   They're cutting three or $400 off the Pixel prices now at various deals.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.800]   I think the Pixel is probably what I'd have.
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:03.520]   And if I were really price sensitive, I'd probably have a Moto G7 or G6.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   G7's kind of.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.320]   Here's the other one with the folding one.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   That's thick.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.880]   Oh, well, so the Royal.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.200]   The only other folding device currently on the market.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:21.400]   It was shown at CES is $1,500 and it's janky as hell.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:31.080]   So the FlexPy, I'll show you if you want to see it, the FlexPy compare this at $1,500
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:36.000]   to what Samsung's doing with a much more, I think, elegant UI.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.840]   And I think this is definitely Samsung's got to beat.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.280]   And yeah, it's expensive to make this.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.920]   Samsung, by the way, is putting a lot of cameras in, three cameras in the S10.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:57.320]   The folding phone will have six cameras, two in the front, three in the middle, one in
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:58.320]   the back.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.280]   It is hard if you've got a folding phone.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.200]   You've got to figure out which way someone's going to point the open close.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.200]   Well.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.000]   And by the way, a lot of the pictures even on stage today at the Samsung event, people
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.960]   had their fingers right over that punch out for the camera because that's just the natural
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.280]   way to hold it.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.440]   You know what would be interesting?
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.440]   Okay.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.440]   So you've got six cameras.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:23.760]   Now, you know, my beloved Jabra 65T Elite headphones, they have two mics on each side.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.560]   And I'll get to it.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:30.800]   They actually take a sample from each mic and they optimize.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.280]   They pick whichever one sounds better on phone calls to pick up your voice.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.280]   So it's like whichever are the four mics that you've got available, it's like, Oh, this
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.280]   way, you know, it's a very quick AI thing.
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.440]   But imagine that with your fingers in front of a camera on your phone.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.360]   Use the right camera.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.360]   It's a fine thing.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.240]   You should say that because Samsung also announced the galaxy buds.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.600]   I guess Google neglected to trademark buds.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.160]   And it does the same thing.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.000]   It figures out which microphone sounds better and uses that.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.520]   The XPS technology, they announced it two years ago.
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.920]   So they're probably using an XPS chips.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.040]   That's what I don't know that for sure.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.320]   But that's what I would guess.
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:15.360]   The other thing that's cool about these galaxy buds, they have very much like the AirPods.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:19.280]   They have, you know, little in-ear buds that go in a case that charges them just like your
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.000]   Jabra's.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.520]   But the case is a wireless charging case and can charge on the back of the phone.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.520]   Okay.
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.600]   So I have mixed feelings about this.
[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.000]   I'm excited like, whoo.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.320]   But then I'm also like, that's good when I have access.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.040]   But what happens like when I'm, I don't want to use my precious, precious phone battery
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.000]   to charge my device.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.080]   At least to you, my real fear is they're going to be phone nudges that are going to
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.400]   borrow your phone's battery.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.200]   They're going to say, oh, hi.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.040]   You might have to put my watch on your phone.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.120]   You might have to put your phone on your phone.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:25:00.520]   One of the most successful posts I ever wrote as a journalist from a page view perspective
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:05.840]   was at GigaObe and it was like, sorry, that's my, my fi.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.040]   Get off my my fi.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.280]   It was because it was very early on and people kept like, if the device was out, people would
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.880]   be like, oh, can I connect?
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:14.880]   Yes.
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:15.880]   Yes.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.880]   No, you can't.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.880]   Maybe.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.880]   That's my room.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.880]   You borrow a little power.
[00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:27.280]   So until I started earning karma, they use the karma, my fi.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.800]   And then if other people used yours, you earned future usage.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   Still using that?
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.800]   No, no.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.800]   No, who's got a my final?
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   They even changed their name.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   Come on.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.800]   I think that's happening soon.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:44.920]   Well, because I have my AT&T grandfather thing and I'm just stubborn.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.240]   I think it's going to hurt AT&T.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.240]   I think every day they wake up and say, Jarvis.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.240]   No, they're all excited.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.240]   Get off that grandfathered.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.120]   They're all excited because you're the last one.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.120]   They don't care.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.120]   I know.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.120]   I don't.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.480]   They've talked everybody out of it.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:02.640]   Incidentally, that power share technology Samsung showed is not exclusive to them.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:08.200]   It's something the chat rooms pointing out that the new Mate phone, Mate 20 from Huawei
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   does that.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.680]   And the rumor is Apple's new phones will have power share technology.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:20.080]   Well, I guess if you have one share, what one charging pad, you put your phone on that
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.080]   allows you to charge two things.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.080]   That's cool.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.080]   That's cool.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.880]   Yeah, you could just also be on the train.
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:30.000]   You could be sitting on the path and somebody could say, Oh, my, my, my galaxy buds just
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   died.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Can I just put them on the back of your phone for a little bit?
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.960]   No, because I'm using it.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   I'm quiet.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   I'm quiet.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.960]   Jeff, you can't use it.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.960]   I'm reading before.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:43.240]   You could be, you could be consuming content on your nifty foldable phone.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.240]   Okay.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.240]   Okay.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.240]   Okay.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.240]   Hmm.
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.320]   Anyway, I think this was a very good day for Samsung.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.320]   I think they showed the shows.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.880]   Are they using Qi charging?
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:01.760]   They didn't use the Qi word, the QI word, but they're, they're chargers are Qi chargers,
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:05.160]   the Samsung chargers, because I charge my iPhone on it.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   They have those fast chargers.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.560]   So I'm going to presume this is all Qi.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.840]   So then you could probably take your earbuds and put them on a Qi charger.
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.000]   Like if you haven't built into your nightstand and then just like plop those down and you'd
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.160]   be like, like that, you have built into your nightstand.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.200]   The stack.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.560]   I do not, but my next nightstand will have it.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.440]   Doesn't I Kia have that?
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.040]   Yeah, I Kia sells them.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.040]   I Kia offers them.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.720]   Actually, a lot of hotels put them in.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.480]   And then there's some cars that have them.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:40.280]   It's not the fastest charging you're going to.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.880]   And actually the Qi folks, you really want to get crazy.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.760]   They actually built a standard for the smart kitchen that comes out this year and it will
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.360]   charge large appliances.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.000]   So there's more power being conducted.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.720]   So the idea is you'll have a blender one day that you just doesn't have a cord.
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:01.320]   You just stick it in the charging spot on your counter and it goes, I want to cheat.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.120]   Oh, a kitchen.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.120]   A kitchen.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   Yes.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   It's my teacher.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.120]   All right.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.720]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.240]   Gosh, there's so much to talk about.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.240]   There is.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.840]   We'll do that in a second, but I do want to show you my Bluetooth headphones that actually
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.800]   I prefer to all of the above.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.720]   These are the aftershocks.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:23.680]   And I was, I have to admit, completely skeptical because they use bone conduction.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.720]   And I thought there's no way I'm going to hear audio from my cheek bone.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.200]   Especially through your thick skull.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.960]   Through my sick, thick skull.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.960]   And you know what?
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.400]   Maybe that boosts the resonance.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.400]   It does.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   You know what?
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:38.240]   That's so funny that you should say that because what you can do when you're wearing
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.320]   them is if you put your fingers in your ears to block the sound coming through your ear,
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:49.040]   because it's right next to your ear, it gets more, it sounds, the bass gets better.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.640]   So this is what they look like.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:56.200]   These are the best sport headphones I've ever had, but they're also Bluetooth talk headphones.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.880]   So I, they're so comfortable.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.200]   I wear them around all day in the house and I could just talk.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.200]   It's great.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   The microphones work really well.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.160]   You see how they, they sit on the side of my head like that.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.440]   And the sound quality is great.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:12.680]   This is a, a headphone I would recommend for anybody who works out, runs, bicycles.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.480]   You don't want a headphone that blocks sound because you don't want to get run over by
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.680]   that truck coming up behind you.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:18.960]   You want to be able to hear it.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.320]   It's wireless Bluetooth for one.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.560]   Multi-point pairing, which is really nice.
[00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.480]   I've appeared to all my phones.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:31.240]   They rest just outside, just outside your ear and they send many vibrations through your
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.960]   cheekbones to your inner ear bypassing your ear drum.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.080]   They even come with ear plugs.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.600]   So if you wear them on the airplane and you want, don't want to hear the baby crying behind
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.600]   you.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.800]   And you can still hear the music, which is wild.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:48.480]   The wraparounds are, I actually am glad that one thing I don't like about these other brands
[00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:54.720]   with it just go in your ears, I feel like it's easy to lose that individual earpiece.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.000]   And, and it's not that secure.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.960]   This has this titanium, very lightweight titanium band, which means that they're attached and
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:08.040]   they're always sitting very comfortably on your head and they are really secure.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.600]   I'm shaking my head for those of you who are listening really, really hard.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:14.840]   If you like head banger music, this is good for you.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.560]   Crystal clear phone calls, music.
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.120]   I listen to my audio book all day wearing these around the house.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.200]   I could still talk to people.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.680]   I could still engage, but I could still hear.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.320]   It's really fantastic.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.240]   They're IP 55, which means you can wear them in rain.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.800]   They repel sweat and dust.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.280]   Six hours of continuous music and calls on a single charge.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:39.280]   One day standby time and they charge up fast about an hour and a half.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.480]   You'll get a two year warranty.
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:49.440]   These are aftershocks AFTERSHOCZ at the end, not S. They're safer for driving in any outdoor
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.400]   activity because you hear what's going on like emergency vehicles and traffic.
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.400]   If you're running a biking, I wear these when I bike all the time.
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.240]   We've got a great aftershocks tech bundle.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:03.360]   You can find it on the website when you go to twig.aftershocks.com.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.640]   $50 off the tech bundle.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.920]   That includes the air, tricks air, a pop socket for your phone, large portable storage case,
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:17.640]   a really nice silicone rubber storage case, portable power bank and a traveler tumbler
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.640]   insulator.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:27.760]   The whole pack, get $50 off when you go to twig.aftershocks.com and use a code twig at checkout.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.920]   I admit and I bet some of you are skeptical.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.960]   When I first heard about this, I thought there's no way they could sound good.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.280]   They sound great and they're the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.020]   Sorry to say, by the way, because we got somebody from the UK saying, "I tried your
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:45.080]   aftershocks deal and it didn't work in the UK."
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:46.280]   Yeah, it's US only.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:53.480]   Twig.aftershocks.com, use the offer code twig at checkout in the US to get $50 off.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.520]   But even if you don't, that's the tech bundle.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.120]   But even if you don't get these, they're fantastic.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.040]   They have a variety of models.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   Aftershocks.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   Last, I could not worry about things falling out of my damn deers because I have weird
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.280]   ears and nothing stays in them.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:11.440]   Yeah, Lisa can't wear airpods because her ear can now is small.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.120]   And so they're not comfortable at all.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.760]   In fact, anytime you wear anything stuck in your ear, whether it's wired or unwired,
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.000]   after a while, there's fatigue.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.440]   These things just fall out and they fall out, which is a, I'm on my third pair of airpods.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.440]   It's ridiculous.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.600]   Have you seen, I presume, the airpod beams?
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.600]   No.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.600]   Um, Romeo, Romeo, she's alive.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.600]   Don't.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.600]   Oh, damn, he's wearing airpods.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.600]   You don't get it.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.920]   Uh, let's go to your meme.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.360]   Let's go to your meme.
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.360]   Okay.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.360]   No, your meme.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:50.120]   Uh, well, that, that just started.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.200]   These are not good memes.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.000]   I'm not going to show them.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.600]   Uh, you want to.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   Oh, did you?
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   Okay.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.600]   Uh, did you see that Disney has reportedly pulled their ads from YouTube?
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.600]   That is even a cool-
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.400]   Oh, we got to talk about this.
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.400]   Wired.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.400]   Yeah, cause it's-
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.400]   A wired story that is huge.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.400]   Apparently-
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:11.000]   I don't see any of this.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   I know.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.400]   This just broke today.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:20.600]   Um, apparently, and maybe it's wired UK because they spelled pedophiles within AE.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.000]   So that might be a UK thing.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:33.360]   Um, but it turns out that there are kind of quasi child porn videos on YouTube, a lot
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.360]   of them.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:44.000]   Uh, that it was young people in scanty clad outfits doing exercises or yoga that the pedophiles
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.440]   have jumped on these.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:52.640]   And in the comments, they'll even say, go to, you know, 13 minutes, three seconds in.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.040]   Um, it's a big problem.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:34:02.400]   And what's really, uh, I'm sure upsetting Disney and other companies is that these, you
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.920]   know, really, I don't know if the videos are intended to be sketch or not.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.920]   Yeah, it's wired UK.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.320]   No, they're not intended.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.440]   Most of them are just taking advantage of the fact that young people post things online.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.440]   And little children sometimes have their butts exposed or they're in an underwear or you
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.440]   can.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.800]   Anyway, uh, I don't want to go anymore on that.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:28.440]   But these, so here's an example of major advertisers, Shen Yun on one of these.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:32.360]   And then they show in the comments, hi, nice to meet you.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.880]   Kisses and hugs.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.880]   You're beautiful.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.360]   It was a video of a young girl playing in her underwear and another one.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:47.000]   Here's Lori Als ad pre-roll ad, uh, with comments that are often a little more than time stamps
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.600]   that direct people to sections where exposed genitalia could be seen or a child does a
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.840]   splits or lifts up their top to show their nipples.
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:59.600]   Um, this is, this is bad for you to, but the videos aren't the problem.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:01.600]   It's the damn commenters, right?
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:08.760]   Uh, if the, because what are you going to do, not let children put up their ballet things?
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:12.360]   I mean, it's, it's the problem here is that there's sickos who ruin everything.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:17.920]   When some videos confuse children who are uploaded, who have uploaded videos of themselves playing
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.720]   in the garden, respond to comments, asking them how old they are.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.720]   On one video, a young girl appears to ask another commenter why one of the videos had
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:28.520]   made him quote, grow.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.320]   The video shows the child and her friend doing yoga is accompanied by pre-roll advertising
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.760]   from Lori Al.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.440]   The video has two million views.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:42.760]   One of our advertisers, Grammarly, were absolutely horrified and have reached out to YouTube
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:45.360]   to rectify this immediately.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.080]   This is a problem of buying ads on YouTube, frankly.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:58.000]   Um, a spout, so Fortnite has paused all pre-roll advertising on YouTube Epic Games.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.160]   So this speaks to a couple things.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:04.160]   One, as platforms get bigger and people use them.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.120]   So people use these platforms, they become massive in scale.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.960]   They're hard to escape, but then people can go down wormholes on their own.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:18.040]   These is not, it's the same sort of people that if you post pictures of your kid in like
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.880]   a bathing suit or Instagram.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.120]   But tell me what you think of this.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:28.760]   One minute, one video monetized monetization has turned on 410, 300, 410,000 views.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.560]   A pre-pubescent girl performs a dance routine and a dingy flat flashing the camera halfway
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:38.680]   through and a definitely illegal, distressingly exploitive bear crotch shot that's shared
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.200]   in the comments with a timestamp.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:45.720]   We've seen it accompanied by advertisements for Fiat and Shen Yun.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.720]   Oh, that dance show.
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.920]   Good Lord.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.160]   That's disturbing.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:57.160]   And I think anytime you see, I mean, we'll tie this to something that I know is on the
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.160]   rundown.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.520]   I don't know if we'll get to it, but it's talking about like Facebook using location,
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:08.880]   like police are looking at its own content to find people who want to harm its workers
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.520]   and employees and talking about if that's ethical.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:17.720]   I think the issue here is we have the ability to police this, but companies are unwilling
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.800]   to do so.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:24.480]   And they're coming to a point where advertisers and the community will force them to because
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.480]   it's simply-
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:29.000]   When YouTube doesn't want this because they're going to lose money, this is terrible.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Right.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.480]   Not to mention the illegal in some cases.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:33.480]   Right.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.120]   They're no longer this cute dark corner of the internet.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:40.520]   And I don't mean dark in a negative way, but just when you're a public main street
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.000]   of the internet, you have to have main street values and mores.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.840]   And they haven't wanted to admit this because they think they're still on the normal internet
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.840]   or the old internet.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.160]   I don't know how to think about that.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.160]   But-
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.240]   Well, and YouTube is even more complicit.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.360]   Again, not intentionally, I'm sure.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.360]   Algorithically complicit.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.320]   Wired says YouTube doesn't just recommend you watch more videos of children innocently
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.320]   playing.
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:10.120]   It's algorithms specifically suggest videos that are seemingly popular with other pedophiles.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.120]   Right.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.280]   This video was monetized with the pre-roll advertising from Maybelline.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   Now, I don't blame these brands because-
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.440]   You always have to have the bad thing happen and then you figure that you catch up and-
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.240]   But YouTube's been fighting this for a long time, right?
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.240]   Jesus.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:30.240]   A lot of depressedness.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:41.240]   I feel like in the case of children's pedophilia, you might want to air more on the side of,
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:47.200]   "Oh, maybe we'll take down a few good apples and you can rectify that afterwards."
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.240]   That's my gut feeling.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:55.240]   I don't know.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.240]   I don't write algorithms for content filtering.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.400]   But I feel like that should be-
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.760]   I mean, and I know people will go around it, but that's what-
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.240]   I mean, look how great China is.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:06.240]   It's answering its population.
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   I don't know where it is.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:13.240]   Videos about with children and them can't have comments.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.520]   Well, and I mean, and there is a parenting thing.
[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:22.680]   Did you- I try very hard not to put up videos with my kid and I ask people not to tag her
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.600]   in anything.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   And I do that because- not necessarily for this reason, but I want her to have the freedom
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.640]   to be able to put these up.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:38.080]   But soon, she's going to be doing this with her friends and not necessarily on YouTube,
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:43.280]   but on musically and other places or sorry TikTok.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.320]   We should point out that according to Wired, reports of pedophiles commenting on kids'
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:53.160]   channels first appeared in 2017 and YouTube promised to fix the problem in the same year
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:58.720]   major advertisers pulled their ads after they appeared next to extremist content, including
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:03.000]   rape, apologia, anti-Semitism and hate preachers.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.720]   This is an endemic problem.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.840]   And you know, the funny thing is YouTube is getting a lot of heat for takedowns that
[00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:12.080]   are inappropriate.
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:18.320]   The Verge, for instance, had a pretty pathetic attempt to show how to build a computer that
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:23.080]   involves such things as putting in the power supply backwards and all sorts of, in some
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.720]   cases, dangerous practices.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.960]   Obviously, whoever wrote the video did the video didn't know what they were talking about.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:36.200]   Some of the commenters, you know, so people took it and showed it and commented on it.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:40.640]   Some of them responsibly, a lot of them responsibly saying, "No, don't do- what is this guy talking
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.640]   about?
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.640]   Don't do that.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:43.640]   Don't do that."
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.640]   Some of them got racist.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.880]   The presenter was black.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.640]   And of course, that's terrible.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:54.240]   The Verge, however, responded with a takedown of all of them.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:59.080]   And YouTube took them down.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:02.960]   And I just feel like that's- we're seeing more and more examples.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:09.240]   It's happening to us, too, where companies don't like the commentary and they're taking
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:12.000]   it down, not for any legitimate reason, but they're taking it down because they don't
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.720]   want that content up there.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:19.760]   And maybe the legitimate reason is its Verge content that is being shown in the commentary
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.000]   and so they're saying, "Well, look, it's our content.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   You can't do that."
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.260]   But as- and we were just talking about this, Apple did this to us yesterday on our Mac
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:30.640]   Break Weekly show, not because they didn't like the commentary, but because they had-
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:34.160]   we showed an Apple ad and commented on it.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.840]   Jeff is the professor of journalism.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:41.840]   I will ask you, that is called Fair Use commentary, right?
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.040]   And generally held to be a good defense in cases like this.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.440]   YouTube does not make it easy, apparently.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:50.760]   We're trying to get the video restored and my people are saying, "There's nowhere to
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.960]   dispute this content ID thing.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.320]   I find that hard to believe.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:57.400]   There's got to be a way to dispute it, but they don't make it easy.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.800]   Let's put it that way."
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.840]   The Verge, in this case, manually submitted the takedowns.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:07.480]   Apple has done that against us when we streamed their product announcements.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:10.120]   You know, there's an interesting business opportunity here.
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.160]   I'm thinking about this in other contexts.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.160]   Yeah, Vimeo.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.160]   Well, this is that.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.560]   Yeah, welcome to Vimeo.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:22.400]   But- and there's a moral hazard here of plenty, but imagine if there were an independent
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:29.800]   auditing structure that you paid to do this for you and that- and that the platform is
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   trusted.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   Oh, like the-
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:33.400]   I don't like it because it's redlining.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.840]   It's for the more privileged, but at some level, you know, like, "Would I need my passport
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.840]   renewed?
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:42.120]   I go to the service that does all the stuff for me and expedites it."
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.480]   Someone does that for ads.
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.160]   And it's not the FTC.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:55.080]   There is a middleman for advertising disputes for- God, what's it called?
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.080]   Is it the ad bureau or-
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.720]   The US or UK?
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.720]   In the US.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   Ooh.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:07.560]   I know because Sprint and Tmo and all the carriers get cranky with each other and submit
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.760]   their like, "My network's better."
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.200]   He says, "His network's better."
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:15.440]   And then you get these like, "So and so, whatever this bureau is, has decided."
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.080]   I'll look it up.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:21.000]   Meanwhile, and we talked about this also on Mac Break Weekly yesterday, so maybe it's
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.440]   had something to do with it.
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:26.120]   YouTube has announced in their Creator blog, "They're going to make the strike system
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.520]   clear and consistent," and they show a nice-
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.560]   This is what I was asking you about.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.160]   Is this clear or more consistent?
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.080]   Yeah, I'm not sure.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.040]   I don't know.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:39.160]   The point of this is most people who break the community guidelines aren't doing it on
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.160]   purpose.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.680]   So, YouTube's only has a three-strike system.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:46.760]   You get three chances and then you're banned.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:52.320]   94% of those who receive a first strike, according to YouTube, never get a second one.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.520]   But they even thought that was too dramatic.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:59.960]   So starting February 25th, all channels will receive a one-time warning the first time
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:02.520]   they post content that crosses the line.
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.160]   And that could be a variety of things, but mostly it's over copyright, right?
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.720]   With no penalties to their channel except for the removal of that content, that's a
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.000]   takedown.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.840]   This is to make sure everyone takes the time to learn about our community guidelines and
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:20.400]   then can quickly get back to creating great content and engaging with the audience.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.840]   So I think consistency is fine.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.680]   That's a good goal.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.400]   First strike results in a one-week freeze and the ability to upload any new content to
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.800]   YouTube, including live streaming and other channel activities.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.600]   Strikes will expire after 90 days.
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.960]   The second strike in any 90-day period will result in a two-week freeze.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.760]   The third strike will result in any...
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.520]   If you get three strikes in a 90-day period in channel termination.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:49.600]   So you get to have a strike every three months.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.040]   I don't know if it's better or worse.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.400]   Hank Green did this video.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:45:01.960]   I think we mentioned last week, before last, that it really goes through the detail of it
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:02.960]   and it's excellent.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:06.960]   But it doesn't make any sense that the system is broken and it is what it is.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:10.760]   The student will have Article 13 and it won't matter.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.760]   We will not.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.760]   That is in Europe.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:13.760]   I know it's still bad.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.760]   I'm trying to look at these.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.760]   It should affect you.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:18.760]   I mean, do you have European listeners to the IoT podcast?
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.760]   I have tons.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:20.760]   I have tons.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.760]   I have lots.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.000]   So Europeans, they're really good at IoT.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.160]   I know.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:34.560]   I spent my holiday reading the Commons report on disinformation and fake news and the Cairn
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:41.520]   Crop Cross review of UK journalism and the Article 11 and 13 stuff.
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.520]   And you're...
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.520]   I don't have fun.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.560]   Yeah, and I spent my holiday reading the Three Body trilogy.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.040]   Oh, you read all three in one holiday period?
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.240]   You're a fast reader.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.400]   It's a good trilogy.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.400]   It's long.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.400]   It's good.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.480]   I've only read the first one and a little bit of the second one before I got a...
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.480]   Before Peter Ring out.
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.000]   You're like, "Oh, I'm done."
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   You're exhausted.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   I see.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   And it's going to be a TV show, I guess.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.840]   So you read it now.
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.400]   How much time did you spend reading it?
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:13.400]   Well, it was a four-day weekend.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.160]   So I usually read like a book a day.
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.160]   You read fast.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   You do?
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.400]   Well, like fiction, if I'm reading like...
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.360]   No wonder you don't have time to watch pornography.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.240]   I'm just kidding, yeah.
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.960]   That's not going on my tombstone.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.320]   I just didn't have time.
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:36.040]   No, you must read very fast because those are really long books.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:40.160]   It took me several months to get the first one done.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.840]   You know, it took a while to get into it, but...
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.400]   You don't watch any TV or something.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.080]   I mean, you don't eat food.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.080]   You're not human.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.080]   You're not human.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.080]   I eat food.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.080]   I exercise.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.080]   I play with my dog and my child.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.560]   Wow, I'm impressed.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.680]   And she creates a great newsletter and website.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.680]   And not dimension.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.680]   I didn't work this weekend.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:00.680]   A fine podcast.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.840]   Four whole days she didn't work.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.080]   She read three books.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.480]   And she makes queso.
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.480]   And makes queso.
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.960]   Okay, queso is like really easy.
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:08.960]   You dump a...
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.960]   So...
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.960]   Like, hold on there.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:15.920]   Negotiations continue in the European Parliament over articles 11 and 13.
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.920]   Is there...
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:19.800]   Julia Radha, who is a member of the EU Parliament?
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.560]   It passed the first vote, I think, today.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:24.920]   And there's further votes.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:25.920]   And there are...
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.920]   Some countries are saying...
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:31.400]   Whole countries are saying, no, this is gonna harm innovation and the internet.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.240]   But the big countries...
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.400]   Let's see, where do I find that?
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.840]   Julia Radha's blog is the place if you want to read more about this.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.840]   She is great.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.840]   She is a brilliant idea.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:41.840]   She is a brilliant idea.
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:42.840]   You are a great idea.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.840]   Pirate part.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:44.840]   The green is the green.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:45.840]   She is a pirate party.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:46.840]   Okay, that's a pirate party.
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.840]   That's a pirate party.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.840]   Yeah, I think she is.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:50.840]   That's official.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:56.720]   Nevertheless, you've heard us talk about it many times.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.680]   I don't want to spend a lot of time.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:03.720]   Article 13 is the one that would require us and anybody that uses content.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:12.240]   And all of our shows are based on commentary on other people's content to get licenses.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:17.400]   And furthermore, if you're Twitter or YouTube or Facebook, you can't post anything that
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.640]   hasn't been licensed.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:24.480]   So you have a huge burden to make sure that everything that you have on there, if there
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.040]   is copyright material by anybody else, there's no...
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.680]   In other words, there's no fair use.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.680]   That's why I...
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.680]   Well, no, there is.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:31.680]   I see as the...
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.680]   There is.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.680]   I read the text.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.120]   There is an exception for criticism of fair use.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.960]   But as Laurie Lussick famously said, fair use is the right to hire an attorney.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:39.960]   It's a defense.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.080]   Yeah, it's a defense.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:46.480]   And the platforms are going to say, "Uh-uh, that's two new ones for us.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.440]   If somebody else made it, you can't put it up."
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.280]   Period, because the liability is huge.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:49:00.480]   And then the article 11 is a link tax, which is very similar to what Germany tried to do.
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.480]   And Spain did.
[00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:06.280]   And Spain did, to their detriment, reproducing more than single words of very short extracts
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.280]   of news stories will also require a license with no exception.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.880]   Including non-profit laws.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:23.640]   So the commons report had this strange factor in there that not only they consider...
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.120]   Because GDPR, they consider...
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:32.280]   There's a wide range of things they consider to be personal data, like your IP address.
[00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:34.760]   Yeah, that's a really tough one.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.200]   That's a really tough one.
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.200]   It's raffle.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:41.080]   And now they're proposing to go the next step.
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:45.440]   Any inference about you, you own.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:54.920]   So everything about machine learning that's about finding patterns and making predictions.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:59.440]   Now suddenly they're trying to propose that you own that.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.480]   What the heck that means and how you do anything about that.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:10.000]   So Amazon comes along and they want to recommend these glosses because you bought those boots.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.200]   You can't make inference without having someone's underlying data.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.280]   And that's always been the issue with GDPR.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:23.400]   But even if you have permission for the underlying, now they're saying they need permission for
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.360]   the inference.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:31.360]   Which is silly because to get rid of that threat, all you do is take away permission
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.520]   to use the underlying data.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:39.520]   What that's trying to get to is Amazon might have data on my favorite glosses.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:49.920]   And I'm trying to think someone else may have data on my foot fungus powder purchases.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:54.440]   And if they put those two things together, they might infer like my insurance or something
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:58.760]   that I'm trying to give myself foot fungus by wearing terrible glosses.
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.760]   What is this analogy?
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:04.240]   I don't know where you're going to get an ad for fungus fighting.
[00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.320]   The lashes, that would be good.
[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:10.120]   I was trying to turn this into something nefarious, but I really think that aggregating
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:14.800]   data from two different sources into an inference.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:20.840]   So but really all I have to do is stop the data about my foot fungus powder purchases.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:21.840]   Again, right?
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:22.840]   Really weird.
[00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:25.000]   You can't make an inference if you don't have the original data.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.480]   So here's on pages 16 and 17 inferred data is therefore regarded by the ICO as personal
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:35.800]   data on the day before the page before it says get this geeks, watch out geeks.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:41.160]   If tech companies, including technical engineers involved in creating the software for the
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:46.560]   companies are found to have failed to meet their obligations under such code dot dot
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.320]   dot dot through the independent regulation of the ability to launch legal proceedings
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:56.720]   against them with the prospect of large fines being administered as the penalty for noncompliance
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.360]   with the code.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.440]   So you do something for Facebook or Google.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:06.560]   Now they're putting the employee in the case of having to know every implication and basically
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.680]   have their own attorney.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.240]   What's weird is they become liable?
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.240]   Well, that's because they can't go after the tech firms.
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.280]   So they're going to go after their employees.
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:19.600]   You always on a legal fight go after the weak link.
[00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:21.240]   And hope it doesn't go to the tech firms.
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.920]   They're going after them both.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:28.680]   Yeah, but this is a this is a much bigger stick from a strategy perspective.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:32.640]   This isn't going to make it into the end law, but this is a really good way to start your
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:33.640]   negotiation.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:39.760]   Well, don't forget there are people in the European Parliament like the German member
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:46.960]   of EP, Schwen Schulz, or as I call him, Sergeant Schulz.
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.920]   I know nothing.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.280]   He, I don't know anything.
[00:52:52.280 --> 00:53:00.080]   He thinks Google because he's getting so many protests over article 11 and 13, he thinks
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:05.120]   it's all coming from Google because they all seem to come from people with Gmail addresses.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:09.320]   So I did a slightly better translation of his tweet.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.320]   Yes.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:15.400]   He said, now every second I'm getting messages about articles 11 and 13, and they all come
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:21.080]   from Gmail and never mind that that the information in them is wrong.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:23.000]   Google do you really need to take this action?
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   Idiot.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.600]   I know you're angry, but I know you're angry.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:30.560]   I know you're angry Google, but really.
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:35.760]   He's a member of the European Parliament, I think, right?
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.760]   Yes, MEP.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   VP.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:41.720]   If we could just get all the old white guys out, it would be fine.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.400]   I couldn't agree more Stacy.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.320]   I could not agree more.
[00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.320]   And worse, he's been retweeted 212 times.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:50.600]   I'll all I had in.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.600]   Saj and Schulz.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.600]   I know nothing.
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:57.560]   Yeah, fortunately all the all the jokes back are in German Swedish or German.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:02.080]   So yeah, it's, well, it's pretty hilarious.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:10.320]   Man, Google, I know you're angry, but you have this fake really necessary action.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:14.120]   I think plus these hashtag odd things.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:17.520]   Yeah, hashtag fake hashtag Google, and he did the hashtag right.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.760]   He separated the hashtag from the text by a space.
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:21.760]   So it doesn't even work.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.720]   Hashtag upload filter hashtag article 13 actually does work.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:28.240]   Look, hashtag Gmail hashtag Google hashtag fake.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:31.040]   Well, they put the space in.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:35.320]   Yeah, but it might still work because it looks like they're blue, which means they are links.
[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.320]   Oh, that's true.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.320]   They might.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.320]   That's right.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.320]   I think that's their point anyway.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.160]   Anyway, these are the people.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.080]   These are the people taking over the Internet.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:49.320]   These are when you see me go crazy about this.
[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:52.600]   I think there's, I think there's bad people on both sides.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.160]   Oh, oh, yeah.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.240]   Oh, going to phrase.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.240]   Thanks.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.240]   Thanks.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:02.880]   No, seriously, I think it's coming from both ends.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:07.640]   It's coming from the ignorant regulators, but honest to God, they're getting ammunition
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:13.880]   from things like YouTube recommending more more like this.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:18.720]   But most of not, you just phrased that YouTube because you explained it earlier before you
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.280]   went into devil's advocate mode.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:23.920]   Well, I don't blame them, but I sort of do blame them.
[00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.120]   Oh, I know.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.520]   Welcome to our future, folks.
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.720]   Things are tools are going to be out there.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.760]   People are going to misuse them and then you got to catch up to the misuse.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:37.400]   Well, what about every time we have this horrible shock that it's occurred?
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.880]   Yes, bad people will do bad things.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:40.880]   That's not surprising.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:44.920]   The issue is not, well, the issue is that in some level, but the issue is what do we
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.080]   expect the platformers do and how quickly do we expect them to do it?
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   Right.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   And how do we hold them to that?
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.080]   And I'm fine for all those three things.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:53.920]   It's the fake shock that somebody just holding bad in the world.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.080]   You know that it drives me crazy.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:56:00.760]   You know that almost all the people who these days espouse the flat earth theory learned
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:01.760]   about it on YouTube.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:04.360]   I don't blame YouTube for that, by the way.
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.680]   But you know, it just, it just shows you.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:09.280]   Well, it's the thing we discussed last week about the anti-vaxxers.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:13.840]   Well, did you see Pinterest is just no longer serving up the search results?
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:17.200]   I didn't know how you felt about that, Jeff, but I was curious.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.480]   I'm fine with it.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.240]   I think, you know, I've been thinking about it.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:25.440]   So Zuckerberg said in his interview with Jonathan Zitrin at Berkman Center, a couple
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:26.720]   of interesting things.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:30.680]   And one was that there was a moment in time when he was considering just getting rid of
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:33.480]   all political advertising because he couldn't deal with it.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:38.000]   And there is a point at which if your Facebook say, you know what, you know what, not only
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.160]   are we not going to promote news, news is for Bolton.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:42.160]   No news.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.160]   Forget it.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.160]   No news.
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:45.160]   It gets us in trouble.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.160]   It's a mess.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.040]   This is for people with their cats.
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:49.600]   No news.
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.520]   That would be a bad thing for society.
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:56.840]   But if you're Facebook, and I own no stock on Facebook, but I did gather money from Facebook
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:57:00.400]   for my university, I have no independent of Facebook.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.800]   We've seen no money personally from Facebook.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:07.000]   If you're Facebook and if a new share responsible to your shareholders, at some point, you'd
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.920]   say, F it, man, just F that news.
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:13.480]   That's in essence what Larry and Sergey did early on because they were really interested
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.480]   in news.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.120]   And then all these damn journalists came after them.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:17.120]   They were all difficult.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:18.800]   And they kind of said, F them.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:25.600]   And they pulled back any effort until it became a matter of PR and lobbying and brand.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:27.640]   That's when they started making friends to the news business again.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:29.960]   And now they're making and they're doing a very good job.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:30.960]   And it's working for them.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.960]   It's valuable and it should be, I think.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.720]   But if I were at some point, Google doesn't make any of Google news.
[00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:38.000]   At some point just say, Oh, the heck with it.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.160]   Go on from Europe.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.160]   Go on.
[00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:41.160]   So who's Shane Dawson?
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.840]   I don't make any any news sites.
[00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:44.840]   Fine.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.200]   Tell me about Shane Dawson.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.960]   Who's this Shane Dawson?
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:48.960]   When he's at home.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:49.960]   I don't know.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:50.960]   He's a YouTuber.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:54.320]   Oh, Kevin Roos writing about in The New York Times.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:59.320]   Last month, YouTube star Shane Dawson uploaded his new project, a nearly two hour documentary
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:05.000]   called conspiracy theories with Shane Dawson in the video set to a spooky instrumental
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   soundtrack.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.440]   Dawson unspooded a series of far-fetched hypotheses among.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.000]   You do the Chuck E. Cheese one?
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   Yes.
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.520]   So I'll get to that.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:16.720]   iPhones secretly record their owners every utterance.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:21.480]   Popular children's TV shows contain subliminal messages or urging children to commit suicide.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:26.520]   The recent string of deadly wildfires in California was set by the military using a high powered
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.600]   laser called a directed energy weapon.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.480]   None of it's true.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.480]   Maybe he's a comedian.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.480]   I don't know.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:36.960]   The video has received more than 30 million views.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.320]   The follow-up's drawn more than 20 million views and started a public feud with Chuck E.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:45.920]   Cheese's The Restaurant Chain, which was forced to deny claims it recycles customers uneaten
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:49.440]   pizza slices into brand new pieces.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.440]   This is a good one.
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.640]   Dig into this one.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:54.640]   Look up the photos.
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.280]   Okay.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.280]   It's a comedy, right?
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.280]   This guy's a comedian.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.640]   Well, but I'm telling you, Leo, look at that pizza.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:02.640]   Looks pretty good.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:03.840]   No, it doesn't.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.840]   It doesn't?
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:09.760]   No, because that's not if you try to put those together, you wouldn't end up with one round
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.760]   pizza.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:11.760]   Oh, you're from New York.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:12.760]   You just have pizza.
[00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:13.760]   You have pizza.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:16.240]   You clearly came from other pizzas.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:20.560]   Notice that prep sorority slice has a slice on it and it doesn't go over to the next slice.
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:23.360]   I'm telling you, Leo, there's a conspiracy at Chuck E. Cheese.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.000]   This is the play acting folks.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.920]   I'm not really saying this about Chuck E. Cheese, but this is the game.
[00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:31.160]   That's not an actual pizza.
[00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.880]   It's recycled slices.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:41.040]   And this is from Shane Dawson's Twitter, Memories of Chuck E. Cheese pizzas.
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.880]   One of them is half cheese, half pepperoni.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:44.880]   I don't.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.880]   Okay.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.720]   And by the way, I'm not believing this.
[00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:48.720]   I'm just having fun.
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.720]   I don't know.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.160]   Oh, no one believes it, except maybe, I don't know, does Shane actually, you're looking
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:56.200]   at some of the pictures and you don't know how they would make the pie.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:59.600]   You're like, Oh, that could be two different pies.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:04.200]   It could also be somebody who took two different buys or put them together.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.760]   I made the picture to make a conspiracy, which is more likely the case.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:09.120]   By the way, lots of tweets from like this.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.120]   I work at Chuck E. Cheese.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:13.760]   I can tell you, we literally do not recycle our pizza slices.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.600]   Like that's whack.
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.200]   Instead we're in the back with a child sex ring.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.160]   I've seen kitchen guys make fresh pizza all the time.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:24.960]   A new order comes in and we see the game room guys throwing out leftover pizza on the table.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.160]   So proof positive.
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:32.320]   Dawson joined YouTube in 2005 became one of its bigger stars several years later when
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:36.760]   began posting his comedy sketches on the site after rising to fame.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:42.600]   He faced black, black, backlash for his use of black face and racial stereotypes and skits.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.600]   Wow.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.000]   Somebody who is not an awesome person does well on YouTube.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   What a shot.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   I'm telling you, I'm moving our entire network to Vimeo.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.640]   This is just, I mean, honestly, by the way, Dawson's real name is Shane Lee Yaw.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.080]   I don't believe that for a minute.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.040]   He has 20 million subscribers and this is what scares me.
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.200]   A devoted teenage fan base.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:13.080]   Clearly he makes content that's going to, he knows how to make content that's going to
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.080]   do well.
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:25.640]   Yeah, as long as we are in a mass based volume based, click based, add structure, the motors
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:33.920]   for everybody are perverse, including CNN, including the maker of the video, including
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.200]   YouTube, including Facebook, all of them.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:42.880]   But does YouTube stock recommending Dawson's videos, even though it will cost them a lot
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.680]   of money?
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.520]   At some point, it depends on the pressure, right?
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.760]   It's countervailing pressures.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.520]   And some people are going to say, obviously he's joking.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.520]   It's a joke.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.520]   I get it.
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.200]   It's because at some point, because what you end up with then is then at some point they
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.000]   start banning the onion and I would scream bloody murder.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.640]   But if somebody out there believes the onion as it happens all the time, you know, Chinese
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:09.000]   newspaper reports onion story, right?
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.480]   Well, we'll go get rid of that.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.640]   So yeah, now you make a good point.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.920]   So what do we expect?
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:21.320]   We don't really have the discussion about what we truly expect them to do and follow
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.320]   the group.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.400]   Do we expect them to get rid of political ads?
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.320]   Do we expect them to get rid of all anti-vax stuff?
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:32.720]   Do we expect them to take not accept videos of children?
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:34.800]   Where do we want the line to be?
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:40.840]   We kind of have to say so as a society, whether it's the law or not, they're going to enforce
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:45.040]   the norms of society and society doesn't know what that actually wants.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:50.800]   So we're going through a process of negotiating this now and they get blamed for it all and
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.800]   sometimes they should be blamed for it all.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.000]   But a lot of times we as a society should be blamed for not making a reminder about what
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.960]   matters and not agreeing.
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:58.960]   Sorry.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:02:59.960]   I think they wait too long.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.560]   Yes, I agree.
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.160]   I think they have the tools.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:07.360]   They just don't want to deploy it because it is expensive.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.120]   It does push some liability in their hands.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:16.560]   I think there are some things that we can all universally agree on as being a problem.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.680]   So conspiracy theory, dude, not really.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.640]   Things like child pedophilia.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.640]   Yes.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.640]   Anti-vaxxers?
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.000]   I was like, anti-vaxxers?
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.080]   So iffy, how do you...
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.080]   Okay.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:37.320]   Well, so this is where I think the tech companies, I don't think there should be a ban on anti-vaxxers.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:46.160]   I do think figuring out how to tweak your algorithms so they don't continually feed
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.160]   into paranoia.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.040]   That they should not wrote that, yes.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.360]   Is probably the way to go there.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:04:00.120]   We need to be having technically informed discussions that we're not really having today.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.040]   Oh, I was like, and Jeff has left.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:06.760]   You finally done it, Stacey.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.040]   I was like, man, that technically informed discussions.
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:10.760]   I was too much for him.
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:11.760]   Henry.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.760]   So here's a...
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.800]   This is a whole sh*t.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.200]   This is a post I haven't written yet.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.200]   Don't worry.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.200]   That's not my rating.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.200]   That's what I'm writing about.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:25.680]   So there's a brilliant professor named Phil Napoli, who's now done at Duke, who wrote
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.680]   a paper that scares me.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:33.120]   And it says, the headline is, "What if more speech is no longer the solution?
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.280]   First Amendment theory meets fake news in the filter bubble.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.840]   You have...
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:42.640]   The First Amendment is under attack because people don't know what to do with this stuff.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:48.200]   So the idea that less speech is better than more speech is antithetical to my soul as an
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.200]   American.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.600]   And antithetical to my beliefs in the First Amendment.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.880]   But there's talk about that going on.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:05:02.120]   And you saw Justice Thomas saying maybe the First Amendment is being overutilized yesterday.
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:06.760]   And you have these European reports saying, "Yeah, the platform should just get rid of
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.400]   a lot of speech."
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.880]   And I read the comments thing.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.360]   Again and again and again and again and again in the margin, I wrote China Iran, China Iran
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:15.360]   and China Iran.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:19.080]   Put those tools in the hands of China and Iran, which they're doing on their own.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:22.800]   And then the UK starts to look like China or Iran.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:27.880]   We've got to recognize that speech is speech and the problem is more that people believe
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:28.880]   stupid things.
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:31.000]   That's education, that's what we need.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.200]   I don't mean media education.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:34.120]   I mean education education.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:37.280]   I would not disagree with you.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:41.240]   I mean, I spend a lot of time teaching my daughter about this.
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:46.440]   I think we probably need to change the curriculum a little bit to give people more media literacy
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:49.000]   or just internet literacy.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.680]   I know they went through that.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:56.000]   No, because the problem I have with that is to some extent, sure, but that's not the
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.120]   solution.
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:05.000]   That's media centric, I think, and acts as if you just had the user manual for our stuff,
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   you'd be fine.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.480]   No, you've got to have the ability to think generally.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:09.480]   Nothing to do with the internet.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:14.560]   Well, so critical thinking is important, but I think when you're teaching critical thinking,
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:19.560]   using examples from today's media is really relevant.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:21.640]   And some people are never going to think critically.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:26.520]   Some people are going to be like, I mean, some people surf the internet the same way,
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:30.400]   you know, people used to come home and sit down and turn on law and order and just sit
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.400]   there.
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:34.000]   And it's to let your brain rest.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.840]   The problem is when they do that, they're not just, it's no longer a lean back.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:47.280]   They're asking you to engage and to forward and to make a statement about things.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:54.560]   So we also true that your idiot uncle Joe and your friend Joey on the playground have
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.840]   always done this, right?
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.960]   And so it's not anything to do with the internet in the end.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.640]   It's just, yeah, there's other opportunities, but there's also more opportunities to actually
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:05.760]   look up stuff to say, Joe, you're full of it.
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:08.400]   You're wrong.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.320]   So we never talk about the good.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.280]   We never ever talk about the good that comes.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:14.280]   And that upsets me.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.280]   I knew Joe.
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.840]   He's calm and sponsored this week.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.880]   No, I wish it were.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:20.880]   I think I need it.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:23.080]   I can show you something almost is exciting.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.880]   That's my aura ring.
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:26.880]   Can we talk about that?
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.360]   Can we come back and talk about it?
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.360]   Oh, yes.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.360]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:31.960]   You have such good sponsors.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.760]   I know we do, don't we?
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:39.600]   Or actually the way we found out about this was kind of interesting.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.000]   Kevin Rose told me about it.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   Kevin was on triangulation.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.480]   He was wearing a ring just like this.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.480]   And I said, what's that?
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:45.480]   That's cool.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:46.480]   He said, oh, that's my aura.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:47.480]   Let me tell you about it.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:48.480]   And he told me all about it.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:52.360]   He said, I'll get you one because he's an advisor for the company.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.760]   They're a Finnish company.
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.960]   And he wrote to the founder of Aura and they sent me a ring.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.840]   And I've been wearing it for six months.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:04.600]   And it is the best fitness activity and sleep tracker I have ever used.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.120]   So it's a Finnish company.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.760]   Number one, I think privacy is very important nowadays when we wear something that records
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.560]   every, every move.
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:14.640]   The aura ring is governed by GDPR.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.640]   They're a Finnish company.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:17.320]   They're very strong privacy policies.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:20.680]   If you're worried about that, read all about it on the Aura site.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:27.560]   OURARANG.com or URAring.com.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.720]   But let me tell you what it does because it's really cool.
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.920]   Inside the Aura ring are a whole host of sensors.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.520]   Infrared optical pulse measurement.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.840]   And if it's on your finger, it turns out that's a really good place to do that better
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.600]   than the wrist.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:46.280]   Sometimes people with the Apple watches say, well, I have a tattoo or I'm a very hairy
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.280]   wrist.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.280]   I can't.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.280]   It's not very accurate.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.560]   Because I don't remember the physiological details you can read about it on the site.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:58.200]   But because of where the ring is measuring, there's a much more clearer and much more
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.720]   accurate measurement of the blood flow there.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.120]   But that's not all that's in there.
[01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:08.840]   It's also got a 3D accelerometer, a gyroscope and a body temperature sensor.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:13.700]   And because of it, it knows all the activity, of course, it's, you know, it measures steps.
[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:14.700]   But also my heart rate.
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:18.880]   I can measure heart rate variability, which is a really important indicator.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.600]   It turns out the higher your heart rate variability, the better.
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:27.040]   Because that means your heart is responding better.
[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:28.480]   This is the app.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.680]   And the Aura ring, by the way, can store quite a bit of data.
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.720]   I think six weeks of data in the ring.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:36.920]   But every day I open up the app and it copies it over using Bluetooth LA.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.320]   It's very quick and easy.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:42.080]   I could see, let me go to yesterday because I got a good read.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:45.680]   So you get a readiness score, which is based on all of this.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.280]   Although noted, I had an elevated body temperature.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.120]   So that's kind of interesting.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.120]   And here it is.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.120]   It was up a little bit.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:55.200]   Often that's a sign that you might be getting sick or something's going on.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:57.160]   Got a great sleep score.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:02.680]   It measures everything, including your awake time, your rapid eye movement, dream time,
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.120]   two hours, light sleep, four and a half hours, 56 minutes of deep sleep.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.120]   That's great.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.640]   And you can drill down on any of these facts and get more information about it.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.880]   You can record activities.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.240]   And if you look at the readiness report, it'll give you a lot more information about what
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.280]   that score comes from.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.920]   Body temperature, resting heart rate, recovery index.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.440]   And here's the heart rate variability.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.520]   The higher the better, which is interesting.
[01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:30.920]   That usually means that your system is more robust.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.880]   You can get information.
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.840]   Here's a really useful one.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.240]   You saw what a great score and an hour of deep sleep.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:41.320]   And I thought, what did I do yesterday that I didn't do the night before?
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.000]   And I realized I took a little tiny melatonin pill to that time.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.160]   And that apparently made a big difference.
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.280]   I could see definitely how exercise affects and improves my sleep.
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:56.240]   My heart rate, resting heart rate is a good indicator of overall health, things like that.
[01:10:56.240 --> 01:10:58.360]   I just, I love this thing.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.760]   This is fantastic.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:00.760]   This is the aura ring.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.360]   It's made out of titanium.
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.360]   So it's super lightweight.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.000]   They have a variety of colors and shapes.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.600]   There's the silver, there's black, there's stealth, which is what I'm wearing, which
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.600]   is a matte black.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:14.680]   The other black is kind of piano black, shiny.
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:19.440]   There's even a diamond version, which would be a great gift for a special person in your
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:20.640]   life.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:26.560]   $2.99 for silver or black, $3.99 for stealth, diamond $9.99.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:32.240]   But I want you to order it right now because these things sell off the shelves so fast.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:37.840]   At this point, they can't promise to get it to you any sooner than May.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.840]   But you might say, well, I'll wait till May, no, because then it'll be August.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.840]   Just to order it, you will be really glad.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.680]   It's a great gift for mom, for Mother's Day, for a graduate coming up in June.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:52.320]   You'll get it by then for sure.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:56.080]   Activity insights, daily feedback that helps you better understand your body, improve your
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.840]   health, reach your goals.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:05.120]   It is fascinating to see this is the best way to measure all this stuff.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:10.040]   You can charge it up in just a matter of hours and it's hold this charge all week.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:13.640]   What I usually do is I take it off, charge it at the charging thing.
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.400]   It's just a little circle base.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.600]   I put it on my dresser and it's a USB charger.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.360]   The ring goes right on it and it charges up very fast.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.320]   But also you could do what I do, which is just charge it for a few minutes a day so
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.600]   it's always ready.
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.760]   I just really love this thing.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:34.480]   This is the OURA Aura ring.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480]   And I think you're going to love it.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:37.760]   But don't delay because they sell out so fast.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:40.520]   They're making them as fast as they can.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:44.640]   It's hard to make because it's a very precise device.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:48.800]   OURA R-I-N-G.com.
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:53.280]   If you use the offer code TWIT at checkout, you'll get $50 off your purchase.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.200]   Order it today to get it by May.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.800]   OURA R-I-N-G.com and the offer code is TWIT.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:01.600]   I just love this thing.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.360]   I've worn every fitness device known to man and this is the one.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:06.920]   This really is the one.
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.920]   I'm going to Helsinki at the end of March.
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:13.160]   They're not in Helsinki.
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.160]   They're in...
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.840]   I can't remember the other...
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.920]   No, no, no, no.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:21.000]   It's a well-known town in Finland.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   Espu.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]   Espu.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   Thank you.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.600]   If you go to visit Nokia, you can see that.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:28.800]   I have bet you there's some people who used to work at Nokia over there.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:32.120]   Yeah, that's pretty much any tech company in Finland.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:36.080]   Yeah, really cool.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:38.240]   So Google says, "No, we made it.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:45.880]   I told you there was a microphone in there, but it wasn't supposed to be a secret."
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:46.880]   So...
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:47.880]   Okay.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:48.880]   This is very...
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.520]   We're talking about the Nest Secure, which is what they're...
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.520]   We talked about this already?
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.520]   No, we talked about it.
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:59.920]   So we talked about the news that it was opt-in only because they were going to enable a
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.160]   microphone that had been in the...
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.360]   So it was announced?
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.360]   No.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:06.360]   So, okay.
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:13.560]   So yes, when they announced this functionality, they said, "By the way, it's opt-in.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:18.400]   You have to opt-in to this service because we're not going to turn on the microphone unless
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.400]   you've opted in."
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:20.400]   Oh.
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.560]   Now, at that point, though, a lot of people were like, "Wait, what?
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.560]   There's a microphone."
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.560]   There's a microphone?
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.720]   Because it wasn't in the original specs.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:27.720]   Right.
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:31.680]   And so Kevin and I talked about this actually last week with regard to smart televisions.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.720]   This isn't a Nest problem.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.720]   This is a connected device.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:35.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:37.160]   A lot of TV stuff microphones in them, yeah.
[01:14:37.160 --> 01:14:38.160]   Yes.
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.680]   And so I'm actually doing...
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:42.840]   So we talked about it on our show this morning.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.600]   And this Friday in the newsletter, I'm going to focus on this.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.440]   I'm putting together...
[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.200]   This is not just blatant self-promotion, but I'm putting together a list of disclosures
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.280]   for connected devices, like what you need to tell people.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.280]   Yes.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.280]   Microphone's a big one.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.280]   Camera too.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.280]   Not...
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.680]   Yeah, microphone camera, but also, you know, speakers and a ton of the devices.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.120]   You have in your house that are smart devices.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.800]   They have additional sensors.
[01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:09.800]   They have humidity, temperature.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.800]   Oh.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.800]   Like a lot of the hue...
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:14.800]   The hue motion detector also detects temperature.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.880]   Does that matter for most people?
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.880]   Probably not.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:18.880]   Why does it?
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.800]   Because I have one in my office, a hue motion sensor.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:24.240]   Because one day they might want to add functionality.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.200]   That's why they do it.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.200]   It for the most...
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.960]   It's all part of a system on a chip probably, right?
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:32.480]   Sometimes yes, sometimes no.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.400]   But yes, it's relatively cheap.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:38.440]   And, you know, if you use that data, you can kind of gain some new insights.
[01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:41.520]   I mean, basically, the money is in the data.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:45.240]   If the money's in the data, you put as many sensors that are relatively cheap as you can,
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:49.680]   because who knows what algorithms you can derive that will tell you something new and
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:51.120]   exciting about someone.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:54.920]   So you think it's credible when Google says this is what a Google representative told
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.400]   Business Insider.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.520]   The company made an error.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:01.720]   The on-device microphone was never intended to be a secret and should have been listed
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:04.000]   in the tech specs that was an error on our part.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.480]   You find that credible.
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:11.520]   I find it incredible that they wouldn't realize that this is a problem.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:17.880]   I find like secret sensors in your IoT devices have been historically kept secret for competitive
[01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:19.320]   reasons.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:26.600]   So I believe that Google did keep it a secret and did it because they wanted to have to
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:32.600]   be able to announce a new feature that was competitively exciting, right?
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:39.240]   If you say on the box microphone inside, people are going to say, "Well, how can I use
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.240]   that?"
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.160]   You don't have, yes and no.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.520]   You don't have to say on the box microphone inside.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:52.480]   But you can say, I mean, there's, I looked at the Nest Guard press materials.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:54.840]   There's nothing in the press materials.
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:59.800]   So at a bare minimum, when you send out those review units, every review unit you ever get
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.560]   comes with a little booklet that gives you all the tech specs and everything you need
[01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.680]   as a reviewer.
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:08.120]   That's not in there.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.560]   And that's that is that should be there.
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:14.760]   And if it's in there, you put it, you say a microphone has been included.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:20.640]   It is not enabled for possible future use or something like that to kind of.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.080]   Transparency and control.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.520]   I think they could have done that and without any harm.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:29.480]   I was trying to think of why they might not have you.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.400]   Think it's just tone deafness like they don't understand.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.200]   Like I said, competitiveness.
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:38.280]   You don't want to say like, if there's a microphone in there and yes, your competitors
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.960]   are going to do tear downs of your products.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:43.520]   But they're going to know, they're going to know more than anybody else does.
[01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.240]   They're going to say, "Oh, there's a microphone in here."
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:48.520]   In five seconds, they're going to look at it and say, "Look at the microphone."
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.520]   Right?
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:53.120]   Maybe a little longer than five seconds, but yes.
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.520]   I mean, they could see it.
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:18:01.600]   It's not hard to see a microphone, I would think.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:04.400]   Unless you've never looked at chips before or something, maybe.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.000]   No, and they do.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.040]   But I don't think I'll put it this way.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:13.520]   I don't think Google was nefarious in not disclosing this, but I do think it was dumb
[01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.160]   that they didn't disclose it.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.120]   I'm not clear that it's not nefarious.
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:18.120]   I mean, yeah, you know.
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:19.720]   They do it all the time.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:24.560]   I know we can Google pass after pass after pass because we feel good about Google.
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:26.080]   We like Google.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:30.440]   But at some point, you got to start saying, as people have now done with Facebook, nobody
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:33.240]   gives Facebook a pass anymore.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:39.800]   I think it's such a widespread industry practice, which is why, like, if it was nefarious,
[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.640]   Google is not alone in having these nefarious aims.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:46.240]   TV, as you pointed out, many, many TVs have microphones.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.240]   TVs have it.
[01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:49.240]   And by the way, they're on and used.
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.480]   Yeah, they're on and used.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:55.640]   Your doorbell, your ring doorbell, the old ones used to have a temperature sensor in
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:56.640]   them.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:57.640]   Again, it's not used.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:18:59.560]   You may not know it as a user.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.560]   That's not exposed to you.
[01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:04.240]   Not that I care if they know what temperature it is outside.
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:08.120]   I do care if there's a microphone and something that I don't know about.
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.640]   Yeah, that's called what we call that in the business is a bug.
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:13.640]   Yes.
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.240]   But there are also.
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:23.160]   If the Russians had done it, yes, we would have said some of these other sensors are
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.520]   equally problematic.
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.480]   You just don't know how they're being used today.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:30.720]   So a humidity sensor or a decibel sensor, which are interesting.
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.560]   I grant you all of that.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.760]   My question now is, why do we give Google a pass?
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.880]   What is it about Google that we give them a pass?
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:42.680]   If the Russians had done this, if Facebook had done this, no pass.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.280]   If the TV manufacturers do it, no pass.
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.440]   If my car had a microphone in it, oh, wait a minute, it does.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:53.960]   By the way, as we as you know, because we both own Teslas, you can shout at your car.
[01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:59.120]   There's a bug would you report this back to the factory, which I think is pretty funny.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.240]   I don't know, Jeff, do you?
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.960]   I think we do give Google a pass.
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.680]   Should we keep giving Google a pass?
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:05.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:07.680]   Okay.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:09.680]   If you say so, I'll do it.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:11.680]   That's it.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:12.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:13.680]   Give them a pass because they're nice guys.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.680]   I'm now ruled.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:15.680]   That's it.
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.680]   They're nice.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:17.680]   They're nice guys.
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:19.680]   All guys, but they're nice.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:20.680]   Nice.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.200]   They're nice people.
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:31.680]   Google would never do anything to spy on us.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.080]   They now say that they have a microphone in their Nusgar.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.280]   They changed their specs.
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.280]   That's good.
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.080]   Yeah, because they got caught.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:39.080]   I, yes.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:44.080]   Yes, we put a microphone in your great seal that we put in embassy.
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.840]   Yes, we do that now.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:46.840]   That's for your protection.
[01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:52.680]   It detects a fire alarm going off.
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:56.160]   There are lots of mics in many of your things in your home.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.160]   I know.
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:59.320]   Why does the TV have a mic?
[01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.400]   Oh, that's my favorite.
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:06.920]   So it can hear some signals that are sent to track conversation.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.280]   No, to track what you're watching.
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.760]   You're viewing it.
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:13.360]   It's like, why does it chicken cross the road?
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:15.360]   So it can hear?
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.360]   Is it sure?
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:25.000]   And in fact, they can tell advertisers if you're, you know, they can tell people, oh,
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.040]   they're watching channel four or they can do all sorts of things.
[01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.040]   They have recommendations.
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:35.800]   Interestingly, you can't actually buy a television anymore that doesn't have, that doesn't have
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.520]   some kind of tracking on it.
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.520]   We were.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.520]   Wow.
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:44.280]   I would love to find someone, not everyone owns these yet, but you know, if you guys know
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:49.800]   of a television, I am very curious to find a television that doesn't have a microphone
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.800]   in it.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:51.800]   And so I'm sorry.
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:52.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.800]   I knew a new one.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:55.800]   So, yes.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:22:00.880]   So this is, this is where we're heading, which is why we need to talk about what needs
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:05.400]   to be in these disclosures and have these discussions because, you know, very soon you're
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.760]   not going to be able to buy new, you know, washers and refrigerators without.
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.760]   Microphones.
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:10.760]   Microphones.
[01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.440]   We've got to get to the point.
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.960]   I mean, so come back to your point about competitive advantage, Stacy.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:24.200]   I think that the, that the risk of pissing off your own users and inviting regulation
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:29.240]   is worse than the risk of your competitor finding out that you have a microphone.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:37.760]   And I mean, I wrote this about Facebook, Facebook's culture of opacity is killing it.
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.200]   And they don't really have a competitor.
[01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:43.360]   So they should, they should, I mean, everything that the rule ought to be at Facebook, whatever
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.000]   you're doing, if there were a camera on you and we showed the world you were doing it,
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.640]   you probably stand up and said, yes, I did that because it's a good thing to do.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:50.640]   It's the right thing to do.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:54.800]   Everything they do should, should bear scrutiny of transparency.
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:55.960]   Same for Google.
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.440]   Same for any of the companies.
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:58.800]   More transparency is good.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.640]   The risk is greater on the other end that you're going to get caught like this.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:06.640]   Oh, we've got some people at the microphone and they're going to be, they're going to
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.640]   be freaked out.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:11.600]   They would have been far better to have a little fine print on every device and all
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:14.560]   the geeks come out and look at the specs and say, wow, look at all the sensors.
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.920]   Isn't that cool?
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.440]   And they'd be far better.
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.120]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:22.080]   So no past Leo.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.320]   I took back the pass.
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:26.760]   Retroactively taking away the past.
[01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:29.920]   Because I am deciding who gets a pass.
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:31.800]   Because Leo gave me that power.
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.400]   You're in charge.
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.440]   Google did backtrack on something.
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:42.480]   It only proposed a modification to Chrome that would have blocked ad blockers.
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:46.600]   Now here's another one where I think Google gets a pass from some people.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.600]   They didn't implement it.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:48.760]   They asked for comment.
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:56.360]   They said this would improve performance by eliminating the capability.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:01.960]   In fact, they even had a, you know, well, a ghostry, which would be one of the things
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:07.960]   blocked, carried out a study that found that ad blockers actually pretty much speed up
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.960]   the browser.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:13.680]   They have a sub millisecond impact on network requests, but because they block almost big
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:18.240]   heavy ads and flash and all that stuff, they actually speed up the browser.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:24.720]   So in effect, this modification to Chrome would have slowed things down.
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:32.920]   But it's intended speed up and Google back down.
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:39.600]   Some people, paranoid people, people who do not give Google a pass said, well, really
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:44.360]   the reason they wanted to do this is to break ad blockers.
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:49.840]   But after all, they gave us a chance to comment and now they're backing down.
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:52.440]   Anything to be said about that?
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:54.760]   I think they have the right to block ad blockers.
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:56.840]   Ooh, that's a very good one.
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.040]   I like that.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.640]   Tell me about that.
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:06.760]   Well, I think that that, well, I'll put it differently on a media company.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:10.920]   If the New York Times says you can't come to our site, that's fine.
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:14.360]   If you don't, hey, well, look, the same for Google.
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:19.560]   So I use, and I have started using now in all my systems, the Brave browser, which is
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:21.880]   a Chromium-based browser.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:27.760]   So it's basically identical to Chrome that has a lot of nice features, including a built-in
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.520]   ad blocker, tracking blockers.
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:31.520]   Thief.
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.200]   Yeah, I'm on starting at that site.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.400]   18 ads and trackers were blocked.
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:39.000]   It does HTTPS everywhere, which we all agree is a good thing.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.680]   It blocks fingerprinting methods, and it makes it incredibly easy to switch off because
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:45.760]   this is, they call it shields.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.120]   You can turn the shields up or down.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:50.440]   So if I go to a site that says, I'll go to iMore.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:51.440]   Here's a good example.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.960]   Where does this now?
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:26:01.600]   Our friend Renee Richie's site puts a little sweet big-eyed kitten on there and says, oh,
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.800]   it looks like you're using an ad blocker.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.800]   We use ads to keep our content free.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.800]   Please support us by whitelisting us.
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:15.040]   By the way, if you press continue with ad blocker, it does let you go on.
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.440]   But you know what I'm going to do?
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:21.200]   Because I like iMore, I'm going to shields down on this site.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.360]   I'm going to get all those big fat ads.
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:28.520]   By the way, the page is still loading because there's a lot of ads on that.
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:31.040]   But I want Renee to have a let make a living.
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.360]   I think this is a good choice.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.240]   It also, Brave has something really interesting.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:37.400]   I was going to make this my pick, but I'll do it a little bit earlier.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.560]   A Brave has something really interesting.
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:43.080]   I know you were aware of this because we've talked about this before.
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:51.000]   The ability to send money to Brave payments to sites that you visit.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.800]   You can establish, they use a cryptocurrency or currency, or something called the BAT.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:58.880]   You can put money funds into the account.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:03.240]   I even got a grant from just random grant for BATS.
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:09.680]   And then as you visit sites, if you fund it, those sites will get some money.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:14.480]   I don't know if they, I guess, show only included sites.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:17.640]   So I don't know if you have to participate.
[01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:20.960]   But here's the Washington Post, Instagram and Gadget.
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:22.200]   I kind of like this model.
[01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:23.440]   How about this model, Jeff?
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:28.120]   Instead of reading the ads, I just send them some money.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:33.200]   We just spent the whole whole other third of the show complaining about people not thinking
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.880]   about the stuff they're forwarding on Facebook.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.840]   And you expect people to look for sites they like.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:41.080]   No, not everybody, just me.
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:44.400]   It's this is the micro payments will save us.
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:48.480]   If only people could give a dime over there, a lot of times it'd be okay.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.560]   I have no, I know.
[01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:54.840]   Another reason why this is kind of maybe not going to fly is it requires Bitcoin Ethereum.
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:59.160]   Litecoin or its own BAT coin.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:02.640]   Have you heard of Tony Hale's scroll?
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.840]   You know Tony Hale was the founder of Chartbeat.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:06.840]   Yes.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.760]   And so he started a new company called Scroll.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:11.480]   So he used Chartbeat for a long time as an analytic.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:12.480]   Right.
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.480]   Did they just buy an Uzzled or is that another one?
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.760]   Scroll, scroll, his new company, Scroll, but Nuzzled.
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:19.000]   Scroll, scroll, Jonathan Abrams, Nuzzled.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:20.000]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.000]   Keep it alive.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.000]   It's good news.
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000]   Good.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.000]   Great news.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   I have five Nuzzled subscribers.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.480]   I have email every week about them.
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:33.040]   So Scroll will give you an ad-free experience.
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:37.280]   You'll give money to Scroll and Scroll will divvy that up across the sites.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.760]   And Tony's not saying that he's going to save all the journalism.
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:44.240]   He's just going to say for some portion of people who are irritated by ads and ad-blockers
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:48.000]   don't work very well, you can go to the New York Times or one of their publishers, they
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.240]   have here, they have all the publishers signed up.
[01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:58.360]   Buzzfeed, Box, Atlantic, SB Nation, and you will get a guaranteed full ad-free experience
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.280]   and they will get a share of the money you give.
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:04.920]   And if the ads just really bother you, but you feel guilty about ad-blockers or you don't
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:09.240]   think they're good enough or they're ugly or they're slow, this is an alternative for
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:12.640]   those people, a set size of the market that he's going after.
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:13.640]   Nice.
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.640]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:18.480]   I wish him luck.
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:23.840]   Anyway, I'm using Brave now.
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:28.080]   So now if Google made that change, it would probably happened in Brave.
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:29.080]   Starving journalists.
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:32.040]   Always use ad-blockers.
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.040]   Shame on you.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.360]   You should find a better way to make money.
[01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.560]   Can't block my ads.
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:39.000]   Are we going to go to our sponsor now?
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000]   Yeah, that's a better way, right?
[01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.800]   No, actually I unblock the ad-blockers on sites that I regularly use.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:51.440]   Because yeah, no, I want to pay for those sites.
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:53.440]   Kevin would like you to add about Chromebooks.
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:55.480]   Yes, for instance, perfect example.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:56.480]   Perfect example.
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:57.480]   I mean...
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:59.240]   I was there just today.
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:02.880]   I see the ads because I'm a nice guy.
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.480]   His ads are like AI generated.
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:06.480]   They're fancy ads.
[01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:07.480]   Barely has any ads.
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.880]   So I'm not too upset about that.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:11.680]   Wait, wait, wait for it.
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:15.320]   No, I hate this because about Chromebooks is going to show, oh, you know why I don't
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:16.320]   see any ads?
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:19.080]   I have currently been blocking them.
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.360]   37 ads and trackers blocked.
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.360]   Wow.
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:24.160]   One fingerprinting method blocked.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:26.240]   Does he know about all this?
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:27.240]   Is one network.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.240]   You know what I hate?
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:30.560]   Have you seen these green box ads?
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.560]   No.
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:32.560]   What?
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:35.200]   I don't know if you can see this or not.
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.200]   I see these.
[01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:38.800]   This is all one of your only ads I see.
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.800]   Can you see this?
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:41.280]   No, you can't see it because...
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.880]   Does he know that Xfinity has an ad on this site?
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:46.880]   It's not bad.
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:47.880]   I love you, Kevin.
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:50.120]   Of course, I'm not going to block ads in your site.
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:51.120]   But I'm not going to allow...
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:52.480]   They're actually relevant to your interests, I think.
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.520]   I'm not going to allow you to send me notifications, sorry.
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.520]   That's okay.
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:00.040]   It really bothers me that every site I go to now says, "Lite, let me..."
[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:01.040]   Oh.
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.040]   Oh.
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.040]   You can turn that off in Chrome.
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.040]   Can you?
[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.040]   Yeah.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.680]   Well, sometimes I want them.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:08.680]   Oh, well then...
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:10.520]   You should not turn those off.
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:12.320]   You're sure there's a way to turn that off?
[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:13.320]   I'm pretty sure.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.320]   Hold on.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.320]   Yeah, I just can't say it correctly.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:17.760]   Because there's a way to turn off after the fact.
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.360]   I don't know of a way to turn off.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.560]   Allow block notifications from all site on Chrome.
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:22.560]   Oh, good.
[01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:26.280]   You say, "From turn off notifications, if you Google that, you will get the support
[01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.280]   Google snippet."
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:31.800]   But I don't want to turn off notifications.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:32.800]   That's the wrong thing.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:36.440]   I want to turn off the request to show notifications.
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.440]   Oh, right, right.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:38.440]   That's a different word.
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:39.440]   Yes.
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:42.320]   Because I like notifications because my Google calendar, for instance, does notifications.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.600]   I don't want that to turn off.
[01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:45.120]   I want the New York Times to be notified.
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:48.520]   Some notifications I want to be asked every single time I go to a site.
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:49.520]   I know.
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:52.360]   But you would never, ever want to know the case.
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.360]   Oh.
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:54.360]   Oh.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.360]   Oh, my God.
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:58.840]   Google is going to do a big announcement on March 19th.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:31:59.840]   We're going to stream it.
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:04.800]   If they stream it, we will cover it at the Game Developers Conference.
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:07.120]   What Google Game Developers Conference?
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:14.280]   The theory is it could be the long telegraph, game streaming gaming service from Google.
[01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:17.040]   And that would be very interesting.
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:20.720]   Project stream, a subscription game streaming service.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:24.560]   Microsoft is working on one, not out yet.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:25.560]   Sony has one.
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:29.320]   There are a number of companies that also do this.
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.920]   But Google is a big player.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.720]   If you get my drift, it would be very interesting.
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.960]   So we will cover that March 19th.
[01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:37.960]   1 p.m. Eastern.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:38.960]   What day of the week is that?
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:39.960]   Is that one of our?
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:43.960]   It's probably, I think it's a, is it a, what do we decide?
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.600]   Is that, anyway, huh?
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.000]   Oh, it's two days after St. Patrick's Day.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:51.040]   That's what it is.
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:53.040]   Can you, can you just Google March 19th?
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.040]   Yeah, you can.
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:55.200]   It's a Tuesday.
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.000]   It's Tuesday.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.040]   So we'll be juggling shows on that.
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.040]   That's right.
[01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:04.160]   We'll move iOS today, I think, something like that.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:05.960]   Let's see.
[01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:10.120]   I think it'd be good to do the Google change law.
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.120]   Wow.
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:13.520]   That was a little too fast.
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:16.800]   That was a little, a little too fast.
[01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:20.120]   I always wanted to be Leo.dev.
[01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.760]   And Google's got it.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:24.840]   .dev, the new top level domain.
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:30.920]   As you know, what Google does with these top level domains is they roll them out slowly.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:37.880]   So you can register it, but at great cost in the first days, let's just see if I can
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.920]   get Leo.dev.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:42.880]   And how much it would cost me?
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:46.120]   Oh, look at all of these different registrars.
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.360]   Well, can I use Google for this?
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:49.360]   Google domains.
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.360]   There we go.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:51.360]   Click Google domains.
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:55.960]   Of course, hover would be the one I would choose.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:03.200]   And well, it's only $3,500 plus $360 a year.
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.280]   It's gone down.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.680]   It goes down every day.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:16.280]   It'll continue to go down every day until it gets to the bottom price.
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:19.080]   I didn't mean that to my cart.
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:20.280]   Stop.
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:25.800]   Jane, stop this crazy thing.
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:28.240]   Stop this thing, Jane.
[01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:30.680]   Jane told me to click it again and it went away.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:31.680]   It does go down.
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:35.600]   And I think at the end of the month, it'll only be $360 a year, but I think that's the
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:36.600]   final price.
[01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:39.520]   So it's expensive for Leo.dev.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:42.840]   It is a three letter domain.
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:44.400]   Is that why?
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:46.800]   Those are pretty expensive.
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:50.920]   Or is Google just, I'm going to give them the benefit of that out.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:51.920]   It's not against you.
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.360]   You are not the center of the universe.
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:56.960]   No, no, I'm just going to give them the benefit of that, that they're not price gouging.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.920]   No, it was the same price.
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:01.600]   And you, no, no, I'm not blaming me.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.600]   I'm not saying me.
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:06.840]   And I wasn't going to say that, Carsten.
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.640]   Dope.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.880]   I'm not saying it's because of Leo.dev.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.760]   I'm saying it's all.dev.
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:18.960]   And that the issue is that Google's price gouging, but I'm going to give them the benefit of
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:19.960]   that out.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.960]   How much did they pay for that?
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:22.960]   I don't know.
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:26.080]   A 10 letter domain.
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:28.440]   And it was $3,500.
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.440]   And $12 a year.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:34.680]   Yeah, that's because somebody else had it or something, right?
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:36.680]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:37.920]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:42.680]   I mean, so companies purchased these TLDs.
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:47.200]   Yeah, but you can get it at GoDaddy and GoDaddy is also charging that.
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.200]   The same.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.680]   Yeah, because Google doesn't look.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:55.880]   Something associated with the legal structure, you know, who knows the answer to all of this.
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:57.480]   Who?
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.480]   Your husband.
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.160]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:05.960]   GoDaddy is only charging $479.99 every year for it.
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.960]   479 every year?
[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:13.200]   Oh, Google's higher upfront or possibly lower if it's not interesting.
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:16.000]   Andrew says we don't know how much Google paid for.dev.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.960]   Or does the other applicant he thinks was Amazon, but he would have to check.
[01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.360]   So Google does own.dev.
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.360]   Okay.
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:26.000]   Yeah, I guess it is in the change log.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.040]   Interestingly, GoDaddy, as a little value add, throws in an SSL certificate.
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:36.240]   So actually that price is not so bad because you get an SSL certificate with it.
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:45.280]   Anyway, pre-registration at the normal price, which is probably $360, opens at the end of
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:48.440]   the month, February 28th.
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:50.160]   That developers are going to want this.
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:51.440]   .dev, right?
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:54.720]   That's a great, I think that's great.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:37:00.920]   I think companies trying to attract developers will want that, but that may just be me.
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:06.960]   Like I would put my developer blog on that site or any if you go to Twilio.dev, I would
[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:09.720]   imagine that you would find cool tools.
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:12.520]   Jeff, do you still give Google the benefit of the doubt on Google AMP?
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:13.520]   Well, what?
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:17.040]   No, I'm going to go to AMP, Grant.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:21.120]   I missed that story.
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:22.120]   I could, but I won't.
[01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:25.120]   I'll avoid the AMP, Grant, this week.
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:29.320]   Using AMP to make display ads safer, faster, and better for users.
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:30.520]   Isn't that what you're doing?
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:34.400]   This is what's coming is trying because the problem one AMP publishers complain about
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:38.120]   is the ads don't come fast enough because the advertisers aren't AMP and they're slow.
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:41.320]   So trying to force the advertisers to give you a better experience.
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:43.960]   And it's not just speed.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:47.760]   It's also, I wasn't one page today and the stuff comes down from the top.
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:48.760]   It comes up from the bottom.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:52.360]   It comes in, there was not one line of text on the page.
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:59.800]   It was all invading ads and AMP doesn't allow that crap.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:02.000]   So yes, good for AMP.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.480]   Okay.
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:06.520]   Not the answer you wanted.
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:09.440]   No, I knew what you would say.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:17.080]   Smart, I'm not going to do these stories, fighting disinformation across our products.
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:18.080]   Right.
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:20.800]   So I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:21.800]   How about the content?
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:22.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:23.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.

[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:35.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:36.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:37.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:38.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:52.800]   Is it actually working now?
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:39:11.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:31.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.

[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:06.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:07.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:08.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:09.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:10.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:11.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:12.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:13.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:14.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:15.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:16.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:17.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:18.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:19.800]   I'm going to talk about the content.
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:20.800]   I'm going to give them a pass now.
[01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:21.800]   I'm going to give them a pass now.
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:24.800]   They can sit in the future and use that pass.
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:25.800]   Absolutely.
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:27.800]   I'm going to -- it's like three Hail Marys.
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:28.800]   It's awesome.
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:30.800]   Yeah.
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:36.720]   AR Core 1.7 with new augmented faces API for the front-facing camera that can overlay effects
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:41.800]   on a user's face, even if your camera doesn't have a depth sensor.
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:42.800]   Pretty cool.
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:44.800]   You want to see it in action?
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:45.800]   Ooh.
[01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:46.800]   Look at this.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:48.800]   She's turning herself into a bronze person.
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:50.800]   Ooh.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.800]   Wow.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:52.800]   That's pretty cool.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:54.800]   That's a little creepy.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:58.800]   Well, creepy is as creepy does.
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:01.800]   So, dinosaurs, chests.
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:05.800]   You saw the childish Gambino ads they've been doing, right?
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:06.800]   They're actually pretty cool.
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:09.800]   You get childish Gambino and you have dancing with you and stuff.
[01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:10.800]   It's really cool.
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:11.800]   Ooh.
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:12.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:13.800]   Ooh.
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:14.800]   Hey.
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:15.800]   Google has some pretty good stuff.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:16.800]   I got to admit in there.
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:21.800]   Someone give them a pass.
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:23.800]   What does Facebook have to do to get a pass from you?
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:24.800]   Facebook's never getting a pass.
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:25.800]   He's never getting a pass.
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:26.800]   You're the stories that have happened.
[01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:27.800]   Hey, you're not supposed to play.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:28.800]   I'm using the Brave browser.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:29.800]   Knock it off.
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:31.800]   Maybe I, uh, nope.
[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:33.800]   I'm just supposed to stop all out of it.
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:35.800]   You just use Google everything to be okay.
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:36.800]   Google.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:37.800]   No.
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:41.800]   Google is back on Apple Watch with the app Keep, which is nice.
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:45.800]   You can now take notes or read a shopping list even more importantly on your app.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:50.800]   On your Apple Watch, if you use Google Keep, Google Keep is a very nice app given that
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.800]   it's free.
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:54.800]   I use Google Keep.
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:55.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:59.800]   So you, one of the things I love is a shopping list because you can set it up that when I get,
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:03.800]   you know, when I go to the store, pop up my shopping list and now it'll pop up in your
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:04.800]   Apple Watch, which you've done.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:05.800]   We're pouring Jeff.
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:07.800]   Well, in that case, that's-
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:08.800]   I slept.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:09.800]   I slept.
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:12.800]   Uh, the Google Change log.
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:13.800]   All done.
[01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:17.800]   Oh my gosh, you guys, someone in my house is cooking bacon.
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:18.800]   Bacon.
[01:44:18.800 --> 01:44:19.800]   Bacon.
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:20.800]   Oh, I love bacon.
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:21.800]   It's like that.
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:25.800]   You're like that cartoon right now where your nose just follows it and pulls you across the
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:26.800]   room.
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:27.800]   Bacon.
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:31.800]   Did you see this person does not exist?
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:32.800]   I did.
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.800]   What do you think?
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:37.800]   Um, this person works or fun?
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:39.800]   This person does not exist.
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:40.800]   Oh my God.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:42.800]   The world's falling apart.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:43.800]   What is this show?
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:44.800]   What is this doing?
[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:45.800]   I mean, so what?
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:47.520]   Is this- I don't understand.
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:48.800]   It looks just like a guy I know.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:49.800]   Yeah, it's making up-
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:50.800]   It's not a real person.
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:52.800]   It's just making up people.
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:55.800]   But it looks just like a guy I know.
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:00.120]   People's face features are actually, I mean, like, there's lots of people who look like a
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:01.120]   guy you know, right?
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:02.120]   I know this guy.
[01:45:02.120 --> 01:45:03.120]   No.
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:05.120]   But I guess his name is Dieter.
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.880]   He looks like the guy on the Trevago commercial.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:08.880]   He's speaking of creepy.
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:11.300]   I think that haircut definitely, uh, his name is Dieter.
[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:12.300]   I'll go, go, go, go.
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:14.300]   Oh, what the hell's going on with that?
[01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:15.300]   Come on, dude.
[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:16.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:17.300]   Oh, this is fun.
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:18.300]   You can make fun of him because he's-
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:19.300]   Because it's embarrassing.
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:21.300]   We can make fun of him because he doesn't exist.
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:22.300]   That doesn't exist.
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:24.940]   Okay, let's do another one.
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:26.020]   So what is going on?
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:27.300]   Why am I getting this?
[01:45:27.300 --> 01:45:31.500]   And how long before this technology gets used for porn?
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:34.900]   So this technology has been around a while.
[01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:37.500]   There's a woman named Janelle Shane.
[01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:39.540]   I'm trying to think of the name of her blog.
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:42.620]   She does all these hilarious things with these GAN networks.
[01:45:42.620 --> 01:45:44.620]   She's a research scientist.
[01:45:44.620 --> 01:45:47.340]   Uh, what's wrong with this up here though?
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:49.780]   There's some area there.
[01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:52.700]   Something going on with a hairline.
[01:45:52.700 --> 01:45:54.700]   And by the way, that kid needs braces.
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:46:04.260]   Oh, there's a multi-natural, multicultural child of all races and creeds and colors.
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:06.620]   And he- Oh, she's over at AI weirdness.
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:13.380]   So there's a blog post called GAN Cats where it's GAN networks creating cats that's hilarious.
[01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:14.460]   But she does a lot.
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:17.420]   So what we usually see in the media is good results of this.
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:25.420]   And this is good, but this type of network is usually- or can be horrifying.
[01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:30.420]   GAN stands for generational- I'm sorry, generator of adversarial networks.
[01:46:30.420 --> 01:46:34.420]   So they're working one against the other to come up with-
[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:38.900]   So you get to something that looks right.
[01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:43.100]   What's impressive is, at least on this person does not exist, is they're not doing any editing.
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:44.980]   They're just throwing it up there.
[01:46:44.980 --> 01:46:45.980]   Right.
[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:49.020]   But you're only seeing the good ones.
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:53.420]   Or people are easy to do because we have so many images of them.
[01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:54.420]   Oh, okay.
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:57.500]   But start thinking about GANs for other things.
[01:46:57.500 --> 01:47:01.020]   Are, you know, yesterday Steve Gibson was very upset.
[01:47:01.020 --> 01:47:02.020]   Oh, dear.
[01:47:02.020 --> 01:47:03.980]   That scares me.
[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:05.620]   He was really- He was scared.
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:13.860]   He was very scared over AI.org's technology that they would not release.
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.100]   AI org.
[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:17.100]   What is it?
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:20.660]   Is the Elon Musk funded?
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:22.860]   Is this just Elon doing his- Well, that's what I-
[01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:23.860]   No, no, no, no.
[01:47:23.860 --> 01:47:25.460]   This is- So I wrote about this a lot.
[01:47:25.460 --> 01:47:27.420]   It was created in like in 2015.
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:28.980]   It's Elon and others.
[01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:34.740]   They created this- Basically, the idea was to be able to open up more AI research to
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:35.980]   everyone.
[01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:37.780]   So it was both getting data sets.
[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:45.340]   It was also understanding- But they were very careful about saying safe AI, right?
[01:47:45.340 --> 01:47:48.540]   I don't think they used the word safe at the time.
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:54.820]   They were looking at the ethics of what they were creating and how it could be used.
[01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:58.860]   So they said they made a text generator.
[01:47:58.860 --> 01:48:02.780]   Okay, this is like- Two dangerous to release.
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:08.260]   That's- Okay, both the headline and that is like cherry picking the most scintillating
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:11.300]   bit from what would be a horrifyingly dull story otherwise.
[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:13.900]   But they don't want anybody to know how they do it, right?
[01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:17.180]   They haven't released- They released some of the data set.
[01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:20.420]   They've been reluctant to release more.
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:22.900]   Sometimes they don't know how it's done.
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:27.580]   I mean, depending on the type of AI they're- Depending on the neural network that you're
[01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:32.180]   programming and maybe it's not even a neural network, you don't always know how the computer
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:34.220]   comes up with what it comes up with.
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:35.220]   Right.
[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:36.220]   Right.
[01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:37.220]   Is it possibility?
[01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:38.220]   Yeah.
[01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:39.220]   I saw the story.
[01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:46.020]   I was looking- So- Today, malicious actors, some of which are political in nature- This
[01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:50.580]   is from the article- Have already begun to target shared online comments using things
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:55.900]   like robotic tools, fake accounts, and dedicated teams to troll individuals with hateful commentary
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:49:01.220]   or smears that make them afraid to speak or difficult to be heard or believed.
[01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:07.180]   Their concern is that research into the generation of synthetic images, videos, audio, and text
[01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:13.180]   may further combine to unlock new as yet unanticipated capabilities for these actors.
[01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:17.540]   So due to concerns about large language models being used to generate deceptive, biased,
[01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:23.660]   or abusive languages scale, we're only releasing a much smaller version of GPT-2 along with
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:24.660]   sampling code.
[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:29.060]   We're not releasing the dataset training code or GPT-2 model weights.
[01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:31.740]   Therefore, it'll be misused.
[01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:34.180]   Yeah, I'm okay.
[01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:35.180]   I'm not that afraid.
[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:37.220]   Should I give you a sample?
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:44.500]   Well, I mean- By the way, the way the data they use comes from Reddit, outbound Reddit
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:45.500]   links.
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:49.900]   So if a Reddit link had karma of three or greater, it was presumed, well, this must be a good
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:53.900]   site, which means the machine does particularly well.
[01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:54.900]   I'm not kidding.
[01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:56.340]   This is from the article.
[01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:57.660]   This is from their paper.
[01:49:57.660 --> 01:50:06.420]   Does particularly well on issues that involve Lord of the Rings, Rexit, or Hillary.
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:14.020]   No, who is the singer that- One of these pop singers?
[01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:16.100]   Because of the Reddit connection, I think.
[01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:17.100]   Here's an example.
[01:50:17.100 --> 01:50:18.100]   I'll read you just a little bit.
[01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:19.820]   Steve read this yesterday.
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:24.700]   So the human wrote this prompt, which is a bizarre prompt I might add.
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:31.140]   In a shocking finding, scientists- Do you want to take that?
[01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:33.300]   No, didn't realize that was odd.
[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:36.980]   That's a little passive aggressive, a little microaggression on my part.
[01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:39.940]   Stacey, would you like to take that call?
[01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:41.100]   In a shocking finding.
[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:44.500]   By the way, this is his human written as an ungrammatical human.
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:50.700]   In a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote previously
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:53.300]   unexplored valley in the Andes Mountains.
[01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:57.420]   Even more surprising to the researchers was the fact that the unicorns spoke perfect
[01:50:57.420 --> 01:50:58.420]   English.
[01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:02.580]   Then the machine, after 10 tries, I might add, wrote this.
[01:51:02.580 --> 01:51:09.980]   "The scientist named the population after the distinctive horn of its unicorn.
[01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:15.060]   These four horned silver white unicorns were previously unknown to science.
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:20.340]   Now after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally
[01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:21.340]   solved."
[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:22.340]   Wow.
[01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:27.780]   I would say that the entire text of human life is just a cliche that you can copy.
[01:51:27.780 --> 01:51:28.780]   Yes.
[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:30.780]   That reads my early papers.
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:31.780]   Yeah.
[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:35.820]   The journalism school, my drop into journalism school was astonishing.
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:37.620]   I was like, "Oh, yeah.
[01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:38.620]   500 words?
[01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:39.620]   No problem."
[01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:42.300]   I was like, "Oh, every word has to be a...
[01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:43.300]   Original?
[01:51:43.300 --> 01:51:45.300]   A meaningful factor means what?"
[01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:46.300]   Nice.
[01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:47.300]   That's hard.
[01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:52.740]   Although we should point out that the Washington Post has had a robot writing in sports stories
[01:51:52.740 --> 01:51:54.740]   for several years now.
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:55.740]   Yeah.
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:56.740]   Yeah.
[01:51:56.740 --> 01:51:59.980]   IAP and Reuters have been doing financial stories, weather stories, sports stories.
[01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:01.500]   The Save's effort.
[01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.540]   Text is just a form of data visualization.
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:04.540]   Good.
[01:52:04.540 --> 01:52:05.540]   That's all.
[01:52:05.540 --> 01:52:06.540]   Good.
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:07.540]   See?
[01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:08.540]   There's nothing to fear here.
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:09.540]   Move along, humans.
[01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:12.300]   I give it a pass.
[01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:14.300]   Jeff gives it a pass.
[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:16.940]   Oh, this is a new feature.
[01:52:16.940 --> 01:52:19.620]   This is a new feature on the show.
[01:52:19.620 --> 01:52:21.180]   Pass or no pass?
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:22.660]   Jeff gives it a pass.
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:26.260]   I'm going to say we shouldn't implement this for a variety of reasons.
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:27.260]   It's going to happen anyway.
[01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:29.180]   I don't give you a pass for that.
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:31.020]   You get bottomed.
[01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:33.020]   No pass for you.
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:34.460]   No pass for you.
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:38.980]   Holy shade, trite, unoriginal.
[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:40.980]   No pass for you, Higgin' Buffum.
[01:52:40.980 --> 01:52:41.980]   All right.
[01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:45.580]   There's a couple more quick stories and then we'll get our picks because I know state.
[01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:47.420]   I could feel Stacy craving the case.
[01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:48.420]   So the bacon.
[01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:49.420]   The bacon.
[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:50.420]   Bacon.
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:51.420]   Bacon.
[01:52:51.420 --> 01:52:52.420]   What is the bacon going to be on or in Stacy?
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:53.420]   Do you know what this is?
[01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:54.420]   A surprise?
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:53:00.540]   My guess, the bacon is allocated for a kale and sweet potato and egg dinner.
[01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:03.100]   Oh, it needs bacon, definitely.
[01:53:03.100 --> 01:53:08.820]   Oh, that's not good at all.
[01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:11.980]   But with bacon, maybe.
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:13.460]   Maybe.
[01:53:13.460 --> 01:53:14.860]   Breaking Google news from Axios.
[01:53:14.860 --> 01:53:17.980]   This is Justin from our chat room.
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:18.980]   Thank you.
[01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:19.980]   Thank you.
[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:20.980]   Hell's kitchen NYC.
[01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:24.580]   Oh, no, I don't have the link.
[01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:26.660]   The other side.
[01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:32.340]   Twitter's top policy executive is reorganizing the company's worldwide influence operation
[01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:34.900]   according to an internal email obtained by Axios.
[01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:37.900]   I have no idea what that means.
[01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:40.060]   They're going to lobby better in other places.
[01:53:40.060 --> 01:53:43.460]   Google exec reorganizes policy shop as global threats.
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:46.060]   Yeah, that's a scoop from Axios right there.
[01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:47.060]   Yeah, sure is.
[01:53:47.060 --> 01:53:49.260]   That is inside baseball.
[01:53:49.260 --> 01:53:51.660]   It's a scoop that's just in.
[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:55.500]   To the word shake up, yes, I heard Stacy was whispering that we were going to be in
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:56.500]   the field today.
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:54:01.140]   What does it tell me about because I like Axios or I thought I liked Axios and now everything
[01:54:01.140 --> 01:54:07.300]   is written in this new TLDR executive.
[01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:08.300]   Smart brevity.
[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:09.980]   They've always done that.
[01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:13.020]   That has always been their thing.
[01:54:13.020 --> 01:54:16.500]   So like this story is two sentences.
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:20.740]   But if I want to go deeper, I can get another 206 words.
[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:22.300]   It's like that's go deeper.
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:25.660]   Yeah, it's smart brevity.
[01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:26.660]   Smart brevity.
[01:54:26.660 --> 01:54:27.660]   That's the opposite.
[01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:28.660]   We do the opposite.
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:29.660]   I don't know what it is.
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:30.660]   Don't be sure to.
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:31.660]   We do.
[01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:32.660]   Don't walk.
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:38.900]   We are the headquarters of Don ProNixity.
[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:39.900]   And Pedantree.
[01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:41.900]   And Pedantree.
[01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:45.260]   Okay, so that's just Axios's thing.
[01:54:45.260 --> 01:54:47.860]   I like Mike's briefing in the morning.
[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:49.660]   It's a newsletter written in that fashion.
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:50.660]   The tech one.
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:52.660]   Well, it's our friend.
[01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:54.300]   Oh, I mean, a freed is great.
[01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:56.700]   The free and the media one is also very good.
[01:54:56.700 --> 01:55:00.260]   I'll click the link because I want to read more and it's the same.
[01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:02.420]   Because you know everything you need to know.
[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:03.420]   That's it.
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:04.420]   Oh, is that it?
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:05.420]   It's over.
[01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:06.420]   I don't know.
[01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:07.420]   You're not going to waste your time with background paragraphs.
[01:55:07.420 --> 01:55:08.420]   I feel like there's more I need to know.
[01:55:08.420 --> 01:55:11.220]   And quotes and all this junk is just going to tell you what you need, which I kind of
[01:55:11.220 --> 01:55:12.220]   like.
[01:55:12.220 --> 01:55:13.220]   Really?
[01:55:13.220 --> 01:55:14.900]   You know more than I do.
[01:55:14.900 --> 01:55:19.340]   I feel like I need to know more.
[01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:23.860]   Uber is going to cap the, uh, Sue's, I'm sorry, New York City has capped the number of
[01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:28.620]   ride hail cars and pause the issuances of licenses for 12 months.
[01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:34.700]   Uber, Sue's saying, Hey, there should be as many Uber on the street as the market will
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:35.700]   bear.
[01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:37.940]   Well, you live in New York, Jeff.
[01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:41.980]   I've heard people in New York say the traffic is terrible because of Uber.
[01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:47.740]   Uh, but I also the day, you know, I watched the tourists come in town and tried to hail
[01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:48.740]   a taxi.
[01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:49.740]   That's impossible.
[01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:50.740]   Or club.
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:51.740]   You can't do it.
[01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:52.740]   Yeah.
[01:55:52.740 --> 01:55:54.380]   You got to know what to do.
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:59.820]   You got to have the, the, and plus, I mean, it's still the case to these, this day, if
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:02.660]   you're African American, trying to hail a cab on the street.
[01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:03.660]   Yep.
[01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:04.660]   There you go.
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:06.580]   Uh, racism lives in all kinds of ways.
[01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:10.340]   And so you call the Uber and you can get a ride.
[01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:16.460]   I think it's the market at work until, until they're all put out of work by self-driving
[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:21.140]   Ubers, which will always with, uh, Mike Elgin has said that international travel has become
[01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:26.140]   so much better in Mexico city knowing that you can go over is infinitely better.
[01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:28.740]   You can't get one in Barcelona though, right?
[01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:30.740]   Especially with, is it illegal there?
[01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:32.540]   I believe they shut it down.
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:33.620]   We used car services.
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:35.540]   I think in Barcelona, I can't remember.
[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:36.540]   Oh, car service.
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:38.540]   It's like the days, we're back of the day.
[01:56:38.540 --> 01:56:44.580]   I had a phobia, phobia of phone booths in foreign countries.
[01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:45.580]   Oh my God.
[01:56:45.580 --> 01:56:47.580]   Am I ever going to figure this out?
[01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:48.580]   See with this.
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:50.980]   So that right now you just take your phone and call.
[01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:51.980]   Yeah, you don't have to get in the phone booth.
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:52.980]   Right.
[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:53.980]   Life's easier.
[01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:55.700]   I have to talk to an operator and nothing.
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:57:02.620]   Oh, they're all unemployed, but you cannot copyright the Carlton dance.
[01:57:02.620 --> 01:57:03.860]   The start one of the stars.
[01:57:03.860 --> 01:57:04.860]   What about flossing?
[01:57:04.860 --> 01:57:11.340]   No, can't one of the stars of the fresh Prince Alfonso Rivera was suing Fortnite saying that
[01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:15.500]   that dance I created on a fresh Prince in 1991.
[01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:16.500]   That's mine.
[01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:20.780]   Copyright office says that is not a choreographed routine.
[01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:26.780]   It's just some moves, which by the way, you got from Springsteen and others.
[01:57:26.780 --> 01:57:29.940]   And so you really- So then George Costanza would do.
[01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:30.940]   Yeah.
[01:57:30.940 --> 01:57:31.940]   So it's the Carlton.
[01:57:31.940 --> 01:57:36.820]   So it's the Fortnite is being sued also by some kid who flossed.
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:37.820]   That wasn't just me being random.
[01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:38.820]   Yeah.
[01:57:38.820 --> 01:57:43.860]   So I wonder if that's- No, there's multiple suits against Fortnite because those dance
[01:57:43.860 --> 01:57:46.500]   moves all come from somewhere, right?
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:47.500]   You want to see the Carlton?
[01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:49.060]   Yes, everything comes from somewhere.
[01:57:49.060 --> 01:57:56.300]   Yeah, here's- This is Alfonso Rivera and the kind of- I think the canonical demonstration
[01:57:56.300 --> 01:58:01.860]   of the Carlton.
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:06.660]   You need, by the way, you need a candle to really make this work.
[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:08.660]   It's not unusual.
[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:09.660]   That's it.
[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:11.300]   The Carlton dance.
[01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:18.100]   Now, am I going to get a YouTube takedown by Carlton or Fresh Prince?
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:21.220]   Or by the way, NBC owns this.
[01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:22.060]   Not Carlton.
[01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:26.220]   But he used it when he performed a dance with the stars.
[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:31.260]   That's where the stars- I was going to say maybe he created- maybe the script just said
[01:58:31.260 --> 01:58:32.860]   dance and he created it.
[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:34.860]   Oh, I'm sure that's the case.
[01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:35.860]   Yeah.
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:36.860]   Yeah.
[01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:37.860]   So.
[01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:44.940]   He's a rapper, two Millie, who does some sort of move that's in Fortnite.
[01:58:44.940 --> 01:58:47.740]   But I think this really is the copyright office saying-
[01:58:47.740 --> 01:58:48.740]   No.
[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:52.300]   You can't really- This is- You can't copyright a dance.
[01:58:52.300 --> 01:58:56.940]   You can't copyright a choreographic routine, a ballet, but you can't really- You can't
[01:58:56.940 --> 01:58:57.940]   copyright that.
[01:58:57.940 --> 01:58:58.940]   A move.
[01:58:58.940 --> 01:58:59.940]   A move.
[01:58:59.940 --> 01:59:04.020]   You can't copyright a move.
[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:07.500]   Are we- Do you anything that I missed before we get wrapped this up?
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:08.500]   I think we did everything.
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:11.540]   I want to torture Stacy and keep her away from the bacon as long as we can.
[01:59:11.540 --> 01:59:15.940]   Well, I want to start arguing about something now just to torture Stacy.
[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:20.820]   Why don't y'all argue about something like Chromebooks or weird journalism standards
[01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:22.940]   I don't care about?
[01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:23.940]   Wow.
[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:24.940]   Okay.
[01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:27.260]   The Elon Musk meets PewDiePie.
[01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:28.660]   Now that's a bad thing.
[01:59:28.660 --> 01:59:29.660]   Oh, God.
[01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:30.660]   I don't care about that story.
[01:59:30.660 --> 01:59:34.580]   I even saw that headline multiple times and ignored it.
[01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:38.820]   This is in PewDiePie's battle with the T-series Bombade.
[01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:39.820]   All right.
[01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:44.980]   There's two moguls considering things very quickly.
[01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:45.980]   Yes.
[01:59:45.980 --> 01:59:49.620]   Zuckerberg is considering putting the Facebook login on the blockchain.
[01:59:49.620 --> 01:59:51.460]   What is that even mean?
[01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:53.460]   You told that your job is a train.
[01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:54.460]   I don't know.
[01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:56.580]   What does that even mean?
[01:59:56.580 --> 02:00:02.820]   And then Jack Dorsey is considering a clarification feature, not an editing feature, but a clarification
[02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:04.540]   feature.
[02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:06.700]   We don't know what that means.
[02:00:06.700 --> 02:00:13.020]   Huh, maybe he'll clarify.
[02:00:13.020 --> 02:00:14.020]   How about this?
[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:17.020]   Paul Vixie, Internet pioneer.
[02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:20.380]   Blast Google for how Chromecast behaves on his home network.
[02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:21.900]   This is another Twitter.
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:25.860]   I'm sure another Twitter burst out burst Google.
[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:28.500]   This is bogus as hell.
[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:31.780]   Actually was on the IETF mailing list.
[02:00:31.780 --> 02:00:38.740]   Vixie, who was an Internet Hall of Fame engineer, created DNS, was upset about how Google uses
[02:00:38.740 --> 02:00:41.500]   DNS in its Chromecast Ultra.
[02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:44.700]   No way, Google.
[02:00:44.700 --> 02:00:45.700]   Way.
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:52.300]   Gotta get that data, data, data, data.
[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:53.660]   Hunger is doing things to her.
[02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:54.660]   I can tell.
[02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:55.660]   I love this.
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:58.260]   This is the part of the show we were looking forward to.
[02:00:58.260 --> 02:00:59.260]   Oh, we can.
[02:00:59.260 --> 02:01:01.740]   Well, now I'm hungry.
[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:02.740]   And I have to go to the bathroom.
[02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:05.940]   So at some point in time, I'm just going to be like, we talk about Amazon pulling out
[02:01:05.940 --> 02:01:07.100]   a New York City last week.
[02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:08.100]   No, this is news.
[02:01:08.100 --> 02:01:09.100]   No, we didn't.
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:10.100]   Oh, that's right.
[02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:11.100]   That is news.
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:12.100]   They pulled out.
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:13.100]   Did it happen Wednesday?
[02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:14.100]   Did it happen Wednesday?
[02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.100]   It did happen on for a rough.
[02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:16.100]   Yeah.
[02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:17.100]   Yeah.
[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:18.100]   It happened on Valentine's Day Thursday.
[02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:19.100]   Yeah.
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:20.100]   What do you think?
[02:01:20.100 --> 02:01:21.100]   Is that childish?
[02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:22.100]   They're taking their ball as mayor.
[02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:29.060]   Blazio said, going home or I think the fascinating thing in this is that the amazing AOC proved
[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:31.860]   to be more popular than a mogul and a mayor and a governor.
[02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:32.860]   I like it.
[02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:36.860]   So I would say, I'm sorry, go and Jeff, I didn't really do it.
[02:01:36.860 --> 02:01:38.540]   I was talking to myself.
[02:01:38.540 --> 02:01:46.180]   So I'm going to bring it over to Google because if I look at this, I'm like, eh, you know,
[02:01:46.180 --> 02:01:50.500]   this is probably a good sign for, I guess, transparency.
[02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:53.340]   So being able to say, hey, this is how this deal went down.
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:54.340]   This is what we gave up.
[02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:58.100]   I think that's always important because, you know, we live in a democracy, theoretically.
[02:01:58.100 --> 02:01:59.500]   They should have included the stakeholders.
[02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:00.500]   I completely agree.
[02:02:00.500 --> 02:02:01.500]   Yeah.
[02:02:01.500 --> 02:02:02.500]   Yeah.
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:06.380]   So I think this is going to be interesting because if this becomes a big deal, Google
[02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:08.500]   has sidewalk labs in Toronto.
[02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:10.780]   And I've done an interview with someone on the show about this.
[02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:11.780]   Yes.
[02:02:11.780 --> 02:02:12.780]   It's very controversial.
[02:02:12.780 --> 02:02:18.740]   It's hugely controversial because Google is not, hasn't been a hundred percent clear
[02:02:18.740 --> 02:02:23.620]   in many people's opinions about how it's handling the data, privacy around it, and then
[02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:29.540]   also how it plans to make money and it's starting to look more and more like a government giveaway.
[02:02:29.540 --> 02:02:35.980]   So I would say the next thing we should look at post Amazon picking up its toys and going
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:40.260]   home is what the heck happens with sidewalk labs because that doesn't look as certain
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:41.260]   anymore.
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:42.260]   Yeah.
[02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:46.580]   Well, even the second day lead or there's even there's even unrest in Northern Virginia now
[02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:48.860]   in Arlington, some Arlington city council members.
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:53.580]   So we didn't, this is not, we don't vote for that because that's Amazon HQ to part two.
[02:02:53.580 --> 02:02:54.580]   Is in Northern Virginia.
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:03:01.220]   I've been so pissed about corporate giveaway or sorry, giveaways on, you know, tax revenue
[02:03:01.220 --> 02:03:03.220]   breaks and stuff for this for decades.
[02:03:03.220 --> 02:03:11.300]   I just think that, and I like AOC, but Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez in her tweets implied that
[02:03:11.300 --> 02:03:16.540]   by not having Google there, they would somehow magically get $3 billion to give to more needy.
[02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:19.700]   No, but I think what she was, no, she didn't really say that.
[02:03:19.700 --> 02:03:24.820]   I don't think, I think what she was saying is we shouldn't have to give them a $3 billion
[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:29.460]   break and we should still get the jobs and they should be open with the community.
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:30.460]   And they weren't.
[02:03:30.460 --> 02:03:36.340]   So, so, so now a conservative front group has put up a billboard on Times Square complaining
[02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:41.500]   about AOC and it's just, it's just a company that tries to fight for companies.
[02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:46.460]   And the more she does, the more she, the more she pisses off the right, the bigger they
[02:03:46.460 --> 02:03:47.460]   make her.
[02:03:47.460 --> 02:03:50.140]   And I'm just amazed by her.
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:51.940]   Yes, she does social spending.
[02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:52.940]   I'm looking at seven nominal tweets.
[02:03:52.940 --> 02:03:56.980]   She does understand that half a half a billion was capital grants, two and a half billion
[02:03:56.980 --> 02:03:57.980]   was tax breaks.
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:03:59.700]   So, yeah, she clearly,
[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:03.300]   Meanwhile, Google quietly when I put this in somewhere, the run up Google quietly went
[02:04:03.300 --> 02:04:11.100]   and used more normally made up companies to negotiate and get tax deals across the country.
[02:04:11.100 --> 02:04:17.660]   So, I mean, the idiocy here is that is that low, if global governments got together and
[02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:20.780]   had a meeting and said, let's say, let's all just stop this.
[02:04:20.780 --> 02:04:25.340]   They'd all have more money, but instead there's a competition for that and they fight each
[02:04:25.340 --> 02:04:26.340]   other down.
[02:04:26.340 --> 02:04:30.700]   It's just like the double, double Dutch sandwich with an Irish twist.
[02:04:30.700 --> 02:04:33.300]   If all the countries would agree to stop that stuff, they'd all have more money from
[02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:34.300]   these platforms.
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:43.140]   Meanwhile, Amazon pays on its $11.2 billion in revenue in 2018.
[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:44.140]   How much tax?
[02:04:44.140 --> 02:04:48.180]   Oh, nothing.
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:51.020]   That's legal, by the way, but yeah, yeah, it is.
[02:04:51.020 --> 02:04:52.460]   Talk about tax grants.
[02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:56.940]   And I saw a graph, another thing that I, by the way, AOC tweets a lot.
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:04:58.700]   I'm still going through.
[02:04:58.700 --> 02:04:59.700]   I know.
[02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:00.700]   Wow, does she do it?
[02:05:00.700 --> 02:05:04.740]   So I also saw a graph that shows job growth in New York City is through the roof.
[02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:07.300]   There isn't a lack of jobs in New York City.
[02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:09.100]   No, and Amazon is still going to be here.
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:11.100]   Google's getting jobs like crazy.
[02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:14.180]   They're buying a property like mad.
[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:15.180]   Okay.
[02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:16.180]   Yeah.
[02:05:16.180 --> 02:05:19.180]   Anything else?
[02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:20.180]   Nope.
[02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:25.020]   Unless we have virtual bacon.
[02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:27.020]   Oh, I wish.
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:30.660]   Stacey has her pick of the week.
[02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:35.020]   Just in time for those of you moving out.
[02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:38.900]   So I was going to do my house listing, but it's now under contract.
[02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:40.060]   So congratulations.
[02:05:40.060 --> 02:05:41.060]   Congratulations.
[02:05:41.060 --> 02:05:43.860]   That was super fast.
[02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:44.860]   It was.
[02:05:44.860 --> 02:05:48.180]   It's been, it took, we're not even actually on the market.
[02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:50.140]   So it took three days of.
[02:05:50.140 --> 02:05:51.140]   So you got to ask him?
[02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:52.940]   Did you get over asking him?
[02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:53.940]   There was a little bit more.
[02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:54.940]   It was very exciting.
[02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:57.260]   But I could all fall through.
[02:05:57.260 --> 02:05:58.260]   So we'll see.
[02:05:58.260 --> 02:05:59.260]   Well, not good.
[02:05:59.260 --> 02:06:00.260]   Not good word for you, Stacey.
[02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:01.260]   Thank you.
[02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:05.900]   So instead of my home listing, which was going to be it, I'm going to do my checklist.
[02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:07.180]   And I may have done this before.
[02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:08.180]   So I'm sorry if I have.
[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:09.180]   No, no, you haven't.
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:10.900]   But hold on just a moment.
[02:06:10.900 --> 02:06:11.900]   Oh, sorry.
[02:06:11.900 --> 02:06:12.900]   I forgot the last step.
[02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:13.900]   Right.
[02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:14.900]   We forgot.
[02:06:14.900 --> 02:06:15.900]   We forgot.
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:18.700]   You can skip this if you want, but I wouldn't if I were you.
[02:06:18.700 --> 02:06:23.300]   That was one heck of a tease.
[02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:28.140]   And I have something, I have a couple of things I want to talk about for a change.
[02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:30.460]   Before I do that, I want to talk about do.co.
[02:06:30.460 --> 02:06:37.580]   I'm talking digital ocean, which is kind of the most amazing technology empowering
[02:06:37.580 --> 02:06:41.500]   developers and hobbyists like myself.
[02:06:41.500 --> 02:06:49.380]   Big companies, digital ocean makes it really easy to set up a production server, production
[02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:52.340]   applications with just a click of the mouse.
[02:06:52.340 --> 02:06:58.260]   And under a minute, you get a scalable compute platform with that on storage security and
[02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:00.100]   monitoring capabilities.
[02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:03.220]   You can go from one virtual machine to 10,000.
[02:07:03.220 --> 02:07:05.620]   You can have standard or CPU is optimized.
[02:07:05.620 --> 02:07:07.940]   They call them droplets.
[02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:10.380]   And they're all based on enterprise great SSDs.
[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:16.020]   And they're so fast that once you pick the application or you can do Docker or Kubernetes
[02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:20.400]   or any of a number of operating systems, let's you pick what you want that provisioning
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:24.880]   to be, it provisions it in 55 seconds or less.
[02:07:24.880 --> 02:07:29.700]   Get your node JS app up, get your WordPress instance, they can go on and on.
[02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:31.980]   It is really, really cool.
[02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:36.740]   And what this is, it really does is it empowers people who have great ideas.
[02:07:36.740 --> 02:07:40.020]   Imagine if you were an inventor and you just had a machine, you'd push a button that would
[02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:42.180]   spit out whatever it is you thought of.
[02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:44.380]   That's kind of what digital ocean is.
[02:07:44.380 --> 02:07:46.660]   Push button and you've got a server.
[02:07:46.660 --> 02:07:55.160]   With 99.99% uptime SLA, you got cloud firewalls, full DNS management, 12 global data centers,

[02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:09.400]   and deliver industry leading price performance.
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:15.800]   This really is one of those things that has become made at revolutionary.
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:23.400]   I mean, it's so easy now to create a digital app, a web site, it's incredible.

[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:52.080]   Now, Stacy, what were you talking about?
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:54.360]   A checklist of some kind.
[02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:56.400]   Yes.
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:59.200]   This is a checklist for when you leave your smart home.
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:00.200]   It's an oldie.
[02:09:00.200 --> 02:09:01.200]   Goodie.
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:02.200]   What?
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:06.200]   When you leave leaving a smart home, make sure you do these things.
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:07.200]   Yeah.
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:11.040]   So this is a list of how you handle things when you're about to move.
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:12.960]   Oh, this is clever.
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:16.200]   So this is prior to occupancy or closing.
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:19.760]   I don't know any of this stuff.
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:20.760]   Wow.
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:21.760]   Wow.
[02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:22.760]   Yeah.
[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:24.760]   So this is--
[02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:28.200]   And are you doing an honor for the new owners?
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:34.640]   Some of the most of mine instead is-- it's a little bit longer.
[02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:41.040]   But yeah, I won't submit changes of ownership and contact information to device manufacturers.
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:43.760]   I'm just going to deauthorize my access.
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:44.760]   But then figure it out.
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:48.840]   Which does include-- so you have to erase everything in your own account.
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:49.840]   Right.
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:55.480]   And you're best off doing it also, delinking everything from Nest and your Amazon Echo
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:57.760]   accounts as well.
[02:09:57.760 --> 02:10:01.480]   This has gotten much more complicated than it used to be moving.
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:07.280]   It used to have to turn off the power, the gas, the water, and say, "See ya."
[02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:08.600]   Wow.
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:14.520]   And some of this, I will not-- I have to bring-- well, I actually have my own modem and I
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:15.520]   have my own router.
[02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:18.600]   So I don't have to worry about that.
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:20.960]   But it's a lot.
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:21.960]   Yeah.
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:25.720]   You can get a copy of this at OT-- actually, OT Alliance.
[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:26.720]   OT Alliance.
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:27.720]   Yeah.
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:28.720]   It's an online trust alliance.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:32.000]   And they did it with the National Association of Realtors.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.280]   OT Alliance.org/SmartHome.
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:37.280]   What a good tip.
[02:10:37.280 --> 02:10:39.440]   So congratulations.
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:41.480]   You snuck that one in, you buried the lead.
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:42.480]   You sold your house already.
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:44.680]   Well, I haven't sold it yet.
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:46.480]   That's under contract, Leo.
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:47.480]   Oh, I see.
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:48.480]   Right.
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:49.480]   Okay.
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:50.480]   I will stop.
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:51.480]   I'll knock one again.
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:52.480]   Oh, no, no, no.
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:55.080]   It's just, you know, if they got across the T's and thought the I's, it's not a big deal.
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:56.080]   Yeah, but it'll take--
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:57.080]   Don't jinx her.
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:00.680]   And you got somebody who was willing to say, "Okay, we won't take occupancy for a few
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:01.680]   months."
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:03.000]   Well, I'll be moving.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:07.040]   If this all goes according to plan, I'll be moving in the middle of April to another
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:08.040]   place in Austin.
[02:11:08.040 --> 02:11:09.040]   And then--
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:11.240]   That's school finishes, I'd say.
[02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:12.240]   Till school finishes, yeah.
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:13.240]   Oh, God.
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:14.240]   So you're going to move to place?
[02:11:14.240 --> 02:11:15.240]   I'm trying to place.
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:18.520]   We're probably going to do like an Airbnb or something like that.
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:21.680]   Okay, so you'll send everything in a container and then you'll just--
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:24.040]   Yeah, we're going to do a probably a container.
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:25.040]   Yeah.
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:26.040]   Somebody's--
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:27.040]   Yeah.
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:28.040]   Because it's really only like six weeks.
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:29.040]   So--
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:30.040]   That's good.
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:31.040]   I'm so happy for you.
[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:32.040]   Me too.
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:36.040]   That's the, you know, buying and selling is such a pain.
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:37.040]   It's a pain purchase.
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:38.040]   Yeah.
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:41.200]   Jeff Jarvis has a number for us.
[02:11:41.200 --> 02:11:42.760]   So we can do the numbers here.
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:47.280]   So Axios previously mentioned, has a very brief post because everything is.
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:54.160]   Instagram as an engagement powerhouse using data from CrowdTangle, which is owned by Facebook.
[02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:58.040]   Top 10 accounts on three platforms by number of interactions.
[02:11:58.040 --> 02:12:09.240]   So the top account on Twitter, guess who?
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:11.760]   And with the chief, 103.9 million interactions.
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:12.760]   Yeah, but look how close Ariana Grande is and how far everybody else behind is Ariana Grande.
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:13.760]   Ariana Grande for president?
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:14.760]   I'm fine with that.
[02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:15.760]   She's huge.
[02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:16.760]   Compare.
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:19.560]   I mean, she's twice the next biggest war is AOC.
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:21.560]   Do it really well.
[02:12:21.560 --> 02:12:25.120]   36.9 million interactions.
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:26.840]   What is the period of that a week?
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:27.840]   Oh, I should know that.
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:28.840]   Well, there wasn't.
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:29.840]   I should have known that.
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:30.840]   Sorry.
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:34.000]   Between November 17th and February 17th.
[02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000]   So long.
[02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.360]   Actually, AOC is going to get probably higher.
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:38.360]   Go up here.
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:39.360]   Yeah.
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:40.360]   Huge.
[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:45.560]   So then Facebook, lad Bible is number one with a comparable 121 million versus Trump's 103
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:46.560]   million.
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:47.560]   What's lad Bible?
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:49.000]   It's what it sounds like.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.360]   It's a publication for, for.
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:53.000]   It's maximum on the internet.
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:54.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:55.560]   Thank you.
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:56.800]   Oh, it's for boys.
[02:12:56.800 --> 02:12:59.400]   So more than you, but more than you have more.
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:01.400]   No, than who still act like boys.
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:04.240]   It's for people who read the articles.
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:07.840]   Well, it's not just, it's not just porn.
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:16.320]   It's, or not, sorry, soft porn or it's hot, hot women, muscle tips and just, yeah.
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:18.520]   It's shallow males.
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:20.920]   And then what's Sifras, the number two?
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:21.920]   I don't know.
[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:26.760]   By the way, lad Bible has more engagement on Facebook than the president has on Twitter.
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:33.400]   Which is interesting on Instagram though, when these numbers dwarf the other two platforms.
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:34.600]   That's the point we got to.
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:35.600]   Holy cow.
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:36.600]   So nine.
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:37.600]   Yeah.
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:38.600]   What are we looking at?
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:39.600]   We're looking at a Brazilian search result.
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:40.600]   Okay.
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:41.600]   Get back to this.
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:42.600]   Yes.
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:43.600]   812 million interacting.
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:44.600]   What's nine?
[02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:45.600]   Yeah.
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:46.600]   I don't know.
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:49.400]   On any of these three platforms, I can't look them up.
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:52.040]   It's a reddish reddish thing.
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:53.040]   Go fund the world.
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:54.040]   Go from the world.
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:55.720]   That sounds bad.
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:56.720]   Kylie.
[02:13:56.720 --> 02:13:59.600]   433 then Arianda Grande.
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:05.240]   NBA, Cristiano Ronaldo, NFL, the rock.
[02:14:05.240 --> 02:14:08.600]   Kim Kardashian finally showing up in ninth place.
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:10.560]   Oh, Kylie's on there.
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:12.040]   Oh, that's who Kylie is.
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:14.040]   Oh, you don't even have to do a last name.
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:15.040]   Just Kylie.
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:16.720]   Oh, for crying out loud.
[02:14:16.720 --> 02:14:18.640]   What's the deal with her?
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:20.640]   Is lip pumping that important?
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:21.640]   Oh, I know who she is.
[02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:22.640]   She's the younger sister.
[02:14:22.640 --> 02:14:24.080]   She's the cool Kardashian.
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:26.160]   She's the Gen Z.
[02:14:26.160 --> 02:14:29.720]   All this doesn't make me sad for humanity, frankly.
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:32.120]   Oh, Matt Gio's on there.
[02:14:32.120 --> 02:14:34.200]   Yeah, it's true.
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:36.320]   I don't know who a lot of these people are.
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:37.320]   I don't know.
[02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:38.320]   I don't know.
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:40.640]   How about Harris is number 10 on Twitter already?
[02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:41.640]   Interesting.
[02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:43.400]   Do you think that that's in Yee?
[02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:45.200]   Is Yee Kanye?
[02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:46.200]   Yes.
[02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:47.200]   Okay.
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:48.680]   Pretty soon it'll just be Y.
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:53.320]   It's the good thing we have Stacy on the show so she can tell them these things.
[02:14:53.320 --> 02:14:59.520]   Do you think though that that is an indicator of genuine?
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:00.520]   I think Twitter not.
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:01.720]   Twitter is kind of its own.
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:03.120]   Well, so it was interesting.
[02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:06.640]   I think I actually also did another look at the candidates.
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:14.880]   And Kamala Harris and Full Disclosure as I have a Kamala hat was number one, except
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:18.240]   on Facebook where Bernie is number one.
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:19.640]   This is before he announced.
[02:15:19.640 --> 02:15:28.920]   And Bernie, I did a story post in 2016 about occupied Democrats and they got 100 to 300
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:32.000]   million impressions a week from Facebook memes.
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.680]   And they kind of made Bernie.
[02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:38.320]   Bernie stayed very strong in that meme world of Facebook ever since.
[02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:42.280]   Not on Twitter, not on Instagram, but on Facebook.
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:47.080]   And that's how he got to raise $6 million in a day.
[02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:51.000]   My pick of the week is kind of disappointing, frankly.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:55.000]   The FDA says buying young people's blood won't keep you from aging.
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.640]   Can I get a refund?
[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:02.440]   Apparently, this is a thing.
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:03.760]   Oh, yeah.
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:05.440]   People are looking for a chilli canal.
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:06.640]   Peter Tiel did it.
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:09.520]   That's why it's like a quote unquote text story.
[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:11.920]   Oh, because we're some bright here.
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:13.280]   Actually, this is really Karsten's pick.
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:16.800]   I knew nothing about it, but I had to mention it.
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:21.520]   My pick is something actually I don't know anything about, but I want to ask you about
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:29.880]   Jeff, which is a news site called Credder, C-R-E-D-D-E-R dot C-O.
[02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:36.520]   And the idea is to rate news sources on credibility.
[02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:37.520]   And I think that's kind of an...
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:38.520]   What's a new one?
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:40.760]   Yeah, I just want you to take a look at it.
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:46.120]   The reason it comes up, it's a guy in Petaluma has set it up and I know his dad and he contacted
[02:16:46.120 --> 02:16:47.120]   me.
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:51.120]   I think it's a very interesting idea.
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:54.080]   I don't know how they rate the credibility.
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:56.080]   That's the key.
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:57.080]   That's the key.
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:58.080]   Is there an about?
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:16:59.080]   Yes, there is.
[02:16:59.080 --> 02:17:00.080]   Yeah, which is blank.
[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:01.080]   Oh, geez.
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:02.080]   Maybe it's so new that...
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:03.080]   404.
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:04.080]   Yeah, 404.
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:14.720]   But top outlets, they have a leaderboard on outlets and that's interesting.
[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:16.960]   I just thought this would be an interesting thing.
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:17.960]   I'll dig into it.
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:18.960]   Have an introduction.
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:19.960]   Introduce me if you want.
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:20.960]   I shall.
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:21.960]   I shall.
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:27.440]   He also does the podcast for the...
[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:28.440]   Oh, gosh.
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:30.080]   Now I forgot the name of it.
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:35.560]   It's the one where the un-covered, the stories that are under-covered each year, they do
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:38.480]   that list of stories that were missed.
[02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:41.680]   So I think he's kind of in this space.
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:42.720]   Anyway.
[02:17:42.720 --> 02:17:48.520]   And then finally I want to mention somebody none of you care one wit about.
[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:50.640]   But I'm kind of sad about this.
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:59.520]   This week, one of the legends of voiceover passed away, Ken Nordine at the age of 98.
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:02.280]   I bet you don't know his name, do you?
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:03.840]   He's very famous for word jazz.
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:06.480]   In fact, you could find fortunately a lot of his stuff.
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:10.960]   He sold these as records, but you could find a lot of his stuff on...
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:11.960]   Don't you know.
[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:18.160]   He's got an amazing voice on YouTube if you look for Ken Nordine.
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:19.320]   98 years old.
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:25.080]   He also begins this tale of a lot.
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:27.400]   He's got an amazing voice, but more than that...
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:28.720]   He's like, "Tom, wait a minute.
[02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:29.720]   Christopher Walken."
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:31.880]   Yeah, he was a beat pick.
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:36.320]   And he was reading poetry in a jazz club in the mid-60s and they ran out of poetry and
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:37.320]   they said...
[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:38.600]   And he just started riffing...
[02:18:38.600 --> 02:18:42.040]   And invented something called word jazz.
[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:44.960]   And so he searched both by the one.
[02:18:44.960 --> 02:18:46.960]   It's like that AI algorithm.
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:47.960]   It's in the country.
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:51.640]   This is like something I would make up as a thing that isn't really a thing that happens
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:53.040]   to be a thing.
[02:18:53.040 --> 02:18:55.080]   I think he did a little bit of LSD.
[02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:56.080]   I'm just guessing.
[02:18:56.080 --> 02:18:57.080]   Do you take this?
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:18:58.080]   I do.
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:18:59.080]   I do.
[02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:02.160]   But I love his voice and he's legendary in the business.
[02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:07.120]   So we're sorry to lose him, but Ken Nordine passed away last week.
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:12.240]   At a ripe old age, I might add, of 98.
[02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:19.240]   But if it's just an excuse to get people to look for stuff and find it, Ken Nordine,
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:25.800]   I know R-D-I-N-E-S, Chicagoan through and through.
[02:19:25.800 --> 02:19:27.680]   All right, I think we're done.
[02:19:27.680 --> 02:19:28.680]   Go get some food.
[02:19:28.680 --> 02:19:29.680]   Bacon.
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:30.680]   Bacon.
[02:19:30.680 --> 02:19:32.960]   Bacon kale sweet potatoes and marshmallows.
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:34.960]   Sounds fantastic.
[02:19:34.960 --> 02:19:40.440]   Egg, egg, marshmallows.
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:41.440]   Egg.
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:43.560]   And I thank you for being here.

[02:20:41.160 --> 02:20:44.240]   It's our once a year attempt to get to know you better.
[02:20:44.240 --> 02:20:47.360]   Not you personally, but an aggregate get to know our audience better.

[02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:52.560]   If you want to take the survey, let us know what you like.
[02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:54.360]   Don't like what you'd like to see more of.
[02:20:54.360 --> 02:20:55.360]   Twit.
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:57.720]   You get plenty of personal information, not a me on a re-show.
[02:20:57.720 --> 02:20:58.720]   I know.
[02:20:58.720 --> 02:20:59.720]   Twit.
[02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:02.160]   But I'm not writing it down, Jeff, and I have no memory.
[02:21:02.160 --> 02:21:03.160]   So you're okay.

[02:21:16.520 --> 02:21:17.520]   Whatever it is.
[02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:23.440]   I'll open your shakes out to the same.
[02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:25.440]   What a voice.
