[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.280]   and Twitter.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.400]   Jeff Jarvis is here, Professor of Journalism, City University
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.120]   of New York, CUNY, plus Jeff Jarvis on the plus buzz machine.com
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.280]   on the blog.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.320]   But the good news, the really good news coming up.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.240]   Yeah, it was kind of a bad news, good news day.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.840]   Daily show, we're losing--
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.760]   what's his name, John?
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.640]   But I'm that guy.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.280]   Yeah, that guy.
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.080]   I've forgotten his name already.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.600]   Do you remember the name of the guy who preceded him
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.880]   on The Daily Show?
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.720]   Killborn.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.520]   Craig Killborn.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.160]   Right.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.000]   But we are-- what we lost on The Daily Show,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.680]   we gain for one brief shining moment.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.840]   Gina Travani is here.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.880]   [SINGING]
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.880]   Hello.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.280]   How's things going?
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.480]   Things are good.
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.880]   Things are good.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.760]   I miss you guys.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.280]   You miss you terribly.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.000]   How are things that think up?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.640]   Good.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.000]   Good.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.640]   Things are good.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.200]   We got some press this week.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.440]   Fast Company included us and our-- their top 10 most
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.960]   innovated companies.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.480]   Wow.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.840]   Social media.
[00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.840]   So that was nice.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.560]   Yeah, and just been hacking and through the night,
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   getting shipping a lot of code.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.800]   And things are going well.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.600]   But I do miss you guys a lot.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.560]   And in fact, I've been far away from Google News.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.000]   It's been fun going through the rundown.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.160]   A lot going on, it seems like.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.080]   Yeah, there always is.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   Why is there-- why do you still have to write code?
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.720]   Isn't think up done?
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.080]   Our current issue is that Amazon payments
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.920]   decided to sunset the payments product that we use.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:02.920]   Oh, no.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.280]   And that Kickstarter used.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.920]   So at some point--
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.240]   I think it's June 1st, we stopped
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.200]   being able to collect payments from our subscribers,
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.320]   which, you know, affects our business slightly.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.400]   But Kickstarter moved over to Stripe.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.560]   And we've been evaluating different options.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.120]   And we're actually moving to Amazon's new product,
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.720]   which they pitched us on.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.840]   So I've been deep in the thick of writing billing code,
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.680]   which is the worst kind of code to write.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.680]   I so much more enjoy product development.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.240]   Thanks, Amazon.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.400]   Yeah, thanks Amazon.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.840]   Well, it's one of those risks--
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.120]   we've talked about this on the show
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.560]   about depending on a particular API or a particular product
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.560]   that's not your own, right?
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.840]   But it was interesting to me that Kickstarter moved over
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.600]   to Stripe, because even Kickstarter
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.320]   doesn't want to store credit cards.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.920]   You know, even a company's biggest Kickstarter,
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.480]   you know, they've been hacked in the past.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.240]   They do not want to be responsible for storing credit cards.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.800]   So yeah, so that's kind of interesting.
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.000]   Yep.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.920]   And some good insights.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.520]   Look at this one.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.720]   Eight days without a picture.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.360]   I haven't posted a photo on my Twitter.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.360]   Actually, this is Facebook.
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.280]   On my Facebook stream in eight days.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.680]   So it would be a good idea to find something to share.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.280]   I had one more tweet this week than last week.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.120]   13 tweets.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.960]   I'm pretty consistent anyway.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.400]   You can see what your most popular tweet was.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.200]   You know, it's really fun as going back four years.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.960]   My most popular tweet was when I was in Argentina
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.240]   about to go to Antarctica.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.200]   You know, what's really sad is that I've unfortunately
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.920]   posted some of my images on Pick, Please,
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.600]   which has since gone out of business.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.400]   So this is a picture of Wozniak and others finding out
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.560]   we don't get to go to Antarctica.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.320]   It was a great picture gone forever.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.520]   Ah, that's a bummer.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.160]   So that's really frustrating when stuff was--
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.480]   but that I guess is the way of the web.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.040]   We just kind of assume that everything where we're
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.600]   staring at pictures is going to go on forever.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.360]   Fortunately, now I store all my images on Google+.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.800]   I figure Google will be around, but also on Microsoft's One
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.600]   Drive and Dropbox.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.960]   I figure out if the three, somebody's going to stick.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.760]   It's going to stick around.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.640]   I'm just going to stick somewhere.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:09.880]   One of them.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.440]   One of them.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.720]   33% of my tweets said, I mean mine.
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.400]   That's good.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.160]   That's improvement.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.200]   It's only a third.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.600]   Man, I came in somewhere close to 70 this last time.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.280]   Ooh, that's a great--
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.040]   That's harsh.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.520]   I need to back away from myself.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.960]   Biggest time for tweeting.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.840]   Biggest response, 3 and 4 PM.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.560]   That makes sense.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.640]   That's good.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.640]   And so late afternoon tweets are good for me.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.360]   Oh crap.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.280]   I like the--
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.440]   Oh, what's better?
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.560]   I said the word great more than any other word
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.920]   on Twitter this week.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:39.760]   Last week--
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.240]   That's the last week.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.960]   Help.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.440]   Help.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.360]   Help.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.040]   Very positive.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.400]   I like that.
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.000]   Somebody once told me-- I think it was a 12-step program
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.560]   that there are only two prayers.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.920]   Help me, help me, help me.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.240]   Thank you.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.600]   Thank you.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.600]   Thank you.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.160]   Great.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.480]   It's close.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.680]   Well--
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.240]   Thank you, everybody, for coming back and doing it.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.920]   Guess what?
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.920]   This is the 10th anniversary of Google Maps
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.760]   was February 8, 2004, the launch of Google Maps.
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.720]   And it's fun to look.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.160]   But this is what it looked like when it launched
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.880]   in the original early days of--
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.480]   the web looked so crappy, those--
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.640]   we didn't know though, did we?
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.280]   No.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.520]   So crazy.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.680]   That just doesn't feel like it was that long ago.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:27.680]   Look at the underlined links.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.440]   Look at-- yeah, look at those blue links.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.680]   Just look at those blue links.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.400]   And then they turned to purple when you click on them, right?
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.520]   Yeah, and that's like browser default now, right?
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.800]   That's like zero CSS, zero styling.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:38.280]   That's like--
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.400]   This is what it would look like if they had no styling.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:43.800]   Wow.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.760]   You know, Google Maps, it's so funny at the time
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.680]   when they launched it, it was very much like Google Search,
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.400]   where it was just kind of like MapQuest.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.280]   It works.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.780]   Right.
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.600]   What do we need another search tool for?
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.080]   What do we need another search tool for?
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.920]   What do we need another web-based email product for?
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.280]   Right?
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.240]   But it was one of those things that Google just
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.920]   knocked out of the park.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.920]   And fun fact, Google Maps was started by the brother team,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.200]   Lars--
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.120]   Rasmussen.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.620]   Rasmussen.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.200]   And right, who went on to do Wave.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.280]   And then went on to Facebook, right?
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.640]   And then went on to--
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.000]   Is it Lars like CTO or something?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.680]   He is.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.960]   Yeah, he's got an important title at Facebook.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.840]   Now, yeah.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.640]   But wow, man, Google Maps.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.880]   And Google Maps was one of the first applications
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.600]   to usher in sort of the super dynamic JavaScript-based web
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.880]   apps.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.960]   Right, and that was before Gmail.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.800]   There he is.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.720]   Lars, what I'm saying is so--
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.360]   He's at Facebook now.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.080]   I don't know what his title is.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.000]   10 years ago-- boy, that's a fast 10 years.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.120]   By the way, interestingly enough,
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.600]   our 10th anniversary for this week in tech is in April.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.880]   Wow.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.200]   I want to get-- if you're a designer and you watch the shows
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.480]   and you'd like to help us out, go to our website,
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.080]   twitch.tv.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.120]   Look at the logo.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.800]   I'd love to modify that in some way,
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.440]   so it says 10 years or something.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.960]   Yeah, like that.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.800]   In fact, if you want to just email Leo@leoville.com
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.280]   and I'll send you the Adobe Illustrator versions of them,
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.720]   then you can play with it.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.160]   Because I'd love to-- I don't know, around.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.040]   I was thinking one of those curly banners
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.960]   with little birds carrying it.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.280]   Or maybe just a party hat on top of--
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.600]   Party hat.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.360]   10 years of Twitter.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.360]   Don't do it.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.360]   Don't do it.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.280]   Our 10th anniversary Twitter, which will be in April this year.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   Wow.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.560]   That's incredible, Leo.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.800]   That's incredible longevity.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.080]   For a podcast network, yes.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.600]   Well, I mean, I think for any kind of web--
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.120]   What company?
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.600]   --company.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.400]   But yeah, for any kind of startup, a web-based company,
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.320]   I think it's huge.
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.240]   Now, remember when Gawker turned 10,
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.320]   I was talking to Nick about it.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.600]   And he was like, god, I feel just old.
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.640]   You see these little companies getting snapped up
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.480]   within a year.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.160]   And I just feel like, you know, or this old company
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.280]   kind of plotting along, even though Gawker is not that at all.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.120]   But I actually really respect and aspire
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.440]   to be one of the companies that sticks around for 10 years.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.600]   Gosh, I hope to think up makes it to 10 years.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.440]   That would be amazing.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.400]   How old is ThinkUp now?
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.080]   Well, we've had a couple of different forms.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.640]   But if you go from the day we established the LLC,
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.640]   that was like July of 2013, I want to say.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.520]   So yeah, so it'll be two years in July.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.560]   Did you write--
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.680]   Did you write ThinkUp yourself first, right?
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.280]   It was called Twittelitic.
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.680]   It was like a weekend project.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.000]   I bought the O'Reilly Hacking the Twitter API book
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.800]   and spent like a weekend.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.280]   And literally, it still has--
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.920]   it had bits of sample code from that book for years in it.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:34.400]   Wow.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.200]   And it underwent a few different forms.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.600]   It was named a couple of different things.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.880]   It was called Think Tank at one point.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.640]   It was a nonprofit.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.920]   It was funded by-- we had a MacArthur grant.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.080]   But we founded the LLC in July of 2013.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.760]   So I've got another eight years to go before I reach
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.920]   your miles, only.
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.320]   It's a lot to be proud of.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.280]   I'm very proud of it.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.600]   And the team we have.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.120]   And I'm trying to think if anybody's been with me, well,
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.680]   Frederick has since almost the beginning.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.600]   And Tony Wang has since almost the beginning.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.320]   So there are a few people who are still here.
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.960]   It's fun to look at the Christmas card and watch it grow.
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:09.240]   Oh, I love the Christmas card.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.240]   The Christmas card's great.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.080]   So what did you think, Gina?
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.040]   Actually, this is timely of the announcement
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.160]   that Google was going to start, once again,
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.840]   re-indexing tweets.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.760]   They got the fire hose.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.880]   They got the fire hose.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.120]   I actually hadn't heard that.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.040]   Man, I need to come back on the show.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.880]   Oh, you even missed--
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.440]   You've been back on the show.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.160]   You missed all the big stories.
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.480]   So I'm actually of mixed opinion.
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.040]   And I'm sure Jeff is as well, because we both
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.840]   would like some of the tweets about us to be buried forever.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.440]   But--
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.120]   Really?
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.400]   I don't know what the deal was.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.600]   I don't think we still know what the deal was between Twitter
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.480]   and Google.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.040]   They used to have the fire hose.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.680]   Remember, they used to search tweets.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.400]   Then all of a sudden, they stopped.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.640]   Google+ started around then.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:54.960]   Right.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:01.040]   But now, apparently, there's been a deal sometime
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.800]   in the first half of the year after more than two years
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.680]   not doing this.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.920]   Google's going to start, once again,
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.360]   putting tweets into search results.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.320]   Bloomberg reports that Twitter gave them access to the fire hose.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.280]   We don't know what the deal was.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.800]   The presumption is that Google paid for the fire hose.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.200]   The Twitter-- you generally used to Twitter.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.480]   I don't know if you hate that.
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.400]   Twitter got more--
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.560]   I got a man-ace commercial, because the stupid web page
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.560]   I was looking at start auto runs a man-ace commercial.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.280]   Stop it.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.600]   It's killing the page, too.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.880]   All right.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.320]   So what's your objective?
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.600]   You feel like you want tweets to go away?
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   Yes.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.760]   I mean, the Library of Congress gets to Twitter archive, right?
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.480]   I mean, at some point--
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.080]   That's fine.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.320]   I don't care about that.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.520]   Here's my objection.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.440]   No way he looks at it.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.240]   Here's my objection that somebody will search my name
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.040]   and not only finding all the good stuff that I do
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.440]   in my blog and stories about me and Wikipedia,
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.640]   they'll find tweets about me.
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.200]   Yeah, I hear you.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.160]   I hear you.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.200]   I don't want some of those to surface, because people--
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.240]   I get a lot of nasty tweets.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.680]   Yeah, I'm sure you do.
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.040]   But you also-- you have some nasty websites, too, right?
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.320]   I mean--
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.960]   Well, that's not a big deal, because nobody
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.520]   links to those, so those notes show up and search.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.080]   I see.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.880]   How is Google going to rank these tweets?
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.480]   Because it's not going to be using page rank.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.560]   Well, I think it's more of a--
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.280]   I saw some come in, and it was more sample.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:31.920]   It was a sample.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.840]   It was a couple of tweets in a search result.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.120]   But how do they choose them?
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.440]   It seems like they should rank them.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.080]   If they have access to the fire hose
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.360]   and they're getting the API results,
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.960]   they're getting number of retweets, number of favorites,
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.200]   number of followers by the author who posted them,
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.840]   whether or not the author is following the person.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.600]   So presumably, Google is going to use those signals
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.680]   to rank those tweets.
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.320]   I mean, if a tweet gets a couple hundred favorites,
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.160]   I imagine that that's rank higher.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.160]   That would be fine with me.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.400]   I got no problem about that.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.440]   But do we know?
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.200]   How do we know?
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.080]   This isn't any different than Twitter's search itself,
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.240]   right?
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.560]   It just exposes people to the internet.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.560]   Yeah, but I don't care about that.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.160]   Because I think if you're going to Twitter and searching
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.360]   for tweets about me, that's fine.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.680]   But it's a little different if you go to Google
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.800]   and you search for my name, I feel
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.320]   like that the stuff that's on Twitter
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.680]   is so ephemeral anyway, this is giving it more weight,
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.760]   perhaps, than it deserves.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.640]   Yeah, it's sort of the eternal debate about whether or not
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.560]   to log like IRC conversations, for example.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.000]   People go into a chat room.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.960]   And I think a lot of people use Twitter like a chat.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.440]   It's this idea that these are just these ephemeral, short
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.480]   messages that you type off the cuff.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.840]   IRC content of the show.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.840]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.280]   Search.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.040]   Yeah, well, you know, it's funny.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.480]   The think of community had this big debate.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.160]   Like, do we log the IRC channel?
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.520]   You know, some people really didn't like the idea
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.280]   that it was logged.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.880]   Look, I'm just dropping in for some quick help.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.960]   I don't want this to be on the web forever.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.320]   But others argued like, hey, there
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.160]   might be conversations that happened here that might be
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.560]   helpful to someone else in the future.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.720]   And it's all about--
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.120]   I mean, what we're talking about here
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.560]   is just the expectations, right?
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.600]   Leo, you don't expect that tweets are going to show up
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.560]   on Google because they don't.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.640]   They're so fast and they happen so quickly
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.040]   and they're more like chat.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.680]   But what that's changing now.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.240]   I mean, as far as I'm concerned, if they're
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.080]   in the Library of Congress, then their tweets or tweets,
[00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.520]   that they're out there, they're permanent
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.720]   whether or not we want them to be.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   So I kind of feel like--
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.760]   So here's my question.
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.840]   So the debate we have a lot of time,
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:34.520]   I say that Google can't own content, can't pay for content.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.120]   So if you're a German publisher, do you look at this deal
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.800]   and say, oh, you paid for tweets?
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.120]   Why don't you pay for us?
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:42.880]   Or is this different?
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.840]   That's a good question.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.760]   That's a good question.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.040]   Because it's definitely-- in Twitter's interest,
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:56.000]   not only would they get the revenue, but in a way,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.400]   that's what this Bloomberg Post says.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.720]   It draws more people to Twitter, right?
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.120]   And it helps grow Twitter.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:03.620]   Right.
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:05.120]   So it says it should be without revenue.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.360]   But Twitter does charge.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.920]   It charges for its fire hose.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.120]   It allows Google to buy it.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.120]   But I see some oil on that slope.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.080]   Actually, it's funny because Twitter's former chief operating
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.360]   officer, Ali Rogani, according to Bloomberg,
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.960]   was against renewing the Google agreement.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:31.080]   He wanted to keep more control over Twitter's content.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.400]   Anyway, this is an interesting story.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.200]   By the way, notice the new Bloomberg business--
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.440]   It's nice.
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.320]   Yeah, look at this.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.400]   As I scroll, look at the top, there's a little--
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.240]   You're almost done.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.000]   You're almost done.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Keep going.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.920]   Showing how far I am into the article.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:47.760]   Is that weird?
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:48.280]   I like that.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:49.760]   I just noticed that.
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.200]   I thought it's too similar to the progress bar of whether or not
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.080]   a page is loaded.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.600]   So I was like, oh, is this page not loaded?
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.520]   I wouldn't do that.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.200]   And besides, what is the--
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.120]   Is this information I want?
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.120]   Like, how far down?
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.040]   I've got a scroll bar.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.080]   I've got a scroll bar.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.400]   It tells me where I am on the page.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.400]   It seems like it's this vertical--
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.240]   Yeah, horizontal scroll bar.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.520]   But it's different from the scroll bar,
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.720]   because it might include comments and other stuff.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:15.200]   It does.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.120]   The scroll bar includes ads.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.280]   And this does not.
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.240]   Well, maybe it does.
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.560]   Oh, maybe it does, actually.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.040]   It stops right.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.680]   Oh, you know what it's also trying to do?
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.680]   It's the infinite page.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.600]   So it's trying to--
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.080]   Oh.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.000]   --port you to go to the next page.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.520]   Oh, now it's reset.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.920]   I'm in a new page.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.760]   Exactly.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.160]   Oh, that's even weirder.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.600]   I don't know why we got into this.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.440]   Because my mind's on web redesigns.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.200]   No web design.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.080]   Yeah, have you solved their problem?
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.640]   Yeah, we had a great meeting today.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.520]   We've got it all figured out.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.000]   Yay.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.840]   Yeah, I feel really good about it.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.320]   We're working hard to make a--
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.720]   I think it's going to be a beautiful new website.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.240]   And the challenge is we're doing some stuff that people just
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.720]   haven't done much in the past.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.760]   Things like that.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.240]   An API, a public API for our content.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:05.120]   That's a big chunk to chew off.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.800]   The old Canary and the Colmine.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.960]   It's brave.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.600]   It's brave, but it's good.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.000]   Oh, I figured out about this.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.160]   And I know that some of our audience, some of you watching
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.360]   and listening right now, if we had
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.520]   a public API that you could say, hey, give me
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.640]   all the shows that talked about Lollipop in the last five
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.560]   days.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.200]   And you could generate an RSS feed of your very own.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.560]   And maybe even give it to friends.
[00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.600]   That would be something I think people are very interested in.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.800]   And that's the kind of thing we can do with the API.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.960]   The Guardian has a public API of its content.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:40.040]   And it sets conditions for its use that are interesting.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.920]   We all have rate limiting.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.200]   I'm learning so much about stuff.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.160]   That's what's fun for me.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.120]   But you go through an API provider that--
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.320]   there's a documented API.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.920]   The API provider authenticates users of the API.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.200]   So you'd have to create a code and get an API key,
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.920]   as you've seen, whenever you--
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.680]   Yes.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.800]   And then there's some rate limiting.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.200]   And we can figure out how that works.
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.480]   We don't want somebody sucking all our bandwidth
[00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:12.360]   with their custom program.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.400]   It's interesting.
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.960]   It's really cool.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.680]   So there's so much stuff.
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.440]   The web is moving so fast that it's
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.080]   hard to even put a place in the sand and saying, well,
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.120]   we're going to--
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.840]   because the tide comes in.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.280]   And now you've got to get a new place.
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.320]   It's very interesting.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:32.800]   It's true.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.720]   And once you become an API provider,
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.600]   you start to realize why other API providers have limits
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.280]   in place.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.280]   Right.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.360]   Well, we'll see.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.320]   Yeah, I mean, we're--
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.120]   we'll live to regret it, but we'll see.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:47.160]   I'm fascinated with the sites that have started without home
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.560]   pages and now without sites.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.720]   Fox and--
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.360]   No, Fox.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.560]   Yeah, Fox and Quartz and Marshall Project
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:56.040]   started without home pages.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.560]   And now you have contently with no site, really.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.360]   And now this news has gotten rid of its site entirely.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.720]   It just lives on the internet wherever it lives.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.960]   I don't understand.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.680]   So what you're saying is there's no front page,
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.080]   but there are pages of content.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:11.840]   No, no.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.160]   Not for now this news.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.040]   Let me see how this works.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.440]   How do you get to now this news then?
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.560]   It comes to you.
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.920]   It comes to you.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.880]   It has a page.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.760]   Like and follow now this news everywhere.
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.520]   So you get it on Twitter, on Facebook, on YouTube,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.360]   on wherever.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.080]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.600]   They just made this change last week.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.760]   So I can't follow them on the web,
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.560]   but I can get their apps, or I could go to Tumblr,
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.160]   or I could--
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.280]   So it's the servants without the site.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:40.760]   No site.
[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.120]   This is something-- we've been talking about this
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.920]   on Twitter because Nick Bilton wrote an article in the New
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.240]   York Times about Snapchat.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.120]   And he's become a real advocate of Snapchat.
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.520]   This is the Snapchat homepage.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.840]   And by the way, this is also nothing because you need the app.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.400]   But these are all brands that are posting stuff on Snapchat,
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.160]   including Yahoo News.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.040]   Kitty Kirk's doing a newscast on Snapchat.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.440]   Maybe that's where Brian Williams could go.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.440]   [GASPING]
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.120]   Hey, Brian, the good news is 24 hours later, no matter what
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.680]   you say, no one knows.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.680]   No one's going to remember that.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.600]   There's no record.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.080]   I know.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.840]   I feel bad because I like Brian.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   I do too.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.640]   But you can't.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.120]   I feel bad for him.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:25.800]   Well, what do you think?
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.880]   Jeff, you're the journalism professor.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.080]   Let's take a break.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.560]   Before you say anything, let's do it ahead.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.800]   I'm actually really curious.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.440]   It's kind of not-- look, anything's in our preview, right?
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.280]   This show we could do anything we want.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:37.780]   Yes.
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.680]   So let's talk about it because that's
[00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.440]   an interesting question is, was the punishment too harsh,
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.800]   too lenient?
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.080]   I mean, what did he do?
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.120]   Let's talk about that when we come back.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.520]   And of course, lots of Google stuff,
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:53.520]   including the return of the change log for one day only.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.960]   A one-day engagement.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.000]   I like it.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.480]   And Google has announced that it's not just a search engine
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.080]   anymore.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.160]   And Udi Manber has moved on.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.120]   And we'll tell you why.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.880]   That's important.
[00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:08.040]   There's a lot to talk about, actually.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.680]   Google I/O coming to town.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.240]   Our show today brought to you by LD Products, Inc.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.520]   and Toner, my friends.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.120]   It's all about the Inc. and Toner.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.200]   Look, can you imagine how many Inc. and Toner cartridges
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.920]   are in landfills, what they are doing to our environment?
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.160]   Wouldn't you rather buy Inc. and Toner cartridges
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:33.000]   that are recycled cartridges that are as good as new,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.240]   but save the environment a little bit, keeps oil and plastic
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.720]   and waste out of the landfills?
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.000]   You want to find out about LD Products, LDProducts.com.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.480]   Of course, you can go to LD Products
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.040]   and get a great price on the original OEM cartridges in Toner.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.320]   But you might want to try.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.960]   Just try their own quality alternative,
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:58.600]   some as much as 75% less than the OEM product.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.400]   And all their products are risk-free with a two-year--
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.760]   I don't know.
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.840]   I guess you could buy ahead.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.720]   A two-year 100% customer satisfaction guarantee.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:11.480]   You can return it a product for any reason.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.040]   And then what's really, really, really cool
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.720]   is their call center, their warehouse,
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.200]   and their headquarters are in a giant, 110,000 square foot,
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.120]   platinum lead certified building in Long Beach.
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.200]   Lead is an environmental building certification.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:34.560]   And a platinum lead means this building is green all the way.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.160]   I love it that they did this.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.720]   This is a lead certification comes from the US Green Building
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.680]   Council.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.760]   And platinum is as good as you can get.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.680]   So if you're ready to get ink for your toner or your inkjet,
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.480]   you've got to go to LD Products.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.760]   Somebody sent me the funniest--
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.960]   let me see if I can find this-- Valentine's Day ink.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.200]   I don't know if I'll be able to find this meme.
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.560]   It was really-- maybe it was on Twitter.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.000]   It was very funny.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.040]   The cost of ink is more than--
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.760]   melt in gold, molten gold.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.280]   And anyway, this is the place to go to save a huge amount.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.840]   In fact, not only are you going to save,
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.320]   we're going to get you an additional 10% off ink and toner
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:26.040]   and free shipping, excluding OEM products.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:31.440]   When you go to LD Products.com/Twit,
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   use the offer code TWIT.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.440]   We started to use this.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.440]   This is a toner cartridge for our HP.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.440]   Remanufactured means just less waste.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.440]   It's better for the environment.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.440]   And you're getting a great product that is totally guaranteed.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.440]   LD Products.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.440]   DAC.com/Twit.
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.440]   I wish I could find this.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.440]   It was the funniest little cartoon.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.440]   Oh, well, it's a problem when people tweet you.
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.440]   If only you could search for it on Google, Alio.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.440]   Oh, you're right.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.440]   You know, if only they were away.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.440]   Oh, well.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.440]   So what did Brian Williams do, first of all?
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.440]   Mr. --
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.440]   Mr. --
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.440]   Mr. --
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   As I think David Carr at the New York Times said,
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.440]   he "gilded the lily so much he turned it into a different flower."
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.440]   Hey, by the way, here's the image.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.440]   I did find it.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.440]   This Valentine's Day surprised her with a cartridge of magenta.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.440]   Nothing says "I love you" like printer ink.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.440]   Gasoline, $2 a gallon.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.440]   Coffee, $15 a gallon.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:42.440]   Extra virgin olive oil, $150 a gallon.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.440]   Nail polish, it's pretty pricey, $1,500 a gallon.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:51.440]   Johnny Walker, 21-year-old black label whiskey, $4,200 a gallon.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.440]   Chanel number five, perfume, $6,60 a gallon.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:06.440]   It all pales compared to printer ink, $16,218 per gallon for an ink jet.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.440]   So give her a cartridge of magenta.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.440]   Except if you get an LED product.
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.440]   Don't tell you you got an LED product because it's a lot less.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.440]   All right.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.440]   So he gilded the lily to the point where there was no lily to be found.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.440]   Right.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.440]   And of course, he misremembered.
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.440]   And there was a great Twitter meme.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:30.440]   There's a picture of Brian Williams on the moon under the hashtag, Brian Williams, "Remeniscer Members."
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:38.440]   I feel like, though, that that was the kind of misrememory that could have been accidental or it could have.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:44.440]   The problem was how the story changed and how it amplified over time.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:50.440]   And then I think that Brian Williams, who's been the anchor, he started as the anchor of NMS NBC's Nightly Newscast.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.440]   And I worked with him at the site at that time.
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:57.440]   In fact, I was on the show a few times and he was part of our launch of the site.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.440]   My virtual reality character, Dave Nolen, interacted with him.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.440]   And I really liked Brian a lot.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.440]   I thought he was funny.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.440]   We've seen him many times on Letterman and Fallon.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.440]   He's just, he's wry.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.440]   He's funny.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.440]   He seems smart.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.440]   And most importantly, for a news anchor, he seems like he has integrity.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.440]   He started anchoring NBC's Nightly News.
[00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.440]   What is it?
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.440]   15 years ago?
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.440]   10 years ago?
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.440]   It's been a while.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.440]   I feel like it's more than 10 years ago.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.440]   And it is currently the highest rated news anchor in the United States.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:34.440]   He's our, you know, our generation's Walter Cronkite, if you will, makes $10 million a year.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.440]   Just signed a new five-year contract.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.440]   Well, not this year he's not going to, but...
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.440]   Well, that's right.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.440]   But that's leading up.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.440]   So that's the kind of who Brian Williams is.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.440]   And disclaimer, I don't know him.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.440]   I didn't hang out with him, but I've worked with him.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.440]   And I always thought he was great.
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.440]   So he was talking about two things, right?
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.440]   One was his experiences in Iraq.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.440]   Right?
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.440]   Thought he was shot down by an RPG in a helicopter.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.440]   Turns out not so much the case.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.440]   Some debate is whether or not he was behind that helicopter.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.440]   Some said it was a sandstorm, but in any case, it definitely wasn't.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:16.440]   And in 2006, when he said this, by the way, I'm told that the pilot who was flying the
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:21.440]   helicopter ahead of him that was shot down by an RPG wrote to NBC News and complained
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.440]   and said, "No, no.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.440]   He was in the one half an hour behind me."
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:30.440]   Williams was quoted as saying, "I looked down the tube of an RPG as it took us out of the
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.440]   sky."
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.440]   Okay, that's one.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.440]   He kept bringing it up and bringing it up.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.440]   And it got bigger and bigger and worse and worse.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.440]   And then he thanked the guy who saved his life when he got shot down by the RPG.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.440]   And that's why that's just kind of had it.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:47.440]   And then there's some debate about, I think it's still debate about his coverage of Katrina.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.440]   Did he see a body float by?
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.440]   Did he get dysentery?
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:54.440]   They said there was no dysentery when he drank some water.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.440]   Or did he just have too much, you know, too many bad yays?
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.440]   He did.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:05.440]   You know, he said that, I thought he said that he saw a body float by in the French quarter.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.440]   And of course, there was no flooding in the French quarter.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.440]   Well, there was some, but then there was some flooding in the French quarter.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.440]   Was it enough for a body to float by?
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:18.440]   There's a picture of him standing there with the water barely went up his soles of his shoe.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.440]   Right.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.440]   So the point at the end, I'll give you a couple of things.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:28.440]   One is, from now on, when Brian Williams, if he goes out and covers a big story, what's
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   going to happen?
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.440]   We're all going to question everything he says.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.440]   He's suspect.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:36.440]   And how is that going to affect his reporting too?
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:42.840]   I think he and NBC both waited too long, weren't transparent enough, didn't really dig into
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.840]   the story.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.400]   My friend Jamie Rosen says that if he was really the manager and editor of NBC News, he should
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.560]   have dug into his own story.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.440]   He should have been interviewed by people.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.440]   You know, I came up with a statement and then kind of they all hid.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:58.440]   And so of course he was suspended for six months without pay.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.440]   That's going to only make $5 million this year.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.440]   Luster Holt is in his place.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:10.440]   Now the problem I have with this, I wrote a post on Medium about it this morning.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:15.440]   Problem is that they're treading water for six months.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:19.440]   Number one, number two, I think it's an insult to Luster Holt who I think is very good, though
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.440]   I happen to know that he has enough personality.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:28.440]   But it may be good right now, but you could have an African American soul anchor on a nightly
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:31.440]   news show and they're not doing that.
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.440]   There's a placeholder, which I think is insulting.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:40.920]   And we should explain that during the investigation, Williams recused himself from the nightly news
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:46.120]   in Luster Holt, who's the weekend anchor, filled in and B.C. did an internal investigation
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:51.400]   which apparently was entirely done by people who know and love Brian Williams.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:56.800]   The decision was to suspend him for six months without pay, $5 million.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.760]   But the implication is he'll come back as the anchor of NBC Nightly News in six months.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.760]   I don't believe that's going to happen.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:07.760]   When I heard this and I heard that he had suspended himself, I said, "That's it.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.760]   You're never going to see him on nightly news again."
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.760]   I still believe that's the case.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.760]   Yeah, I did.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.760]   The case.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.760]   I talked to a -- I happen to be sitting in Starbucks and ended up in a conversation with a crisis
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:17.760]   PR person.
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.760]   And I asked her, "What would you advise NBC for Brian Williams?"
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.760]   And she said, "Take them off, lie low, have them come back and do a couple of really
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.760]   big interviews in a few months and then test the waters."
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.760]   For all I know she advised them with this.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:31.760]   But I don't think that works.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.760]   So my argument today is that NBC has already been kicked into the kidneys.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.760]   They have the opportunity to really reinvent TV news now.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.760]   And I don't -- I fear they're not going to.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.760]   But they could make the NBC Nightly News into all kinds of things.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.760]   You know, start with the punchline that was all over Twitter yesterday.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:51.760]   Comedian Brian Williams and Newsman John Stewart trade places.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:54.760]   [laughter]
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:31:00.760]   Turn it into get rid of the commodity news that we all know and like vice do stories we haven't
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.760]   seen and wow us with your narrative and your journalism.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:10.760]   Turn it into a town square for America and have civilized smart debates.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.760]   Explain really difficult stories for us.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.760]   Get rid of the show entirely.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:22.760]   Go digital first and serve everybody on digital and on mobile, but use the show as a byproduct
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.760]   and a promotional vehicle.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.760]   There's all kinds of options for how they could remake TV news.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.760]   TV news badly needs to be remade.
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:31.760]   You've been saying that for some time.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.760]   Yeah, we've done a Vents of CUNY on this and I'm going to do some more events on this.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.760]   So I think there's actually an opportunity for NBC here.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:38.760]   But what's NBC doing?
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:48.760]   Instead they're in a self-imposed limbo like a Star Trek episode trapped in the glass of the screen not changing for six months.
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:52.760]   And that's, you know, what is that going to do to the reputation that they have?
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:53.760]   What is that going to do to the show?
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:55.760]   What does that do to lust or hold reputation?
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.760]   What does it do to Brian Williams reputation?
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.760]   I think that's the worst that could happen.
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   And they've got to do something bold now.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.760]   And the question is Comcast owns half the damn world.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.760]   Google owns the other half.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.760]   Is there anybody with any guts and Comcast to say, you know what?
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.760]   Yeah, we make money on it.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.760]   But the audience is dying.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   The audience is over 60 years old.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.760]   We're fighting for the exact same audience with ABC and CBS.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.760]   Let's do something new.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.760]   Let's turn this into an opportunity.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:27.760]   So that was my very helpful suggestion to that.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:35.760]   It is certainly not related to the Brian Williams incident, but it is an opportunity to rethink what Nightly News is.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.760]   And something that's probably long overdue, although obviously still makes them a lot of money.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   Well, they wouldn't do it as number one.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:42.760]   You know, don't rock the boat.
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.760]   Don't mess with it.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.760]   I happen, you know, full closure.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.760]   Now they have to because they've got to figure it out.
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:47.760]   Now they have to.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:48.760]   I intended.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.760]   They're going to sell six months, right?
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.760]   Well, but that's gene.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.760]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.760]   I don't know that they really did.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:33:00.760]   I think that everybody's going to see it as, you know, just just as I say, trading water on hold.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.760]   Nothing new there.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.760]   They're not going to do anything bold in those six months.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.760]   I think they've got to be bolder faster.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.760]   I agree.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:12.760]   I just I think that they're probably in panic mode right now when you're in an incomplete and frozen in fear.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:17.760]   That's not the time that you're sort of emboldened to make a, you know, kind of up end, you know, the whole thing.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.760]   But they bought themselves a little bit of time.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.760]   I mean, I, I agree.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.760]   And six months from now, I would be very surprised if he came back on the air and everything was just the same.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.760]   They're probably going to make some changes, right?
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:28.760]   But they had to buy themselves some time.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.760]   Is there any chance for this, Jeff?
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.760]   I mean, it seems like this has never happened before.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.760]   Well, there was Dan Rather.
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.760]   Uh, I had 60 minutes.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.760]   And by the way, Dan stood up for Brian, which I thought was nice.
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.760]   Um, Gina, let me just push back on that for a quick second because I think you, yes, I think you're right.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.760]   I think they're in panic mode.
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:52.760]   But when they're number one and making money, that's when they are least likely to disrupt themselves and do anything.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:53.760]   That's true.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.760]   That's true.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.760]   There's, there's a moment where you say, Oh, WTF.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.760]   We've got nothing to lose here.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:33:59.760]   Yeah, we suck.
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.760]   Yeah, man.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:09.760]   Um, they're not in that mode yet, but somebody in Comcast couldn't be somebody there could say, you know, well, let's send in something new here.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.760]   No, you're right.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:11.760]   You're right.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:18.760]   I mean, I think it probably depends on how much money they make and how, you know, whether, how well they think they can spin this and recover from it.
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:21.760]   You know, back into the status quo.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.760]   All of the.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.760]   Is.
[00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:31.760]   Uh, in full disclosure, I attended a couple of NBC news executive off sites.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.760]   I didn't get paid for it.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.760]   God damn it.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.760]   Um, but I found it interesting.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.760]   It was, you know, it's off the record.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:40.760]   So I'm not going to reveal it particularly, but the impression that I took away, you know, I'm talking about, Oh,
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.760]   it's like my book, you know, the new relationships for news, new forms, do business, what do this do that?
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.760]   They're in a different business.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:50.760]   The entire business, all, you know, is Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian, Brian.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.760]   It's a star business entirely.
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.760]   They don't think that we watched the news.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.760]   They think we watched Brian.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.760]   And, and so that became a single point of failure, as we like to say in tech world.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.760]   For the entire business.
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.760]   He, he tripped and the entire thing trips.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.760]   And so there's a, there's a, there's a fundamental business problem here.
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.760]   Business model problem here.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.760]   And that's what they've got to realize.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:16.760]   It's kind of antiquated though.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:22.760]   On the other hand, to put that burden of veracity on a person.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:30.760]   When we have news sources, many, many, many news sources making crap up every minute.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:38.760]   And, or exaggerating or, and of course you have a fall guy, but isn't this, I mean, we're in a new era.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:47.760]   And the notion that there is a news source of record anymore is kind of meaningless, isn't it?
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:53.760]   I mean, the days when Walter Cronk, I could say, we've lost the war and that would be it.
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:57.760]   And Nixon said, Oh crap, or Johnson said, Oh crap, we've lost the war.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.760]   Those days are long gone.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:04.760]   Gina, what was the last time you watched Eevee news?
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.760]   Oh.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.760]   For years.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:13.760]   I mean, I used to visit my grandfather in law and he would watch.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.760]   Right after Lawrence Welk and right before chapter.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.760]   He was 93 and we watched 60 minutes together.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.760]   But like as like, you know, that was a thing that we did together.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.760]   I mean, maybe five years ago before he passed, I don't watch nightly.
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:34.760]   My mom, when she cooks, I mean, everyone that I know that watches nightly news, you know, is, is well over 65 70.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.760]   No, that's just not a thing.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:41.760]   I mean, you know, when I was a kid growing up, that was my mom had the five o'clock news on kind of while she was making dinner.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.760]   That's not part of my life at all.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:54.760]   But to go back to the news of record and this idea of like this one person, I mean, right now the thing that's going to, I mean, what compels people, compels an audience is a personality and stories, right?
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:03.760]   So like we love Brian Williams because he's a trusted person and he's a personality and he's, he was telling a story and obviously trying to make it more compelling.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:09.760]   Yeah, this whole thing reminded me a little bit of the Mike Daisy thing that happened when he was telling the story about Apple.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.760]   And I mean, of course, he's not Brian Williams.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:22.760]   But I remember just being so just absolutely outraged that this guy could have, you know, stretched the truth so far that it no longer resembled anything that was actually true.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:28.760]   But I think that he, that that Daisy is a storyteller at heart and embellishment is part of storytelling.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:34.760]   And it's about, you know, creating this narrative and creating this emotional pitch for an audience and bringing them along.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.760]   And I know I'm a writer. I do it.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:43.760]   And there's no material that what he lied about or made up or exaggerate is probably the right word.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.760]   Didn't have any material impact on the news itself.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.760]   It didn't.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.760]   And I'm sure in a lot of ways Brian felt like he looked down the barrel of an RPG, even though, you know, right?
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:59.760]   Because I mean, he was like, wow, I was half an hour behind or following a helicopter that got shot out. That could have been me, right?
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:07.760]   Like, I made these connections in my mind. I mean, even when I look back at 9/11, which is kind of this big dramatic thing for me, I think, you know, it's funny.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:12.760]   I did a talk at XOXO about my 9/11 experience.
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.760]   And I did the Google Street view from the corner where I was standing.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:21.760]   And I swear that my memory is that I could see the towers burning, but you really, but you, I couldn't see the freedom tower from the current Google Street.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.760]   And that was just my memory. I mean, our memories changed.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:29.760]   And you super impose images that you see after them and every retelling it changes.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.760]   So I really, I feel kind of bad for him because I know how this works and how this happens.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:47.760]   Like, I mean, you know, you could say that he was, it was malicious because he was trying to embellish and make the story more compelling and build up his own personality and, and, and, and, you know, make it seem like he was more important in the middle of it than he actually was.
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.760]   And maybe that was part of it, but memory is a weird, a weird, strange thing.
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:39:06.760]   And also the, the, you know, the quote I looked down the barrel of the tube of an RPG that had been fired at us was not as part of the nightly news, but was in an interview with a student tele, a Fairfield new university student TV network.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.760]   I mean, it wasn't exactly on, it wasn't on his nightly news show.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:19.760]   The story, the story to change, he apologized saying, you know, I confused what happened.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:25.760]   He was writing in the helicopter behind the one that was hitting a confused the events of 12 years ago.
[00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:28.760]   But is, I think the issue is that story changed more than that.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:33.760]   I think that's really it. I think it's the reaction to it. I think you're right. Very right, Gina. I mean, I worry about this too.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.760]   You know, I think about me in 9/11 and, and where I was.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:40.760]   We all do that. It's normal.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:48.760]   Yeah. And, but, I mean, David, David Carr again tried to say that, that what he did didn't have an impact on what he does for a living.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.760]   And I'm sorry. I got a disagree there. You, you, you, one should try to hold oneself to a higher standard.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:58.760]   At the same time, he's human. At the same time, I go back and part of the problem is TV.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:09.760]   Jay Rosen again quoted, said somebody from TV, you know, tweeted him and said, you got to understand that on television, the correspondent doesn't actually do much of the journalism at all.
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:14.760]   The producers and these other people doing the correspond, but, but then they may not take credit for anything.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.760]   The correspondent takes it on. Right.
[00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:23.760]   And that's what they do. And, and, and you're right, Gina. They make, you know, they're, they're about trying to make compelling narratives.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:38.760]   And you can see how he got carried away, but I can also see how once exposed and not having dealt with it, I think in a very forth right way, it affects his credibility and that's the credibility of the network.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:45.760]   Actually, that's true. I think that's true. They definitely didn't handle it well, but I mean, you know, look, this is the human, human reaction to it.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:52.760]   I made a mistake is, oh, like, how can I, how can I cover this up or it wasn't so bad or, you know, and I think, oh, Gina, that's really important too, I think.
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   You know, I always say I always credit blogs with having taught me.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:03.760]   I mean, Craig Silverman who wrote a wonderful book called the regret the error. I wrote the forward for it. And as I, as I did that and I thought about it, I remember my early days in journalism.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:08.760]   You're right. The last thing you ever wanted to do was admit that you made a mistake. It was the most shameful things were perfect.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:19.760]   And what blogging taught me, you know, the first time I made a mistake and, and erased it and got slapped for it, I learned a lesson about how to make mistakes openly.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:27.760]   And I, the primary lesson I learned is that when you correct yourself, you don't reduce your credibility. You enhance your credibility TV doesn't know that.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:37.760]   When was the last time you saw correction on TV before Brian Williams? It never corrects itself. It doesn't have that ethic that we now take as our norm.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:48.760]   Yeah, that's so funny. That's so true. A life hacker, one of the, one of the heart earliest, most difficult editorial decisions I had to made is that we never pull a post and that we show any edits that, like, change the story.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:42:07.760]   It's that, like, change the content, you know, a typo, we would fix without showing that we change the typo. But if, but if, you know, if we had published the wrong piece of information that we would strike it out and then do an update, a dated update, and now that was tough and it was tough for me because I didn't want to forever and ever for there to be a note of the fact that we made a mistake and we first published something,
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:17.760]   a particular, the painful situation we had, we had, we were putting instructions on how to edit your Windows registry, which can really bork a machine and we screwed up the instructions.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:29.760]   And I felt like a complete jackass. And, you know, and my first response was like, let's just change it, you know, change it and not acknowledge. But, you know, there were a bunch of comments from people that said you guys got this wrong.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:38.760]   But it's true, blogging is, you know, and that's when we see the, you know, Wikipedia revisions and things like GitHub is what you see things are a work in progress and they get changed and fixed.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:46.760]   Does it make it really have that? Does it make any difference that he didn't do this on the nightly news? But the exaggerations always occurred
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:55.760]   with, you know, interviews by student reporters or David Letterman or Alec Baldwin. I mean, why would he be interviewed? Because he was on the nightly news.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:43:02.760]   But, all right. I mean, I think you're right. I think the damage to credibility means you probably.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:12.760]   But if it's not like you lie on nightly news at all, ever, these were in later recollections with in kind of more personality driven venues.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:25.760]   And it is in a huge stadium. You know, that's that's the issue. He didn't very public places using his fame and notoriety. Listen, if he if he lied to his wife about where he was last night, that's their business.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:30.760]   Right. That doesn't affect his credibility. If he lies in public.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:39.760]   Again, I have some of the forum too. I think he's a good guy. I don't think he did this maliciously. I don't think he tried to say I'm in a I'm in a horns waggle the world here.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:44.760]   But but he was still back to it affects his credibility. He's probably inflating.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   A couple of possibilities, but that he was inflating his own reputation, which would be bad or that he really wanted to make it a more interesting story because he's on Letterman.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:04.760]   And it has to be more interesting because he's on Letterman than just a news report. Anyway, I feel bad. I guess there's nothing more.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:09.760]   But let me know that that nothing wrong has ever been said on the Twit Network.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:20.760]   Well, maybe that's why I'm so I feel so bad for him because I never told any kind of embellished story. No exaggeration is nothing.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:28.760]   Well, actually, actually, the other problem with being every week is that when I do screw up and I have screwed up on this show often.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:36.760]   I have to remind myself to remember that the next week I should correct myself. And that's not easy to do. Right.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:43.760]   The post twig walk home is always filled with I wish I had said this or I wish I would.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   So look at the inner mind of a host. I'm always like, yeah, you should have said this. Yeah, I wish I put that a different way.
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:45:00.760]   Udi Manberg, who is a name you might recognize, has left Google. He was nine years at Google, then later at YouTube.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:09.760]   He joined in 2006 from Amazon. He founded the A9 lab, which was Amazon's attempt to create a search engine.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:19.760]   And then, in fact, one of the main reasons I recognize the name is because he's featured in Bradstone's The Everything Store.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:29.760]   He went to Google, led Project Noll, which was kind of like knowledge and short for knowledge. It was a database of information.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   Didn't really take off. He helped create help outs using Hangouts, which is actually a great and very little used, I think, a Google feature Hangouts feature.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:47.760]   And then he worked on YouTube search most recently. He's going to the National Institutes of Health, which is cool.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:58.760]   And other departures, Christopher Rot, who created Google News as an extra project, just announced on this weekend on Google Plus that he's leaving up for 15 years.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:45:59.760]   Wow.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:05.760]   And what's his name? The head of knowledge who jumped off the, who set the new record for jumping off.
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.760]   Oh, he left too.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.760]   Really?
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.760]   What's his name? I don't have the knowledge of his name.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:17.760]   Who jumped out of the thing without the thing. Set the new record for skydiving.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.760]   Oh, come on.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:23.760]   Looking down the barrel of an RPG over here, King Katina, I believe.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.760]   Oh, what's his name?
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.760]   I can't remember it.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:35.760]   Google I/O May 28th and May 29th. We're going to have to go through this rigmarole again, getting you guys in.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.760]   Oh, boy.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   Now, Gina, I don't know if I can leverage your, I think, I think as long as, if only if Gina comes back full time, she can get into Google I/O.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.760]   I think we might have to make you do that.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:53.760]   Well, Leo, I was going to say to you, I want to be, I would like, I'd be happy to be of service in whichever way.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.760]   I mean, if it would be easier for me to watch the stream and cover the stream, I think we'll have you do that.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.760]   I think we'll have you do that.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.760]   Like, I'll start. I will absolutely at minimum do that.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.760]   And I presume, Jeff, you're planning to go, right?
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   Well, if they let me in, is it notice this year? It's Thursday Friday. That's different.
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.760]   Oh, Wednesday, Thursday in the past.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.760]   And I'm going to throw an application in, you know, of course.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.760]   Sure.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.760]   Of course.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.760]   Actually, it's Thursday, Friday. So will I.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:25.760]   Maybe maybe I'll get my Gelligan did see he wants to go. I know. And Jason, you want to go, don't you? Of course you do.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.760]   Yeah, I have gone.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:32.760]   I would a few years, but you know, every single year, it's the same song and dance, right?
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:35.760]   Right. We have to ride up until the bitter end.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:40.760]   We're in a cold sweat and somehow, somehow it happens.
[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:46.760]   March 17th, 9 a.m. Pacific tickets go on sale.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:54.760]   But that really is a meaningless information because if it's anything like in the past, tickets will sell out within a few seconds.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.760]   Literally.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.760]   Some reference to a lottery.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.760]   They did a lottery last year, didn't they?
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:00.760]   Right.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:09.760]   So it's an application process and the people they offer tickets to, it has no band, like the order in which you order or apply has no bearing on who gets the ticket.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.760]   So it isn't going to be this rush where it's like everyone's refreshing their web bread.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.760]   You know, it doesn't need to be.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:19.760]   That's kind of cool. Did you see that? This is very material design, isn't it? This is the Google I/O page.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.760]   Here's the countdown.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:28.760]   It looks at cut out, paste pieces of paper counting down to 33 days until registration begins.
[00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.760]   So yeah, paper, I love the new lower third here, Leo.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:32.760]   I like the nice.
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.760]   I like the light.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:34.760]   Yeah, you got material.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.760]   We did that. Anthony Nielsen do that.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.760]   Yeah, I believe so.
[00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.760]   Yeah, we've got material on our on our album art.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.760]   Well, you know what? We had to do that. We had to take this.
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.760]   There was this person on the album art.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.760]   Aw, you're killing me.
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:49.760]   You're killing me.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.760]   Abandon us.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.760]   Aw.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.760]   We have some residual feelings.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.760]   We're going to have to talk about this.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.760]   No, no, it's okay.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.760]   It's all good.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:00.760]   Okay.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.760]   You still like me.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:02.760]   I still love you.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:03.760]   That's the problem.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.760]   That's the problem.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:05.760]   I know.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.760]   I didn't like you. It wouldn't be a problem.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.760]   This is an unrequited podcast.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.760]   Yes.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.760]   You guys are too kind.
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.760]   Alan Eustis, thank you, Virgil, and the chatroom.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   Alan Eustis is the name.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.760]   Thank you.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.760]   Thank you.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   Google I/O, two days of inspirational talks, hands-on learning, and a chance to hear more about
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.760]   Google's latest developer products.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.760]   Developers really want to go to this, right?
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.760]   You know, this is where you find out what's going on.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.760]   Yeah, you want to go.
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:40.760]   You want to go to I/O because you know you're going to get some mad goodies that maybe no
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:42.760]   one else has.
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.760]   You know you're going to get to be in the room.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.760]   Listen, there have been a couple of I/Os that have been amazing.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:50.760]   The wave demonstration, I wasn't actually at that I/O, but that's when I decided I would
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:53.760]   start having the skydiving with Google.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:54.760]   Wow.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.760]   Amazing.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:56.760]   You have an opportunity to get that.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:02.760]   I mean, you've got to remember before anybody had Google Glass, Google Glass was really exciting.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:07.760]   You know, Android Wear, I mean, you're just first on some really, really cool technology.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.760]   Google--if you're a developer, you definitely want to go.
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:16.760]   Google's doing I/O extended events for developers who can't get to I/O or don't get tickets,
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:22.760]   so you'll be able to attend live, streamed sessions, local developer demos, hackathons,
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.760]   and more.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:31.120]   You intend to stream the keynote as they have before and they say select sessions as well.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:37.080]   So I think they really understand that people, not everybody can get to I/O.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:41.360]   I feel a little guilty taking up as a chair as an on developer, but I also find it just
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.760]   so telling as to what they're doing and how they're thinking.
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:51.040]   Jason, turn on the audio on my laptop because I just noticed on the website there's this
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:56.040]   little slider thing and when I tap it, it says Chrome Experiment Ahead.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:58.560]   The experiment features WebGL and Web Audio APIs.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:03.360]   You might want to grab headphones, have your audio up, make some noise.
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.040]   I just clicked make some noise.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.040]   Let's--oh!
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.040]   Oh!
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.040]   What am I seeing?
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:13.040]   Yeah, I have sites always so nerve-y.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.040]   There's always something here.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:22.160]   It's a keyboard.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.040]   Get ready to record.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:26.040]   Boy.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:33.040]   I'm playing.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.040]   That sucks.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.040]   What should I do?
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.040]   Scroll up and down.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.040]   Scroll.
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.040]   I can't scroll.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.040]   Okay.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:48.040]   Now, arrow and upper left.
[00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:51.040]   Oh!
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:56.040]   So you guys have already played with this, huh?
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:57.040]   Wow.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.040]   Jason.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.040]   I actually haven't played with this.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.040]   I knew that there was something going on here, but I hadn't checked it out yet.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.040]   Move the big circles.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.040]   Whoa.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.040]   Wow.
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.040]   So that they get hit by the dots.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:12.040]   Because every time they get hit by the dots, you get a drum beat.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:16.040]   Oh, this is very similar to an app called Node Beat.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.040]   Oh, you've seen something like this, huh?
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.040]   There's an Android app called Node Beat.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.040]   We had it on all that Android years ago.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.040]   Look at this.
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.040]   Look at this.
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.040]   In some ways.
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:29.040]   Look, this changes the beat.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.040]   What's very interesting here is this is all happening inside the browser, right?
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.040]   This is a WebGL.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:39.040]   So this is the Google I/O site, and I just happened to click a link.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.040]   So what else can I do?
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:45.040]   I ask you.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.040]   So should I record my...
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:52.040]   You ready to record?
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:58.040]   I'm such a nerd, but this is so cool.
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.040]   They always do this.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.040]   They always have something, right?
[00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:02.040]   They'll do this, yeah.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:07.040]   And in a way, it kind of is a little bit telegraphs the kinds of things we're going to see.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.040]   So what does this thing do?
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:11.040]   Oh, this is like a rubber band machine.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.040]   Oh, you're losing...
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:16.040]   Man, that is crazy that's happening in a browser.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:20.040]   That is all HTML.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:25.040]   So this is like, these are like rubber bands, and you put them in the peg holes, and then
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.040]   but what happens?
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.040]   And then I have to strum them.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:38.040]   See, I don't know how hard or easy this is to do.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:43.040]   But I bet you this is a lot of agile points to develop.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:48.040]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.040]   We need a lot of agile points here.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.040]   We need this functionality built into the new Twix site.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:57.040]   I'm going to call our developers and say, "Guys, I need the...
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.040]   Okay, should I record?"
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.040]   All right.
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:03.040]   I think you can get a new Twix theme this way.
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.040]   Yeah, this might be the new Twix theme.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:10.040]   This is Twix.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:11.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.040]   Does it have a higher pitch if I stretch it more?
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:16.040]   I can't.
[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:21.040]   All right.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.040]   Now what?
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:28.040]   I already did this one.
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:29.040]   I did this one.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.040]   That's it.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:32.040]   Now what do I do?
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:35.040]   Let's pause.
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:38.040]   Share song, reset to default, exit experiment.
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:43.040]   So it's just a little instrument there.
[00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.040]   So this is really cool.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:52.040]   But my cynical response to this is like every year that IO site has some crazy,
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:58.040]   cool Chrome experiment with this insanely dynamic neat functionality.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.040]   And Google does make beautiful Chrome experiments.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:06.040]   You just don't see anybody else making anything like this.
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.040]   It doesn't feel like it's working.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:12.040]   I think this is a really cool showcase of what's possible.
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:15.040]   I just don't see a whole lot of uptake on it.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.040]   That's a good point.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.040]   Unless I'm looking at the wrong sites.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:23.040]   And I'm not going to be able to do it.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.040]   I'm not going to be able to do it.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:28.040]   I'm not going to be able to do it.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.040]   I'm not going to be able to do it.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:34.040]   I'm not going to be able to do it.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.040]   I'm not going to be able to do it.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.040]   I'm not going to be able to do it.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.040]   I'm not going to be able to do it.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:43.040]   I'm not going to be able to do it.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.040]   I'm not going to be able to do it.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:50.040]   Is this somebody saying this is going to die when HTML5 comes along?
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:52.040]   Isn't this HTML5?
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:55.040]   It's a WebGL as a plugin.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.040]   WebGL is a plugin.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:02.040]   And Web Audio API would probably be an API within HTML5 I would guess.
[00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.040]   Right.
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:08.040]   But I think you'd have to have the, in other words, this only works in Chrome right now.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.040]   Right.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.040]   No other browsers.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.040]   No other browsers supports.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:18.040]   Or do any browsers besides Chrome support WebGL?
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.040]   It seems like a Googly thing.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.040]   That is a good question.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.040]   That's a good question.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.040]   Let's Google WebGL support.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.040]   I wonder how we could figure that out.
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:30.040]   Browsers that support WebGL.
[00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.040]   Apparently some browsers do.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.040]   Here's a table.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.040]   Eleven, IE 11 and up.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:42.040]   Firefox 35 and up.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:48.040]   iOS Safari 8.1 and up.
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:51.040]   Huh.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:53.040]   Chrome is way ahead there.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.040]   Light green is partial, partial support.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.040]   Red is no support.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:58.040]   Dark green is full support.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:02.040]   So, uh, opera light is a partial support.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:05.040]   Safari, actually Safari on the desktop partial support.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:08.040]   Safari on iOS full support oddly enough.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:09.040]   This is an interesting.
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:12.040]   Chrome, Android is partial support.
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.040]   It's harder to do.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:20.040]   Apple, if you want, if you want WebGL on a mobile device, get an iPhone.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.040]   Oddly enough.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.040]   Wacky.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:29.040]   Method of generating dynamic 3D graphics using JavaScript accelerated through hardware.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:32.040]   That's what WebGL is.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.040]   That's all.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:38.040]   And this is in the US.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.040]   But that's for market share.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.040]   No, that's global market share.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.040]   Huh.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:45.040]   There you go.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.040]   Wow.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:48.040]   It's amazing what you can learn these days.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.040]   All right.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.040]   Moving along.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.040]   So you're, we'll all try to go to Google I/O.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:54.040]   We will certainly cover the keynote or notes live.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:56.040]   Thursday and Friday is great.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.040]   Thank you, Google.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:02.040]   Usually they've overlapped with this weekend Google, but now we can, uh, we'll, they'll
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:06.040]   be out of our way and we'll be out of their way.
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.040]   Google has added a virtual genius bar.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.040]   Have you seen this?
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.040]   I think it's trademarked.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.040]   Sure.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.040]   They're actually using a help outs.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.040]   It's called Google device experts.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.040]   Uh, it's kind of like made a from Google.
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.040]   Mm hmm.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.320]   So, uh, employees involved with the service told TechCrunch, it's been in testing since
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.040]   November.
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:34.040]   Google spokesperson has said we're in a limited trial of an experimental support feature
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:38.040]   gathering feedback, not yet ready to share a full plan.
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:40.040]   Is this the thing we call that day?
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.040]   No, it's different.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:44.040]   This is in the devices section of Google Play.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:47.040]   So you're in, you're on the web.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.040]   You're in Google Play in the devices section.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:54.040]   Click the help icon top right corner and then under contact us there will appear a video
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:59:00.040]   call button and that will give you a Google Hangouts with a Google expert who can help
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.040]   you.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.040]   So we can't call anybody now?
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.040]   Well, I can try it.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.040]   They say you can share your screen.
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:07.040]   So this is very much like Mayday, isn't it?
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:08.040]   Mm hmm.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:10.040]   So let's go to play.google.com and see what we can do.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.040]   I don't think it's rolled out yet.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:14.040]   I think it's just something they've spotted.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.040]   So there's devices.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.040]   Here's help.
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:21.040]   Um, is video call.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:22.040]   Video call.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:23.040]   Video call.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.040]   Yep.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:25.040]   How can we help you?
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.040]   Um, what do I need?
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.040]   Uh, can.
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.040]   Broke my Nexus 6.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.040]   I'm going to use.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:34.040]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:38.040]   Can I use, um, Skype on Chrome OS?
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:39.040]   Skype?
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:41.040]   Oh, right.
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.040]   From OS.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.040]   Question mark.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:46.040]   Start a video call.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.040]   Wow.
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:48.040]   Sorry.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:49.040]   This is going to be good.
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.040]   I'm trying to troll them, but you know, why not?
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.040]   You're the first one here.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.040]   Ready to join.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:59.040]   Now, I think, uh, would you like to share your screen?
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.040]   We have to kind of tell somehow.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.040]   Don't show this.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:07.040]   We have to tell them we're doing this before we actually do it somehow.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.040]   Uh, share my screen.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:15.040]   Um, Google, hey, I just sharing your screen with plus.google.com.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:18.040]   You are screen sharing present to everyone, but I'm not.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:22.040]   They hear my audio, but no one is coming in the room.
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.040]   Oh, they're, they're getting something out of the microwave.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.040]   Oh, hey.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040]   How you doing?
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.040]   Can I?
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.040]   I'm on a don't play as audio yet.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.040]   I'm on a podcast called this week in Google.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.960]   My name is Leo and I'm wondering if I can show people, because we're showing people this
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:39.960]   new feature.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.040]   If I could show people your screen and, uh, and we can record your voice.
[01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:49.040]   But Doug, before I can show this, I need your permission to record it.
[01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:51.040]   Go for it, Leo.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040]   Go for it, Leo.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.040]   All right.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.040]   Thank you, Doug.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.040]   So everybody's going to see you now.
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.040]   Uh, yes.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:00.040]   And I have nothing confidential on my screen, so go ahead and look at it.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:01.040]   I will.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.040]   Thank you for sharing your screen.
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.040]   But yeah, I saw that you had a question about using Skype on Chrome OS.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.040]   Yeah, can I?
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:10.040]   Um, so currently Skype is currently not supported on Chrome OS.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:16.640]   There are however great alternatives for video chatting on Chrome, on Chromebooks as well,
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:22.040]   as well as, um, as well as communication apps that are available on the Chrome Web Store,
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:23.040]   including Hangouts.
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.040]   Are you familiar with Hangouts?
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.040]   I am.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.040]   Hangouts.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.040]   In fact, we're using this as help outs, isn't it?
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.040]   Isn't that what we're using right now?
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:32.040]   Um, we're actually, we're on a Hangout right now.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:36.240]   I know Hangouts is, um, kind of similar to Hangouts, but we're actually just straight
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.240]   up on Hangout.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.760]   This is plain old Hangout.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.040]   And Doug, are you, uh, where are you a Google employee or are you a third party or?
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.600]   Yeah, I work at Google.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.200]   We're here in beautiful Mountain View.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:47.200]   You're in Mountain View.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.440]   I love your set.
[01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:52.240]   That looks so cool with the Android stuff there.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.400]   You know, we are very googly here at Google.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.400]   I know.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.720]   How many, how many of, do you know how many of you are there doing this?
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.520]   Um, I know we have a, we do have a small team.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.360]   I wouldn't be able to put a number to it though.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.720]   I'm really bad at math and counting.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.720]   That's okay.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:11.320]   But there are other people and you're all kind of near each other doing this?
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.800]   Um, yeah, kind of.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:18.240]   I'm, I'm not too sure how big the team is, but I do have my own team here and we are
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.800]   all kind of our team of device experts.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.880]   Now, did you, were you a Google employee before this or were you hired specifically
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:25.880]   to do this kind of support?
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:31.040]   Um, you know, actually, because you're kind of our press, we do kind of.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.040]   You can't talk to me.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.040]   I understand.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.520]   Doug, I do have a link for you if you like, if you like.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.840]   It's a press at Google.com.
[01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.720]   Yeah, I'm familiar with that.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.680]   And I apologize for ambushing you, but that's why we asked you.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.680]   Um, not all.
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:45.880]   I'm just curious if I can help spread the word or kind of.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.880]   Well, you are.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.880]   That's what we're doing with us.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:48.880]   Is that cool?
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:49.880]   We're doing.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:50.880]   Yeah, lots of people now are going to try this out.
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:54.560]   I heard that link with me and I could just, it was in a little window down here and I
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.680]   could just click that to go to press.google.com.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.680]   That was cool.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:02:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:00.680]   Hey, this is really neat.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:01.680]   Hey, Doug, you're great.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.680]   Would it be a cool host?
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:03.680]   You speak of Google?
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.840]   Yeah, we could hire you as a host.
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.840]   This week in Google, we've got to replace Gina here.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.720]   Hey, it's very nice to meet you, Doug.
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:09.880]   I really appreciate it.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.880]   Thank you.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.120]   Um, it was really great talking to you, Leo.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.120]   All right.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.720]   It's a great demo of what you guys can do.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:16.720]   Thanks.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.720]   Thank you very much.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.720]   Take care.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:19.720]   If you have any help, go ahead and shoot us another hangout.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:20.720]   I will.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.720]   I love it.
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:22.720]   Hi, Doug.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.720]   Hi, Doug.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.720]   That is so cool.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.720]   That is great.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.040]   You were really good sport.
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.040]   That never gets old.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.280]   Calling Google support on this show never gets old.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.680]   Oh, I know you did it first on all of that.
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.000]   No, no, no, no, but I think it's great.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.240]   I think it's awesome.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.000]   And I would imagine you guys are pretty darn impressed as impressed as I am because for
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.800]   the longest time Google and support have not been two words that have shared, like,
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.640]   human, been associated with good.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.360]   But both of these times that we've done it on this show, the response has been super
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.360]   quick.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.800]   They've, you know, I'm sure if we would have dove in with a, you know, pretty hard work
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.600]   question, probably would have got a good answer.
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.600]   I'm pretty impressed.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.400]   By the way, he did not refer to a notebook or anything.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:06.760]   At least not that I could see.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.920]   He knew the answer.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.960]   Yeah, he wasn't doing a slow page.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:11.360]   Yeah, let me go to.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:19.600]   So, so you do that by going to the play store and, um, clicking the question mark icon.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.880]   And then under contact us, there's a video call.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:23.880]   At least there was online.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.960]   There's also live chat and phone.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.160]   And that is impressive for people who have in the past said, Oh, I don't know.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.320]   I can't get support from Google.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:36.080]   Now they don't do this for Gmail, um, and stuff like this.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.920]   Although he did answer a question about Chrome OS.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.920]   Yeah, you did.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.920]   Wow.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.920]   That is a close one.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.760]   I guess that's well, they sell Chromebooks here.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:52.800]   So, you know, but they sell products here that are covered the entire spectrum of Google
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.800]   stuff.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.680]   Now, if I, if I've been obnoxious, I could have asked whether there's any possible use
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.600]   for my Google Glass.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.600]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:04.240]   Uh, because glasses is still available in the store and no, it's not.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.240]   You can't buy.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.640]   I think they just have it there.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:09.800]   But I think they would still support it if you asked.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:11.320]   And then let's, let's just for the record.
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:15.840]   Anybody listen to Google, don't get the guy in trouble for not going to press first.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.760]   He was a great demo of the product.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.520]   This was a wonderful thing to do.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.440]   Uh, he was, uh, he was wonderful.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.440]   Yeah.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.240]   I feel like he, he pretty, like at the appropriate moments.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.240]   He handled it beautifully.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.240]   He handled it beautifully.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.240]   Yeah, beautifully.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:34.360]   And I think it was good for people to see in real time what it looked like to actually
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.160]   make a call, how long it took.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.080]   And I apologize, you know, we're in the state of California, which is what they call
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.440]   a two party state.
[01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:45.280]   We cannot in any way broadcast the audio or video of the call until we have permission
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:49.280]   unfortunately, in order to do that, I, they had to do it up a little bit.
[01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.400]   Yeah, I had to put it up in just a tiny bit.
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.040]   So, uh, we can edit that out or something.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.600]   But, uh, yeah.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.840]   So the live audience got a little, little leak of something that they shouldn't have.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:03.840]   But, um, I thought he did very nicely at that.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:07.280]   And he could have said, no, you know, you can't, like, if you're pressed, I'm sorry.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.280]   I can't talk to you.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.160]   But, but I think it was appropriate that he did what he did.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.280]   We got a very good exact idea of what could happen.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:14.880]   It's the great thing is Google is indeed human.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.400]   There is a human face of Google love and varied human.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.400]   Nice.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.400]   I liked him.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.400]   Nice guy.
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.400]   Nice teacher.
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.400]   He was standing up, which is impressive.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.400]   That's an interesting choice.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.680]   That's a conscious choice, right?
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.200]   Obviously he's not standing right now.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.840]   He's waiting for somebody else to call.
[01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:35.280]   He's obviously standing on a set with, with lighting and background and yeah, that's certainly
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.800]   better than mine with the sun setting and my light changing.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:40.160]   But yeah, now he was, he was ready and set up.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.440]   So that was device support, right?
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.160]   He said this is, I'm support for devices.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:48.560]   What I'd like to see is somebody whose Gmail account was shut down because of a terms of
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.600]   service violation or somebody's AdSense account that's in some sort of suspended state.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:58.080]   I would like to hear the script or the response to, hey, I can't log into my Gmail account.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.080]   I'm locked out.
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.280]   You know, what, what happened?
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:04.840]   Well, it's interesting too, is that having an employee in Mountain View, that's a very
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.440]   high expense item.
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:07.440]   No kidding.
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.440]   Real estate and stuff.
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.440]   No kidding.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.440]   That's interesting.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:14.520]   Maybe it's just a test and they're figuring it out, but that surprises me.
[01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.080]   But good.
[01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.800]   That's what they need to do.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:26.080]   Chickenhead two in our chicken had 21 in our chair and says, you should show this to Comcast.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.720]   Oh, Comcast.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:32.400]   Actually, I want to show Comcast Google's new robotic dog.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.960]   This thing is so cool.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:35.960]   Boston Dynamics.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.360]   That's the one that did that crazy running robot.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.680]   They've got a new one.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.120]   This is called spot.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:44.400]   Google owns this company.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:48.880]   So, oh, he's so cute.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:54.000]   Notice by the way, the previous running robots had big long wires attached to them.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.800]   This guy does not know he's wireless.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:56.800]   Yeah, wireless.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:00.360]   Look, he's coming to bother people.
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:01.360]   They just ignore the dog.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.360]   No big deal.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:03.360]   Nobody.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.360]   We see this all the time.
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:05.360]   Look, he kicked it.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.160]   I feel so bad about them kicking this dog.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.160]   I know.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.160]   I totally agree.
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:12.160]   I just forget this one right here.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.160]   I'm just like, on ice.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.840]   That was nice to do to the robot.
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.600]   But that shows you how I don't want to say anthropomorphic because it's a dog, but how
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.760]   realistically you kind of assume this is a live creature.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:22.760]   Yeah, I know.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:23.760]   Because it's not.
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:24.760]   It's just a machine.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:25.960]   You kick your computer all the time, right?
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:28.160]   It's just a computer with less.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:29.160]   Sometimes.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.960]   Walking on ice on gravel.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960]   Look at this.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.640]   And again, can we hear audio?
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.640]   I have audio potted up, but I don't know.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.640]   I don't hear the.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.640]   [SOUND]
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.440]   We heard with the other robotic dog.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:44.280]   Is there a volume in the player?
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:46.040]   Maybe I don't have the player turned up.
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.040]   Let me turn on the audio.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.040]   Let's see.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:51.040]   It's pretty quiet.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:53.040]   What could be for a wheelchair?
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.040]   What is a wheelchair?
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:56.040]   What would that be?
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.040]   Well, didn't--
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.040]   It's a trot.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:01.640]   The guy who created the Segway created a wheelchair that could go upstairs like that.
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:02.640]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.640]   It can run along.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:04.640]   Oh, that's so cute.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.640]   Well, no, that looks like stormtroopers.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.640]   Yeah.
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.640]   Do you look like stormtroopers?
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.640]   Yeah, I'm coming for you.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.640]   Here we are, human.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:17.640]   Puponi humans.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.640]   You rang?
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:21.880]   Fire rocket guns.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.640]   The future of war.
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:24.640]   Wow.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.640]   Yeah, that's pretty terrifying.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.640]   Actually.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:32.640]   God, what would you do if you had an army of those things headed right towards you?
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.960]   No, I just wanted to carry my groceries home.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.320]   Remember Boston Dynamics?
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:44.240]   Before they bought Boston Dynamics, the company did have, in fact, some defense contracts.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.680]   So this is-- what is that?
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.680]   A pig?
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.280]   It's a motorized pig.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:53.000]   And so-- and I think Google said that whatever contracts existing contracts they had, they
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.240]   would continue.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.920]   No robots were harmed.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:56.920]   Show this.
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.920]   The making of this video.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:58.920]   Oh.
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:02.600]   It knows that the kicking, the kicking is disturbing.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.040]   It's very disturbing.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.840]   So this has got to be electric.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.240]   They've come a long way.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.240]   What was that noisy when it was at a gas engine or the--
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.080]   That was the one that looked like a pig.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.360]   But there was the-- what was noisier?
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.400]   Was that because it was a gas engine?
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.600]   I think it must have been, yeah.
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.600]   Wow.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:25.920]   It's got lidar on the head.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.600]   See that spinning thing?
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.600]   That's how it sees.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.560]   The beast is self-driving car when you have a self-driving--
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:33.560]   It's just sort of sad.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.160]   It just kind of gets back up and keeps up.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.160]   Like go ahead.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.160]   Kick me again.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.160]   That's cool.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.160]   Kick me again, man.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.160]   Fine, whatever.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:44.080]   The good news is these robots have four minutes battery life.
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:47.680]   So all you have to do is run for four minutes and you're OK.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:48.680]   Wow.
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.680]   All right.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.920]   I can watch these for hours.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:52.920]   I know.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:57.360]   I'm actually rerunning the video just because we like it so very, very much.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.800]   Our show today brought to you by makes me want a nap.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:04.040]   So thank God I have my Casper ready to hand.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:07.400]   Our show today brought to you by my new mattress from Casper.com.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.960]   Who would ever think you'd be buying-- but who would ever think you'd see walking robotic
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.960]   dogs?
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.520]   Who would ever think you'd be buying mattresses on a website?
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:17.000]   Don't you want to lie on the mattress you might ask?
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   How about this?
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.240]   Of course you want to lie on the mattress before you buy it.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:25.200]   But the problem is five minutes on a mattress in a showroom with the saleswoman looking down
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.880]   her nose at you is no way to test a mattress.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.480]   With Casper, you get free delivery in 100 days.
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:35.640]   100 days to sleep on that thing, 100 nights to decide if you want it.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:40.520]   And then if you don't, painless returns, they'll take-- they come and they get it and it's
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.520]   fine.
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.720]   You know, you get your money back.
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.120]   It's completely risk-free.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:47.760]   The Casper mattresses are long lasting.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.480]   They're comfortable.
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:51.280]   There's good back support.
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:57.000]   They combine memory foam, nice firm memory foam with latex-- I mean, sorry, nice firm latex
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   with memory foam.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.520]   So it conforms to your body but gives you a nice support.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:06.520]   You can see I'm very comfortable on my new Casper mattress.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.680]   They're made in the USA.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.600]   They are premium mattresses.
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:13.440]   But by eliminating the resellers, the showrooms, they save you a lot of money.
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:17.800]   Casper mattresses start at $500 for a twin, $950 for a king size.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:24.440]   And we're going to give you $50 if you use the offer code TWIG, TWIG at Casper.com/Twig.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.720]   Even Aussie loves their Casper mattress.
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.720]   I liked it so much.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.120]   I got one for my son.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.920]   He's in college and living off campus.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.160]   He needed a mattress.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:34.160]   No way.
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:35.160]   He's on the third floor.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.600]   They were going to get a full-size mattress up three stairs.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.080]   So three flights of stairs.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:39.080]   So we got him at Casper.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.880]   He loves it.
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.880]   Casper.com/Twig.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.520]   He says, "Dad, I sleep on every night."
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.520]   I said, "Really?
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:46.520]   Every night?"
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:50.320]   Well, most nights, Casper.com/Twig.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.360]   Say, "50 dollars when you use the offer code TWIG."
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.800]   I'm telling you, I love my Casper.
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.360]   You will too.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.160]   Do you think maybe it might be time for some trumpets?
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.160]   I'm so sorry.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.760]   I didn't even think of that.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:05.760]   You want to throw it out of a mouth?
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.440]   You got Gee, can we do the change log?
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:13.640]   The gurgle change log.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:17.840]   Our live studio audience is applauding three of them.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:20.480]   I've got some music to my ears.
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.880]   Have you guys have not-- have those trumpets been retired?
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:23.880]   Yes.
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:24.880]   What's your change log with that?
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:30.520]   Gee, the turranis here with the latest from Google.
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:35.120]   Google takes on Yelp elites with its new local guides program.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:40.240]   This is a new feature in Google Maps where you can opt in to become a local guide if you
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:43.760]   go to google.com/local/guides.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:49.480]   And it's a program that's meant to kind of encourage people to go out and post well-written
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:52.520]   and informed reviews for local places.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:57.560]   And basically, if you opt in to become a local guide, you get a couple of benefits.
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.080]   You get access to a special email newsletter, an opportunity to join Hangouts with other
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.080]   reviewers.
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.120]   You get to host and attend special events.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:08.720]   You get to moderate local guides, Google+ communities.
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:15.080]   Google just gives you a couple of goodies here and there for beefing up their reviews.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:18.080]   So if you're into that, like I said, google.com/local/guides.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.120]   It's very similar to Yelp's elite program.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.880]   If you're looking for a little bit more Google Drive storage, you can get two gigabytes of
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:31.960]   extra drive space for free by completing Google's security checkup.
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:33.880]   This is just a little quiz, it seems like.
[01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:35.680]   I haven't had a chance to run through it myself.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.440]   That basically checks to make sure that your Google settings are up to date, your security
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:40.880]   settings and privacy settings.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:43.160]   So you'll run through a couple of checks that will make you easier.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.160]   It's very simple.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.160]   I did it.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:49.560]   It takes two seconds just to make sure that you have a backup phone number and email address
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.160]   in case you get hacked.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:59.280]   Make sure that it shows you where your authorizations are so that you can review that and you get
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.280]   the habit of it.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.280]   It's very simple.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:04.600]   Yeah, it looks like this is just stuff that you should be doing anyway, but Google's just
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.320]   sweetening the pot a little bit by often.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.320]   It's extra two gigabytes.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:12.760]   Yeah, it's my view is I think that if you do two-step authentication, they all said
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.240]   you had a t-shirt.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.600]   Yeah, seriously.
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.120]   This was for safer internet day.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.120]   That's kind of neat.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.120]   Yeah, cool.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:21.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.240]   We talked about that on Sunday because Larry Maggid was one of the guys behind it and
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:30.800]   was down there at Facebook with Cheryl and a bunch of other people to promote this.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.880]   So thank you, Google, for participating in safer internet day.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:36.040]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:39.800]   It also shows how much two gigs has been devalued to look out.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:40.800]   Yeah, seriously.
[01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:42.840]   I will give you two gigabytes.
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.400]   It's like as an age green stage.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:49.680]   So I didn't even have to do anything.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.280]   I just got three checkmarks just because I'd already done that.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.280]   Boom, boom, boom.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.080]   I'll do you recently had said, yes, my recovery information is correct.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.160]   My recent sign-in activity looks good.
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.720]   Yeah, I do that all the time.
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.560]   Yeah, and I'm sure you surely you have two.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.320]   So wait, does it check to see if you have two factor enabled?
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:08.000]   Oh, that seems kind of advanced.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   It does.
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.680]   It's not they're not requiring you to do that, which is too bad.
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:12.680]   It's too bad.
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:14.480]   Two factor is it's a lot.
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.480]   I guess.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:18.160]   You expect a regular of normals still.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.160]   Grandma.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:24.320]   They also have this nice safety center that shows you how to prevent cyber crime, manage
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.600]   your privacy and safety and security.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.240]   And then there's safety tools here.
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.200]   These are all the tools that Google offers.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.200]   This is great.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.040]   Love this.
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.040]   Nice.
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:43.280]   Speaking of Google giveaways, if you've got a Chromecast, Google wants to give you six
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.440]   bucks and play store credits.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.440]   And it works.
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.440]   I did it.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:50.440]   Two Chromecast, two six bucks.
[01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:52.240]   I have three Chromecast.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.360]   Yeah, you can eat your bucks.
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:58.560]   Yeah, so you just have to be on the network that your Chromecast is.
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:04.160]   And if you go into the Chromecast app on iOS or Android, you can go to the check for offers
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:05.160]   button.
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:08.120]   It's under it's in the hamburger menu, I believe.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:11.000]   And if you check for offers, there's often a few different things in there, but this
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.720]   offer is basically it's a six dollar gift card to Google Play.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:18.800]   I mean, I guess they're hoping that you're going to rent a movie for Valentine's Day,
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.640]   a guest or buy something from the Play Store.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   Didn't we get something just when we bought the Google Chromecast?
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.400]   Yeah, at this point, the Chromecast is, at least in the US, is pretty much paid for
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.400]   its own day watch.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.560]   I think I made money.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.560]   Yeah.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:37.360]   I mean, Google has been, I've just been pretty impressed with how loosely they're giving
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.760]   away content.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:43.600]   X-Men also, if you log in to the offers page with your Chromecast, they're offering the
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.440]   first X-Men movie for free in HD.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:49.560]   Just a bunch of free content that they keep giving away.
[01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:53.960]   By the way, just real quickly, if you have two factor turned on, I just redid the security
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:58.720]   checkup, they do have you go through the two factor settings and verification.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.920]   So I actually have five check marks.
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:04.520]   Oh, fancy hands.
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:06.520]   You're super safe.
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:12.160]   It's worth doing this though, because it does remind you of what apps you've permitted,
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.880]   Android devices you're using and things like that.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.440]   It's good to do this.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.560]   And six, how do we get our six bucks?
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:25.600]   Six bucks is in that you want to go into the Chromecast app on your mobile device.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:28.440]   You should be connected to the same network that your Chromecast is on.
[01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:29.440]   Cool.
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.720]   I think, you know, look, the reality is that these giveaways that they really want people
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.240]   to use the Play Store more.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:35.240]   Right.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.240]   And I think it's about movies and TV.
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:37.240]   More than it is about Chromecast.
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:38.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:41.360]   More than it is about apps or devices.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:44.200]   So I mean, if I had an extra six bucks and I never bought from the Play Store before,
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.400]   I might rent a movie.
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.400]   Right.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.000]   And then once you start to sort of a mass library in the Play Store, it's like, okay,
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.400]   you know, at this point I've got libraries.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.520]   I've got iTunes videos that I purchased.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:57.120]   I've got Amazon, you know, Prime instant video.
[01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.120]   I've got Google Play.
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.120]   I'm like, where?
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.120]   I know I have this movie, but which one is it?
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:05.240]   You have to check me, you know, all the different places.
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.240]   Is that it?
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.240]   That's it.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.240]   That's all I got.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.240]   It's the cue.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.240]   Play the Trippanis.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.240]   Trippanis.
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:12.240]   Trippanis.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:13.240]   Trippanis.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.240]   We call them Trippanis now.
[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:16.240]   The Trippanis.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.240]   Trippanis.
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:20.240]   That's the Google change log.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.480]   Oh, we missed it.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.480]   We missed it.
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.480]   Nice to have.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:26.640]   See why we like to change the look of that.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:27.960]   You made us money.
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.640]   You got me gigs.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.640]   Really good.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:34.880]   Thank you to Jason for putting that together because I was utterly unprepared.
[01:19:34.880 --> 01:19:36.360]   So thank you, Jason.
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:38.040]   You know what?
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:41.480]   Jason, unfortunately, he's so good that I've stopped doing any work at all.
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.480]   It's all right.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.480]   I have my sources.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.240]   I just go, what happened today?
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.760]   And he tells me it's great.
[01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:49.760]   It's great.
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.680]   Here's one that Jason actually guys talked about last night.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:52.680]   No, we didn't.
[01:19:52.680 --> 01:19:54.320]   This actually popped up today.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.920]   What's up with Android Wear?
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.720]   What's the story?
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:05.880]   Research firm Canala says only 720,000 Android Wear watches were shipped in the last six
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.240]   months of 2014.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:13.080]   That's the same period that Apple sold 114 million iPhones.
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:17.640]   You can pretty much guarantee that they'll sell more than a million Apple watches in the
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:21.360]   first day, I would guess.
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:27.720]   Does this mean Android Wear is as research analyst, a Canala says, not very good?
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:28.720]   No.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:31.520]   No, you dope.
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:32.880]   We love Android Wear.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:36.600]   In fact, I think it's very good.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:41.080]   He says the battery life is one of the reasons they haven't taken off arguing Google should
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:45.760]   have further streamlined the mobile operating system so they can last longer than a day.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.760]   Why?
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.760]   It's we threw every day.
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:48.760]   I don't think longer than a day.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.080]   I don't know where that comes from.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.440]   I've heard real people say it too.
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:55.040]   But don't you plug in your phone at night when you go to bed?
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:58.280]   Don't you put your watch on the stand at night when you go to bed?
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.240]   I mean, it's just what we do now.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.520]   Yeah, you have a pebble, Chris.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:03.520]   Chris has shaken his head.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:09.480]   But you have a pebble and your pebble can't do doodly did diddly squat and it's not even
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:14.640]   in color and you don't have a sweet second hand.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:19.040]   You don't have a touch screen or a touch screen and you can't talk to your pebble.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.600]   I think that actually Android Wear is really good.
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:22.600]   I think it is too.
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:23.600]   But we shall see.
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:26.480]   Jason's note in the law is your right.
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.280]   Jason made a great note.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.760]   So that's the number of iPod sold in 2001.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:38.040]   It was 125,000, one-eighth of that or whatever, one-six of that.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:45.080]   I mean, between 2001 and 2002, iPod sold 725,000 units, which is roughly about the same as
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:46.080]   this.
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.080]   Two years.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.080]   Two years.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:53.040]   And you know, they're comparing it against the iPhone, which, you know, they're different
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:54.040]   categories.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:58.140]   I just don't know if it's a very fair comparison to compare a watch, which is an accessory
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:21:59.380]   that ties to something.
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:00.960]   Well, here's an iPhone that's like this.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:06.660]   I do have to say though, the comparison that will be, will be relatively important is in
[01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:08.860]   April when the Apple Watch comes out.
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:15.880]   And you know, yeah, I even, I even, the lemmings, the lemmings are going to run to the store.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:17.260]   I even switched to an iPhone.
[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:22.340]   So I get used to this so that I can buy the Apple Watch when it comes out.
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:24.660]   Well, but then you have Tim Cook.
[01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:27.420]   Well, I thought was, I thought these quotes were a little obnoxious.
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:28.620]   He gave a keynote this week.
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:30.320]   He basically said, there's no such thing.
[01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:33.400]   Nothing you'd call a smart watch yet.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:35.400]   And I don't think that's fair.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.040]   I think that the Moto 360 is great.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.040]   And it too.
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:43.940]   They also said that Sydney is the new cancer.
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:49.720]   So that your Apple Watch is going to buzz at you and bug you if you sit for too long.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:50.880]   No thanks, Apple.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:51.880]   No, what?
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:52.880]   See, yeah.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:53.880]   Many of the new cancer.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.080]   You can turn that off.
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.320]   You can turn that off.
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.980]   I know, but I thought it was obnoxious.
[01:22:58.980 --> 01:23:03.220]   Well, it makes in the shops proud.
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:10.020]   I mean, you know, that kind of trash talk is kind of what Apple does.
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:12.060]   I just added to the rundown.
[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:16.340]   My friend Paul Ford wrote a piece on Medium actually about it's called it's kind of cheesy
[01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:17.420]   being green.
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:18.420]   And I didn't even know this.
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:23.020]   And I do use iOS a little bit, but he was pointing out that when you use iOS and you
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:28.340]   get an I message from someone else using an iOS device that the bubbles are blue.
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:34.340]   But if someone is using another operating system quote unquote, this bright, bright
[01:23:34.340 --> 01:23:39.740]   green and that he did this search on Twitter of people basically saying that, you know,
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:43.620]   that they hate green and if somebody texts them back and it's green that they judge them
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:45.940]   they never gave it a raise in green.
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:48.220]   Of course, is ridiculous, right?
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:52.780]   But he was saying that he really feels like Apple sort of reinforces this weird, this
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:54.980]   kind of weird class war.
[01:23:54.980 --> 01:23:58.340]   This is a great line of the last paragraph.
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:01.620]   It would probably be one line of code to change the color to reduce the tension between
[01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:06.380]   the blues and the greens to make it possible for a broke dude stuck on Android 4.1 jelly
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:09.300]   bean to Mac on a rich girl with an iPhone six.
[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:14.220]   That's for knowing that he's not in the same ecosystem.
[01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:15.740]   That is a really interesting point.
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:21.260]   I mean, I think it's I don't think Apple's trying to dis the other phones.
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:28.140]   So I just want you to know that this is an SMS message versus a web based an internet
[01:24:28.140 --> 01:24:30.980]   based text message, right?
[01:24:30.980 --> 01:24:31.980]   Right.
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:33.700]   So the blue means that it came over the internet.
[01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:37.140]   It didn't come through your cell carries SMS system.
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:38.660]   Right, right, right.
[01:24:38.660 --> 01:24:40.060]   And that's probably that's true.
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:41.060]   You can argue that.
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:45.980]   It's an SMS versus an iMessage, but it is really a pretty strong indicator.
[01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:48.620]   Oh, this person's an iOS or not, right?
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:54.340]   You know, yeah, when you get a green message and it's interesting that it's green because
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:55.980]   Android is green.
[01:24:55.980 --> 01:25:00.420]   And I had no idea that people didn't like the green bubbles that that it was such a
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:01.580]   different look at these tweets.
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:02.580]   People are so mean.
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:04.820]   People are mean, right?
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:06.420]   Mean.
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:11.060]   It's so awful, but I stopped trusting a person once I text him in its green bubbles.
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:15.740]   Oh, yeah, it's a little bit how I feel when I counter someone with an AOL email address,
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:16.740]   right?
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:18.660]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:20.180]   I mean, we all do it.
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:23.380]   We all have these brand associations and judge people a little bit by them, right?
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:27.100]   Sarah tweets, I'll never seriously date a guy who texts with green bubbles.
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:30.460]   I'm sorry, but never.
[01:25:30.460 --> 01:25:34.900]   Elvin, which what kind of name is Elvin?
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:41.500]   Elvin Broke says when she texts you back, even though you got green bubbles, you smile
[01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:43.260]   like you know, like a disease.
[01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:45.660]   I got the green bubbles.
[01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:49.500]   Do you respect me even though I'm on Android?
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.780]   Not really now that I think about it.
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:52.780]   Wow.
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:53.780]   Wow.
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:54.780]   Wow.
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:59.380]   I had to share this piece.
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:00.380]   Thank you.
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:08.820]   That's a very easy to do.
[01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:09.980]   It's just very easy using bedley.
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:14.140]   So you don't put any embed codes that you just put the URL of the thing you want to embed
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.140]   in.
[01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:16.140]   And it what's there?
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:18.140]   And these are the Twitter cards.
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:21.660]   So Don Macley knows Twitter cards.
[01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:24.540]   I think medium and Twitter probably talk once in a while.
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:26.380]   Yeah, yeah, because it's at Williams.
[01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:28.420]   I've heard he had something to do with Twitter.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:30.020]   There are a couple of different common there.
[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:34.940]   By the way, Ed Dumble, we love he is a deep data guy and a Riley guy.
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.060]   And he's been on our shows.
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:40.860]   And so he's the one who actually discovered the green bubbles.
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:42.380]   Oh, his head.
[01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:44.020]   It was Ed.
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:45.020]   Too legit to quit.
[01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:48.660]   I can't deal with you if you still have green bubbles.
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:50.100]   What can't deal?
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:52.860]   No, that's stupid.
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:56.940]   People will find any reason to be discriminatory green bubbles.
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:59.940]   We're still living in the I'm a PC era, right?
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:00.940]   The hips.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:01.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:02.940]   Yeah.
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:05.180]   Although, OK, I'm just going to say.
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:06.180]   Oh, boy.
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:07.180]   Here we go.
[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:08.500]   I'm using the iPhone.
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.540]   There's two things that are great.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:12.660]   One is the touch ID really works.
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.540]   And that's really nice to unlock stuff.
[01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:20.020]   And the other is messages is now, but it's totally wrong because it only works with people
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:23.340]   who have iOS and iOS 10 devices.
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:24.620]   But it is a nice way to communicate.
[01:27:24.620 --> 01:27:26.020]   You can do audio.
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:27.020]   You can.
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:29.180]   I mean, it's really it's a nice system.
[01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:30.860]   I mean, it's similar to Hangouts.
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:33.540]   I've never I haven't used I'm better than Hangouts.
[01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:36.020]   I wish I wish Google would add some features.
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:40.980]   Well, for instance, let's let's say I'm going to send a message to Lisa.
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:43.180]   I could, of course, text an I message.
[01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:46.020]   And if I tap in the text field, I'll get the keyboard.
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:48.420]   And just like Hangouts, I can attach a file.
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:49.420]   But look at this.
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:51.140]   See the little microphone here?
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:58.860]   If I press it, I could start recording a message to Lisa and then swipe up and it sends it.
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:00.540]   You can't do that on Hangouts.
[01:28:00.540 --> 01:28:04.740]   Well, I couldn't use Hangouts to type it for me without making you go to the trouble of
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:05.740]   listening to the darn thing.
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:07.140]   No, but you see how fast that was?
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:08.780]   Look at that.
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:10.980]   And it's not easier.
[01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:11.980]   Tation all the time.
[01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:12.980]   No, this isn't dictation.
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:13.980]   I'm sending her the audio.
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:18.420]   I prefer dictation because I would hate to have to listen to the audio.
[01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:22.180]   Do you prefer dictation or do you love hearing these great messages from me?
[01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:26.620]   Like, and then I send it.
[01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:27.620]   See?
[01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:28.620]   Oh, see.
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:29.620]   You're disgusting.
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:30.620]   You're disgusting.
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:31.620]   You're disgusting.
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:32.620]   Oh, geez.
[01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:36.460]   It says the old Mary people.
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:42.860]   OK, all right.
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:44.860]   Public displacement action.
[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:45.860]   Disgusting.
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:46.860]   Disgusting.
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:53.460]   No, but I do use Hangouts, which is a second class citizen on the iPhone, but it's not
[01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:56.860]   a completely second class citizen.
[01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:59.820]   But I find that little audio thing really sweet.
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:03.980]   Also, without any additional feature, I can just do.
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:10.300]   Use a messages on the desktop or the laptop or the iPad and those all work together.
[01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:14.820]   But it's only when somebody's in on a Mac, which is frustrating.
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:16.860]   I guess I could SMS somebody.
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:21.780]   Oh, but then you get green bubbles.
[01:29:21.780 --> 01:29:22.780]   I hate them.
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:23.780]   Green bubbles.
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:24.780]   Those green bubbles.
[01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:30.660]   Samsung is going to make a new Galaxy smartphone, which I presume they'll announce next month
[01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:38.540]   at mobile world Congress with not one, not two, but three screens.
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:42.780]   This is a story from again Bloomberg Business Week.
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:44.980]   We'll see a lot about phones.
[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:45.980]   How three?
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:47.500]   You got the main one, the curve, the third one.
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.540]   There'll be a curve on the left.
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:50.540]   Oh, both sides, right.
[01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:51.540]   Both sides.
[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:52.540]   So here's the problem.
[01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:57.380]   The reason I like the one curve, I never know easily which is upside down and right
[01:29:57.380 --> 01:29:58.380]   side off.
[01:29:58.380 --> 01:29:59.380]   But I picked you pick up the phone.
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:00.380]   Oh, you know that.
[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:01.380]   But you really know that.
[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:02.580]   It really does make sense.
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:06.180]   They ought to, you know, but believe it on one side.
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:11.340]   Samsung got a lot of attention doing the right thing, I think, which was putting a disclaimer
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:18.820]   in its, you know, user manual for the TV that Samsung Smart TV, some of them you can talk
[01:30:18.820 --> 01:30:20.940]   to, mine you can talk to.
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:26.300]   It says in the disclaimer, if you enable voice recognition to interact with your smart
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:30.340]   TV using your voice, some interactive voice commands may be transmitted along with information
[01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:35.420]   about your device, including device identity identifiers to a third party service provider,
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:40.860]   nuanced communications that converts your voice commands to text and to the extent necessary
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:43.700]   provide the voice recognition features to you.
[01:30:43.700 --> 01:30:48.860]   Google does the same thing when you say, okay, you know who, sorry, when you say, okay, you
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:52.460]   know who Google will be listed.
[01:30:52.460 --> 01:30:56.540]   The phone's not always sending it to Google, but as soon as you say, okay, or as soon as
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:31:01.860]   you say, hey, Siri, or press the button, it sends that back to Apple or to Google.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:04.460]   In this case, Samsung doesn't have a voice recognition department.
[01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:08.540]   So they sent it to Nuance, who by the way, provides a lot of the recognition for Apple
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:09.540]   as well.
[01:31:09.540 --> 01:31:13.220]   Samsung will collect your interactive voice commands only when you make a specific search
[01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:17.900]   request to the smart TV by clicking the activation button on the remote on your screen or speaking
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:19.500]   of the microphone or control.
[01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.940]   Now Samsung says, don't worry.
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:23.580]   That's non-ominis.
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:24.900]   Calm down.
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:27.340]   They do not monitor living room conversations.
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:29.180]   And of course they don't.
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:34.900]   But the wording in the in the in the year before was applied that.
[01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:37.940]   Well, it was translated badly, I think.
[01:31:37.940 --> 01:31:44.220]   And yeah, it applied that that's something you say because it said, be careful.
[01:31:44.220 --> 01:31:45.220]   That was the interesting thing.
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:51.100]   And I think that that was actually Samsung trying to do the right thing.
[01:31:51.100 --> 01:31:55.060]   In warning people, and we talked about this with the Steve Gibson yesterday on security
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:32:00.700]   now, I think that it's probably good to disclose what you're doing.
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:05.420]   And even to say, hey, if you this bothers you, turn this feature off because, you know,
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:09.100]   if you say sensitive things, it could be sent up to our servers.
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:13.420]   Well, and it probably is discoverable if in your divorce.
[01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:15.500]   Maybe, maybe not.
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:16.500]   I don't know.
[01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:19.980]   But I mean, so there's they want to be they want to limit their liability on the side
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:20.980]   of caution.
[01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:26.540]   But as you and everybody else knows, if you have an Xbox one in your living room and you
[01:32:26.540 --> 01:32:32.060]   say, OK, Xbox, it then starts listening and sends the content back to Microsoft.
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:37.380]   If you say, OK, G O O G L E, well, your phone will start listening and your browser will
[01:32:37.380 --> 01:32:39.860]   start listening and send the stuff back to Google.
[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:40.860]   That's how these work.
[01:32:40.860 --> 01:32:45.340]   They don't constantly stream it because that would be prohibitive.
[01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:46.340]   I don't know.
[01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:50.940]   I don't I feel like Samsung kind of got well, okay, Leo, here's here's I.
[01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:56.660]   There's this this security sheet now that everybody is supposed to put tape over the
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:59.420]   camera on their laptop to be tear up the show.
[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:00.420]   Right.
[01:33:00.420 --> 01:33:01.420]   I think it's ridiculous.
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:02.420]   Right.
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:05.860]   So so is this the same kind of thing that everybody should, you know, chop the ears
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:06.860]   off their TVs?
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:08.700]   Well, you it's very easy.
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:11.860]   And I think that to Samsung's credit, they explain it and then they said, and you can
[01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:12.860]   turn it off.
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:13.940]   Here's how you turn it off.
[01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:18.100]   And I actually have turned it off on my Samsung TV, not because I'm paranoid or worried
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:19.100]   about privacy.
[01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:21.180]   Because I don't I don't want it.
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:23.700]   I don't it does not a useful feature for me.
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.020]   But I love the Amazon Echo.
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:26.540]   We played with that same thing.
[01:33:26.540 --> 01:33:31.260]   When you say the word Alexa, it sits up, takes notice and then it will answer your question.
[01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:33.500]   And it does that by sending it back to Amazon.
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.300]   None of these devices can do it locally.
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:37.220]   They don't have enough brains.
[01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:38.740]   Certainly not your TV.
[01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:42.220]   However, this one I don't like.
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:45.700]   I don't know if this is true, but a number of owners of Samsung smart TVs and I am one
[01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:47.020]   and I haven't seen this.
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:52.660]   Say that their TV sets have started to interrupt their movie viewing with a Pepsi ad.
[01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.140]   What?
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:58.500]   They're dynamically inserting ads.
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:04.580]   If that's the case, I'm going to throw my $9,000 curved OLED TV out the window and cry.
[01:34:04.580 --> 01:34:09.300]   I'll be standing out your window with arms.
[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:11.500]   Arms wide open.
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:12.860]   You bought the TV.
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:14.220]   There's no reason I'm in many teams.
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:21.540]   The Panasonic Vira also has TV as banner ads, some of which play movies on the interface.
[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:24.040]   And you can disable some, but not all.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:31.340]   But for it to insert and add into a movie, I'm watching.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:34.700]   From your hard drive, these are like people watching a movie from.
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:37.540]   I'm plaques.
[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:42.820]   Samsung said, well, we're aware of a situation that has caused some sort of a problem.
[01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:48.340]   Smart TV users in Australia to experience program interruption in the form of an advertisement.
[01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:51.260]   This seems to be caused by an error.
[01:34:51.260 --> 01:34:54.740]   And we are currently conducting a full and thorough investigation into the cause.
[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:57.340]   It's only happening in Australia.
[01:34:57.340 --> 01:34:58.340]   We'd like to apologize.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:01.900]   And I have to say, I don't use plaques, but I've never seen a Pepsi ad inserted into any
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:06.260]   of my content on my Samsung smart TV.
[01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:08.780]   Might have to do with Fox tell.
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:12.740]   I don't know.
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:15.180]   There should not be ads on your TV anywhere.
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:17.780]   No, because you bought it.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:24.460]   Yeah, it's just a matter of time.
[01:35:24.460 --> 01:35:27.340]   Let's see anything else.
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:28.340]   Good news.
[01:35:28.340 --> 01:35:32.020]   We talked yesterday about the ProPublica article.
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:38.700]   Werner Koch, who is a German who has since 1999, been the one, mostly the one guy who
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:41.220]   supports GPG tools.
[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:42.220]   I use it.
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:43.900]   I love it.
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:50.460]   It is an open source version of PGP encryption for your email.
[01:35:50.460 --> 01:35:54.180]   And it could be used to sign other things and encrypt other things.
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:35:58.820]   And the article by Julia Angwin was just kind of broke my heart.
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:02.940]   He created a canoe privacy guard actually in '97.
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:06.180]   And since then, it's been almost single-handedly keeping alive with patches and updates from
[01:36:06.180 --> 01:36:08.220]   his home in Germany.
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:10.020]   I'm too idealistic, he says.
[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:13.940]   In early 2013, I was about ready to give it all up and take a straight job.
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:16.020]   But then the Snowden news broke.
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:19.860]   And I realized this is not the time to cancel.
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:20.860]   Thank goodness.
[01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:24.420]   He's been making about $25,000 a year since 2001.
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:31.020]   He did launch a fundraiser in December, which has raised $43,000.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:32.020]   Here's the good news.
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:39.340]   When this article came out, the Linux Foundation gave him a one-time grant of $60,000.
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:45.980]   Facebook and Stripe each pledged $50,000 a year to GPG tools.
[01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:50.900]   And donations flooded his site and he almost immediately reached his funding goal of $137,000.
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:55.900]   Oh, that's great.
[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:57.540]   So he's now got $300,000 more to support his efforts.
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:36:58.540]   And he deserves it.
[01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:00.740]   By the way, apparently there's a launch.
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:07.220]   This is the Deep Space Observatory, a SpaceX launch, which has been scrubbed twice.
[01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:09.780]   And it looks like they're going to be able to do it this time.
[01:37:09.780 --> 01:37:11.980]   I'd like to watch rocket launches.
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:17.620]   Kind of timely because Google just confirmed a million dollars to SpaceX.
[01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:24.420]   Elon Musk is just coolest, coolest.
[01:37:24.420 --> 01:37:32.660]   I'm getting all these people who are saying, "I had no idea I was a blue bubble."
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:33.660]   Or green.
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:35.460]   There you go.
[01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:39.260]   They got to discover off.
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:45.660]   When this is supposed to come back onto the on the barge?
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:47.580]   When is it sparked supposed to do that?
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:48.580]   An hour.
[01:37:48.580 --> 01:37:54.460]   That's the launch vehicle after it gets the whatever it is.
[01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:56.460]   Excuse the time.
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:57.460]   Cool.
[01:37:57.460 --> 01:38:05.380]   It's a deep space weather satellite, which I think, as I remember, is going to be in space
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:10.780]   four times a distance to the moon, three times at the range point.
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:12.060]   Ah, okay.
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:13.740]   Which is roughly three.
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:17.700]   It moves around, but it's roughly 750,000 miles out.
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:20.460]   So that's cool.
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:24.060]   The deep space climate observatory.
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:27.700]   Successful launch.
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:29.700]   Very nice.
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:31.260]   Congratulations, SpaceX.
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:33.980]   And yeah, Google an investor in SpaceX.
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:40.460]   We just learned $900 million into SpaceX's billion round, billion dollar round.
[01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:41.980]   So that's like pretty much 90%.
[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:43.300]   So basically the whole round.
[01:38:43.300 --> 01:38:45.860]   My math is correct.
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:48.580]   A few people were allowed to follow on.
[01:38:48.580 --> 01:38:50.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:51.580]   That's nice.
[01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:54.780]   Good for them.
[01:38:54.780 --> 01:38:59.140]   Google and Fidelity.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:03.260]   And by the way, for their billion dollars, they get about 10% of the company.
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:06.660]   So I guess that values a company at $10 billion.
[01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:10.740]   So SpaceX did that launch vehicle, not the Discover satellite.
[01:39:10.740 --> 01:39:17.100]   That's a government satellite, but the government pays SpaceX to put it into space.
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:18.940]   Successful launch.
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:23.620]   I don't know what they're going to announce, but Google and Mattel have a thing coming up.
[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:26.780]   Sorry, I got to turn my phone off.
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:27.780]   One of you.
[01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:31.060]   I'm getting all these, all these blue, many blue bubbles.
[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:32.060]   Yeah.
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:36.780]   I'm sorry.
[01:39:36.780 --> 01:39:41.340]   It's for a major international toy fair this Friday.
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:46.220]   Mattel invites you to view what's possible with an exclusive announcement and product
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:50.500]   debut and then at the bottom Mattel and Google.
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:53.340]   Do you think it's Google cardboard?
[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:54.900]   It sounds cardboard to me.
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:56.740]   Does Mattel make that?
[01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:57.740]   Yeah.
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:39:59.500]   Three of you are the Viewmaster.
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:00.980]   That's true.
[01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:06.140]   The Viewmaster 2.0.
[01:40:06.140 --> 01:40:07.140]   More could be a tablet.
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:08.380]   There's lots of things it could be.
[01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:10.620]   They've got Viewmaster in the invite.
[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:12.420]   Oh, that's what this is.
[01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:14.100]   View what's possible, of course.
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:15.100]   Don't die.
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:16.180]   I didn't even look at that.
[01:40:16.180 --> 01:40:18.300]   I thought maybe it's a tablet shaped as a Viewmaster.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:23.700]   I wouldn't that be great cardboard, which was really the most interesting giveaway at
[01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:25.940]   the last Google I/O.
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:28.780]   Really hasn't been exploited well enough, I think.
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:31.660]   I think Google's kind of stepping up a little bit.
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:38.060]   LG just announced that buyers of the LG G3 now get for free LG's own version of the
[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:39.860]   cardboard viewer and it's made of plastic.
[01:40:39.860 --> 01:40:45.940]   I don't know what you call it when cardboard's made of plastic.
[01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:47.380]   More and more we're seeing it.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:49.540]   We're seeing more app support for it as well.
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:50.540]   I love it.
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:54.300]   It seems like they could just make a simple app that you pull on the magnet and it switches
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:55.300]   the viewer.
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:57.380]   It kind of already is a Viewmaster, really.
[01:40:57.380 --> 01:40:58.380]   It is.
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:02.260]   I think that's the little magnetic thing that, and there's a little RF.
[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:03.260]   It's a flick.
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:07.660]   Or NFC in here that triggers the program to run.
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:12.460]   This is the one Gina built in her lap as she was driving up from Google I/O without even
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:14.420]   looking at the instructions.
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:16.420]   That's why it's really not quite.
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:17.900]   It's not quite put together so well.
[01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:19.140]   I refuse to look at the instructions.
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:20.740]   I'm like, I will figure this out.
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:22.220]   I will unfold this thing.
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:23.220]   That was a lot.
[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:24.220]   I loved watching that.
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:25.220]   That was a great issue.
[01:41:25.220 --> 01:41:27.220]   I wish I could have seen it.
[01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:28.220]   It got done.
[01:41:28.220 --> 01:41:29.220]   I wish I could have seen it.
[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:30.220]   I wish I could have seen it.
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:31.220]   Yeah, of course.
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:33.940]   It was determined Gina the maker.
[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:40.980]   Yeah, determined Gina could have done that a lot more efficiently if I just read the instructions.
[01:41:40.980 --> 01:41:41.980]   Oh, no.
[01:41:41.980 --> 01:41:42.980]   It's a giant RTF-N.
[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:44.980]   Oh, you determined for a photo Gina.
[01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:47.940]   So the idea is you have to have an Android phone.
[01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:53.460]   You put the Android phone in here and suddenly you get a new world view.
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:56.980]   It actually is the coolest thing they handed out of Google I/O.
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:02.820]   I know you guys got two Android Wear watches, but this is the coolest thing.
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:07.060]   It's awesome when the coolest thing from Google I/O only costs like $7.00.
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:09.900]   It was under your chair.
[01:42:09.900 --> 01:42:11.620]   Everybody can get one now.
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:14.780]   All right, let's take a break and we've got a tool, a number.
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:18.940]   And yes, Gina's tip or thing or whatever.
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:21.180]   Coming up, we've missed you, Gina.
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:23.940]   Our show today brought to you by my razor.
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:27.860]   How smooth, baby smooth my face is.
[01:42:27.860 --> 01:42:30.380]   That's because I know a guy named Harry.
[01:42:30.380 --> 01:42:31.460]   Harry's razors.
[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:33.060]   We've been talking about him a lot.
[01:42:33.060 --> 01:42:34.060]   I love it.
[01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:41.940]   If you go to h-a-r-r-y-s.com, you could take a look at the best deal in shaving out there.
[01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:43.420]   Shaving who likes to shave?
[01:42:43.420 --> 01:42:48.980]   Nobody does, especially if you have a bad blade or a dull blade or heaven for fender.
[01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:51.260]   You're so cheap using those disposable razors.
[01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:53.900]   Hey, actually, I don't blame you.
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:58.980]   When a blade, a Gillette blade in the drug store could cost as much as $4, it's tempting
[01:42:58.980 --> 01:43:02.500]   to go get the, you know, $0.69, Jill, you know, bic.
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:06.420]   But I'll tell you what, it's bad enough you have to scrape your face with a super sharp
[01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:07.740]   blade every day.
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:12.180]   To do it with a badly made super sharp blade is ridiculous.
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:14.060]   And to spend $4 is ridiculous.
[01:43:14.060 --> 01:43:19.820]   Harry solves this by giving you the best razor blades I've ever used better than anybody
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:22.820]   else's for about half the price of those big brand names.
[01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:26.540]   Part of this is because Harry's was smart enough to buy the factory.
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:30.340]   When they first started the company, I love, this is Silicon Valley, man, right, right
[01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:31.340]   there.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:34.580]   When they first started the company, they did, you know, all that research.
[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:35.940]   What makes a great razor blade?
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:37.300]   Where do you get the best razor blades?
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:41.060]   They found out really it's only two factories in Germany that make these blades.
[01:43:41.060 --> 01:43:47.500]   They bought one of them and they, and they said, engineer these for sharpness, for performance.
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.180]   They're shipped for free, right to your door.
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:53.660]   And because they make and ship the blades, they, they save so much money, they can pass
[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:54.940]   the savings right onto you.
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:44:00.460]   You're basically getting razor blades factory direct and your satisfaction is guaranteed.
[01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:01.460]   Start with a Harry's kit.
[01:44:01.460 --> 01:44:06.780]   They've got the new Jimmy Chin limited edition razors that are so cool looking.
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:11.060]   They also have the Truman, the Winston's, I have a, I use Winston.
[01:44:11.060 --> 01:44:14.700]   They're nice metal handles with engraving and so forth.
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:19.020]   But this, the Truman said is a really amazing deal, $15.
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:24.460]   And for $15 you get, as you do with all the kits, the razor with a handle that looks and
[01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:28.180]   feels great, three blades, the foaming shave gel.
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:31.620]   And I, they never mentioned this in the ads, but I always add it.
[01:44:31.620 --> 01:44:34.460]   My favorite part of the Harry's kit, that thing.
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:36.580]   You know, you know what I'm talking about?
[01:44:36.580 --> 01:44:40.220]   It's the travel the holder do hickey.
[01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:43.260]   At first I thought I was just like, oh, it's through this away.
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:47.340]   But then I realized, no, you put the razor in it and it put, then you can put it in your
[01:44:47.340 --> 01:44:48.340]   top kit.
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:49.340]   You don't get cut.
[01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:50.340]   It dries out.
[01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:51.340]   It's really awesome.
[01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:52.340]   Harry's is the best.
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:53.340]   I love Harry's.
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:54.340]   This is a nice Truman set.
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:55.340]   There's the blade.
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:59.540]   You put it right in here when you travel and never again will you get cut, but your blade
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:04.380]   will always be protected and never nicked so it never nicks your face.
[01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:08.860]   $25 for the Winston set, but I've got a, I'm going to sweeten this, this deal for you
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:13.740]   because when you visit Harry's and use the offer code twig, your first purchase, $5
[01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:14.740]   off.
[01:45:14.740 --> 01:45:15.740]   H.A.R.R.Y.S.
[01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:19.460]   .com or offer code TWIG.
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:21.620]   Now we're talking $10 for the Truman set.
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:23.820]   Now we're talking.
[01:45:23.820 --> 01:45:28.060]   Don't forget to try a Harry's really nice aftershave too.
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:34.260]   That's something new in the aftershave moisturizer and the lip balm.
[01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:35.260]   Harry's.
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:37.180]   You need it this winter.
[01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:39.180]   Harry's.
[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:42.700]   H.A.R.Y.S. .com is the offer code twig and it would be a great, I think it'd be a
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:46.700]   great Valentine's gift for the guy in your life.
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:47.700]   Harry's .com.
[01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:52.940]   Gina Trappani, wouldn't mind a little tip from you.
[01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:55.660]   We've missed all of those great tips.
[01:45:55.660 --> 01:45:57.180]   You've been collecting them no doubt.
[01:45:57.180 --> 01:45:58.780]   Oh yes indeed.
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:05.100]   In fact, I had the bad luck of having the Google stomach flu recently because you know,
[01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:07.220]   you're all day care.
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:12.660]   It turns out that Google is adding health related information into the knowledge graph.
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:20.140]   If you take your phone for example and search for tonsillitis or laryngitis or gastroenteritis
[01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:26.940]   or whatever and it is the season to get sick, you'll get a card with a bunch of information
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:33.220]   about the condition, how contagious it is, whether it's self-treatable or self-diagnosable,
[01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:35.220]   the age is affected.
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:38.580]   This is exactly what we were talking about earlier that Google's trying to give you the
[01:46:38.580 --> 01:46:40.860]   answers right there.
[01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:42.540]   They're an answer service, right?
[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:44.860]   They're not a web search as much anymore.
[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:45.860]   That's great.
[01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:51.740]   But yeah, really, really nice way to quickly, for those of us who like to self-diagnose by
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:56.980]   scaring the heck out of yourself by searching for symptoms and for illnesses, Google's
[01:46:56.980 --> 01:46:57.980]   there to help.
[01:46:57.980 --> 01:47:04.220]   I've noticed my doctor tells me less now that he just assumes I'm going to Google it.
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:05.980]   Do you notice that?
[01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:07.580]   They don't have to give us all the education.
[01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:10.860]   They used to spend a lot of time and I was very bored where they would say, "Well, let
[01:47:10.860 --> 01:47:12.260]   me explain what this all means."
[01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:14.420]   Now they say, "Hey, you can Google it."
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:15.420]   It's fine.
[01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:16.420]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:17.420]   It's true.
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:18.420]   I don't mind that.
[01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:23.180]   As long as you go to somewhere reliable or use now Google's knowledge graph because they
[01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:26.180]   have actual physicians reviewing it and so forth.
[01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:29.780]   Which I think is great and I think it's important and I think it's the right thing to do.
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:32.460]   However, you know it's going to be controversial.
[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:34.700]   WebMD stock went down.
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:35.700]   Oh.
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:37.660]   Because Google's competing with WebMD.
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:44.780]   Oh, Google's trying to do this because they're trying to avoid a senior responsible
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:47.780]   information and I think it's the right thing to do.
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:51.980]   But it's Google entering farther into content.
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:52.980]   Yeah.
[01:47:52.980 --> 01:47:56.140]   I don't know that there's any ads associated with that.
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:57.140]   I don't know.
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:59.380]   They're going to make money on the knowledge of graphing to do.
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:00.380]   It is.
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:01.380]   I agree with all that.
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:04.140]   But mark my words.
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:06.220]   Somebody with a German accent is going to complain.
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:09.500]   Google's blog post is about this.
[01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:13.180]   It has one in 20 Google searches for health related information.
[01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:21.100]   We're all looking for information about why we feel a certain way or our kids are.
[01:48:21.100 --> 01:48:23.460]   That's amazing.
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:26.500]   Jeff Jarvis, your number.
[01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:30.500]   So just a minor, minor little thing here and we're going to go with it.
[01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:35.700]   Scottish researcher named Ronald McDonald insert laugh track here.
[01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:38.100]   Oh, I'm a McDonald.
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:40.500]   Yeah, I feel the better.
[01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:44.300]   It says that now I've lost the screen.
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:50.380]   You can predict elections based on Google searches.
[01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:53.380]   You can predict elections by result based on Google searches.
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:54.860]   The first time we've heard this, right?
[01:48:54.860 --> 01:48:57.540]   No, but I think it's interesting to me.
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:48:58.660]   It was I didn't have any other numbers.
[01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:03.020]   So light to standards this week.
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:11.460]   But I thought it interesting that TV gets accused of having an impact on elections because
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:15.260]   you were not supposed to reveal the polls before they're closed.
[01:49:15.260 --> 01:49:22.940]   But basically one way or the other between 536 as recline and Google search and all these
[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:27.060]   tools now, we're going to get better and better and better.
[01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:30.900]   I think it pulling to an extent that says that you don't people.
[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:35.420]   The question is will people stop going to the vote?
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:37.460]   Because Google already told him who's going to win.
[01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:38.460]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:39.460]   That's part of the.
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:40.460]   That's amazing.
[01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:45.740]   That makes sense because the only reason that information works is because people are Googling
[01:49:45.740 --> 01:49:48.380]   the candidate or the measure.
[01:49:48.380 --> 01:49:49.380]   Right.
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:54.100]   If people stopped getting involved, then it would stop working.
[01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:55.300]   I don't know.
[01:49:55.300 --> 01:49:56.780]   I don't know.
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:49:59.500]   I think it was my best number.
[01:49:59.500 --> 01:50:00.740]   What was the number?
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:04.340]   I there's there's there's no number.
[01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:05.580]   I got a number.
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:07.380]   You want a number?
[01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:08.660]   998.
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:12.180]   Ask me what that number has to do with.
[01:50:12.180 --> 01:50:14.900]   How much you're going to end up spending thousands of dollars on your website?
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:15.900]   No.
[01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:16.900]   Oh God.
[01:50:16.900 --> 01:50:17.900]   Ouch.
[01:50:17.900 --> 01:50:18.900]   Ouch.
[01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:22.860]   No, we're going to get.
[01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:25.300]   Wait till you see the new website.
[01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:31.940]   And you tell me then if it was worth a quarter of a million dollars.
[01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:33.540]   How much does it cost?
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:35.020]   How much to see?
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:42.460]   It's my fault because we went to a really big, great firm that does sites for big companies.
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:45.780]   And of course, as soon as I told people this, everybody in their brother who watches the
[01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:50.420]   shows said, well, I could do it for you for $15.93 and stuff like that.
[01:50:50.420 --> 01:50:51.420]   Yeah.
[01:50:51.420 --> 01:50:55.980]   You tell me, I think you're going to see every dollar on the screen.
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:50:56.980]   We'll see.
[01:50:56.980 --> 01:51:02.180]   But I'm you'll see because the tricky thing that we're doing and the thing is kind of
[01:51:02.180 --> 01:51:04.500]   expensive is we're doing an API.
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:05.500]   Just got.
[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:07.540]   And then the website calls the API.
[01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:09.180]   It's just one of many consumers.
[01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:13.620]   I really feel like we need to get past the notion of a web page, especially for podcast.
[01:51:13.620 --> 01:51:14.620]   Oh, there you go.
[01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:15.620]   Yes, you do.
[01:51:15.620 --> 01:51:16.620]   Yeah.
[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:19.380]   Yes, we will have a beta test and actually we're going to have it sooner than we thought.
[01:51:19.380 --> 01:51:20.540]   So stay tuned.
[01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:23.140]   We will be looking for beta testers.
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:25.900]   My number 998 though, doesn't apply to that.
[01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:29.660]   It applies to the number of Chrome experiments.
[01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:34.900]   So we the newest we just played with, which is the, the IO 2015 experiment.
[01:51:34.900 --> 01:51:39.300]   But I realized, and we've probably talked about this before, but if you are using a
[01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:45.160]   WebGL capable browser, preferably Chrome, that there is a place where you can go Chrome
[01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:51.060]   experiments.com where you can see all of the experiments collected into one place.
[01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:52.700]   It is a Google page.
[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:54.300]   So these are all approved experiments.
[01:51:54.300 --> 01:52:00.580]   You don't have to worry about, you know, the harm that these could cause.
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:01.580]   They actually do a nice job.
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:02.580]   They show you the website.
[01:52:02.580 --> 01:52:06.140]   It's from they show you QR code that you could use.
[01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:09.780]   So if you're on a phone, you don't have to enter in any URLs.
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:12.580]   If you're on your browser, though, you can, you can try these.
[01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:14.740]   Here's one pop the bubble, release the fish.
[01:52:14.740 --> 01:52:18.500]   This is called traveling fish.
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:22.580]   That's loading very slowly, but there's quite a few.
[01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:24.340]   These are, that's probably because it's a feature.
[01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:26.780]   Ooh, WebGL attractors trip.
[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:28.780]   Okay, everybody.
[01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:30.860]   I'm glad this site is proving me wrong.
[01:52:30.860 --> 01:52:33.220]   I was saying that no one with Google makes these things.
[01:52:33.220 --> 01:52:34.220]   998.
[01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:38.500]   Look at the Helvetica clock, too.
[01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:40.100]   Ooh, this is fun, though.
[01:52:40.100 --> 01:52:44.220]   I'm going to go home and take some shrooms.
[01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:45.420]   Let me, let me, what is it?
[01:52:45.420 --> 01:52:46.420]   Helvetica clock.
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:47.420]   Helvetica clock.
[01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:48.420]   All right.
[01:52:48.420 --> 01:52:51.260]   Ooh, dude.
[01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:53.420]   Helvetica clock, too.
[01:52:53.420 --> 01:52:54.420]   All right.
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:57.420]   I'm guessing this sequel is Comic Sans clock.
[01:52:57.420 --> 01:52:59.700]   Yeah, wouldn't that be funny?
[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:00.700]   Here you go.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:02.700]   Helvetica clock, too.
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:05.020]   Oh, wow.
[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:07.860]   That's pretty, so there's a 3D render of the digits.
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:13.060]   And each new time crashes into the previous time.
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:14.060]   That's hysterical.
[01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:19.820]   So that's showing WebGL because it's showing the physics engine as well as the 3D rendering
[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:24.100]   engine because you have to predict how these things had fallen in real physics.
[01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:28.180]   It unfortunately doesn't look at all like the time because there are no colons and it's
[01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:29.180]   24 hour clock.
[01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:30.180]   Right.
[01:53:30.180 --> 01:53:32.180]   But it's, once you know it.
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:34.500]   It's 152 and 7.
[01:53:34.500 --> 01:53:36.340]   152 and, yeah.
[01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:37.340]   Yeah.
[01:53:37.340 --> 01:53:38.340]   No, it's 320.
[01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:39.340]   Right.
[01:53:39.340 --> 01:53:40.340]   1520 is up.
[01:53:40.340 --> 01:53:41.340]   Oh, sorry.
[01:53:41.340 --> 01:53:42.340]   Yes, see?
[01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:44.580]   What time is it?
[01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:45.580]   1520.
[01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:46.580]   Okay.
[01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:48.580]   Now I get it.
[01:53:48.580 --> 01:53:52.980]   That is kind of, that is kind of, I can stare at that forever.
[01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:53.980]   Yeah.
[01:53:53.980 --> 01:53:54.980]   Wow.
[01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:55.980]   That's rising.
[01:53:55.980 --> 01:53:58.980]   There's lots of these, quite a few of these.
[01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:04.100]   So if you were kind of intrigued by the Google I/O thing, oh, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:07.380]   Here's some volumetric particle flow.
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:08.380]   Enjoy.
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:14.380]   I want to thank you for, you can change the particle count, the speed, the turbulence,
[01:54:14.380 --> 01:54:15.380]   the color.
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:16.380]   Wow.
[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:19.580]   I don't know what this is good for, but let's increase the number of particles.
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:20.580]   Ooh.
[01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:22.420]   How about a million particles?
[01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:25.220]   I am animating two million particles right now.
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:26.220]   Yeah.
[01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:27.220]   It looks like it might be.
[01:54:27.220 --> 01:54:29.220]   And your browser is a special.
[01:54:29.220 --> 01:54:30.220]   I don't want to.
[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:31.220]   Please.
[01:54:31.220 --> 01:54:33.180]   That's the land of millions right now.
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:34.740]   But that's a lot of calculations.
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:36.260]   That really is.
[01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:37.860]   Wow.
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:42.860]   That's pretty impressive actually, that it could animate two million particles like
[01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:43.860]   that.
[01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:45.020]   And the shadow.
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:46.020]   Wow.
[01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:47.020]   Yeah.
[01:54:47.020 --> 01:54:50.180]   This is actually a good way to test your computer.
[01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:51.180]   See where it shows.
[01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:52.180]   This is Speedcast.com.
[01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:53.180]   Yeah.
[01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:54.180]   Ooh.
[01:54:54.180 --> 01:54:55.180]   Wow.
[01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:56.180]   This is a great speed.
[01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:57.860]   It's a good benchmark.
[01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:03.580]   And what's nice is the code for this is actually visible on the site.
[01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:04.740]   So you can see how it did.
[01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:06.380]   Yeah, it turned the color wheel.
[01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:08.780]   Well, it's a, it's a GitHub.
[01:55:08.780 --> 01:55:10.580]   Oh, nice.
[01:55:10.580 --> 01:55:11.580]   Yeah.
[01:55:11.580 --> 01:55:12.580]   You can get it.
[01:55:12.580 --> 01:55:14.220]   Get it.
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:16.260]   Some people have too much time.
[01:55:16.260 --> 01:55:19.540]   David Lee, you have too much time.
[01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:20.540]   JavaScript and WebGL.
[01:55:20.540 --> 01:55:21.540]   This is kind of cool.
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:22.540]   Chrome Experiment.
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:23.540]   Ooh.
[01:55:23.540 --> 01:55:25.580]   NYC Taxis, a day in the life.
[01:55:25.580 --> 01:55:26.580]   Oh, where's that?
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:27.580]   Let's see that.
[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:28.580]   Oh.
[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:29.580]   Is that on the first page?
[01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:30.580]   No.
[01:55:30.580 --> 01:55:31.580]   Just like NYC.
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:33.340]   I think it says Alt, Betaclor, not.
[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:37.780]   It doesn't seem to be, but I can search and yeah, it's a Google page.
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:39.580]   You can search.
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:42.580]   NYC Taxis by Chris Huang.
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:45.540]   Oh, this is going to be good.
[01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:46.860]   A day in the life.
[01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:47.860]   Begin.
[01:55:47.860 --> 01:55:49.620]   Visualizes what these are.
[01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:50.620]   That's an empty taxi.
[01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:51.620]   This is a taxi.
[01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:52.620]   This is a taxi.
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:53.620]   Whoa.
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:54.620]   Going to the airport.
[01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:57.300]   Okay, yep, yep, going back.
[01:55:57.300 --> 01:55:58.300]   Wow.
[01:55:58.300 --> 01:55:59.300]   Manhattan.
[01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:05.740]   So this is a single taxi and August 9, 2013.
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:06.740]   Wow.
[01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:09.140]   And life in the big city.
[01:56:09.140 --> 01:56:10.500]   Hey, that's neat.
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:11.500]   That's really neat.
[01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:13.500]   If only taxis were actually that fast.
[01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:14.500]   I know.
[01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:15.500]   Look at that.
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:16.500]   Wow.
[01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:17.900]   I'm down the west side highway.
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:20.500]   Look at that.
[01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:21.500]   This is pretty cool, actually.
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:22.500]   Wow, that's really cool.
[01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:23.500]   How many passengers?
[01:56:23.500 --> 01:56:25.420]   You can see the fares.
[01:56:25.420 --> 01:56:30.900]   $169 of fares, 66 passengers.
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:32.180]   And I can load another taxi.
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:34.260]   So I don't know where this data comes from.
[01:56:34.260 --> 01:56:36.980]   It's five, by the way, five minutes per second.
[01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:37.980]   Time's sped up.
[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:40.900]   You can found 300 X.
[01:56:40.900 --> 01:56:46.380]   Do taxis broadcast their GPS data?
[01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:47.380]   It's interesting.
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:49.180]   Yeah, I don't know where he gets the data.
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:50.900]   Yeah, there is.
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:53.700]   And I don't know what the poor guy.
[01:56:53.700 --> 01:56:57.020]   He's stuck in hell at the airport at Newark.
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:56:58.020]   He's waiting.
[01:56:58.020 --> 01:56:59.020]   He's circling, waiting.
[01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:00.020]   No fare, waiting.
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:01.540]   Oh, he said to go home.
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.540]   No.
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:05.020]   No, he's just floating around.
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:06.500]   Floating around the airport looking.
[01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:08.420]   Oh, yeah, he said go home.
[01:57:08.420 --> 01:57:09.420]   He said that with that.
[01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:11.580]   I'm not going to get a fare poor guy.
[01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:12.580]   He's not rushing.
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:13.580]   You can.
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:15.980]   You can't pick up New York taxis.
[01:57:15.980 --> 01:57:17.980]   Can't pick up at Newark.
[01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:18.980]   What's he doing there?
[01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:19.980]   I don't know.
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:20.980]   He's supposed to drop somebody off.
[01:57:20.980 --> 01:57:21.980]   He's a gypsy cab.
[01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:23.980]   Now he's in the Holland Tunnel.
[01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:24.980]   I'll pop up.
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:25.980]   You can speed it up.
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:26.980]   It really is.
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:27.980]   I did speed it up.
[01:57:27.980 --> 01:57:28.980]   It's now nine minutes per second.
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:31.340]   Here's I got 17 minutes per second.
[01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:32.340]   It's really zapping.
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:36.980]   Yeah, this guy is just I think he's on a break.
[01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:38.980]   Four hour break.
[01:57:38.980 --> 01:57:39.980]   This guy fell asleep.
[01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:40.980]   Oh, there he goes.
[01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:42.980]   Oh, that was dinner.
[01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:45.980]   Holy, holy, holy cow.
[01:57:45.980 --> 01:57:46.980]   Well, that's right.
[01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:48.980]   I'm supposed to be driving.
[01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:51.380]   Oh, this is a great video game.
[01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:52.380]   It's like Tron.
[01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:54.740]   Anyway, these are fun.
[01:57:54.740 --> 01:57:55.740]   Aren't they?
[01:57:55.740 --> 01:57:56.740]   WebGL.
[01:57:56.740 --> 01:57:57.740]   Maybe it isn't.
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:02.140]   Oh, my happy have 48 passengers.
[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:05.980]   $713 total revenue.
[01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:07.580]   That's a hard day, man.
[01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:08.580]   77.
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:09.620]   He doesn't get to keep it all right.
[01:58:09.620 --> 01:58:10.620]   How much does he keep?
[01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:11.860]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:14.420]   This guy had 126 passengers.
[01:58:14.420 --> 01:58:17.180]   $719, $72 in tips.
[01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:18.940]   So he gets to keep that.
[01:58:18.940 --> 01:58:20.220]   He gets to keep a few hundred.
[01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:21.220]   That's not a bad.
[01:58:21.220 --> 01:58:22.220]   That's not bad.
[01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:23.220]   You know, 250.
[01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:24.220]   It's hard work.
[01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:25.220]   Yeah, hard work.
[01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:26.220]   It is tough work.
[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:28.020]   Mapbox and Heroku.
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:30.940]   And there's a blog post so you can see how it was done.
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:33.020]   That is really cool.
[01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:34.900]   That is really cool.
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:35.900]   Wow.
[01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:38.900]   There are some smart people in the world.
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:40.660]   Boy, yeah.
[01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:41.660]   We're glad.
[01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:44.060]   And you know, one of them is Gina Trappani.
[01:58:44.060 --> 01:58:45.060]   We love you.
[01:58:45.060 --> 01:58:47.020]   It's so great to be back.
[01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:49.020]   Love you, Gina.
[01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:50.020]   It's awesome.
[01:58:50.020 --> 01:58:51.020]   Love you, Gina.
[01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:52.020]   Classy.
[01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:53.020]   Don't go.
[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:54.020]   You know, don't.
[01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:55.020]   This is hard enough on her.
[01:58:55.020 --> 01:58:56.700]   The poor woman really does want to be here.
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:57.700]   I know you do.
[01:58:57.700 --> 01:58:58.700]   I do.
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:58:59.700]   I love you.
[01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:05.180]   But you got a startup and you can't be spending time with us when you've actually
[01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:07.700]   got a job to do.
[01:59:07.700 --> 01:59:09.620]   So I do enjoy it very much.
[01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:10.620]   It's really cool to be back.
[01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:11.620]   Thanks for having me.
[01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:12.780]   I'll be back in a few weeks.
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:14.980]   Please go to ThinkUp.com.
[01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:16.060]   Sign up.
[01:59:16.060 --> 01:59:20.980]   If a thousand people sign up for ThinkUp, I think Gina will be back tomorrow.
[01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:23.060]   I swear to God.
[01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:24.460]   I mean, right?
[01:59:24.460 --> 01:59:27.100]   If enough people said, "Why that Gina Trappani?
[01:59:27.100 --> 01:59:28.100]   She's great.
[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:29.340]   I should sign up for ThinkUp."
[01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:33.140]   If a thousand people did every time you're on, I think we'd see more of her.
[01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:36.540]   So folks, you know what to do.
[01:59:36.540 --> 01:59:37.540]   Sign up.
[01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:40.980]   Well, I've heard from Twitter viewers that they've signed up for ThinkUp, that they're
[01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:44.820]   not big social media users, but they signed up and they subscribe because they want to support
[01:59:44.820 --> 01:59:45.820]   me.
[01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:48.820]   It's just incredible and humbling to hear.
[01:59:48.820 --> 01:59:50.980]   And thank you so much for the Twitter audience for being so supportive.
[01:59:50.980 --> 01:59:54.340]   And you could try free for two weeks, so there's no reason not to.
[01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:55.340]   Yeah.
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:57.660]   Actually, we just released a really cool new developer tool.
[01:59:57.660 --> 02:00:01.460]   If you go to blog.thinkup.com, you can design your own insight.
[02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:03.380]   We've got this kind of whizziwig.
[02:00:03.380 --> 02:00:04.380]   Just load up a webpage.
[02:00:04.380 --> 02:00:07.860]   You pick your color and you pick your image and your avatar and you can write your own
[02:00:07.860 --> 02:00:08.860]   insight.
[02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:09.860]   Really?
[02:00:09.860 --> 02:00:10.860]   It's kind of a fun little--
[02:00:10.860 --> 02:00:11.860]   Oh, cool.
[02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:12.860]   Yeah.
[02:00:12.860 --> 02:00:13.860]   It's the insight creator.
[02:00:13.860 --> 02:00:14.860]   See that's--
[02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:15.860]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:16.860]   Okay.
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:17.860]   Can I be honest?
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:18.860]   Yeah.
[02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:21.820]   That's the kind of thing Gina does when she's not here is she gets to do stuff like this.
[02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:22.820]   Okay.
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:23.820]   That is really neat.
[02:00:23.820 --> 02:00:24.820]   Right, right.
[02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:28.020]   So you can choose, hey, do I want to show a bar chart or a pie chart, you know, which
[02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:29.020]   network--
[02:00:29.020 --> 02:00:30.020]   Oh, you're doing Instagram.
[02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:31.020]   What are you going to do Instagram?
[02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:32.020]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:00:32.020 --> 02:00:33.020]   Yeah.
[02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:36.660]   We are working on Instagram right now and hopefully we'll have it out in the next few
[02:00:36.660 --> 02:00:37.660]   weeks.
[02:00:37.660 --> 02:00:39.460]   So I'm really excited about that.
[02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:41.620]   It's in testing right now internally.
[02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:43.740]   And so, yeah, really, really excited about that.
[02:00:43.740 --> 02:00:48.380]   So, yeah, so if you design an insight using this kind of editor, you can write the headline
[02:00:48.380 --> 02:00:49.940]   in the body and show us an avatar.
[02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:52.460]   And then there's a button at the bottom that says file a ticket.
[02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:55.180]   It'll automatically create a new GitHub issue.
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:01:00.300]   You can save it and we'll see it and you can kind of propose it for development.
[02:01:00.300 --> 02:01:01.300]   So a lot of fun.
[02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:02.300]   Yeah.
[02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:03.300]   Neat, neat, neat.
[02:01:03.300 --> 02:01:04.300]   And I think up is so great.
[02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:05.300]   I'll show you one more time.
[02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:08.700]   I'll show you my insights from a think up.
[02:01:08.700 --> 02:01:09.700]   It's really fun.
[02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:10.700]   Thank you.
[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:12.740]   I can't wait to get my Instagram in here.
[02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:15.100]   Yeah, I'm really excited for Instagram.
[02:01:15.100 --> 02:01:16.100]   Super excited for Instagram.
[02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:18.540]   They don't make the stream so much nicer because it'll be photos.
[02:01:18.540 --> 02:01:20.980]   There'll be a lot more photos, a lot more visual.
[02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:25.420]   Instagram really doesn't have a whole lot of analytics available to it, unlike Twitter
[02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:26.980]   and to some extent Facebook.
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:29.460]   So it'll be fun to add that to the product.
[02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:30.460]   Yeah.
[02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:31.460]   Yeah.
[02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:32.460]   So there's the Amazon giveaway.
[02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:34.380]   No, what do they give away?
[02:01:34.380 --> 02:01:36.340]   Anybody can give away something.
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:41.620]   You can set a limit and say if I get a thousand new Twitter followers, the thousands of person
[02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:42.620]   will get a book.
[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:49.340]   And you just say, you just, wow, Amazon.com/giveaway, run promotional giveaways to create buzz.
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:51.980]   Wow, that's so smart of them.
[02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:53.860]   Isn't it so smart of them?
[02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:56.860]   You select a prize, you set up the giveaway, you get a link.
[02:01:56.860 --> 02:02:01.340]   You share the link on your, so you could say, you know, for my 10,000th follower.
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:04.940]   And then for the entrant, winner, lose entry is fun and simple with immediate results.
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:08.140]   Amazon collects, of course, all of their personal information.
[02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:11.820]   And then ship surprise directly to the winners.
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:14.420]   Wow, that's kind of cool.
[02:02:14.420 --> 02:02:15.580]   I might have to do something.
[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:17.940]   Jeremy Kaplan found that.
[02:02:17.940 --> 02:02:19.980]   I'm gonna have to do something like that.
[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:22.340]   Well, it's perfect for Twitch.
[02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:23.340]   Yeah.
[02:02:23.340 --> 02:02:25.940]   Yeah, it hardly costs you anything.
[02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:26.940]   Yeah.
[02:02:26.940 --> 02:02:28.420]   I'll give away a Gutenberg.
[02:02:28.420 --> 02:02:30.620]   The geek, it only cost me a buck.
[02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:31.620]   That's right.

[02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:57.140]   You guys have been doing pretty well without me.
