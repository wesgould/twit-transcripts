[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.200]   from the Google verse. Jeff Jarvis has the week off but I should mention next
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.400]   week this week in Google will be in New York City at Jeff's
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.400]   brand new studio Acuny and Gina Trippani will be joining us in studio. I'll be
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.760]   there as will Jeff. So that's gonna be a lot of fun next week. This week though
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.440]   great panel for you starting out with one of the
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.680]   proto Googlers himself. Matt Cutts is back. Great to see you, Matt.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.840]   Hey, good to be back. Always, always love him. You've seen him for years on those
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.040]   great webmaster videos, webmaster tools videos and of course he's been fighting
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.400]   the good fight fighting spam on your search results for
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.160]   many a moon on sabbatical right now which is nice.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.040]   That's a new to report. You enjoying it? I cannot complain. You don't miss like
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.360]   going into work nine and five every day? Well, you know the funny thing is I
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.880]   keep reading the Google news. I can't help myself. I'm like how could this country
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.560]   do this or whatever? Yeah, you've got your you got your I mean you don't have the
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.880]   I'm sure a tattoo but you might as well. Your blood runs in colors, primary colors.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.600]   Little rainbow, you know, it's like a bag or something.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.120]   Also there oh there he is at the Google dance which is the event you
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.920]   Google throws every year for a press right? Yeah a bunch of search engine
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.640]   optimizers. Oh SEO people. Yeah, not press.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.520]   They're welcome to. Yeah, it's a dance but it's all guys so there you go.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.280]   No, I'm sure there's one or two female participants. There were there were.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.960]   I'm sure there are nice people. Nice people. They're strange though. They're
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.000]   they're from another planet. We all are. Let's face it everybody's
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.480]   strange once you really find out. Ron Amadio is also here from ours Technica.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.160]   We love Ron his coverage of Google is par excellence and I guess it's the
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.360]   first time you to have met. Yes. Yes. Hey, what's up? Awesome to be here.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.200]   I'm Ron. Ron's a regular on this show and on all about Android.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.280]   Yeah. All right. I'll do this. That's yeah.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.520]   We're all joined somehow magically as we.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.720]   So Matt is a little tired this morning. Oh man. He stayed up all night.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.800]   Pulled it all night or watching TV but not half the cards. No.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.440]   The go you watched Alpha go win the fifth and final game of its match against
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.440]   Lisa doll. In fact at this point the real story of the five game matches that
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.000]   Lisa all won any game at all he won one game for even though the match was
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.240]   already lost. So what is your takeaway from this? Alpha go we should mention
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.480]   is was from a company called Deep Mind Google acquired Deep Mind not so long
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.080]   ago and so it's a Google company or an alphabet I should say alphabet company now.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:37.360]   Yeah, it's pretty wild because go is especially popular in China, Japan,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.840]   Korea and so the the match was the matches were staged at 1 p.m.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.960]   Korea time which means it starts at you know eight, nine, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.720]   Eastern time depending on where you are. So there were some people who were like
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.800]   in the chats for the various things saying it's 4 a.m. Please let me go to bed
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.200]   but it's crazy to see this thing you know it's like deep blue it's like history
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.280]   being made where people never thought you know within the next 10 years or
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.480]   even maybe within our lifetime that a computer would be a viable competitor
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.800]   and go and so it's pretty wild to see you know these people talking about
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.560]   strategy and aji and co and I had known nothing about go but it was still
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.640]   hypnotic so it was a lot of fun. I used to play go I was very serious
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.800]   chess player I used to play go as well and it's much much harder game than
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.040]   chess even though it looks a lot simpler it's just a
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.880]   19 by 19 board there's only one kind of piece it's a stone you're black or
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.960]   you're white and you place the stones you take turns and the idea is to
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.520]   occupy territory where if you surround the other players stones you can take
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.600]   them off the board and once the all the stones are placed
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.280]   you count up who controls more territory and that's how you win
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.640]   but it's tough. Yeah I stayed up a few nights watching them till like 3 a.m.
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.120]   but the the commentators like I was saying before the show are
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.400]   awesome as someone who knows absolutely nothing about go
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.560]   they have like their own little fake board and they like lay out moves and
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.480]   say oh we could go here or here or here and and they kind of explain
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.280]   the game to you as it goes along because it's rather slow and there's there's
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.720]   plenty of time in between moves but if you actually want to watch it
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.560]   DeepMind has a youtube channel with all of the games on there and like 15
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.240]   minute recaps of each game so if you missed it you can go
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.960]   take a look and see see what all the fuss was about. Michael Redmond is the
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.440]   guy on the right he is a 9-dan which is the top ranking
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.120]   so he's the equivalent of a go-grandmaster and he is explaining
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.920]   what's going on.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.840]   Yeah there's a lot of time in fact the game itself oh I guess I have a tab
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.720]   open with your voice in it somehow. Sorry. Let me
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.960]   clip. I thought there was you talking but then I
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.800]   realized that's the same thing he just said.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.040]   This what's interesting about this is Blackwell cut here
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.880]   white please here. Those of us who watch chess matches like
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.880]   I cut my teeth in 1972 on the Bobby Fisher Boar Spaske match this is exactly
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.680]   the same thing. These games go on for a long time this game went on for
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:13.520]   five hours. Five hours and the moves actually are a little faster
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.480]   sometimes in chess because and I'm not sure how the timing works but at some
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.760]   point the timers go to one minute per move and so you're
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.560]   going to then it this game does speed up quite a bit one minute
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.960]   moves is for chess or go. Hey pretty snappy.
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.240]   And a tennis I admit but the thing that's really interesting is
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.480]   it's been almost I didn't realize this till I looked it up almost 20 years
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:42.080]   since Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov the world champion to become
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.120]   the best chess playing computer in the world 20 years
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.960]   between then and now when a computer finally becomes the best go player and
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.480]   I think it's safe to say and from all the commentary I've read
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.040]   and even from Lisa at all the player that it is the case that AlphaGo is now the
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.360]   best go player human or otherwise in the world it's really
[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.040]   and if it's not give it a few weeks for it to be more number crunching
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.200]   and it'll get there. Why do you know why it's so hard to play
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.080]   go why is it the it took 20 years of chess it was able to look far
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.720]   enough ahead that it could just look at any position and
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:26.080]   and within the time limit there is a time limit on professional games
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.320]   figure out what the best move was and make it
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.480]   apparently too hard to do that and go right when I think there's too many
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:39.360]   possibilities oh either way take a shot Ron you go
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.560]   yeah what I had always heard is that you could basically brute force chess
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.200]   like there's a set number of moves and you can kind of
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.440]   calculate out whatever do like a search tree and calculate out whatever the
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.040]   optimum moves where you can go deep enough you can't go all the way to the
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:56.080]   end of the game but you can go 20 or 30 moves which is
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.680]   in a reasonable amount of time which is enough to know to get to a point where
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.240]   you go this is a uh unlusable game yeah but with go there's just too
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.320]   many possible spots for any kind of like natural
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.520]   uh for any kind of normal computer algorithm to get to calculate so it has
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.080]   to be an artificial intelligence that actually can
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.720]   look at a position and intuit it I guess yeah what's amazing about about the
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   deep mind stuff is that it's general it's a general AI where like the
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.400]   the IBM stuff um was they built a computer specifically for chess
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:35.120]   uh where the the deep mind stuff has already played um what was it
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.400]   breakout the video game they want to take it and have it do
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.920]   Starcraft next I think that they had said in an interview
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.440]   it's they they kind it figures out the rules of the game on its own I think
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.720]   for for a lot of the video games and stuff like that and it's a learning
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.720]   computer so um right the way it taught you know the deep
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.080]   deep blue you you get you kind of taught it they had
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.960]   grandmasters uh show it positions and say this is
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.480]   better than it this deep mind taught itself in
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.000]   effect by playing thousands tens of thousands of games against itself
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.680]   yeah wow right and another neat thing is that they
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.320]   actually published the uh the results in a nature paper so you can read
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.520]   about how they did it but there's for example a couple different neural
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.800]   networks they called one a policy network and one a value network
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.080]   and uh so they actually got to the point where they could predict where the
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.280]   world-class go players were going to play
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.200]   you know something like 57 percent of the time and if you can do that
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.880]   you can radically reduce where you need to search you know to find the next
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.200]   good place so what was interesting about watching the live stream is
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.800]   people even the experts didn't always know who was winning
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.720]   right and you know at the end they'd be like oh I see now black has the
[00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.880]   advantage or white has the advantage and it was kind of interesting because
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.560]   alfago is always updating its stats about what it thinks
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.560]   its odds of winning are and so one of the neural networks is just to sort of
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.800]   figure out okay what are what are likely to be the best
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.040]   position so it can narrow down the the search quite a bit
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:13.280]   it's uh it's i think more than winning a chess game it's a step forward for a
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:19.200]   AI a kind of almost a proof of concept uh that a neural network can actually
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.400]   do some real work we've seen more and more of this
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.800]   as particularly from google although facebook also has a go playing computer
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.000]   and and there was a little bit of a sour grapes kind of response
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.080]   we gotta see them play each other come on
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.320]   that's the that's would be great wouldn't it yeah i love the post from the
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.480]   facebook AI guy that was like well sure you can make the world's best
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.960]   go playing computer but did it learn to play go completely by itself or did you
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.320]   bootstrap with a database of you know watching other games and i'm like
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:53.280]   you know it's still the first time that's ever happened that's a pretty big
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.360]   milestone yeah so give it a little bit of a kind of a little bit of an obscure
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.960]   i mean that's when you know some of this happens the same thing happened in
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:06.880]   chess um that is exactly what the people what people said when deep blue
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.640]   one was oh well it was it was trained to beat
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.280]   kasparov it was designed to beat this particular player and
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.480]   but what we've seen in the years intervening is even a
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:23.520]   pc now can beat ninety nine point nine percent of all players routinely
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.800]   that in fact it i think it's safe to say at this point
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:31.440]   that with Fritz or one of the strong uh computer programs that can run on a
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.480]   multi-core pc it's not a quick the chess playing computers are the best
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.320]   period better than any human and what's interesting is the go community is
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.040]   going through a lot of the same kind of grief
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:47.440]   and that the chess community went through 20 years ago we got over it and uh
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.840]   didn't stop people playing chess even though
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.960]   you know you had the knowledge that a computer could win this game
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.800]   um it's still a fun puzzle for humans to solve it doesn't take any of that
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.880]   away in fact a computer uh human chess players really
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.240]   now partner with computers for training for sparring
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:08.640]   for analysis computers are a very big part of chess now and it's a nice
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:12.480]   symbiosis it's not you know they're not the enemy
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.040]   but again it's not about the game and we can go on and on there's a lot of
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.760]   we had an interview on the new screensavers with the head of the american
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.320]   go association one of the things he said is that
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.920]   uh alpha go doesn't play like a human for instance when you're playing as a
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.120]   human you're kind of calculating your head well how many
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.840]   squares in my head how many points in my head
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.640]   and can i build that lead uh alpha go doesn't care
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.760]   how much it's a head by what it's always looking at is can i win the game even
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.160]   i only win by half a point can i win the game
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.560]   and a human just doesn't think that way so it's it plays a different game but
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.120]   it's a computer we would expect computers to think differently right
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.160]   the goal is not to teach a computer to think like a human
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:58.480]   yeah and that strategy made the live games super close like it would never
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.600]   try to right pull away by a million more humans try to
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.960]   crush at the opponent yeah
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.800]   it doesn't care it's got no it's got no skin in the game
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.640]   uh it doesn't want to crush or not crush although i guess you could probably
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.880]   um teach it to have that desire i don't know if that seems like it's
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.480]   insulting like i don't need a i don't need a huge lead just this move is
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.520]   close enough i don't want to be too little human i don't need to be too
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:30.560]   by much as long as i win who cares matt do you follow ai at all i mean uh
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.760]   you must have some kind of at least academic interest in it
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.840]   yeah i do and it's kind of funny because i uh where i went to grad school it was
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.440]   in the middle of artificial intelligence winter and everybody's like oh
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.960]   we're not even gonna teach any courses in artificial intelligence it's failed
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:49.200]   it's a failed subject we can't do it it's oh it's over
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.120]   right and now you look at what people are i mean even the voice recognition on
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.280]   your android phone yeah you know has a lot of word error rate correction built
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:59.360]   in because of this sort of deep learning so
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.960]   google photos all this stuff is going to become practical a lot faster than
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.600]   people expect it to and uh so i i a lot of people are like okay mobile
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:12.000]   social local if if it were me i would probably pull one of those out and
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.960]   probably slot in machine learning as a skill to be
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.080]   studying right now because there's a lot of ways that software will
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.680]   eat the world as mark and dreason has often said and and
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.040]   i think artificial intelligence is one of the ways in which you can get ahead of
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.400]   that trend and sort of figure out how to be part of you know making that
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.680]   change instead of being surprised by it yeah
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.720]   um do you a lot of experts including mark and uh
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.240]   others say but we also need to be careful
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:46.400]   sure do yeah do you fear AI well i you know any any power tool
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.160]   uh you whether it's link networks or whatever you want to have a healthy
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.880]   sense of caution uh but it's kind of interesting i think
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.760]   dimness the you know one of the co-founders and and and heads of uh
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.440]   of deep mind whenever google acquired deep mind he said okay we also
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.600]   want to set up an ethics panel to think about the implications of this so
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.600]   you know even back years ago whenever deep mind got acquired they were thinking
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.760]   along those lines and certainly you know 20 years from now we'll have
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:19.360]   computers and and robots doing more jobs that people do today so
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:22.640]   thinking about how that is going to affect society i think that's probably
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:25.520]   going to affect society more in the near term a lot of the people i talk to
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.520]   say you know we're still a generation away from worrying about you know
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.120]   you know the scariest sort of scenarios that a lot of people seem to bandie
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.480]   about uh elan musk who's another person who said we
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:41.840]   have to worry a little bit about ai uh the founder uh one of the one of the
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.560]   principles that uh y-combinator and others have put a billion dollars
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:51.440]   towards a non-profit ai research company called open ai i think some of the
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.160]   concern is we don't and i think this is legitimate it
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.800]   shouldn't be any more than the human genome
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.440]   should be owned by a single company ai shouldn't be owned despite the fact
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:05.040]   that we we really do have a kind of a race between facebook google and others
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:09.760]   ai shouldn't be owned by any individual private corporation that should be
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:15.200]   uh something that everybody can use and there's a neat tension there because
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.560]   on one hand google has published a lot of these papers and we've opened sourced
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.480]   tensorflow which is sort of our machine learning framework so a lot of people
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.280]   can all try it you know and i think facebook has also
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.360]   uh open source theirs as well and so rather than try to hold on to their
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.920]   proprietary silos a lot of these companies are letting go and letting
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.160]   other people try out ideas which is good the only thing is then you know
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.120]   20 years from now what might be the unintended consequences if it's easier
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.360]   to experiment but for the near term there's so many benefits we've made it
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.720]   too easy oh my god
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:51.680]   microsoft siva doing this microsoft just released a project ai x
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:57.680]   which i love uses minecraft see one of the problems with ai is uh how do you
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.160]   test it how do you where how do you give it a playground
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.040]   of course one way is to make a go playing computer or a chess playing
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.720]   computer but microsoft is making it possible to use
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:11.920]   minecraft and they have an a library and interface so that you can use minecraft
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:17.200]   for your ai to test it for ai research and they've also opened this up
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:22.320]   which is great um so ai x if you want if you don't want to learn how to play
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.080]   go learn how to play minecraft but you as you say alpha go learn
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.560]   breakout first yeah they they ran it through like 13
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.280]   different Atari games i think yeah because it's general purpose it's
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.160]   they want to use it for i think medical um some kind of medical diagnostic thing
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.920]   next the the deep mind has a bunch of presentations out there where they
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.720]   talk about kind of the future and how they want to apply this to
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.760]   actual useful things besides just beating video games
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.000]   right
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.520]   um all right let's take a break when we come back i know ron you've played with
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.240]   it i'm sure matt you have two i'm calling it uh android nutroll
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:09.280]   uh i don't think google will we know nut yeah there is hiroshi lokheimer
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.560]   said that nut would be in the name or implied it he says i'm not going to tell
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.160]   you what the name is uh but let's talk a little bit about the new
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:22.400]   version of android i've put it on my uh my six p and uh actually i started with
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.920]   my pixel c thinking well i couldn't make it any worse
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:31.040]   uh and maybe no actually you know what to be honest i love my pixel c
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.800]   but this i thought split screen will be really good on a tablet
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.240]   uh and it was so stable and reliable i thought well i can put it on my six p
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.760]   now this is uh this is actually surprisingly ready
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.840]   not recommending it but but but it is an early it's an early bit
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.480]   it's first bit is an alpha but the google is allowing anybody with a modern
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.240]   nexus device to try it out we'll talk about ron you can give us your
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.440]   feedback matt too if you've got anything to say about have you you've tried it
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.640]   matt right come on i could neither confirm nor do you
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:04.400]   not allow it's he's been running it for the last three months from
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:10.480]   it's public for crying out oh okay ron and i will talk about
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.400]   our show today brought to you by fresh books if you're a freelancer or you're
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.480]   on sabbatical and uh you want to send out invoices you know you have to send out
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.480]   the invoices to get paid you probably don't really want to follow fire up
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.160]   google docs and to get the spread sheet and put all your expenses in there and
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.800]   then create an invoice and print it out and
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:32.000]   uh lick it the stamp and put it on the envelope and mail it you probably want
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.200]   to do it easier in fact it's such a burden was always such a burden for
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:38.560]   me to send out invoices that i often just didn't
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.840]   you know and i i put it off i don't want to do that
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.120]   which means you don't get paid because with no invoice no pay
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.800]   so what's nice fresh books that came along and i think i started using them
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:54.400]   in 2003 2004 and it made it so easy to do uh invoices
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:59.120]   that i would email clients paid faster because it was easier for them to pay
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.440]   and they've just gotten better and better and you know what the best part
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.200]   about fresh books is it organizes all your cash flow
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.760]   information you can see what invoices you've sent
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:14.000]   who's paid you what your income is which makes it easy for yeah tax time
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.760]   tax time their mobile app will let you take pictures of receipts organize
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.920]   them for later which means it's easy to invoice for them if you get if you get
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:26.880]   reimbursed or claiming them as expenses when a tax time comes around
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.400]   you're just gonna love this feeling the reports make it so simple either to go
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.880]   to your accountant or do it yourself now it probably is a little too late
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.760]   for tax time this year if you haven't been using fresh books but now would be a
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.360]   good time to start for next year especially since we've got a free
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:46.720]   30-day trial for you go to freshbooks.com/twig
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:51.440]   get the app on ios and android you'll love it it's ridiculously simple
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.000]   cloud accounting software and it lets you sail through tax time sail through
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.640]   those chores at the end of the month that make you get paid faster
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.760]   even if you're not a numbers person actually especially if you're not a
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:07.520]   numbers person fresh books i loved it i really did
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:14.880]   freshbooks.com/twig for 30 days free this week in google
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.600]   matt cuts is here ronomadio marce technica
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:24.000]   and uh we were kind of surprised in the middle of twig last week
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.440]   when the when uh what all of a sudden it said hey
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.560]   you can install android n we don't even have a name for it but you can
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.880]   install it if you have a nexus 5x or a 6p or a pixel c or
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.680]   um the nexus 9 although i think that's held up a little bit
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:45.280]   um so ron you put it on your 6p i put it on a nexus 6 old school
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.880]   old okay wow old school phone i don't have a 6p
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.040]   doesn't work on the five unfortunately so there are some people left out but
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:58.880]   if you have a recent nexus phone right um it's it's just a developer preview
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.480]   so you know don't go don't go running off to install it on your actual
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.240]   production phones um but uh it's a cool looking for
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.520]   i guess mainly app developers to kind of get ahead of the
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:13.360]   the changes that they're gonna make in the new app having said that i've found
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.440]   it to be pretty stable though right have you had
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:18.320]   the only issues i've had like when i run instagram instagram
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.840]   complains through your libraries they're so weird and then it just goes on and
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:27.600]   runs normally it depends i like on my pixel c it
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.440]   resets about every 10 minutes what i don't i don't know why
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.680]   mine doesn't mine's really reliable so there's two different ways to get it on
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.200]   your device oh i did the over the air okay i did an
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.400]   ota yeah you can sign up for the beta program
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.280]   the new thing is to sign up for the beta program which is super easy like you
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.640]   go to this website and you hit enroll and google like
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.120]   instantly pushes you an ota for the beta and i did that on my pixel c and it was
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.680]   super unstable so i don't know i'm gonna try
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.840]   i'm just going to go to the website by the way it's google.com/andrite/beta
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.360]   and you just push the button and you can see i've enrolled both my pixel c and
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.560]   my six p it'll show you your eligible devices that you have attached to that
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.400]   account i have a bunch of devices that haven't shown up in
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:16.560]   there but my nexus six showed up three times so oh
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.680]   i don't i don't know how that works i really wanted you to upgrade
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:23.440]   yeah but once you get it installed you get split screen and a new notification
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.680]   panel and tons and tons of under-the-hood
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.480]   improvements to dig through i really i really like it i love the
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:36.320]   the compact notifications where pushes them all into
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.120]   what's nice well here you can see i have my chat room
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:42.720]   my notifications and so these would be multiple notifications but when i
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.560]   tap it actually this didn't do it in this case but on some of them
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:50.000]   if you it's if you pull down on them though you pull down on it then you get
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.080]   the other ones okay but those aren't bundled these aren't bundled so i just
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.120]   screwed it up for you but um it's it's it's nice i also love the
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:03.440]   the new uh we call it uh it's not a hamburger we call it a grilled cheese
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.160]   so if you if you've got multiple programs running and you press and hold
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:13.920]   the uh recents button right it turns into open open something first oh i have to
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.560]   have something open okay now do it there you go
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.920]   and it turns into the grilled cheese which is a double
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.880]   button and it shows me on the it splits the screen by the way this is
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.560]   resizable which i really like so i could have the chat
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.920]   room open here and uh and then pick from one of my
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.400]   other let's have google plus open here
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.240]   and i mean this is this is what this is probably the single most
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.760]   important feature that was missing from the pixel c this makes
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:44.080]   the pixel c pretty good yep yeah definitely it's really nice on
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.480]   that let's use for on a phone probably right
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.560]   actually one of the things i found there's besides that feature there's another
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.640]   one that lets you kind of zoom out the display you can set the
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.200]   the kind of overall size of android yeah if you have if you have a really big
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.720]   phone with these features now big phones become like more useful because
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.320]   when the nexus six first came out it was this giant six-inch screen but all
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.040]   that happened was android got bigger right you didn't see more of android
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.240]   right and now with these settings you can actually do more with your big
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.520]   screen which is surprisingly useful that's that's why i have it on the
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.920]   gigantic yeah because you have the gigantic or
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.880]   shamu yeah yeah here's a nexus five and this giant
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.480]   look how big that thing is kaburah wow
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.760]   looks like uh she's big that's nice so you change the deep
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.440]   is i don't is it a dpi setting it's like a dpi setting yeah that's what it is
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.960]   they surface that okay but it's it's limited to like
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.200]   you can zoom out one level uh which is not a ton
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:50.400]   um and you can zoom in a bunch if you like have trouble seeing you can make
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.760]   everything super big uh but it's it's very cool that they finally
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.040]   surfaced that there was it was a super popular mod that people would do if they
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:00.960]   like rooted their phone or whatever it feels like almost some of this stuff is
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.120]   stuff that uh google learned from the mod community it's like oh you like that
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.200]   uh i love the summaries now you get in the um
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.520]   uh system settings so the you kind of you don't have to dig into the settings to
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:18.720]   see like for instance which wi-fi is selected uh what my brightness is right
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.920]   now uh how many you know what my ringer volume is
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.840]   all of that is very handy i mean the only reason i'd ever open storage was to
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.440]   see how much storage i have left well now i see it without up actually going into
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.560]   it so where do i is it display that i can change the
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.160]   dpi yeah display size there it is display size as
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:41.200]   opposed to font size and then um i have uh four settings so
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.400]   i press plus oops it's it's thinking about it yeah
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:50.480]   it's thinking about it and is it changing is it changing both windows it is
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:56.000]   so that's kind of that's kind of cool i mean for a large screen phone or a
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.520]   tablet what's great is both those windows are active windows like you can
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:03.120]   scroll up on one and down on the other simultaneously
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.560]   it's not like ios where it's like one kind of goes passive and one
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.880]   goes active this is exactly what on a tablet uh this is
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.840]   awesome now so it looks like most of what's new in
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.760]   android and at least is is ui i don't know what's under the hood but a lot of
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:22.000]   new ui stuff um i love uh and i think it was a jr
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.880]   rf ale pointed this out he said there's two
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.600]   features i really like that nobody ever talks about
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.720]   one is the ability to switch context very rapidly you double tap the
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.600]   recents button and it'll bring up the last app you used
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:40.960]   just boom um so you can you can just switch context like that
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.440]   i think that's that is actually a really nice feature
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.680]   oh okay cool yeah yeah and then if you if you're in um
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.280]   multiple um you know you're in recents and you have multiple you can like alt
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.680]   tab between them but just hitting it once you can see what you're different
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.400]   and by the way these are bigger thumbnails in before
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:03.520]   so this is great i mean i have to say and unlike you you see i've been using it
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.480]   i haven't had any crashes at all on my epic yeah
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.240]   so i don't get mine i don't know something's wrong with mine i'll have to mess with it
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.560]   mine might be pre-release from google i don't know uh yeah i didn't we need to do
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:18.320]   some special debugging for run i got it when it came out on
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:23.040]   Wednesday so maybe i couldn't complete setup it just keeps
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:28.000]   just keeps rebooting we should mention that you can opt out of course you can
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.960]   unenroll the device but you should be aware that it will wipe your data
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.240]   it will it will just basically reset your phone back to the
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:41.920]   latest stable release so uh don't do this unless you're willing to do that
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.760]   well and especially if people have been using a pixel c it seemed like a lot of
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:49.680]   the feedback on those reviews was we wish we had better windows management
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:54.400]   so it's kind of nice that this is providing that sort of features you know in some
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.920]   sort of form pretty early on so that people can be using it while they're
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.800]   testing it or get an idea of what's coming yeah i'm thrilled
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:05.280]   we also saw a rumor i don't know if you saw this uh i won't ask you to comment
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:11.120]   Matt uh that there would be like windows like separated windows
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.400]   coming out at some point i don't know if that's and or if that's something special
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:19.520]   for the pixel c did you see that run yeah so in the in the android and
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.760]   uh developer docs it mentions a free form window mode
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.040]   um where yeah which is basically going to be
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.120]   it sounds a lot like kind of like what remix os is where it's like android
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.560]   with kind of free floating app windows that you can move around with i guess
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.320]   a mouse and keyboard i don't know kind of silly i asked ron if he saw it would
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:45.920]   in fact the article was i run that i read i didn't note that of course you know
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:50.560]   about it that's how i found out about it
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.600]   it's good about things yeah i i try sometimes i don't know see this was
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:00.400]   this was dumb i all of this stuff comes out all at once and there's no way to
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.600]   to dig through it all and you just kind of post whatever you find
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:07.840]   so i like decompiled the operating system to find this reference to
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.680]   free form windows and people like it's in the docs you're dummy
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:16.160]   you know like the reverse engineer it um but yeah
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.320]   after i posted that i somebody linked me the doc things and i'm like oh okay but
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.760]   so the thing is like why would you do this um
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.520]   is it is it desktop android like is this the first step because it
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:33.200]   it doesn't make a ton of sense on phones it's kind of weird on tablets without a
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:37.520]   without a mouse right so are we seeing the first step toward the
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:44.240]   the rumored desktop operating system i i would be very happy frankly
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.120]   uh to have that on the piece of stuff these in windows
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:51.680]   yeah well i already did that you just make me want to buy a pixel c leo
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.600]   yeah by the way if you're a developer 25 percent off on the pixel c right now
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:00.160]   also broken by ron no no if you say you're a developer they do know
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:06.320]   if you're a developer not of nine drawing
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:11.040]   and that cuts it right there you can't say these things you can't
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:16.560]   i'm sure everyone who clicks that box has done at least a few hello world
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.320]   programs exactly who is a developer yeah we're all
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:25.520]   developers and services it's a good point right i'm
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:29.200]   learning i want to learn development i have multiple projects in various
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.960]   stages of development yeah most of them you know include
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:40.480]   headers dot h done so uh so and so a 25 percent off
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:43.520]   it gets down to like three what is it where is it here is it here
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:49.360]   beach 75 375 that's good yeah so you could basically get the keyboard for
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.640]   free the keyboards another 150 bucks don't i think
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.000]   i have never unlike many in fact unlike most
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.080]   fact that okay let's say everybody but me never regretted purchasing the pixel
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.720]   c i really like it and i love that get the get the hard
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.000]   keyboard you know the one that has the big magnet and i love that
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.560]   it's such a such a nice system and it fits just right in my man bag
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:19.520]   so i had to get a bigger i'm gonna write a blog post
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:26.640]   on the preff searching shopping for man bag because i have now become a full
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.880]   convert to carrying a purse and uh and one of the reasons is
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.000]   because you can tab you know these little computers or you could be a
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.920]   surface maybe or so uh will fit so nicely in a small
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.880]   relatively small bag and um and then you got it with you all the time and
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.760]   this is a it's not a desktop computing environment
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.440]   but there's so much stuff on android there's so many i can see why
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.640]   as much as i love the chrome book i could see why google might say well if we're
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.440]   really going to do something like this it probably should be android i mean
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.320]   look at all the apps
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.280]   a lot more apps yeah and i'm i'm by the way not using the
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.720]   google watchers you probably figured out i'm using uh no for launcher which is my
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.760]   favorite but then it works uh people look at my desktop and they go what's
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.400]   wrong with you i'm add that's what's going on
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:18.000]   nicely but i can tell this is my music page right you know
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.600]   nice and the nice thing about nova is you save these and then you just apply
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:25.360]   it to the next device so it's not like i have to go through this each time
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.240]   oh that's smart yeah yeah there's there's a big google plus
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.600]   uh widget giant i don't know if i really will keep that this
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.840]   normally has a widget i think i must have erased
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.680]   but accidentally relates to widget there it's amazing though the the pixel
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:44.720]   seed came out in december so it was three months ago four months ago like you
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:49.360]   guys couldn't wait three four months so that we could kind of see that oh this
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:53.360]   is what's going to happen and that it it seems like it came out just way too
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:56.000]   early before the software was ready for it at all
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.960]   so come on matt tell us the truth was it you run who who i think it was that had
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.720]   the story that this is what really happened
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.240]   right that it started it yeah there were references to the
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.720]   pixel seaboard in the chrome os repository for a bit and then they kind of
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.760]   went away and then android came out so yeah it was
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.160]   it was weird i don't know it was uh the story was
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.320]   ron wrote it of course the pixel c was probably never supposed to run
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:28.240]   and read and you have i think extremely strong
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:34.800]   uh evidence that uh this you know starting in 2014 this rew board
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:42.400]   um was designed for a particular kind of new hybrid os
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.360]   that got canceled the chrome os uh touch chrome os got canceled
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.080]   and then they did project a thena
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.680]   which was you know i mean there's you could see the steps and i think you
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.480]   documented it quite well so i'm mad i wouldn't expect you to confirm or
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.240]   deny particularly well and as a as a search guy i don't have any
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.280]   insight you don't know okay sort of back and forth anyway but then the frank
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:08.000]   and board and i you know it might have been rushed to get the pixel
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.160]   c i remember they announced it uh was it was it that the next is it was at the
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.280]   next launch event the next is yeah six and six p and five x launch
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.800]   event they said right yeah look at this it's cool and then
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:25.200]   nothing and then all it was again was i think it was during twig all of a sudden
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:31.120]   it's on sale and i ordered one immediately and and uh so did so did jeff
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.320]   and he's had a little problem with his but he got his replaced and it's working
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:39.120]   it wasn't starting for some reason um you had december 8th it went on sale
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.400]   and some thought thought the reviewers seemed to think that maybe it was
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.560]   premature that there wasn't uh that andra it wasn't the right os for this but i
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:51.920]   i've been very happy um using it as just an android tablet
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:57.040]   yeah well i don't know exactly yeah why they moved up the in beta uh you know
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.640]   some people said if the in beta is available then developers have more
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:04.080]   of a chance to play with it and get ready for it and also oem's might have
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.200]   more of a chance which is also kind of nice yes but it's also a nice side
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.000]   benefit that it helps the pixel see because now you've got better
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.680]   witness management so that's you know three good reasons right there
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.520]   i'm thrilled well i think i i'm gonna give you another reason i think
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:20.720]   uh and ron would probably disagree but it's
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:25.680]   surprisingly stable it feels like that there also might have been the calculus
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.200]   you know what this is actually pretty done it's pretty good it may not be
[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.560]   done but it's good enough to put it out there with people aren't going to be
[00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.360]   saying it crashes every five seconds except for ron
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.560]   uh and uh it is plenty stable on my yeah my six is fine right
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.240]   just yeah just i don't know something's wrong with
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:47.040]   re-do re-do the pixel because i have this has been rock solid
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:51.360]   and the only issue i've had is that some apps
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.760]   um
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:58.000]   either give me an air throw an error and then continue on i think i had one
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.880]   app error out i can't remember which app that was
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.040]   uh it wouldn't run it might have been ways
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:08.320]   ways has been flaky lately well i had ways uh dying on my nexus five
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.520]   yes so ways you know i think there was a
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.040]   uh sis or an excess or a security update and then
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.560]   you know that was getting some errors yeah so i think we fixed that i took ways
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.920]   off of my six p because every five minutes it would say
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.720]   ways is crashed i wasn't even running it
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.360]   it was wow right ways is crashed
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:31.920]   hmm what's going on there yeah and i don't use it enough that i mean
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:34.640]   google maps has a lot of the ways information in it now you know it's
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:38.240]   interesting my car which uses i have an Audi it has google earth
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:42.000]   uh tied in it must be tied in live because it's got t-mobile
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   t-mobile sim in the car it's now giving me ways style
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.640]   it told me there was an accident ahead nice wow it must have as much as you
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.240]   getting ways data so it's google earth not google maps
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:58.000]   isn't that weird it's it's it's it's google max functionality it does turn
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.720]   by turn and i see streets and uh but they say google maps on it and it
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.640]   does have the satellite view that is i think google maps satellite view
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.840]   i'm not sure what the difference is really but yeah i've i've been digging
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:13.840]   through these uh these car infotainment systems and
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.360]   they're completely insane so yeah that that was some weird like custom thing
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:22.000]   that Audi and google made i guess but it it works it's just like before
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.120]   android showed up with smartphones where you have all these all these weird
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.320]   operating systems that like some some dude made at the car company and
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.080]   threw it on the car and will never be updated again
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:38.720]   yeah i'm pretty sure it's qx it's at least a decent
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.640]   os it's a real-time real os made by blackberry now
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.400]   yeah which is rare well and it's it's also interesting because everybody talks
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.480]   about the self-driving cars and sometime this week i saw an article that said
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:55.920]   the newest honda civic has you know like automatic lane assist and the
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:59.360]   automatic cruise control and so you're starting to see these
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.440]   features you know and it also that this is i wish jeff were on the show i think
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:07.840]   it also has both android auto and uh an apple car player whatever their
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.880]   system is called so honda does is that one of our
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.920]   i meant to tell jeff that because one of our guys bought a civic
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.440]   and it has both and he's very happy with it so i met yeah yeah my buddy has a
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.400]   2016 accord and it'll do it it does lane it will try to steer but
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:26.720]   we're talking about lane guidance by cameras
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:31.520]   looking down at the road to see paint like the difference between that and a
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:34.320]   real self-driving car with like lydar and all that stuff is
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:39.440]   is completely different sure yeah that's the start to trickle into the market a
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.640]   little bit oh yeah yeah my howdy does that it's
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:48.480]   called lane assist right and um you can see that it's seeing the paint
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:52.560]   and actually i what it told me is how often i veer
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:58.320]   into i think i'm an old man uh because what it does is it vibrates the
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.840]   steering wheel uh and it's like you're going over bots
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:06.160]   dots it's good and even though there's kind of virtual
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:12.000]   dots and it goes and so you go back and i think i think it will in addition
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.880]   pretension the seat belts begin to break and things like that
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:19.120]   it also if a car pulls in front of me it will jam on the brakes
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.240]   even if it dap i have a sit adaptive cruise control which
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.240]   is really good for stop-and-go traffic you just turn it on and you sit back
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.760]   and the you still have to steer but the but the car
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.280]   will will keep a distance between the car in front of it
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:37.840]   if the car in front of it stops it stops it's pretty amazing
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.160]   we're getting there we're getting there we're getting there
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.080]   slowly uh you know these are only in the very high-end cars at this point
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.640]   although if the court has it that's a good sign
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:50.240]   it's a civic the Honda Civic well he's got car i don't think he has the
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.880]   is uh although that's somebody has the car play i was talking about the car
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.920]   play in the okay yeah i'm doing it well and the civic the civic does have
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:59.760]   android auto in the car play and it's great and the you know lane following
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:03.280]   does well nice the new one yeah that's the basic
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:08.080]   model right yeah that's great yep we're getting there
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:12.160]   that's the way it's going to sneak in uh is just you get more you know bit by
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:16.000]   bit they they kind of start to take over more and more
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.280]   and you get you get the part of it is just for the human to get more
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.400]   confident in the ability of the car yeah to uh that is terrifying yeah the
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:29.360]   i i tried tesla's um auto driving thing which they were
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.760]   demoing in new york city like you want to talk about
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.800]   terrifying traffic on like the new york city boulevards or whatever
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.480]   and yeah there's a video where you want to like the west side highway or
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:44.080]   something it was like crazy yes yeah it was is that the west side
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.720]   highway you're driving down it and like the trade center is right
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:50.800]   yeah like center wherever that's okay yeah and and yeah there's a video
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.120]   somewhere online of me just you know screaming
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.680]   it was horrifying
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:02.480]   but you didn't get an accident did you how hard is it though not to grab the
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.440]   wheel and jam on the brakes it's really hard
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.440]   it's of muscle muscle memory but you're trying to turn off
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:13.520]   it will it will take some time for us to get used to this whole motion
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.480]   but or maybe less time than we think i don't know
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.480]   it is it is a very um
[00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:26.640]   uh i think relaxing prospect to have just the car come get you take you home
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:32.960]   we'll all have chauffeurs in the future yeah that'll be great our robot chauffeurs
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:39.680]   ah right let's see what else i'm gonna jump into the uh
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.120]   fabulous document that Jason clant this has prepared for us
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:48.000]   with a list of all the stories i'm gonna forget to talk about
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:54.240]   i love that that google introduced a transparency report for itself
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:01.280]   regarding https so the the top line stat is now 77 percent of all the traffic
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.880]   to and from google is now encrypted which is you know that's good progress right
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.200]   there that's amazing progress and that some of that is let's
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:14.640]   let's encrypt right uh i think this is not this particular one is
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.520]   strictly google um and that is our using google
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:21.600]   search not that's right yeah that's right because google is a
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.240]   certificate authority i'm sure right and let's encrypt is fantastic i think
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.120]   they just had like a million certificates go out
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.320]   um but uh you know for the for the google
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.080]   numbers i think it's something like they count almost everything soup to nuts
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:39.760]   like even mobile api calls and stuff like that so
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.280]   to get to 77 percent of everything being encrypted when you're talking to
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:47.840]   google makes it that much harder for a neighborhood cafe or your boss or an
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:52.480]   ISP or a government to spy on you so yeah we i mean
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:57.040]   i had mixed feelings about google uh last year started saying you know you're
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:00.240]   gonna not gonna show up uh as well on search results and eventually
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.960]   chrome is going to ding you if you don't do
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:07.280]   https and i you know i kind of there's
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.800]   i understand why it's a good idea and it should have it
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:15.680]   https should be everywhere uh but you know if we don't even have a
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.520]   you know there's no log in to our site and you don't even download
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.400]   podcasts from our site you download them from somewhere else really it's a
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.400]   it's a read-only site uh and even if somebody did a man in the
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:30.560]   middle i don't know what i mean i guess they could put malware on it but
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:34.320]   um we did it i did it i bit the board and did
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.760]   what the hell well you talked about people
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:41.120]   a lot of people probably think of it like google is like using some big club
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:44.400]   trying to urge people and it's it's much closer to a series of
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.720]   gentle behavioral nudges like in gmail if you email somebody and it's not going
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.160]   to be encrypted uh then you'll see a little red lock that's open
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.080]   so it just knows you know yeah that's fine just a little tiny i don't mind that
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.680]   push people towards better safety and security they did say and i think you'll
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.480]   start to see this uh later this year that pretty soon it's gonna start
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.000]   looking worse and worse if you're on a non-encrypted site
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.880]   like they'll be sure bigger x's and yeah it'll look scary
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:17.120]   but but if you think about it a lot of energy that used to get wasted on
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.320]   things that weren't as useful people are now spinning on things like making
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:24.320]   their site faster or or like let's encrypt where you've got free ssl
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.920]   and that's making a big difference there's this yeah there's very little
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:32.480]   reasonable yeah not to at this point since let's encrypt
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.200]   basically not only gives you a free cert
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.800]   but it has a script that will automatically install it on an Apache or
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:44.800]   nginx site not iis yet but uh that means that most sites
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.840]   it's as simple as you push a button and this because that was
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.920]   it wasn't merely the cost uh it was it was the engineering
[00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.760]   involved right and you know i still have a site the tech i lab site the radio
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:59.200]   site which is not htps uh it's running on nginx i should
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:03.360]   probably look into uh uh getting that uh
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:07.120]   a cert it could still be simpler but i'm glad to see
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.240]   you know the collective will of everybody on the internet pushing things
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.680]   towards less friction less headache less hassle to get those
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:16.960]   in certificates installed well of course with this debate uh this apple
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:21.040]   department of justice debate i think um awareness of the importance of
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:24.800]   encryption is really uh i bet you it's a hundred percent
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.720]   greater now than it was yeah of a month ago right
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:33.280]   yeah the the seventy seven percent thing is interesting because i i always
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:37.440]   picture google services as like your data is online somewhere and and you're
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.640]   going to go access it so like of course all that would be encrypted but like
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.280]   what's left what are the google things that are not
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.520]   encrypted yeah well and there's some like news
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:52.480]   uh a lot of the big trend it was uh advertising so it was like 10 percent
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:57.120]   in uh january of 2014 and now something like 77 percent of all the
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:01.040]   advertising is encrypted with ssl and so for a while people said oh we we
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.520]   don't feel comfortable going to ssl because we don't know that the ad
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:06.640]   networks will work right and so those sometimes those were bringing up the
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.440]   tail end but even there there's really good progress
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:13.920]   tell us why in simple terms that everyone can understand it's a good thing
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:19.280]   for everything to be https i mean use if you want my
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:22.160]   the you know our website where there's there's no
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.320]   login there's no purchases there's no data
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:30.800]   being transferred it's just a it's like a brochure a read-only site
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:34.960]   why should that be encrypted do you want to go wrong or do you want me to
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:39.120]   taste that? no it's yours man it's yours okay i'm given this to you
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:42.160]   the big one would be the man in the middle attacks you know you might
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.320]   include some javascript from another site and then someone can basically
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.360]   interject themselves in between and give you malicious javascript and we
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:53.200]   we saw that with like uh i forget if it was like the great firewall of china
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.320]   or something where they were they were adding extra things to the
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.760]   javascript that would cause a denial of service attack against other sites
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:03.280]   and so even things like where you know when you're getting your cookies and
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:07.920]   stuff like that and you might think that well the other thing is
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:11.360]   you know you don't want your isp interjecting ads you know if you type in a
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:15.680]   domain name that doesn't exist or or you know it's better to have all of those
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:19.760]   channels encrypted so that you know it and whoever you're talking to knows it
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.200]   but nobody in between knows it you don't you know necessarily want to have
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.560]   those those things where somebody knows oh they they go to
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:30.160]   windows weekly and so they probably have a windows device so that's how i would
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.920]   attack leo or something like that right um just all those things add up
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:38.400]   and if you're on an open wi-fi access spot which you shouldn't be
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:42.000]   without protection but if you are uh then the man in the middle can be from the
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.880]   guy sitting you know across from you yeah
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:49.280]   fire sheep yeah or neighborhood cafe that was the that was the revelation that
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:53.680]   got facebook to uh do https was fire sheep which
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:56.880]   allow you could run run fire sheep on firefox
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.200]   and sit in the cafe sniff the traffic going on around you if you saw somebody
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:04.400]   was on facebook you could grab their token
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.720]   the the cookie that facebook uses to say oh you've already logged in yeah i know
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:12.880]   you're you and you could sit there and be on their facebook page and start
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.720]   posting stuff and i think that that demonstration
[00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:21.280]   i remember when steve gibson uh saw fire sheep he was he said this is the
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.000]   greatest thing ever i said steve this is horrible
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:29.840]   he said no this is going to force everybody to use htps and he was right i
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:34.000]   mean that that i think was a single data point that that finally got facebook
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.240]   to do uh secure yeah sometimes things have to break before they get better
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.680]   you know like you know the snow news everybody's like this is terrible i was
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:45.040]   like this is yes it is terrible but it means everybody's going to be a lot more
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.040]   serious about security so that's a good thing
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.800]   uh except for the president but that's another story
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:58.800]   he really let me down i tell you uh he's been you know i'm a democrat i voted for a
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:02.080]   bomb i contributed to his campaign i'm a big supporter and
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:05.920]   and uh and uh i feel like he's been in general a good president of course no
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:08.960]   president no politician is going to be a hundred percent you're never going to
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.960]   score a hundred percent with anybody because
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.680]   you're going to do something somebody doesn't like
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.360]   but i'm very disappointed that uh he was at south by southwest
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.840]   doing saying good things really good things
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:23.920]   saying uh this was on friday you know help us tech
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:28.080]   community make government more efficient more responsive more transparent
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:31.200]   uh it's going to take you and your coding abilities and that you know feel good
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:35.760]   message and everybody sign them up and then at the end in the q amp a
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.920]   the the moderator says well what about this uh apple phone thing and he just
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:43.920]   he just ruins the whole thing he says we've got to stop fetishizing
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.840]   these phones why they shouldn't be private encryption
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:52.320]   we can come to a compromise and that as you probably as everybody who's
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:56.000]   watching knows because i've gone off on off on this a couple of times
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.440]   uh there is no compromise when it comes to encryption it's just not
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:03.600]   it's math it's not a compromise there's no two plus two equals four
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:07.440]   uh or five or maybe six i don't know could it be three
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:12.960]   no it always equals four period period did you see the john all of her
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:17.120]   segment yeah i didn't but everybody's raving about this was a good yeah
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:21.280]   it was great and that's the one to send to your regular friends as it moves
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.240]   to techie friends because it goes through all the points and then it says
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.520]   well what about other countries you know what if you have to weaken it for
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:33.120]   you know oppressive governments and to fit in that much nuance into 22
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:37.200]   minutes is a pretty impressive feat so that's a good one to send out yeah
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   um and i think what's i hope this has become clear we'll see because apple's
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:44.480]   gonna do an event on monday in which they will give this is like their closing
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:48.560]   arguments their last chance to say something before the judge
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.880]   rules on tuesday probably will rule against them i'm guessing will rule
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:55.840]   against them and then it'll be appealed and i'll go to the supreme court and we'll
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:59.920]   see what happens there but uh it's it's apple's last chance to really
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:04.240]   i think tim cook really kind of uh figured out
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:12.560]   the angle on this is that if encryption is weakened in any way
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:18.160]   it's it reduces our security it does not improve our security
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:23.120]   so anything you do in this one case that solves this one question
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:27.200]   will inevitably have repercussions that will weaken our security across the
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:32.400]   board and if people get that i think that
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:37.120]   congress which ultimately will have to make or not make a law about this
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:42.560]   we have a shot we have a shot that maybe congress will will will go oh
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.600]   yeah this is bad for public safety it's just very simple
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:49.520]   this is it's a bad idea for public safety if if law enforcement is a backdoor
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:53.440]   encryption of any kind it's bad for public safety
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.560]   and i'm sure this is google's i know this is google's point of view uh as
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:00.160]   well well and i love that that tim cook has
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:03.440]   basically decided to make privacy a cornerstone of apples
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.560]   message and philosophy and yes they're marketing but
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:10.480]   good on apple that's fantastic it's you know that's the ultimate pro user
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:14.640]   stance to to you know really concern yourself with privacy and security
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:18.640]   and i think google tends to think more about the security aspect of it and
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.640]   apple has been lately emphasizing the privacy aspect of it but both of those
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:26.800]   together are a fantastic thing and i i hope tim talks about it
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.680]   you know as much as he can and i hope that all the
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.720]   companies in the tech industry continue to file these amicus briefs and those
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.840]   sorts of things yeah did google file an amicus brief i'm sure
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.440]   they did i think a lot of companies came all together
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:42.800]   to file as one and i believe google was part of that so
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.680]   you you probably can guess how i feel personally about this so
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:49.440]   you know take me with a grain of salt ron how do you feel about it
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:54.160]   i think everybody is in agreement strong yeah we shouldn't have encryption what
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:58.400]   a bad idea no no encryption anywhere
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:02.560]   um it's you know i i i agree and i'm i'm full agreement with the president and
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:07.280]   law enforcement um that uh in order you know that that a
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:10.960]   search warrant should allow law enforcement to search
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:14.240]   uh if it's you know there's probable cause and a court orders it
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.720]   that's how it works in this country and until now it was
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:22.160]   the human brain was the only place exempt from that the fifth amendment said you
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.720]   can't be compelled to testify against yourself and
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:29.360]   courts deemed that well that meant that you know we can't read your mind
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:33.200]   um you can't force compel you for instance to give up a password because
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:38.800]   that would be self-incrimination um but the problem is once encryption
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:44.000]   existed once public key crypto became known and it's a simple concept
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.120]   that had once understood can many many coders can write
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:52.560]   encryption routines it's not hard um that that did change the equation and
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:56.480]   while i understand why law enforcement doesn't like that idea there's nothing
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:59.600]   you can do about at this point you can't you can't put the
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:04.720]   horse back in the barn bad guys will have encryption
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:09.360]   and if you weaken encryption in a misguided attempt to make it
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.800]   uh easier to do your job as law enforcement and i'm all for them doing
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.480]   their job as law enforcement the problem with that is you weaken it for
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.880]   everybody and uh and that's and we know that from history
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:24.240]   this isn't even something we haven't tried before we tried to
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:28.480]   block strong encryption exports and all it did was cause a security problem
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:32.400]   which has lasted 20 years and has only now been kind of fixed
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:39.840]   the 40-bit uh SSL browser so i think we it's not even any question in anybody
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:42.640]   who's really dug into this i don't think there should be any question in
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.320]   anybody's mind and while the president wants compromise
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.880]   because he's a politician and that's the art of politics is the art of
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.600]   compromise and negotiation and working it out
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:54.720]   there's no compromising with the fact that the math
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:57:00.320]   is out there i think it's just it's done something you could do about
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:04.240]   um all right enough said it'll be very interesting to see what Tim Cook
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:08.160]   says this will be like i said closing arguments for apple on monday
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:14.080]   yep and i i i while no one knows and we've even debated whether he'll do this i
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.920]   would be shocked if he didn't take the first 15 minutes
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:21.920]   of apple's presentation to make that case as strong as he as he can
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:27.840]   uh instagrams wants to uh do the same thing facebook's been doing and twitter
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.520]   has said it will do which is to start showing pictures
[00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:35.520]   out of order what do you think about that
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:43.040]   algorithmic feeds ron are you a pro or con i might
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:48.160]   not i'm abstaining i'm a non-instagram user really i don't really use twitter
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:52.800]   i don't really do instagram or facebook i do do twitter and yeah i i mean i do
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:55.920]   twitter with like tweet deck and all these crazy
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:01.120]   gestures they don't stream twitter apps right so they don't pay attention to
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:06.000]   what twitter does well i mean i right i want to see everything i
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.040]   really don't need you doing some weird right algorithm thing at least on twitter
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.480]   because that's the point of that is kind of real time
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:18.800]   instagram i don't use but i mean it's pictures i don't
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:22.960]   i doubt anybody feels strongly about instagram as they do twitter
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:27.120]   pretty pretty think what do you think that uh i i think people tend to be
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:31.760]   change averse you know everybody was so angry when twitter changed from stars
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:35.680]   to hearts and now everybody's like whatever click the heart you know so
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:39.600]   uh you know as long as they're relatively reasonable about it and things don't
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:43.520]   show up from four years ago and and you know they they could start about slow
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:48.320]   and turn the dial up slowly yeah it seems seems like i wouldn't want to miss a
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:52.160]   great picture just because i happen not to be online when it stream through so
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:55.680]   you know power to you instagram let's see what happens what they realized is
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.280]   that uh people i kind of do this when i go to instagram i go
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.160]   until i see until i get to pictures i've seen before and they go okay i've seen
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:05.920]   everything right but they realize most people don't do that they say in fact
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:10.000]   now on average 70 percent of your fee people miss they like go back a few
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.600]   pictures uh twitter was the same problem right i never could catch up with
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:18.000]   twitter that's you know that's crazy talk okay so but what you get used to is
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.680]   you go well i know uh twitter's not a uh content feed
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:27.760]   uh in which you try to read the thing cover to cover it's a it's a river of
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.040]   stuff that you dip into uh ad hoc whenever you
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:34.320]   have in the mode and what you get is what you get at that moment
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:38.240]   on the other hand i kind of so i didn't like the idea of the chronological
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:43.040]   of removing the chronological feed uh on twitter but actually in hindsight i
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:46.800]   think they did it well uh what you might have missed and you can very
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:50.320]   quickly get back to chronological and i kind of like it so i yeah
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:55.200]   i've come around i'm i'm a believer in the in the modified feed i don't know about
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:58.640]   facebook facebook's so opaque as to what they're doing so
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:01.440]   twitter you kind of know this is stuff you might have missed
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.280]   you know i presume instagram will be kind of like that that's the way to do it is
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:09.120]   say hey here's a here's a few photos from people you like that you might have
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:14.640]   missed and now back to your feed right well facebook's weird about how
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:20.160]   they do that and they charge for promotion for stuff so there's there's like this
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:24.080]   weird conflict of interest of of how they how they do their algorithm versus
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.440]   how they you know extract money out of i don't know
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:33.680]   big accounts and all that right yeah facebook is just it uh it's opaque it's
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.680]   random it doesn't and it's funny because i think people
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.640]   use facebook or exactly the kind of people who say but i want to see all of
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.720]   amp mods posts in order that's why i'm on facebook
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:48.400]   i want to know what my kids are up to
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:54.160]   well of all the people not to do it uh right
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:01:00.160]   uh okay i thought i could stir up some controversy but we're all
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.560]   we're all pretty mellow about that um it's pictures
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:14.560]   fine let's talk about google in court russia google has lost its appeal
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.760]   google as you know it's kind of complicated maybe wrong could explain
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:22.080]   it better than i even though android is open source and there is the android
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:26.240]   uh open aosp
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:31.280]   android open source project which is just android without any google stuff
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.800]   if you want to make an android phone with google stuff you have to
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:39.120]   include all the google stuff is that right right yeah usually it's uh
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:42.400]   there's a there's a package that you kind of have to take of all the
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.360]   google plants it's not all of them but it's most of the google
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.040]   apps yeah yeah google and and you have to give
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:54.240]   uh preferential placement to google search and um
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:57.440]   some other stuff you know you have to bundle pretty much all the google
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.800]   services that always struck me as fair uh google gives away android anybody
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.000]   can build an android phone that wants to look what app amazoned on they took
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.160]   as done they took the android source code
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:12.960]   you know customized it modified it put the uh amazon app store on it and
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.600]   shipped it out didn't cost them a penny uh and then if they wanted to make an
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:21.200]   android device that's google android which is what i think most users want
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.400]   for a phone anyway um you you conclude the google
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:27.440]   i don't want to buy a phone that doesn't have google apps
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.720]   the google app store or google search or google maps when you don't you want
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.960]   that well yandex didn't want it yandex is a google search in russia well
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:38.480]   they're no google's competitor search competitor in russia
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:46.160]   and uh they uh went to court saying uh that for google to require
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.600]   phone manufacturers to put google apps in
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.640]   um is uh is monopolistic
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:59.280]   hmm so they the courts agree so they want they want the play store
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.600]   without any of the extra google apps is that the ruling here
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:08.960]   um because i mean you you could just not take the google apps like it's
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:10.880]   optional you don't have to take them at all right
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:15.040]   i think like kendall i don't like it just so the
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:19.520]   they they want they want manufacturers to be able to cherry pick
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.960]   so they want a manufacturer to make an android phone and say well we'll put
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.280]   maps in but not app store or i want app store but not maps
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:31.360]   and that's by the way that's what the court ruled
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.120]   well i mean i don't know i feel like google saw
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:39.680]   this microsoft thing happen and then they designed android specifically
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.640]   to kind of get around that kind of argument where here
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:46.000]   here's the source code you can take it and do whatever you want
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.760]   and and i don't know to have them still come back and
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:54.960]   and say that they want to cherry pick from the google apps is weird i mean
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.480]   they they work together half the time it's like you have to include google play
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:01.680]   services because well precisely it's not designed to be
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.160]   unbundled right so i don't know how that's going to work
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.160]   google's going to have to rewrite or something and of course the larger concern
[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:11.920]   is that the eu may follow suit and they've made some noises that they
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:16.720]   are considering that yeah they you they they have some serious like personal
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.600]   hatred of google over there i don't know what's going on with them
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:23.920]   like over there which is funny because
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.200]   google isn't even close to monopoly in the u.s i can't remember what the
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:30.320]   percentages is 70 percent 60 percent of all 60 years
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.920]   something low it's like 80 percent europe it's it's very high they're much
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:38.320]   more than the monopoly in europe um i don't know why that is i guess
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:41.760]   they don't like being in france either i don't know
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:47.760]   what is the other choice uh well yeah there's being there's yandex
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.640]   there's bydo says nom i understand in duk duk go
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:57.440]   i understand what if you're in china that uh you would prefer a chinese
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:05:01.280]   search engine or russia you would prefer a russian search engine
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:05.520]   i'm i have no doubt in my mind that they don't do as well as google does
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:07.920]   and that furthermore at least in those two countries they're probably
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:11.600]   heavily influenced by government interests
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:14.800]   did you see there was some article i don't know
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:20.080]   talking about uh the vokes wagon defeat device scandal and and sort of saying
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.120]   there there appeared to be a document leak
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:27.680]   that was that was sort of saying some members of that particular part of the
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:31.520]   european commission had met with somebody who was on the lobbying side
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.960]   or boy and it was kind of like it it
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.680]   the article that i read made it and maybe it's a
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:42.000]   rag you know blog that you can't trust but sort of made it sound like
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.800]   the the companies were able to discover how much exactly they needed to give
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:52.720]   on their exhaust emissions you know stuff um you can justify that
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:58.240]   well we want to negotiate we need to uh how how far do we have to go we'll do
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.840]   this we'll talk behind doors a little bit
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:08.000]   mmm google is adding support for microsoft office
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.240]   facebook at work slack uh to the single sign on
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:19.120]   uh i don't understand that is it google that has to do that or those guys that
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.280]   have to do that yeah i thought it was the other way around
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.600]   yeah
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:28.160]   this is uh oh i guess this is two google apps
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.520]   ah uh so you can use
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:35.040]   lapse oh okay yeah so if you're using google apps for work you can use
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:38.720]   google as identity provider
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.960]   i don't know i don't understand life it's all beyond me
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:47.520]   i don't know it's too simple yeah no google apps for is it is it called apps
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:52.160]   for work now whatever the apps for work yeah is its own it's kind of its own
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:55.520]   little box with like this crazy extra dashboard that i've tried to
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:07:00.320]   figure out a couple times to make stuff like like android for work
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:05.600]   function and it's in the same way that exchange is like hard to to manage
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:10.400]   this is like its own crazy life form that you kind of have to
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.560]   deal with i don't know google apps is is hard a lot
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.680]   if you're the admin if you're not the admin then life is good
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:21.920]   well no if you're not the admin then you go i don't understand why i have to use
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.800]   my g why i can't use my gmail account with the
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:29.920]   i don't it's confusing no it's i think it's great as long as you're not the
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:33.360]   admin as long as you have some dude who's your full-time admin that's great
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:36.320]   but that's why we have rustle rustle does that
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.840]   and rustle rustle rustle rustle has flipped the switch so for instance i can use
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.360]   inbox with my apps account as opposed to nice
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:48.880]   yeah okay it's still not i understand why google hasn't fixed this it's still
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.800]   well and jeff's always complaining about as you know matt about
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.040]   about about the you know the the the separation between his private personal
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:08:01.280]   google account and his apps email and how come he can't use his apps email for a
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.120]   lot of the things he uses personal email for blah blah blah
[01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:08.400]   and i guess it must be a hard computer science problem
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.000]   well it's a fair criticism and i i truthfully don't know what the inside story
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.480]   on that is but it makes me feel like there must be some extra work to
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:20.080]   integrate with the google apps for work and then individual products are like
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:24.400]   oh we'll get to that later whereas it feels like somewhere years and years
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:27.040]   ago someone should have done the engineering so that
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:31.360]   that worked by default for all accounts including apps accounts and
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:34.240]   and now maybe the genie is out of the bottle and it's too hard to get back in
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.120]   or something i don't know exactly what the reason although
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:41.600]   okay if you're the administrator and you're not a tech savvy person or a startup
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.440]   then you do sometimes want to control how quickly you get updates and win
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:49.440]   right it's functionality update happens and maybe you're in a regulated industry
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.160]   and so there are some arguments for things moving
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:56.160]   slower and not you know surprising you with you know web downloads
[01:08:56.160 --> 01:09:00.000]   and here's this new feature it just turned on but uh i think
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.520]   more of the complaints i hear are of jeff's variety where they wish
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.840]   apps accounts would work better i hear that from me
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:10.160]   and end users the google apps end users always seem to hate that like the i i
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.600]   totally get this slower oh it needs to be slower and more stable and
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:18.800]   you're your your admin guy has to you know control all of this but
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.640]   the users always seem to be really mad about it why can i do this new thing
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:27.840]   with my google app's account latest yeah well you can for instance they just
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.000]   added like a switch that the admin can throw that lets you use
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.080]   inbox with your google apps email but but your administrator has to give
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.600]   permission you know um that but that was huge i was really
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:43.360]   glad when that happened and i think and how long ago did inbox come out that was
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:46.320]   like i don't know it's been a couple years i think
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:50.880]   we actually go ahead oh i was just going to say apparently now you can use
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:56.080]   the web replies the email replies on the web version of inbox oh
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.560]   i use those all the time yeah people people don't understand they said leo
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:04.880]   you're so terse these days but this they're always
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.760]   it's actually there's an example of artificial intelligence being really
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.880]   cool and it's probably very stupid artificial intelligence but
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.480]   it's really nice because what it does is looks at the email and then offers
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.680]   three choices of what your likely response would be yeah
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.360]   right on let's do it or and it's often very colloquial
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:24.880]   uh no way i don't want to do that and then you pick that and your your mail
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:29.440]   and email is answered i love it you know it's it's legit it's like legit
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:32.960]   artificial intelligence there was like a google research paper about it
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:37.120]   uh and everything my my favorite story is they they did the inbox
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.680]   uh smart reply and it would want to reply i love you to every single message
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:45.280]   uh which is which is kind of nice like it's search some kind of database of
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:49.360]   of people talking and determine that that was a good response
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:52.480]   that's what people say to each other the most is i love you
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:58.160]   that's a but not to your boss you know i say i love you
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:01.200]   so now you know now you know why my emails to you
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.440]   adjacent clanthes are always so quick and snap it i wish facebook messenger
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.320]   would add this feature
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.760]   or hang it do you do you tell Jason that you love him often all the time
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:17.920]   all the time all the time that in cat pictures cat pictures
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.640]   automated cat pictures the best thing to ever happen
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:27.120]   to article actually speaking of uh inbox we talked to uh on one day we had a
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.360]   triangulation uh i don't know if you know jeffrey nap he was uh one of the
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.360]   guys behind um priority inbox he also did the
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:39.600]   hangouts and he's now at google ventures and he wrote a book called sprint
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.560]   talking about i don't have you ever done a sprint the google venture sprint
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:48.160]   it's a five-day process um where they set up set a goal and they won and they
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:53.920]   was a team of seven people and and it's a really cool process where they get to a
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:59.360]   prototype and testing by day five do you familiar with it
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:03.200]   yeah i've gotten to do an early version of the sprint there's two authors on that
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:07.760]   book john and jake and i forget i've rated it with jake and braid and uh
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:12.240]   yeah oh yes sorry yes three and uh and it's pretty cool because in a course of
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:15.360]   five days they try to come up with uh you know
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.680]   interesting solutions and it's uh it's worth checking out the book just came
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:24.240]   out just really very impressed and it uh while i will never do it because
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:29.600]   i'm far too disorganized uh i thought but this seems like a good idea somebody
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:35.840]   ought to do this um but not us not me anyway um but it looks like fun too
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:38.320]   actually which is kind of cool so if you didn't see triangulation this week
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:43.120]   it's a it's a good one to uh to watch sprint with jake so you know jake i mean
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:47.040]   that jeffrey you know jake we we we were acquaintances i wouldn't say best
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.840]   friends but yeah we we've talked each other it's funny because they're both
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.320]   really tall and so you know if you if you if you're like oh yeah you're
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:59.040]   jake john on jake yeah jake jake jake jake jake jake jake jake nap
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:03.760]   johnsaraski and braid and co-whits were the three uh who worked on that sprint
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:07.520]   technology google's interesting that way because i have a feeling there's a lot
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:11.680]   of interesting processes that are used by various teams to
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:15.600]   uh you know get to these solutions in a timely efficient fashion
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:21.680]   engineers love process yes and in fact if you haven't seen a book by uh lazzlo
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:26.240]   bock uh it's called work rules uh lazzlo is the head of human
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:30.720]   resources at google and or people operations whatever you want to call it
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:36.080]   and i would say page for page pound for pound that book has more insights about
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.680]   i remember that yes yeah the experimentation that google's done on a
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:43.280]   lot of different y-teams work and you know how to how to make things work well
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:48.080]   and lazzlo is a fantastic guy in general so uh if you pick that up and just open
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:52.640]   it to any random page that that will probably be a pretty useful page
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.960]   for you or at least interesting about why they decided to do things that way
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:02.400]   it's uh it's a pretty good book remind me uh Jason to book him for
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:05.760]   triangulation that would be a good triangulation guest we'll do see if we
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:10.160]   get lazzlo on the show yeah people operations he's head of
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:13.680]   people operations yes
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.080]   oh i love it are you excited about silicon valley coming back
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.040]   you can find out what's really going on at google
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:24.960]   that should be so fun we had so on sunday i don't know if you saw
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:31.840]   but david pog was on a twit and uh david of course is at yahoo for as long as
[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:37.280]   there is a yahoo running their tech vertical tech.yahoo.com
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:40.240]   but he came to us he was at austin in south by south west and he came to us
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.880]   from the roof of the w except the way he was seated
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:46.080]   it looked like he was in prison but so then he panted around and it was clear
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:49.600]   he was on a roof with a pool and and i said you look like you're in hooley
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:53.120]   in that in the in the rooftop offices of hooley where they put people
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:57.520]   who they don't want to fire but they don't want to they don't have anything
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:00.640]   for them to do so they just sit there up on there in the roof and then
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:04.480]   after a couple hours ago maybe let's go have lunch
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:08.400]   the resting investing david's laughter was uh
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.800]   pained
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:14.160]   slightly pained
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:19.360]   what is uh what is this project googles up to uh in uh in mountain view
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:23.360]   google's project it's the new campus the new campus
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:26.560]   the new campus okay yeah i thought they got turned down on this yeah they
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.680]   read they read they're real thing that like exists
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:32.880]   yeah they had to change the design the campus with the tent
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:36.000]   yeah yeah they they were trying to get if i remember
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.640]   right they were trying to get enough space approved
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.280]   right by the this city and some of it went to lincoln
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:48.480]   uh so google ended up not being able to build the crazy spider web
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:53.280]   city that they had envisioned originally um so so now there's
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:57.520]   but there's a little ear one yeah it doesn't look quite a spider webby
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:01.440]   either but and by the way not a tent it's a photovoltaic integrated canopy
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:06.240]   skin pardon me yeah get out come on you want to work there matt you know
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:10.000]   you do that looks the slideshow is pretty fun
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.760]   you know it is groups like me it is what's uh so this is the this is the
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:20.560]   revised uh campus yeah that'd be cool but this is just one building instead of
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:23.520]   like a whole mess yeah there were there were gonna be
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:27.440]   three buildings before
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.760]   right yeah does this so does this does this keep all of the things that they
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:34.560]   were originally talking about where like it's a modular design and they're
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.440]   gonna have some kind of robot that's gonna move
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:41.440]   walls around and you know reshift areas to match
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:48.000]   whatever a given team needs this was the original one as you say it had
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:54.640]   uh had three buildings under it um right it really looks like a uh
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:17:01.520]   scene from under the dome actually so they had they had to the new plans now
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.400]   are uh as you said more traditional uh flat glass walls but they still have
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:12.880]   the tent on the uh i'm sorry what am i saying the photovoltaic canopy
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.160]   they need to come up with an acronym so it's spelled tent but still has
[01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:22.320]   right i'm sorry it's the p_i_c_s the photovoltaic integrated canopy skin
[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:25.440]   the thermal enclosure northern something yeah
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:30.720]   thermal enclosure um we can do neutral neutral
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.840]   is it's like is it still see through it just looks like a
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:38.160]   funny shaped roof now in yeah it doesn't look quite as cool
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:43.040]   oh yeah but it must be see through because they have trees inside they have
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:46.480]   here's the roller dome i don't know what that is
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:51.520]   no see they have greenery and some kind of vegetable stand
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:56.960]   what's this is that is that do you have that google yet the the push cart with
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.600]   vegetables
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:03.600]   they try a lot of the cool experiments at google i'm not seeing you would we
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:07.840]   i'd have a cow carts here anybody want a kale who wants to
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:11.040]   mapitize your kale that's a kale the carts here
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.800]   kale shops well in in the old renders they had people
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:18.720]   farming outside of the building oh my god this is what you do though when you
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:22.880]   get to be like oh see in the distance there's two more
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:26.240]   bio domes so uh you're right it was three different
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.680]   structures see these two in the background this is the old plan
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:34.080]   oh man gosh darn linked in you ruined our
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:39.840]   whole thing charleston east this will be uh this will be called
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.520]   that's the old campus on the left if we could agree on some building
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:46.000]   standards where you could dock the buildings together
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.840]   or the building could join our professional network at google
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.360]   they have those they have that in or had that in japan
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:57.360]   that um the hotel that would uh you could
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.680]   press a button in a robot arm would come and move your room to another part of
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:06.800]   the hotel do you know about that no that's awesome
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.320]   i think it was like a thing in the sixties
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:18.000]   uh or seventies um but i don't but i it was like some sort of
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.520]   modular hotel but it was like normal sized rooms
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:24.880]   yeah there it is here it is the capsule hotel
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:30.480]   um no that's not it let's see uh it was a japan
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:36.400]   my um i can't find it i read a wonderful medium piece of
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:42.720]   photographer who uh who stayed there and he scared his girlfriend because he
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:46.080]   it's he found out that you could press a button requesting a move which cost
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:51.280]   money uh and then cancel it but the arm will come
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:57.440]   and your room will start shaking and it won't cost you anything
[01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:02.960]   so by the way the chat room is listing out possible acronyms like thermal
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:07.680]   entropy networked tent perfect closure not tent so i like it recursive where it
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:13.040]   has a tent in the word tent right yeah
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:18.400]   so it looks like these plans are actually for a different location not the original
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:22.320]   the original thing was going to be in north bay sure i don't know if they're
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:26.560]   still they're not actually doing any of this yet this is like just some guy
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.040]   drawing you gotta get mad and view to agree
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:33.520]   yeah right yeah and it met the the plans have gone in
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:38.080]   so uh yeah there you go this is their whole landscape plan
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:43.440]   layout the buildings the everything they submitted the entire plan you kind of
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:46.240]   do this if apple's going to have the spaceship
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:50.160]   and facebook has the whatever that is unfinished the spaceship is under
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:53.360]   construction like they're gonna oh they're close to done they'll be done next
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.400]   year it's like we're we're thinking that um you know they just put the the roof
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.600]   on the theater that they're going to have events in we're thinking that apple
[01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:06.560]   start having events there maybe in for the iPhone 8 the fall of next year
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:11.040]   well yeah well we're only effective negative taxonomy
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:15.760]   i believe we call that um google actually this is i'm sure
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:19.280]   one that you're up on mat we'll start ranking mobile friendly sites
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:26.160]   even higher come this may what does that mean well uh there's a link in the
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:30.800]   rundown towards the bottom where you can click to the uh the mobile test
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:34.720]   but basically it's it's you know things that you would think would be kind of
[01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:38.720]   uh common sense you know you know you're not using images that are too big
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:42.400]   you're you know it's got a whole checklist and so you can type in
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:46.640]   any URL and it will tell you whether your website is mobile friendly or not so
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:51.040]   you can type in google.com and in fact i think they had just uh just
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.840]   don't fix your work fix it we're mobile friendly
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:56.880]   does that mean mobile responsive what does that mean
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:01.680]   uh it that helps a lot you know it's like a bunch of different things down
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:05.200]   at checklist that it looks for and in fact there's documentation
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.560]   on the mobile uh friendly test page where it sort of talks about mobile
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:11.280]   SEO and those kinds of things so you can sort of say
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:14.960]   you know uh responsive web design hey i win
[01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:20.240]   our our page is mobile friendly in fact here's how it looks on a mobile
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:24.240]   isn't that nice that's this is a nicely done i'm sorry this was going to be your
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:28.160]   thing i just i just realized this was going to be your thing
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:31.520]   it's totally fine i've actually got another one i was going to do anyway
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:36.960]   but uh what's nice about this is you know last year uh they started to
[01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:40.320]   they basically said this is a little another gentle nudge to
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.120]   point people towards being mobile friendly and it should be completely
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:46.400]   logical at this point that mobile is is huge at this point
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:50.480]   so just like with site speed or ssl now we're going to give a little bit
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:54.160]   we had been giving a boost it'll probably be just a little bit more of a boost
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:57.200]   for sites that are mobile friendly so if you've been thinking about it and
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:00.320]   wondering are these phones really going to take off
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:04.160]   you know maybe maybe it's time to some other things are fed
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:08.400]   yeah we're going to go straight to VR you know but
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:12.720]   maybe take a little while and optimize for mobile before you go for VR
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:18.560]   yeah um good well i'm thrilled to see that we're mobile friendly
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:21.840]   yeah yeah i i tried arse technical and we passed
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.160]   too i i've no one to yell at so that's good
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:28.880]   three for three we're good well it should be it should
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:32.160]   i mean yeah three for three you're including google.com
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:35.120]   that's all the internet need
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:39.520]   google arse technical and leo's site i mean that's that base shape it's
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:43.520]   everything you mean so that's all all you ever need
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:48.240]   very nice very nice uh let's see what else go ahead
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.840]   i don't know if you saw this thing on the youtube creator blog about blurring
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:57.120]   objects in your videos i just you know growing up in kentucky i of course
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:01.680]   love the television show cops and so oh yeah the the perps always had blurred
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:06.000]   faces right yeah or or you know uh or the people behind the perp background
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.680]   they'd have their brand you know blurred out so now that functionality is
[01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:15.520]   available to you as you can create yeah you could do that in the web browsing
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:20.320]   i believe so yeah yeah yeah it's it's not just like a you draw
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:23.840]   the square and that square stays permanently blocked like it's object
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:27.600]   tracking wow that's pretty sophisticated wow
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.360]   yeah that's awesome this is another thing that's got to be like a i powered behind
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:36.800]   seat somewhere yeah that's showing up everywhere that's really neat
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:40.640]   although i hate videos where there's things blurred out in the background
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:43.600]   yeah but you know if you're a youtube creator you don't want to have a
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:46.080]   brand in the background that didn't give permission
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.360]   you know yeah if you fail to get permission now
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.640]   instead of having to spend an hour doing something you do like three seconds
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:57.280]   and suddenly you're in much better shape which i i think it'd be fun to just
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:00.080]   play with that a little bit start blurring random things on the video
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:04.160]   and see if people notice you know see if you can do some hijinks i was kind of
[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:07.360]   stunned uh it's uh steve chanzer marks uh he was
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:11.760]   the creator of youtube at south by south west he revealed and i never knew this
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:15.280]   and i talked to steve i remember telling steve before he sold the google
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.600]   in the very earliest days of youtube he never revealed
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:22.160]   that when he first started youtube it was supposed to be a place singles
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:27.040]   could upload videos talking about what they were it was a dating app
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.120]   what they were looking for in a partner and what a perfect name though youtube
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:34.800]   almost like if you're dating it's like this is me this is you this is me this is
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:39.840]   me and you together what explains the name yeah
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:43.360]   glad to see that steve's hair is no less unruly
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:47.680]   that's why it's before he was a billionaire uh steve and chat that's so cool they have
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:52.880]   a new uh site um actually it's a steve site uh called
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:26:01.920]   nom nom or nom just nom um and uh it uh wants to harness the hive
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:07.120]   mind for better cooking oh that makes sense okay
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:10.400]   looks like pinterest i don't know what it is
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:14.240]   um i like that it's all videos about food
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:18.960]   food videos it's he steve's like me one good idea
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:23.040]   and we're just looking at different ways to slice it
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:26.000]   how many different round table shows can i do
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.760]   uh this actually looks pretty good so it is so it's kind of youtube for food
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:36.880]   and recipes huh yeah actually i'm just food
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.920]   yeah there's a lot of geeks who need help with cooking
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.360]   and there's a lot of people out there who enjoy you know top chef and all those
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:46.400]   kinds of things so why not why not that sounds kind of neat
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.560]   food network is uh absolutely addictive
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:53.840]   um well that's a perfect segue to the next story down the row
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:27:00.240]   uh a little bit is uh twitch is now giving julia child weird julia child channel on
[01:27:00.240 --> 01:27:05.120]   twitch okay does how we take a chicken and cut it into the
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:09.840]   quarters right yeah this is definitely before my
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:12.240]   time like the the thing they did before this was
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:15.600]   bob ross and that was pretty cool because like he's a chill guy in pain and
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:19.760]   it's interesting that was really yeah it's just cool to see him paint but
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.400]   this like i don't know you don't get to eat the food afterwards so
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:27.200]   uh i grew up watching this show the french chef it's a it was uh
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:32.160]   it was really the first cooking show on pbs and she was
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.120]   a very unlikely superstar i met her she's very tall
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:40.960]   was very tall um and every bit is great kind of cookie is
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.960]   she kind of came across this is awesome what's great is it's very very live
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.840]   there's no oh yeah i mean things happen oh yeah
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:51.840]   she stuck a mixer i mean she stuck a spoon in a mixer last night yeah
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.640]   anyone flying across the set you've been watching it all day
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:58.320]   i was watching the last night yeah she was making some sort of orange
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:02.320]   butter no it's totally not a because nobody knew about cooking shows she
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:05.360]   invented it i'm purposely hiding the comment section because there's a lot of
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.840]   stuff coming up that's weird but it's interesting to watch
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:10.720]   a lot of the a lot of the younger audience are like
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:18.320]   whoa this is so cool what is that uh why is the video black and white
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:21.360]   this with twitch chat has got to be like the best thing ever come on yeah i'm
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:26.320]   not showing it we don't really know uh what kind of a filter is that
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:31.440]   wow and the the thing everybody uses now on twitch is
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:35.520]   these avatars that are people's heads like there's a bob Ross head
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:38.880]   and i imagine there'll be a julian child head eventually
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.800]   uh i don't get that so do you see all the heads going by
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:46.160]   do you um do you understand that uh they're
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.160]   Jason uh you're a young person not a
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:53.680]   uh young person on set would be this person right here actually you know it
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:57.680]   is it's called it's a culture it's a subculture that's it is and this is the
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:01.680]   thing like they announced they announced youtube gaming and
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:05.760]   i'm like twitch has twitch has all of this culture stuff that like youtube
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:09.600]   gaming is is not gonna have like that's where that's where the community is
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:14.000]   but but yeah all of those emotes they're emotes and they mean they mean
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.440]   something yeah right they mean they all they all mean some kind of emotion you
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:22.400]   know the the one everybody does is kappa which is uh which is some guys head
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:26.000]   he's like a twitch developer and he's making kind of a sarcastic face so
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.880]   that's for sarcasm and uh there's a million other ones yeah if you i think
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:34.320]   if if you like really want to get into it you can mouse over it probably and
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:38.880]   you'll get um all right you should get maybe a tool tip or what it is that's
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:42.080]   the what face you can look it up and then there's
[01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:46.320]   there's baby rage but that one's the what face uh it's just its own set of
[01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:49.920]   the Kramer the Kramer one they call that the
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:56.320]   pog champ right i know what pogs are pog champ is
[01:29:56.320 --> 01:29:59.600]   it's it's a guy and there's a video somewhere there was like a youtube
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:04.000]   video of a guy making that expression and twitch staff thought it was funny so
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.600]   they just cut his head out and stuck it in there and i feel so old but yeah you
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:11.440]   can well you can know your meme go go look it up yeah but it's what happened
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:14.560]   it's what happened in the Appalachia's when you cut people off
[01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:20.560]   from the rest of the world for a hundred years they develop their own language
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:23.680]   and that's what's happened on twitch these are people who never get outside
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:26.560]   anymore i don't know what what you mean how about that but
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:29.840]   day day day day go ba ba ba da that's so wrong
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:35.360]   that's so wrong but the Appalachia of the internet is what it is
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:40.480]   what what it means um i'll watch
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:47.600]   i have lost met that man oh i will watch Hearthstone streams a lot and um
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:50.800]   they have their own pro they're right there's this one there's this one girl
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:54.240]   it's a eloise so she's chinese and has ended up
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:58.640]   learning most of her english through twitch chat oh wow
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:02.800]   so she she has kind of been been raised and and brought up into the english
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.520]   language through the internet's like force possible
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:10.720]   so true of english and pretty awesome that is well though
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:15.520]   frankly if uh if you are on imager every day and then you go away for like
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:18.880]   three days you come back and there's like four new things you've completely
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:21.680]   missed out on and memes they move too fast yeah
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:25.920]   the good news is they don't stand on the shoulders of each other they're all
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:29.120]   kind of this separate thing and it goes away in a few days or months or
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:32.000]   whatever i mean you could still to this day say what
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:35.200]   color is the dress and people will know what you're talking about but that's
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:39.120]   rare most of these just kind of you're not in
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:42.160]   in other words you can join at any time that's kind of yeah
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:46.320]   that's like twitter you're like what is batman doing at 2 30 in the morning on
[01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.960]   a third two-star you can look it up on know your meme and you don't want to
[01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:56.240]   call you there yep so um have you tried yet the uh the pay by voice google thing
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:32:02.160]   that you guys are doing in the silicon valley only in effect only at mcdonald's
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:06.960]   and uh it's pizza place uh i think it's more than just
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:10.400]   mcdonald's now so yeah i had been helping with the testing of that
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:15.120]   and it was pretty awesome okay so okay so we don't understand it so here
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:18.800]   so this is what we've i've read is you go up and you're at mcdonald's you got
[01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.440]   your order fries and your big mac and shake and you go
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:29.280]   i'll pay with google and then what does the clerk say
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:32.800]   what's their pay your initials or what rather yes initial what are you and you
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:35.760]   say mc or what's your name and you say what your name is i don't know what the
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:38.960]   latest incarnation is that's been public and that's all there's
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:42.080]   yeah or your picture or something like that so they can look and they can see
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.480]   your picture and then maybe they disambiguate with your name or your
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:48.880]   initials um and uh so the what is the what is the
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:54.240]   clerk seeing a picture of you yes so the clerk is doing the validation
[01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:58.400]   the clerk seeing your picture and then no your phone your phone is validation
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:01.600]   too right they have a bluetooth sensor or something
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:04.720]   yeah yeah yeah oh actually a lot of wizardry that happens by
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:08.080]   so it's more than just a picture of you and i know my name
[01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:12.640]   oh a lot more yeah yeah no um the nice thing is that uses the proximity
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:16.560]   apis that are sort of underneath the hood so your phone knows that you're at
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:19.120]   this location so it's kind of like pay by square
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:24.640]   used to be yeah a little bit um if you uh
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:29.600]   so if i had paid by square my phone uh and i would open it and then i would
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:32.480]   walk into the coffee shop we had one down the street
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:36.640]   by proxy by geofencing it would know that i was in the coffee shop mice
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:40.720]   picture which pop up on the ipad that the clerk was using
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:45.200]   and i and that would be it uh you're leo right
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:48.480]   right and i think the technology is is maybe slightly different and
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:51.760]   slightly more accurate under the hood well that was the problem the geofencing
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:54.720]   was two stores next to each other couldn't use
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:58.400]   pay by square you had you had to separate them enough so that you
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:01.200]   would but this is better than geofencing
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:04.640]   yeah yeah stuff like uh you know there's a lot of ways that you can actually
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:07.840]   know that two devices are near each other and some of that stuff i think has
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:11.760]   become public is it bluches early or is it beakening or
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:14.960]   uh i don't know how much it's sisrin don't say
[01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:19.200]   okay so so your options your options i could i can give you options yeah it's
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.840]   gonna be uh either the bluetooth beacon stuff or like
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:25.520]   ultrasonic pulses oh it could be that it's
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:28.640]   picked up by microphone we've seen we've seen people use that right
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:32.880]   yeah right that's a nearby for the chromecast
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:40.080]   that's that's about it yeah what is it one of those i don't know uh
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:43.520]   it's safe to assume you could do technology like that yeah
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:47.280]   so tonight okay so the latest penny arcade
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:51.200]   i love everything that i love it yeah love penny arcade love it
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:54.640]   it's funny because they actually have they talk about something like this in
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:58.880]   the latest comic strip they basically say uh when you try to pay with your phone
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:02.160]   and it works you know and they've got one panel that's like the guy is like
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:06.000]   super sexy with a leather jacket and glasses and then they go
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.760]   when it doesn't work so good and then you know everything's going wrong so i
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:13.360]   don't know if you can find that penny arcade comic but it's the most recent
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:17.120]   one uh and when it works with just pain with your phone you know at the
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:20.400]   wall green she's like ah this is fantastic and when you pay with your
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.400]   voice you're just like it feels so cool and then if you pay with
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:28.240]   samsung pay people go wait a minute come back here and give me money
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:32.960]   yeah how did that happen that happened so like that here's the here's the
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:36.800]   yeah what weirds me out what weirds me out about this this google thing is it
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:44.240]   like it requires that you train the the the register the cashier on how to do
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.400]   this and it's like i don't know you want to train all the cashiers in the world i
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:53.520]   guess on this new payment thing when that sounds really hard to me like what
[01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:57.120]   was it the one samsung pay guy got uh got the cops called on him
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:59.120]   yeah because i thought he was hacking the term yeah
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:05.920]   yeah nobody so samsung pay uh will do a tap to pay but they also have uh
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.560]   they'll screen a magnetic field that takes the worst of the swipe card reader
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:14.160]   and and looks as if you've swiped a card but you haven't so
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:17.680]   imagine the clerks reaction because this would work anywhere you don't have to
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:20.720]   be trained it would work anywhere that they have a card reader
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:24.720]   when you go like this and say i've paid yeah
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:30.720]   pay no attention i've paid here's a guy gonna use it this is how it's supposed
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:35.040]   to work according to samsung no like samsung pay kind of works
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:38.240]   everywhere even on his janky i don't want some pay winners but you want to
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.560]   handle i'm gonna pay all my phone don't look at the cameras
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:44.400]   Mike you ready it doesn't work watch me
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:52.320]   boom boom that's how samsung says it's supposed to work
[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:57.120]   they don't show i'm getting arrested and dranked up to prison
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:37:00.560]   uh but okay so do you think this google thing will become
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:03.840]   pay with what's it called pay with google pay was
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:08.160]   uh pay with magic well they they sort of been calling it pay with
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:11.920]   google but so in the blog post they do say they use bluetooth low energy wi-fi
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:15.440]   and location services on your phone so that that much that's perfectly that's
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:18.160]   perfect um yeah and i have to admit so i've used it at
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:23.120]   mcdonald's and not admit i have to say um you would think you know some random
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:26.080]   guy at mcdonald's would not be that interested in learning you know how to
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:30.400]   take a new form of payment but it worked faultlessly well he has the software on
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:32.800]   his screen i mean that's one of the reasons right that works
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:35.920]   compared to samsung pay where you don't have to know anything about it for it to
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:39.520]   work he has right it's on his terminal and it pops up
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:43.040]   uh it the the app is called google hands-free and i did install it until i
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:46.320]   realized that i'll never be going to mcdonald's the silicon valley so
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:50.320]   right it's only in one city so don't go to your local mcdonald's and try to
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:53.280]   make this work because it's not gonna yeah and pop a john but
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.040]   pop a john but if you're in the if you're in the south bahay there is this also
[01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:02.080]   ice cream shop called tin pot creamery and i think hands-free gets you like five
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:06.800]   or ten bucks free there like use that and it is
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:11.040]   really good ice cream so amazon is patented and i don't know if this
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:16.080]   will go anywhere but has patented pay by selfie
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:22.320]   um so and the and what happens there is
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:27.600]   uh you actually have a gesture that take your pick
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.840]   that is your your motion or gesture that proves it's you
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:36.480]   so that's like your new pin code is or you know
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:41.440]   and that's better than a fingerprint you know what it probably is i hate to
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:45.360]   tell you who knows how good those fingerprints actually are and i can
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:49.600]   tell you it's a lot better than the sign with its stylus
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:55.280]   which nobody even checks i want to hear i want to hear google's plan for like
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:59.200]   adoption on this this pay with google thing though because it sounds like
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:04.240]   you need special software and some kind of
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:08.480]   beacon thing that fires the signal out it's probably similar to the
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:12.720]   square pay with square thing right and they did very well i mean i thought
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.960]   they got it we've seen such i feel like we've seen such
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:19.520]   hard adoption problems with nfc already when that's when that's just a
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:22.640]   terminal box that you buy and plug in and we'll work with
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:26.000]   pretty much every register to go and say you need to run the software on your
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.800]   register system so that the picture pops up or whatever
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:33.120]   sounds really hard to to kind of get out to everyone
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:38.240]   that's what's great about samsung pay right yeah true and to be fair
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.800]   to google they say it's an experiment so they're not
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:44.240]   rolling it out worldwide or testing it to see how it works all i know is i get
[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:47.440]   five dollars off when i buy 10 crock and buy creamery and i'm like
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.560]   that's not yeah i'm a fan of that pay with this now that i now that you explain
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:53.680]   how it works it's not as puzzling as it was to us last week where we thought
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:56.480]   well the only authentication is i say my initials
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:59.840]   but i understand now it's sensing the phone it's actually sounds like it's
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:04.240]   probably fully secure if you can come up with a better experience
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:07.520]   then maybe you'll be able to get the adoption but ron i completely agree
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:11.040]   there's a lot of you know friction there that would have to be overcome the nice
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:14.880]   thing is with apple pay uh you know there's a lot more people
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.480]   thinking about possibilities of how to do payment and maybe even some of the
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:24.800]   places that that weren't as intrigued before are now like oh okay
[01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:27.520]   people are you know people are actually paying at their wall greens with their
[01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:30.240]   phone we need to start paying attention to this and figure out what a what a
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:34.000]   good purchase experience looks like yeah it doesn't look like that penny arcade
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.280]   wizard that was really i like that thank you for
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:40.880]   pointing my way to that comic that was pretty i feel like that wizard most of the
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:45.840]   time when i uh did we we showed it didn't we let me let me pull it back up again
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.480]   just real yeah i showed up at ron was talking something else when you try to
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:52.080]   pay with your phone and it works that's a very attractive thing you just did
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:56.960]   yes i know it's very powerful technology and i am at the helm
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:02.160]   when it will not work so good it would appear my magical one does
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:05.760]   failish me let me have the mystic weave is thin in your
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:11.120]   strange realm they tell how many paper faces do you require
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:15.520]   and obviously the woman is not so stressed good i'm that guy
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:18.480]   see i've been using Samsung pay as much as i can do you use it with the
[01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:20.720]   swipe machines yeah i use it all over town and what do
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:24.400]   people say a lot of people look to me like we don't take apple pay i'm like
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.840]   it's not okay it's not an apple for so apple doesn't make a curved phone
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:31.760]   um and then i'm like just it's cool and i pulled it up in front of it
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:34.560]   it's going to work and it works they don't think you're hacking them
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:37.360]   no and then i'll show them on screen like it shows my credit card it shows the
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:40.720]   last four so they can like target always ask for this
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:44.960]   last four please and the great thing is on the the Samsung phones you know it
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:48.800]   once you activate it yeah it lives as a little tab on the bottom of your window
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.880]   i'd show it but i don't have a camera point that way
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:54.880]   okay but you just swipe up from your thumb from your home button
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:58.080]   you just swipe up while your screen's locked and it says do you want to pay
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:01.600]   with Samsung right and you enter your thumb or your pin to activate it
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:05.120]   and then it starts pulsing to let you know it's sending the signal
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:08.480]   hold it there and then it'll vibrate to let you know it's done so they give me
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:13.840]   three choices on this oops oh crap now i'm getting an ad
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.040]   to make payments of Samsung pay select Samsung pays your default mobile
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:21.920]   payment so you can't use Android pay and Samsung pay simultaneously
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:25.680]   but you could say Samsung pay wants to take over the NFC chip too i think
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:29.280]   yeah okay so you have to choose one or the other
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:34.560]   all right and then you could say if your app supports tap and pay
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:38.880]   use the app that's open so i could have Android pay open
[01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:43.760]   and use Android pay with tap to pay or i should just use Samsung pay
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:47.520]   right why not i think you could also use google wallet if you have the google
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:50.560]   wallet credit card and you entered as a google wallet card never happened to
[01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:54.080]   google wallet yeah well all right i'm gonna since
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.760]   you're you're leading the way Jason i'm gonna try this from now on yeah
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.240]   i mean like i said i think it's great and it works great and
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:08.080]   um you know Jerry my partner is a die hard apple fan
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:12.560]   you know he says straight out that is so much better than apple pay
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:16.640]   hmm how about that folks because the times he's tried to use apple pay
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:19.760]   you know it's you know you go to luchase's deli they're like no we have an
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.800]   updated ours on machine i say i would update it their machine
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:26.160]   yes but they don't have to with with Samsung pay you you get
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:30.720]   you get to use new technology with their old technology and it works
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:35.200]   every time i have a new person i don't know where my wallet
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:38.880]   this thing that gets me this thing gets me about this little credit card
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.960]   machines is like now if you if you're bored in line google the model number
[01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:46.000]   on the front of the credit card machine and see how much it costs
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.880]   or is it best by the other day and the thing that they had was like
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:53.200]   fourteen hundred dollars for this stupid machine machine
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:56.960]   yeah yeah the little box that you but they have to do it because if they don't
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:01.840]   whoever is the least secure it pays for fraud yeah right so that's kind of a
[01:44:01.840 --> 01:44:07.120]   strong incentive to get it right there's no reason why those should
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:12.240]   have to cost that much either i mean yeah give me a next to seven i would
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:15.360]   come on don't most people just rent them i mean
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:18.640]   do people really buy them outright i'd be surprised if they did at that price i
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:21.680]   assume they probably just they pay monthly fee with their
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:26.000]   with their bank for the yeah they're already paying through the
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:32.080]   nose for the you know the credit card and square just came out with the new
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:36.960]   contactless um if you ever had a square i carry one on
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:40.080]   now it's time you mean like the thing that you swipe a little dongle yeah they now
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:45.360]   have an nfc contactless pay uh square you can buy you can get from them
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:50.080]   and people can use any of the you know apple pay Samsung pay android pay
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:54.800]   with square so if you use square to store or like i said i carry one of my
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:59.120]   in my pocket that i used to you know sell things i'd pull it out and be like
[01:44:59.120 --> 01:45:02.880]   here you go cool i can't find i gotta find a credit card that support
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:05.760]   Samsung pay that's the other problem is a lot of credit card companies are
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:07.680]   nervous about it yeah they were slow to roll out at
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:12.640]   first yeah i tried mine the first week it came out and it was
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:15.520]   nothing to happen in like bank of america doesn't work let me see if
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:18.560]   anybody else does here well when when i oh happens hopefully i'll get to
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:23.200]   try this this pay with google thing oh yeah they gotta use it at i oh right
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:25.360]   yeah since we'll all be in town i'm sure they'll
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:28.560]   they'll have some kind of demonstration or something mcdonald's or pop a john's
[01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:33.280]   brain set up a little booth yeah i'm so mad are you excited about i uh
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:36.240]   huh yeah i know tim pike i think it'll be really good
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:43.200]   yeah but um doing doing it at uh shoreline amphitheater will be different
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:46.720]   oh i know tell us how they're going to do that explain how they're going to do
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:50.000]   that because that's not a venue with seminar rooms
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.880]   like uh muscony is it's just an all either and and i am i this is purely
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:57.920]   personal speculation i have no idea whatsoever but muscony
[01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:01.680]   always got full and always sold out in like 20 minutes
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:04.880]   and shoreline you've got enough room where you can have the keynotes
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:07.520]   and then i have no idea whether they're actually going to do this but it would
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:11.760]   be neat if you'd let the developers peel off and break out and go
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:16.160]   visit various folks at google because that's where the google plex is is all
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:19.040]   around so you're going to theater and we kind of saw it really
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:22.960]   maybe they'd have uh autonomous vehicles come and ferry you
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:27.120]   to that part of the google plex that's what we're hoping yeah
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.800]   sure we have enough autonomous vehicles how far is it to shore so there's the
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:33.040]   shoreline amphitheater you see they have a big lawn
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:35.920]   but the lawn is sloping it's not like you'd set up tables on the lawn and then
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:39.520]   there's an auditorium so that's really going to be for the keynote only
[01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:44.880]   i would expect so but you can walk from shoreline to the google offices
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.400]   uh we've done that many times and in fact if yeah as you zoom out basically
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:51.760]   every building you see is a google office oh okay
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:55.120]   so they can just take over that's as far as the i can see
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:47:00.160]   google is north north of one-on-one which one has the uh semi-autonomous canopy
[01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:03.120]   tent environment
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:09.440]   thermal election just google yeah just google i cannot be contained by any
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:12.880]   buildings so they just did it outside in the amphitheater is that
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:16.000]   that's the plan i don't know what we're going to do with google io now since
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:19.040]   they announced android and where it's just going to be drinking and
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:22.560]   and well map might know is anything you want to talk about
[01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:27.680]   man i don't know what the topics are going to be
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.280]   but you know they're always looking for you know what are for example in
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:34.640]   search they're like maybe they'll talk about amp or take a drink or
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:37.120]   progressive web apps or something like that so
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:40.960]   and i'm i wonder if they'll be some pixel c uh information i'd love to i'd
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:46.160]   love to see you know more roba because i really love the pixel c and i just i
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:50.240]   think some more robust support it could be good it's may 18th to the 20th
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:54.480]   we have two invitations uh so two of our
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:58.000]   um intrepid reporters intrepid reporters thank you
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.400]   jason howl and uh player to be named later we'll be going i'm not sure but
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:04.640]   they're gonna i think we're gonna have a cage match to see you get seen
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:08.640]   yeah we've drawn straws for the cage match um
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:14.560]   and they're doing the lottery again uh this year so i don't let's see the lottery
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:18.160]   oh it ended you had till march 10th to get in the lottery yeah
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:20.240]   and then they're gonna announce they're
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:23.760]   announcing soon right people are sending yeah people have been getting results
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:27.360]   i've seen a few i've seen a few disappointed posts out there
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:30.480]   oh they claim it doesn't go by the order of
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:34.800]   which you know in your entry no right it's random right so you could have
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:37.920]   done it at exactly you know one minute after or you could do a 10 hours
[01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:42.080]   that's the only way to do it because you don't want to only allow people who
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:46.400]   have fast fingers to get no more or else you were motivated
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:50.480]   up early yeah and that's just not so leo uh i don't know if you've seen
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:53.920]   the breaking news but uh there's this competition called
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:58.960]   pwn to own yes where it so apparently it's going on right now yeah
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:03.520]   yeah it's going on right now and it it looks like safari has fallen
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:08.000]   twice maybe and then somebody used flash in a windows kernel bug
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:13.680]   so well safari down twice windows maybe down once it looks like so far
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:17.600]   chrome is alluding people and it looks like so far vm where workstation has
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:20.960]   not been hacked so interesting day is interesting
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:25.760]   actually google has upped the uh reward to a hundred thousand dollars for hacking
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:30.960]   and chrome book or chrome os because it's so robust and i i don't imagine
[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:35.040]   they're actually doing uh chrome os at pwnedown
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:39.680]   the rules are uh the rules at pwnedown are essentially
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:46.000]   uh you have to uh you're you're challenged to hack
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.440]   uh let me see if i can find the rules here i have them in front of me
[01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:53.040]   somewhere you're challenged to hack a computer with a standard install
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:55.840]   actually you're usually hacking the browser right so it'd be safari opera
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:01.760]   internet explorer chrome and you get to win the computer that it's on if you
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:04.560]   do it and i think they've added a cash prize now to it
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:07.840]   which i have mixed feelings about because it's so it's the
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:12.320]   you know now people are coming up with zero days and holding on to them
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:14.880]   so they can win pwnedown
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:19.280]   but you know the facebook is paying more for bug bounties google is paying a
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:22.400]   lot more for bug bounties and so you know i don't think there's that many
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:25.280]   people that are holding on the prizes that i'm seeing are 80,000
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:28.880]   60,000 40,000 have been won and those are large amounts of money but
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:32.320]   a lot of people can also make that money by just disclosing you know out of the
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.000]   normal cycle uh and and pain for those vulnerabilities i think
[01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:41.840]   makes everybody much more secure chrome's offering 65,000 microsoft 65,000
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:47.360]   flash and edge 60,000 uh apple's offering 40,000 for safari
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:50.800]   and you get more points i guess for the harder stuff 13 points for vmware
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:56.480]   workstation and you only get three points for target sandbox escape
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:02.080]   um so it's uh yeah this is interesting so the only one that's not fallen so far
[01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:07.440]   is chrome well i i saw somewhere a tweet like it's literally going on right now
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:10.160]   and i saw some tweet that somebody was saying that somebody's trying their
[01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:13.840]   fourth attempt on chrome i think the chrome team normally does
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:17.760]   their security updates right before pwnedown you know it closes all the
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:21.440]   known vulnerabilities yeah so it's you know it's a fun time it's like the
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:25.600]   super bowl of cracking you know so you don't think it it promotes somebody
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:29.360]   coming up with zero days and holding on to them
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:32.480]   they might hold on to them but it's at least promotes them coming
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:35.360]   forward with them and i think that's the most important thing i don't want them
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:39.600]   to be locked away in a in a government vault or some spy agency or something
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:42.320]   like that yeah i mean it's in everybody's interest that these
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:47.520]   flaws get exposed uh yeah and then fixed and then fixed yeah so cool
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:51.680]   it's a shame that there's no phones on here it seems to all be like desktop
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:57.120]   operating systems and stuff i wonder how easy it is to hack a phone these days
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:01.200]   uh it's fbi can't do it
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:10.160]   well i know google has uh there's there's android security bounty it's just like
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:13.520]   there are of course there should be a bunch of other operating systems so
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:17.760]   it exists quite just there's no there's no contest for it
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:21.360]   yeah well if you could hack an iphone i think you can
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:24.160]   make a lot more money than you can make it pwnedown you can sell that to
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:27.760]   governments or or you know let people install things on the app store and
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:30.800]   route their phone so i think the rules for this contest are you have to
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:34.960]   disclose the whole that you found right yeah absolutely should be that way
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:38.720]   they might know uh the score so far after round three
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:43.440]   from the zero-day initiative official pwnedown uh
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:47.600]   twitter twitter uh the vulcan team has already won
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:51.120]   13 points in eight thousand dollars jong hoon Lee who won last year i think
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:55.520]   a big prize sixty thousand dollars the ten cent security team
[01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:59.760]   forty thousand dollars no money for team sniper from ten cent that was team
[01:52:59.760 --> 01:53:03.680]   shield the one money or oh ten cent cent three teams
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:08.640]   or uh shuan wu no money there so there it is so far trend micro and helip
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:11.760]   hacker enterprise as sponsors of the zero-day initiative
[01:53:11.760 --> 01:53:17.520]   pwnedown at cansec west three rounds so far but the action continues
[01:53:17.520 --> 01:53:20.720]   if you're curious i mean how exciting can this be to watch
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:24.080]   hackers attempt to break into a system here's a
[01:53:24.080 --> 01:53:30.720]   a thrilling image from the real-time excitement that is
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:34.720]   pwnedown it's not as exciting as ghost
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:38.960]   you know i think it's fun more fun to watch it go
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:44.000]   anyway if you follow zero-day initiative uh at th e zd i
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.480]   at the zdi uh you can see what's going on that's fun that's cool
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:52.240]   that's from thank you matt for bringing that up i forgot that was today
[01:53:52.240 --> 01:53:55.440]   i think it continues again tomorrow two i think so for two days and this time
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:58.560]   it's at uh south by it's not in vancouver
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:02.320]   um it's because trend micro kind of took it over
[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:06.800]   yeah uh and uh and it's uh so it's at south by which actually makes it
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:09.680]   it makes it more fun
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:12.080]   pwnedown
[01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:15.840]   uh let's uh take a break come back with picks tips anything you want to share
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:19.760]   with us this is always fun to have matt cuts on and ronam audio i appreciate
[01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:22.160]   your guys taking some time with us this afternoon
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:25.920]   uh love sure love doing it with you uh our show today brought to you by
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:28.640]   something you'll probably both be familiar with at lassian
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:32.240]   everybody who writes software probably knows about it lassian
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:37.120]   their amazing jira is the way to assign track and manage
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:41.360]   tasks for any project no matter how complex we use
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:44.800]   jira designing the website guard web team in austin
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:48.400]   um would you know we would write user stories and
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:50.560]   get them up on the jira board and they would
[01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:54.000]   they would work on it in fact if you ever saw silicon valley they're using
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:59.040]   essentially a jira style workflow where you have a bit by bit you chisel away
[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:02.640]   at a problem um jira is really phenomenal for doing
[01:55:02.640 --> 01:55:05.600]   this and it's especially for distributed
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:12.000]   teams um because uh you know somebody's working on it in austin we got a
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:15.200]   review it in petaluma and jira makes it easy for
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:17.920]   everybody it's all web based our engineering team uses
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:22.080]   confluence that's what we use to document equipment and work processes
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:26.240]   um and jira can be used to to manage vendors that's how we kind of managed
[01:55:26.240 --> 01:55:30.080]   our web design um hip chat is what we use all the
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:34.160]   time we're all in a lassian here uh for
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:38.160]   everything from planning events to keeping track of engineering issues
[01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:42.800]   um we've tied in some of these great services like panoptica to our hip
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:46.640]   chat so when a site goes down or servers slow i know immediately
[01:55:46.640 --> 01:55:49.600]   russell knows immediately we could see it in the hip chat
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:52.560]   you get instant messaging you get video chatting
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.160]   uh and then of course test review and manage code in real time with bit bucket
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:01.520]   at lassian makes tools that help teams in every industry from startup to

[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:48.560]   here an android app you love a piece of gear i know you're the product reviewer
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:51.280]   do you did you like the s7 do you like it
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:57.280]   um it's fine it was a phone i don't i mean it's it's such a small it's such a
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:00.560]   it's like it's a spec bump it's it's pretty much
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:05.040]   yeah the same as the fixed all the things i had wrong with the s6 so the s6 didn't
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:08.720]   have enough ram and of horsepower it had we hesitated a lot
[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:12.800]   and this thing is the 820 you got to love the qua the qua calm snap dragon 820
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:19.040]   right yeah it is it is me so i'm doing one of these there's so many funds
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:24.240]   around here this this fund what's that um this is a
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:31.200]   this is a shell me me five right yeah we love the me four that was a very
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:33.920]   impressive this is this is another one um pretty much
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:38.320]   the same specs as the the uh s7 it's a snap dragon
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:44.800]   820 and i don't know like three gigs of ram um and it's it's just really close to
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:48.640]   what sam's saying is putting out except it's 305 bucks
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:53.840]   wow this is where we're an s7 7.0 bucks so expensive
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:59.440]   wow yeah there there's even can you get the show me in the us though i mean
[01:57:59.440 --> 01:58:04.720]   uh not yet um they do have a store here that sells like headphones
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:07.760]   and other little silly things but the thought is that maybe this will be the
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:12.880]   first one uh that they actually bring to the us i don't know it has um it has
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:16.720]   an international uh software build on it so it will
[01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:20.560]   actually show up in english and uh will kind of work
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:24.080]   here and it has i think it has a decent set of
[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:29.280]   uh lte bands that should kind of work here maybe i'm still kind of looking at
[01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:31.840]   that um you know one place that other companies are
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:36.160]   at this advantage even apple is that sam's song makes those old led screens
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:39.680]   and and i think kind of keeps them themselves that is it is it screen
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:43.360]   anywhere near as good as the s7 because that is an amazing screen
[01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:48.800]   uh no it's it's 1080p where the samsung is 1440p
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:52.800]   and and like yeah and the weird curved oled thing that sam's on has going on
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:55.360]   the thing is i don't really know if you'll miss it
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:59.280]   like the samsung thing is but even the colors i just love
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:03.120]   sa they super amoled i just yeah amoled is like super
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:08.480]   sacherous yeah yeah so beautiful i don't know what i what i would like to see
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:14.640]   samsung do is is be more of like uh integrate their various component
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:19.040]   sections more like samsung could totally make a 100 percent samsung phone
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:22.080]   uh and they just don't like this still has a
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:25.440]   qua-com processor and all that which which actually still gets made in samsung's
[01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:28.000]   factories oh that's interesting i didn't know that
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:32.320]   uh yeah it's all the fab uh yeah interesting
[01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:35.760]   so they do the exeunos everywhere but the us here in the us it's uh it's
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:38.560]   a qua-com and i think that's because of the radio bands probably more than
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:41.600]   anything else right they did exeunos last year on the s6
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:45.280]   yeah because the a 10 was like a horrible chip
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:48.400]   right so it's so they can do it they just chose
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:52.800]   not to i think because sam's on component section treats the phone section as
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:55.440]   any other customer like they try to stay independent
[01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:58.320]   right that's right i don't know they they could really play their strengths if
[01:59:58.320 --> 02:00:01.680]   they just came together as a unit and and
[02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:04.320]   released i don't know something that only they could build
[02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:11.120]   battery life on the s6 is a big s7 is a huge improvement over the s6
[02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:15.120]   i'm getting really good like look 80 percent i mean uh here it is four in the
[02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:18.560]   afternoon uh this easily gets through the day
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:22.720]   according to uh g-sam i think it's uh 15 and a half hours and i think that's
[02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:26.320]   even low i think it was was lower first because i was
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:29.600]   installing everything and i think it's coming down going up every day
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:33.280]   it's and you're on marshmallow now so you get those and those is great and
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:37.360]   but you know and and also notice the screen usage 10 percent
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:43.280]   um it the screen is much less of a of a drain than it is on any other phone
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:47.360]   i've used usually the screen on almost any phone is 30 40 50 percent of the
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:51.600]   usage here it's very it's sips at the usage so
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:56.400]   i don't know i i and the camera you come on you love this camera you must
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:59.760]   yeah oh the camera's great sam's son really figured out cameras like last
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:03.040]   year and has just been putting out some of the best stuff yeah
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:06.800]   yeah all right all right i won't argue with you uh
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:11.680]   it is twice as much as the mefos right it is twice as much yeah but
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:17.040]   i don't know the all of the the interesting cell phone stuff i think
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:21.920]   happens at the lower end nowadays then then at the the super high end stuff
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:24.720]   the super high end phones just take last year's design and put more
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:28.240]   stuff in it but when they when they kind of do this competing on
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:32.400]   price thing i think it gets more interesting aren't we maxed out though i
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:35.280]   mean we're at peak phone already that's the problem there's nothing what are
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:39.040]   you gonna do what what could you do that would make everybody go wow that's
[02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:42.240]   right in yeah in america sure but you know
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:45.680]   there's there was a thing in the roundup about you know people in china
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:49.920]   getting cell phones and and all that that's that's going to be the big
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:53.440]   like tech story for phones next right right
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:57.280]   um how about the robin that was 400 bucks did you
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:03.840]   like that um yeah it we it it was a fine like
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:08.000]   hardware phone but they tied it to this weird cloud system that doesn't
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:11.760]   really make a ton of sense i mean everybody anybody that complains about
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:16.080]   phone storage just says give me an SD card and then they're totally happy
[02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:20.000]   and if they had just done that i think this storage
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:25.360]   market would have been a lot happier with the uh the next bit robin because
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:28.640]   right now it's like oh well you can use cloud cloud storage but you also have to
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:33.040]   use a ton of your mobile data to move stuff back and forth and and get it up
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:36.480]   there and it's like that's that that stops the whole point of
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:39.680]   storage like the whole point was i don't have great internet access so i want
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:42.800]   to have these movies and music and stuff with me
[02:02:42.800 --> 02:02:46.640]   and it doesn't do that so it's it's weird i don't know it's cool to see a new
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:50.160]   phone company though i look forward to getting one once they
[02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:56.640]   start selling in the u.s absolutely yeah mr. mat cuts your thing of the week
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:01.120]   so this is oh mat mat mat unplug your headset it's
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:02.720]   ah oh oh ah
[02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:07.360]   somebody's hey i has taken over and while he's fixing that let me just mention
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:11.680]   somebody was wondering uh in g-sam what the percentage of usage for the
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:17.280]   screen is when it's on or off and uh it's three percent when it's on which is
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:20.880]   really good considering it has the always on feature
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:24.320]   which means that even when this phone is off and just sitting on the desk is
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:27.200]   showing the time and the a few little things and
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:30.000]   i have to say three percent drain wall off
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:35.360]   wall um uh wait a minute that says discharge wall on off three percent
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:38.080]   eighteen percent i think that must be reversed it must be eighteen percent
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:41.760]   went on and three percent went off that way otherwise why wouldn't you six
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:45.600]   times more when it's off than when it's on would that make a sense
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:49.120]   that floating clock yeah it's well nobody's young like that
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:52.240]   see it it's just sitting there it has an always on
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:56.080]   uh and uh that is that's it i like that that might be the
[02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:59.280]   eighteen percent though no because that's always on
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:02.720]   no did you left it there all day it's only been five hours though it hasn't
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:05.760]   been on that long no it hasn't that these this is not a good
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:10.160]   day to uh to see the battery life but then you know
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:14.560]   days past i used it a hundred percent today was i had brought out the
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:20.080]   nexus six p to talk about uh not role
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:25.200]   i'm telling you i got an inside track on that one
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:29.520]   and i'm not gonna tell uh no you guys that what you're betting on new
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:33.040]   teller yeah i i there's a silly photoshop
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:38.000]   somewhere of me doing a um i took a stupid new tele
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.560]   bottle and wrote android on it it's just madam if you ever been to the
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:45.840]   meeting the and there must be a fun meeting where they decide what the
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:50.480]   code letter is going to represent uh i haven't been to the ones for
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:54.080]   android but uh it is fun whenever we're talking about search
[02:04:54.080 --> 02:04:58.720]   projects and deciding pigeon and penguin or caffeine or you know
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:01.280]   what do you want to call it and and do we want to name it at all those
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:04.800]   kinds of things because you know you that's that's your chance to put
[02:05:04.800 --> 02:05:07.520]   something out there that can even be an inside joke that people might not
[02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:10.880]   realize so yeah to compare it the six p wall on
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:14.080]   off is 22 percent 13 percent so there's a big
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:17.760]   big difference uh there what do you what do you got mad as you're
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:21.520]   pick a break there just something to know if you're a publisher webmaster
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:25.920]   search engine optimizer is that uh we mentioned earlier in the show that
[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:30.000]   google in may is going to be giving more weight to mobile friendly pages so
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:33.520]   if you are planning on making mobile friendly websites
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:38.000]   we will be changing the user agent for google bot uh now that's for the
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.840]   smartphone version of google bot so it used to pretend to be an iphone
[02:05:41.840 --> 02:05:45.680]   now it pretends to be an excess five x so rightly so
[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:49.120]   yeah when you see one of these guys nexus five x sir from the web
[02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:52.800]   showing up that's that's the google bot that's that's it odds are it might be
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:56.480]   the google bot and treat him just like you'd treat any other browser but um
[02:05:56.480 --> 02:06:00.000]   that's something to know about it it i maybe the nexus
[02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.760]   phones are are popular enough now that we don't have to say we're an iphone
[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:07.200]   but i think for ninety nine percent of uh websites it won't make any difference
[02:06:07.200 --> 02:06:10.560]   it's just something to be aware of if you haven't heard about that that just
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:14.960]   came out do you have an opinion go ahead what is
[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:17.840]   this why why did you switch why change the user agent
[02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:22.320]   yeah well uh there's some things that the you know
[02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:25.920]   whenever the iphone isn't under your control you know for example the iphone
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:29.120]   didn't support flash and so you could you can imagine a lot of different
[02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:31.680]   functionalities that people might try to say oh
[02:06:31.680 --> 02:06:34.960]   i'll just poll or i think the iphone is capable of this
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:39.360]   and now with it being the nexus five x is the user agent we're able to have that
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:43.280]   under our control we're able to check you know for example we can we can get an
[02:06:43.280 --> 02:06:46.640]   xs five x pretty cheaply so you could actually have these guys
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:50.560]   load the page and then have it load the page from other you know devices to
[02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:54.640]   check whether things are cloaking and all those kinds of things so um
[02:06:54.640 --> 02:06:58.000]   yeah it's not a huge change but it's just something where it gives us a little
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:01.600]   more ability to maybe monitor if anything's going on and we should
[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:06.240]   point out this is not an attempt to any intent to hide the user agent it says
[02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:09.680]   in the user agent string google bot that's right you know i mean it's not like
[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:12.240]   they're pretending they're not the google bot it's just that you have to
[02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:16.000]   you can't give google bot is the as the the hardware device
[02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:19.600]   yeah and if you're going to change your version number anyway like instead of
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:23.760]   mobile safari 537 to mobile safari you know like 600 or whatever
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:27.840]   why not go ahead and and list some mobile or modern you know phone that you've
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:32.800]   already got that you own and make yeah do you have a
[02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:36.880]   favorite for what n might stand for mat knowing that you have no inside
[02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:41.040]   information i have no inside information and the whole kit cat thing
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:44.560]   seem to get mixed reactions but i like new teller because you tell i don't know
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:48.400]   if you know this but it's delicious i know it's delicious
[02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:51.680]   but it is a brand name that's what you're talking about kit cat was a brand name
[02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:55.440]   and and did get some heat because nobody wants to say a brand name
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:59.840]   um and they abandoned that brand name thing for the last couple
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:04.800]   yeah but every good new kit everybody loves new teller so yesterday
[02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:07.680]   they did a you know the opinion rewards program from google
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:11.760]   yeah use yeah use the opinion of rewards to send out a question what should
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:15.120]   android nb name damn it why didn't i specifically the question is
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:20.640]   what tasty food comes to mind when you think of the letter and
[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:26.400]   that role and the winners so far is has not chose no none of those
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:30.320]   nori uh new york cheesecake new york cheesecake that's not
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:33.920]   too compound that's not new york cheesecake is what they call
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:38.400]   android and internally in like the code base there's always a separate
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:42.000]   name that it gets from the developers and that's the actual name from the
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:46.160]   developers huh yeah in the code so lollipop was
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:52.080]   uh was a i forget uh key lime pie was kit cat yeah we all we thought it might be
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:55.600]   key lime pie yeah yeah so the developers give it some
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:58.800]   some separate name because they can't wait for the marketers to decide what
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:01.360]   they want to do right so i have to have a name for it
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:05.200]   name space and i just found out if i if i scroll down on the nine to five google
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:09.840]   story about this i can vote oh what should android
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:13.120]   and apolian nut brittle nachos nori noodles
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:17.680]   nugget where's new teller it's not even on the list
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:23.120]   and by the way i'm peeved because i also do google opinion rewards
[02:09:23.120 --> 02:09:29.760]   and they didn't ask me they says there's no survey at this time
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:35.360]   they're just washing twig so they don't they don't need to ask you
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:40.560]   not roll not roll not roll not roll not hungry
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:44.000]   that you got to think about what your icon would look like so i don't know but
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.200]   then a jar of nutella doesn't really work either so
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:50.960]   no it does there's an android mashup that has like the little android guy with
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:54.640]   that oh okay it's sticking out of a jar of nutella
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:57.280]   i think we all know it's going to be nutella
[02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:00.400]   that'd be so nice if they hand it out nutella is like the swag
[02:10:00.400 --> 02:10:04.560]   oh you know what it's good but at patrick delahanty
[02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:08.320]   has pointed out there really is only one name it can be and yes it's a brand
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:12.880]   name but it's the right brand name nerds
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:16.640]   nerds nerds are good too i like nerds
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:20.640]   google nerds it's a no it knowing google if they're not going to
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:23.840]   announce the name at i/o they will have a spread of
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:28.400]   snacks that begin with n yeah just spread all over the show
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:33.520]   that'd be funny hey i want to mention uh my pick is uh
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:38.160]   after having extensive trials i'm android where i love i love android
[02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:42.400]   where and i have two moto 360s including the
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:46.320]   moto 360 sport but it but it doesn't do the kinds of
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:49.280]   things including continuous heart rate monitoring that i really would like it
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:52.800]   to do and i've ended up coming up with uh my
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:56.560]   favorite fitness watch which doesn't you know it's not android where but it
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:59.920]   still does notifications i can control music play back with it
[02:10:59.920 --> 02:11:03.680]   uh has alarms in it and is much better for fitness
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:07.440]   fitbit of course which is the king in this field and this is the fitbit blaze
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:11.600]   which at 200 bucks i think is uh my choice for
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:14.880]   it's not a great watch i mean i have a whole bunch of different
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:18.480]   watch faces and all that but it really is a great fitness device
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:21.920]   including continuous heart rate monitoring so this is the only device i
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:24.800]   have that will tell me what my resting heart rate is
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:29.200]   and frankly that's a very good indicator of overall health as i've been able to
[02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:34.000]   bring that down i've felt better and better it has a much broader range of
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.200]   exercises you can choose from including some exercises that most
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:43.200]   fitness bands don't do with that i do a lot like spinning and pilates and i
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:46.720]   i feel like that that's uh i mean of course there's no steps in
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:48.720]   spinning and pilates but the fact that it has
[02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:52.320]   accurate continuous and by the way i've tested it is accurate continuous
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:56.720]   heart rate measurement um and uh really does do a good job of tracking your
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:00.560]   overall movement it ties in via bluetooth le to
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:04.880]   the fitbit app on any phone or all your phones i have it on all the phone so
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:07.520]   it doesn't really care what phone it's attached to
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:11.360]   uh and they have in this a built-in fit star
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:15.040]   mini fit star program that'll work you through some uh workouts
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:18.880]   through the watch so of all of the fitness bands and i've tried them all
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:22.960]   including unfortunately android where apple watch is one of my favorites it's
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:27.360]   pretty good but this one's even better and five-day battery life
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:32.240]   means you don't have to go crazy uh charging it all the time it does not
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:36.720]   kill the battery to have continuous uh heart rate monitoring so i'm very
[02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:40.320]   happy with uh this and so my little it's my pick the
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:44.240]   fitbit blaze ugly is sin but you know what
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:48.320]   who cares you can pop it out of the by the way see there's other bands available
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:51.120]   so you don't it pops out of the of the band
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:54.240]   it's not it's not actually integral to the band so
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:57.840]   in fact you have to pop it out to charge as usual they have a weird charger
[02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:01.600]   so what does what does the underside of that look like because the reason the
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:04.560]   apple watch is good is because there's two
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:09.360]   green heart rate monitor lights and receivers and most of the andro
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:13.760]   okay that has to so that has two lights and one receiver maybe yeah
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:16.720]   it is as accurate as the apple watch which is
[02:13:16.720 --> 02:13:20.560]   absolutely the most accurate device much more than the android where devices
[02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:23.280]   right and the reason none of the android where devices work is because
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:27.360]   they have one light and one receiver and that's usually it's only because
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:30.480]   the the hardware makers like cheaped out and didn't
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:33.120]   yet didn't go with the two light solution so that's cool okay it's got
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:37.440]   it's got a crappy LCD screen it's not very bright it is always on
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:42.400]   which is kind of nice um i don't know i feel like this is uh
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:47.120]   it's not a watch it's a fitness device none of these are really decent watches
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:50.560]   in general although i actually really appreciate how the uh
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:54.880]   the Moto 360 looks i i got one with a metal band and i think it looks the
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:58.160]   most like a watch i love round this is square
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:02.880]   but uh anyway you probably uh i know your fitness fanatic
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:06.880]   mat cuts you probably have a device you like to use for your
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:10.400]   workout rock old school the fit bit blade or
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:14.240]   pulse or one or something like that i've lost so many of those down the toilet
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:18.800]   yeah it's it's like a subscription because you lose them so quickly or they
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:21.520]   break yeah i left one i tell this story i left one at the
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:24.720]   san jia gozoo one in paris and one in the toilet
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:29.280]   and i think one got washed so uh but you could wear it that way you could wear
[02:14:29.280 --> 02:14:31.520]   this that way too i think fit bit really knows what they're doing
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:36.080]   actually of all the of all the trackers what's your 30-day challenge mat
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:40.480]   this month is fitness month yeah i'm trying to exercise once or twice a day
