[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.920]   I've got graphics working on it. Mm-hmm. The weekly packet would be such a good name for the show except nobody would understand it
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.440]   I've explained it all of them
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.960]   Jeff Jarvis is here from the City University of New York professor of journalism. Hi Jeff

[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.240]   She was your your colleague at giga-ohm and now writes about the Internet of Things
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.880]   Stacy on IOT calm you don't say bathroom do you I
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.920]   Do it's my last name. Okay, so I dropped the H so it's not bottom. It's
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.040]   Didn't even register. I spent my entire
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.840]   Formative elementary school year thing
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.000]   Pig and bottom pig and bottom. I think don't isn't it kind of a British thing to drop the third and just call it to but maybe not
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.040]   German isn't it?
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.520]   Higgin boss. I was gonna say we've been in America for years. Okay. We'll call you both bothoms the bothoms
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.280]   Anyway, wonderful to have you. I'm a fan. I've been you know a huge fan of your byline for years on giga-ohm
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.440]   Love the work you do and I've really enjoyed you when you appear on our other shows and I realized we've never had you on this show
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:14.320]   Well, thanks for fixing that. I can't wait and you actually have the best voice in podcasting by the way beautiful voice
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.040]   Thank you. Were you a voice artist or something? I mean you really sound good
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.840]   No, but now I'm thinking of a second career
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.760]   So
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.280]   iTunes next Leo's never said that to me on the oc no I
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.680]   Haven't so there was a story
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.080]   Who does Tom Hanks and George Clooney and oh, yeah people in Germany died
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.880]   It was really interesting to me that you had a voiceover guy was a star enough to do obits on and big stories around
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.440]   So people knew that he was dubbing the voices of those superstars. Yeah. Yeah, wow
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.960]   That's actually now they have to find like 10 other people. Yeah, exactly
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:56.600]   I thought that in most civilized nations they use subtitles
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.400]   Don't know there's lots of dubbing. I thought they mocked us
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.160]   For in the United States because we had to have dubbing
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.480]   But we don't like dubbing that much we don't like dubbing we like subtitles, right?
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.080]   Maybe I got that's only if you're an art, you know an art house. No, yeah
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.440]   there seems to be a division some people like
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.040]   Prefer to have dubs even if they're bad and some people prefer to have subtitle
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.080]   I just hate dubbing because it's I do too looks so phony. It's so much better when you're watching
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.200]   I'm gonna age myself here got a young kid
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.320]   So musical comedies or like Disney movies all the singing has to be redone for translated and that's
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.160]   That's totally a voice actor right there. Yeah
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.700]   This is only barely on topic, but did you see?
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.520]   spirit of liberation.de
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.320]   No, evidently a new cache of World War two color film
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:55.760]   I go nuts on color phone that age because it just changes your worldview so much. It doesn't look so old for one thing. Yeah, yeah
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.720]   In your like anything happening before color. It was all in black and white, right?
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.680]   And so it's normally invasion. It's per limb being destroyed, you know and so on
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.600]   But it's it's it's amazing to see it in color. I just saw German site. It's in true
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.120]   What is the you're you're up on how the Germans feel about everything
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:20.760]   No, just don't mean it like me, but that's all right. What is the attitude? Well, your sneakers days of real insult to speakers. Yeah
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:27.200]   So is it no they know it's not but they did so they did a story on Jeff go ahead to tell the story
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.960]   Yeah, they just story about when I was speaking in Augsburg and they said what was it?
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.440]   He talks freely and wears sneakers
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.360]   And has a currently a dial telephone
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.240]   that phone
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:46.240]   Hello, mr. Chavez. I have a call for you person to person when you accept the charges. It's Lee and at Fresno
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.120]   So so they don't mind they enjoy these
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.640]   Old-time. Well, there's a fascination with history Lord knows yeah, mm-hmm
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:01.520]   And with the the Berliner excitement that which is where I found this does all kinds of great things where you look at you know
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.160]   I've given seen then and now that slightly thing
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.360]   I saw one of those
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.520]   Paris and Berlin and this photographer
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.840]   Overlapped new photos with yeah, historical it was fascinating. Yeah, I
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:24.200]   Yeah, so but you have to pay it looks like you have to pay for it. Hey for it, but I might
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.800]   Oh, here's let's look at the trailer. We probably could show that safely
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   Yeah
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:39.520]   It all
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:48.800]   It's so real in a horrible way. Yeah good color too. It's amazing. It's original color, but it's
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.920]   enhanced
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.640]   In in resolution they say
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:02.320]   It doesn't wasn't that long ago really and so it does kind of give you a false sense of oh
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.680]   This is our ancient history when it's in black and white. Yeah, exactly
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.840]   It feels longer ago. Yeah, I mean look how vivid that is. It looks like real people
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.120]   Right exactly it's amazing how our brains, you know, if we still have black and white tv
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.120]   We would think the world looks that way
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:21.200]   And this is what from the Donald Trump campaign is this
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.480]   I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.120]   Uh, jeff javis, what the hell happened
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:31.200]   You not want to talk about this
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.120]   Not for very long
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:39.120]   I won't spend a lot of time but and I missed it and I apologize because I would have immediately tweeted in support but I was walking home
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.480]   Uh, and I found out about it after the fact after s squared already pulled it down, but s choir
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:49.040]   Unaccountably and inexcusably published I think so a piece
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.480]   That was said by professor jeff javis. It wasn't
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.720]   Uh, it was kind of it wasn't even I get I gather I didn't couldn't read it, but it wasn't even particularly funny
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.440]   It was a parody. Well because it's a parody of the parody
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.680]   uh
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.440]   Vander high had written a
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.440]   pen in the wall street journal
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.600]   Uh, saying succuburg should run for president would run for president right so so
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.400]   This guy who I who has been torturing me now for four years. So this is the twitter guy
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:23.680]   It's the twitter guy. Yeah, uh, wrote a piece and and and s choir did a horrendous job
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.720]   They did not label it at the very top. Did they know it wasn't you of course they did of course
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:33.360]   Then it's inexcusable and then only only at the the only way you can see this was at the
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.560]   Very very bottom of the piece and we know nobody scrolls these days
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:42.640]   In the ital id at the very end of that is said not at jeff javis as if anyone should be able to figure out
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.600]   Which ones which be the later after your complaint they added
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:52.320]   Then jake found this in a search only by searching for the word satire on the page at the very very very very bottom underneath
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.520]   All the tabula crap and all the other crap and all the other crap and all the other crap
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.000]   There was a whole big gray list of tags in there. It said satire
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.440]   That was it that was the only effent label on the thing
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.320]   I I got terribly upset. I got really really really upset because this is i just i just had it
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.560]   I've just absolutely had it. Uh, this guy has attacked people using my name. That's it
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.800]   He's just not at jeff jure this case
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:21.600]   So this would be even somebody sophisticated and I think some people who are sophisticated were fooled by this
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:29.040]   Uh thought it was you because nobody's really gonna do an e forensic research and certainly nobody doesn't know you is going to assume it's you
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:34.960]   It's unconscionable for s square to do this and I you know for one i'll defend you as my friend and blah blah blah
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.120]   but it's the larger issue of
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:44.000]   What's to stop this from happening all the time if you don't have journalistic institution of any sort should never try to fool
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.080]   It's readers. It's unethical. It's wrong
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.720]   So I ended up on twitter with the apparently the the assigne editor. He asked me to email him
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   He never gave me the response of the
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:58.080]   Respective response then I then i'm in a very privileged position. I know people at her at the parent company
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.960]   I went to my email list. I went to very high people at her
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.560]   I can do that because i'm connected here and i'm a professor in new york and I know people
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.440]   You know the average schmuck who got in the situation couldn't do that
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:13.440]   But I used that privilege to email them and executive email back very nicely included to others
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.800]   They then put a label in that said it was worse. It said
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.880]   uh
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.680]   by at professor jeff javis a
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.640]   Soterical whatever I said that's they've read that sentence that says that I a guy named
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.040]   Jarvis satirical twitter
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.320]   No, I said listen
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.840]   First I was very angry and I said take it down take it down take it down then I said listen
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:40.000]   You take my name off of this. I'm i'm collateral damage take my name off this in any way and you can do whatever the hell you want
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.120]   I'm not you know fine, but then a higher executive came in and said and apologized. Well, it was because I think they're exposed
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.440]   I frankly think that there's no I mean that's gonna be come on. No. No. No. No, you can't do that
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:54.160]   They just you know you're you're a public figure
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.560]   I'm a public figure if somebody starts publishing stuff over my name that I didn't write
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.080]   I would sue the hell out of them. Well, and you should
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.760]   I then I asked for a lawyer because I didn't connect with one but people always threatening
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.800]   It was doesn't yes, it's defamatory. Yes. I believe it's acting on even that it's confusion
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.520]   you know the biggest the biggest awards in
[00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.680]   in the trademark confusion the trade you know trademark awards
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.200]   And I know this because I talked to attorneys about twitter because twitter was named twitter after twit
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.880]   And so I talked to attorneys, but are we protected?
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:35.760]   Etc. And they said well if you wanted to pursue it the way to pursue this is trademark confusion that people would assume as they do the twitter
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.240]   That I copied twitter not vice versa
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.480]   And I would think that this would be this would be a similar issue
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:50.320]   This is confusing people about you damaging to your reputations use its use of image and and name
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.800]   Yeah, there's a personal research
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.800]   Yeah, I want to get this to be right
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:02.480]   I so they took it down. I knew what would happen. I knew exactly what happened then I get smashed all of the trolls travel in packs
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.400]   So certain trolls that left me alone for years come back out other trolls come in
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:10.480]   Uh attack me on twitter, you know calling me a well, and that's the problem
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.480]   It's the stress and effect if you
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:17.040]   So what are you supposed to do you supposed to sit back and just take everything? No, I'm not supposed to take that point
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.320]   No, you as my son said you pull the bandaid off
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.400]   So, um, I went on a medium and I posted saying this is what happened
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:30.160]   And uh, and then I heard today from a reporter at gocker of all effing places
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.080]   Gocker trying to act hottie with me, you know, huh? Hello little hard to look hottie from the sewer fellas
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.880]   Uh, so I also responded to that and put that up and I just put it there and let it you know
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.880]   Let the let the snow roll off
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.560]   This guy has had his fun for four years now four years ago
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:52.640]   Two years ago. It's not about this he promised to change the name. He promised Jason potton of mit media review who intervened
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.920]   He didn't do it. He just said on twitter that oh, it's just not a priority yet. He had two years
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.400]   BS fella bs
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   I've had it. You've had your fun
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:09.040]   I avoided this because I didn't want the crap, but I've just plain had it. I got so upset last night my literally my
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.000]   Anxiety attack was going for the first time in two years
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.640]   I felt like I was gonna go into a fib and I said, you know for this stand up in the f*cking hospital
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.200]   No, well, you shouldn't but so that's it. That's the story. Yeah. We don't need a belaborate
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.320]   But I think it's damaging to ask squares brand very damaging
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.200]   Well, I think they know that I think this is this when I asked them for again and again and again
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.840]   I said what is your policy? I want your policy so I can write about this
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.280]   And I never got it and I suspect they don't have one I suspect they will now
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:39.440]   Because the basic rule every journal every had journalist taking a price should have a rule about this is unacceptable
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.520]   The bottom line is you do not fool the reader
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.280]   That is the worst thing a journalist can do in any possible world
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:52.960]   You don't fool the reader and the effort of this guy and the s square in this case was to think oh, we're all clever
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.440]   We're gonna fool the reader
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.840]   No, that's unethical. It's unjournalistic
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.920]   And and that was it so I I just I want to move on now
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:06.080]   And thanks for the support Lisa did a nice tweet today
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:11.760]   About this as well and I appreciate that I appreciate lots and lots and lots of very supportive tweets very good friends who came in
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.000]   People who mean a lot to me
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Dan Gilmour, Zaneb Tufesky
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.920]   Neil Dash a lot of people just really were very very nice Matthew came on I saw came in today
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.760]   And I and that really means a lot because it just you just the the the junk people come after me
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.840]   I put one bad tweet you don't want to show in the ear
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.640]   In the piece and you just get tons of that junk
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.800]   Which which by the way is convenient because now I can tell all the jerks and I just block them
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:42.640]   I have blocked another hundred jerks and my life will be quieter and that's nice. So thank you. That's it
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.760]   Ah
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.920]   It's just kind of shocking. I know it just doesn't
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:51.760]   And I think it's not just about you Jeff. I mean
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.040]   We're already in a kind of a loosey goosey environment in terms of internet journalism
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.040]   And the last thing you want. I mean what you know what if somebody wrote a
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.600]   It's fake joseve job said fake steve jobs
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.440]   Uh, you know Dan Lyons wrote that for a long time, but there was never any question that wasn't Steve jobs
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.320]   Exactly. Exactly. I don't know that Steve jobs was pleased about it, but at least all I'm sure it wasn't
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.240]   But it wasn't pretending to be Steve jobs and this is pretending to be you
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.280]   And if somebody wrote a piece under over George cloney's name
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:30.080]   You could bet they'd be getting sued like crazy. I mean that's that's a really that's a brain. That's this
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:37.920]   I'm shocked frankly that they would do that and it really has to twitter Jeff about about him
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.600]   Changing his name or forcing him to change his name on twitter
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:47.520]   Uh, you know the problem there. No a la parody account. I did last night. Oh finally. I
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.960]   Don't know what's gonna happen there. The the problem is Matthew is that it's the it's the strice end problem
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.360]   Is that if I caused the account to be killed?
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.640]   Um, then you know the guy took down his account or it would account down as quickly a few months ago
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.680]   And there were stories there were news stories and I caused this to happen
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:09.040]   Can you get a life into real news? No, I didn't cause it to happen and um
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.520]   Uh
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.080]   So no, but at this point I am over the edge some people are trying to intervene and just say listen
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:22.080]   You've had your fun. You've had your time just change the name. Yeah, just he said he said for some time
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:27.200]   Oh, I'm not really making fun of Jarvis. I'm making fun of this type. Well, then change the name
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.160]   Very simple, you know call yourself. Uh, I don't know. Hey, good. Motham
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.120]   Fake Jeff Jarvis. I've got a fake Matthew Ingram even though even though it's still
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:50.560]   Why still you why still involved me anymore? Just just take me out of it. Just take me out of it
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.080]   You've had your time for years for years. Well, it's built a brand around it though. I mean, that's
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.720]   That's what he does. So
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.560]   Which is really sad, you know, it's a really sad thing. This guy doesn't have you know
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.880]   He wanted to write his parody piece put it on your own byline
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.680]   Be proud of it wasn't very good, but fine be proud of it. So I think maybe that's the problem
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.640]   He's trying to he's writing bad. He's not good enough to write it over his own name
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:21.840]   He's one of the other people to suffer. Jurestasing exactly and and so that's exploiting me at mine
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.640]   Shocking, you know, it's one thing to do on twitter
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:27.600]   It's another thing for an s square to do it and I just really
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.480]   They apologize
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.480]   They apologize. Yeah. Well, at least one executive there is permanently damaging. Sorry s square
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.720]   Well, then gocker put it up, of course. Yeah. Well, see I wrote them off ages ago
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.960]   I'm today still have reporters. I thought what are they doing?
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.640]   Politics politics. I guess not
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.440]   I guess not. Yeah, exactly
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.920]   They can't they do you know what once you taste blood. It's very hard to wean yourself off that flavor
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.280]   Yep
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.280]   All right, Facebook results are in
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.360]   It seems so bloodless to talk about but
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.240]   Twitter results
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.080]   Not so good. In fact apple not so good. Microsoft not so good a lot of
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.960]   A lot of not so good results
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:19.200]   Facebook crushed it though actually Facebook was the one win, right? Yeah. Yeah big one. Yes significant analyze, please
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:28.080]   Well, I mean, I know how I want him to do the work. You got three people. I should be sitting back and join my tea. Listen
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:33.360]   Facebook beat every estimate I think on every metric as far as I can tell
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:41.520]   Um, what are the what are the things that we look at to see how well Facebook's doing mobile engagement mobile ad sales mobile, right?
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.800]   How it's doing in mobile. Yeah, yeah, I was an advertising based company
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:53.280]   Yeah, and advertising. I mean, I think 79 of their revenue was from mobile ads. I remember not that long ago
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:58.080]   People writing think pieces about will Facebook ever figure out mobile. Yes
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:09.440]   A year and a half ago. Yeah, two years ago. It was like Facebook doesn't get mobile Facebook and now 79 of their ad revenue, which is massive
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:16.400]   I mean, that's the power of having a billion. Is it a billion five monthly active users? I mean, what she did a billion daily
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.320]   Right. They said I think a billion daily. So q1 revenue
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:24.560]   5.4 billion that's a single quarter
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.760]   79 of that from mobile ads
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.240]   You know, I think the difference here too is is is they have more data about us and about content that I think than google
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:38.960]   I you know, we can have that that discussion which has more but I think you can argue facebook has more opportunity
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.800]   To target in a relevant way at a higher value and performance
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.400]   Google
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.160]   Brought up a whole bunch of the ad infrastructure that puts it in the rest of the ad business
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:54.880]   Facebook is doing this entirely on its own platforms. Mm-hmm. And I think that one key difference is
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.640]   Google
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.640]   Has lots of data
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.840]   Based on
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.760]   You know, just the volume of people doing things Facebook has a lot of data based on
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:09.120]   Other aspects of your behavior. So clicking liking commenting
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.440]   sharing
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:14.560]   Google doesn't have access to any of that stuff except through
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.200]   Twitter, which kind of deal with
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:24.560]   Um, you know, it has some on google plus which I think was the whole point of launching that was to get that kind of behavioral data
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:31.520]   Because that stuff is gold to advertisers if you can kind of draw multiple vectors between
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:38.640]   You like this and you commented on that and you shared this and therefore you're gonna like this specific car or whatever
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.920]   We know you who you know and we know what they like and we you know, yeah, yeah, and and again
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.480]   I have no problem with that
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.480]   Do you guys is there a different way of
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:55.120]   valuing the advertising for something like Facebook, which is kind of more entertainment and kind of downtime versus google
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:01.600]   Which is very information oriented because that's kind of the way I think about how they great questions Stacy great question
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.000]   Because you know what you just hit your your finger on put your finger on put your finger on
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.680]   is
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.600]   That um the question of direct response versus brandian advertising
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.280]   You're right google is direct response and they're brilliant at that and they can target
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:21.440]   Terribly well to that and so can facebook but what facebook really has is this this familiar
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:30.000]   In a place and I think you I think you may have hit something that the opportunity for branding advertising which media are dying to hold on to
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.080]   Now can go to facebook and in a way google
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.960]   in a way google's sort of
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.600]   You know made its own bed. I mean it it pushed
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:47.120]   Programmatic direct response to the point where that's a significant proportion of all the advertising you see online
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.200]   and the and the
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.360]   Money they and others make from it is miniscule and so you have to have massive massive scale
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.920]   Um, so they're very very good at that
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.720]   Type of advertising, but not so good at lots of other kinds of advertising
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:06.400]   Do you advertise any of the shows when you start? Yeah, we do. So what what do you find about about?
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.480]   I don't know. I don't uh
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:14.960]   Indulgent all that stuff. I try to keep seriously. I try to give myself distant from incoming and outgoing ad dollars
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.760]   I don't want to know anything about it. Uh, the other thing about facebook is that it's really subtle
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:24.560]   Uh, you know understanding how you're getting the ads that you see
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:29.840]   It's both like they're amazing at their machine intelligence, but they're also on the back end
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.120]   I'm shocked at the inputs I can put on facebook to reach
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.480]   It's amazing the granularity. It's incredible. If you've looked at any of those sliders that you can choose
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.440]   We when we were running a conference
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.440]   Toronto we had a guy who who dove deep into facebook and
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:54.320]   There's just so many things you can target by well, I'll give you an example Jason kelolandis said here's what you should do
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.880]   Jason of course knows all this stuff
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   Uh, he said what you should do is you've got a newsletter. You've got a mailing list now
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.800]   What you do is you feed that mailing list to facebook and you say I want people like
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.920]   These people yes because they already know everybody's email. I want people like these people
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:13.600]   So you don't even have to say what these people are like you just know these people are active viewers
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.080]   So they wanted the mailing list so we're not doing this by the way
[00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:20.720]   You feel just telling you you could and then facebook churns those numbers and says good
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.480]   I have another 10,000 people who are like those people but not
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.960]   Not subscribe to your mailing list
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:31.600]   Would you like to buy that ad and of course that's who you want right it's more of those engaged
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.440]   Viewers that's a that kind of granularity is amazing
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.520]   And so if you think about like I think about this from a sort of media point of view
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:44.240]   If you're a newspaper or a magazine or even a tv station for that matter
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:49.760]   You know basically diddly squat compared to facebook about your users
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.880]   And I know this is something jeff's talk about as well
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.280]   You you know kind of hazy
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.480]   General vague things about the group of people who consume your content facebook knows
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:07.680]   People down to you know their height like they you can so you can leverage it which is interesting all you need
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.960]   Their facebook says well, we know all about that guy right and if you're an advertiser
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:20.560]   You get to say I want a woman between 32 and 37 who lives in these specific geographical areas
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.920]   Who's who likes these tv shows who's voted for these things who's probably pro choice like that?
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:32.640]   This sort of debt here's the question you can do is mind modeling is that offensive given that it's anonymized
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:38.080]   They're not for instance if I buy that list. I don't even get to see who those people are that match
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.800]   Yeah, you're right leo in fact I can go to
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:45.520]   Data warehouses right now and I can buy a similar list where I do get the list
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.440]   I do get to mail it out myself. We're on facebook facebook becomes a shield
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:56.000]   Between the advertiser so easy and invasion of privacy. They're anonymizing. They're not giving that information now
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.640]   I don't think I'll give you a free. Okay. We don't think so do real use your things
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:07.600]   Maybe I think it's a it's a little questionable. I mean we face that actually I'm building an iot newsletter right now
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:15.280]   And we debated do we stick the addresses we have in there and get that there's why I don't do that because of perception
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.600]   not because of reality so much but perception but
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.440]   Well, I think it is iffy and there's also the question of
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:29.120]   There's no accountability for how good facebook is and that kind of black box element is really scary because
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:36.400]   If I look at my list right now, it's it's mostly guys guys who are like yeah, internet of things but
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:44.160]   There are lots of women and moms out there who would love to know about connected. I don't know light bulbs and everything that I care about
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.560]   But they're probably not seeing it, but I don't know that and that's kind of
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:55.520]   That's the black box approach that kind of frustrates me. So here's my favorite story that probably called a second one other issue of course
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:01.360]   You give your mailing list to facebook. There's no guarantee that that's not adding to facebook's information
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.600]   Right. That's why you are giving your your subscribers
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.480]   Something about your subscribers to facebook another another quantum of information
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.640]   I'm sorry jeff go ahead. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. So I don't if i told the story on the show before a reporter called
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:22.960]   Me about privacy some time ago and he said that to his friends and family he was talking intimately to them
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:28.640]   About how he was feeling and he and this happened that was weird and that happened was weird and this happened and that happened
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:33.520]   And then he saw an ad come up on facebook for multiple sclerosis treatment
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.960]   I ignore I ignore this stuff because this this is all anecdotal
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:42.240]   There's a lot of this kind of anecdotal stuff and people are really good at finding coincidences in the world
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:48.800]   Yeah, but maybe but I but I think that there were symptoms there and the point here was actually a benefit because he didn't
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:53.040]   Wasn't diagnosed. He didn't know what why he was feeling so did he just did he find out that he had ms?
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.600]   Yeah. Oh wow. Yeah
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:04.240]   And surely you can hear the crease argument well, but yeah, you don't want to be diagnosed by your facebook posts
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.280]   But that's knowledge right and knowledge is not a bad thing. We keep on demonizing
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:17.360]   But but no Jeff it's who it's shared with okay, it's who it's shared with so now facebook says oh this guy has all the symptoms of ms
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.280]   We might want to we might
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:25.520]   Didn't do that. No, they didn't the advertiser the advertiser asked for certain keyword. I understand we think facebook didn't do that
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.040]   But that's what p that's what privacy advocates are most worried about
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.280]   Is that data base will then be sold insurance companies will deny that guy insurance?
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:38.080]   But they didn't do that or use it as a as a pre-existing condition. I guess I can't do it
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.200]   And actually to be fair, I think I think far more than facebook
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.080]   We need to be worried about all the data resellers and packages that are already out there
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:52.720]   They all know you know, there are a couple of huge companies. That's all they do. Yeah, is build basically data files
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.200]   They've been doing it for decades without your knowledge. Right. Nothing new
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.680]   Right, but I think that the change is the internet makes it so much easier
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:04.000]   We're putting so much stuff on there and the the algorithms and the models for
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.920]   Deciphering the stuff we put out is just oh much better and cheaper to get to
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:16.400]   What's Ricky is that facebook won't just have it your insurance company if they wanted to they could probably you know
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.880]   Do a deal with watson ibms watson and start like filtering through all your social media posts
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.440]   right, I mean, that's
[00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:28.640]   Crazy at an individual. Oh, well, they have the wrong mr. Jarvis. Uh, this is your local fbi
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.560]   Agent, uh, according to facebook, you're about to commit a crime
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:38.240]   Uh, you probably haven't committed it yet, but I just want you to know we're watching pre crime pre crime
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.640]   I mean just tell him as professor Jeff Jarvis
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:45.840]   Not me. It's that other guy there there I saw a story recently where there are
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:53.840]   Intervention programs to try to identify people who could be young people especially who could be vulnerable and they use various
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.240]   Signals to that it's just data. It's just information and and in this case. Yes
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:03.280]   There's something they were going after you but they're stopping you from the life of crime and intervening to give you services
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.400]   So that you won't and what's wrong with that?
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:11.360]   Oh, no, they're suspecting me. Well, they're trying to improve your life because they recognize you're at risk
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.960]   This is a topic when I was talking with the people who are building
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:20.480]   Machine-burning algorithms at facebook. They actually brought this this concept of hey
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:27.520]   We could probably look at what you're posting and see someone who is likely to commit suicide
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.040]   but
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.040]   Do we have an obligation should we?
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.600]   Step in and that's that's something they actually think about
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:43.040]   Uh, which yay for them for recognizing that that's kind of creepy but also a benefit and I just don't think it's society
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.040]   We've gotten to the point where we're like
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.880]   Yay
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.240]   The problem is the the benefits and the disadvantages are so
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.280]   In twined, you know, you don't get
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:56.480]   The benefits without the disadvantages. It's a little like
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:01.280]   The internet itself. It's simultaneously the best thing ever and the worst thing ever
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:05.920]   So you can't trust anyone who's trying to sell you something. That's I mean, that's part of the problem
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:12.720]   But you can get benefits from it. So the the target example where target sent that
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.440]   um, family
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:17.120]   messages about their
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:20.720]   Daughter and her pregnancy and the father didn't even know she was pregnant
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.600]   But target knew because they had looked at all the things that she bought and determined that she was probably
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.440]   in her first trimester
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.480]   That's a
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:34.320]   Our horrific story in a way because the dad found out from target that his daughter was pregnant
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:40.960]   But that was a misuse of the data. Yes, right, but you can you can also see examples where
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.680]   Finding something like that would actually be a good thing
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.320]   Might not be the way you want to find out whether it's a diagnosis of ms or cancer or
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:56.960]   It's information that could be useful to you. The question is how you get it and who else gets it and then what they do with it
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:02.720]   It's not even who else gets it. It's who else can put those pieces together because they're everywhere
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:10.000]   Yeah, and we're and we're leaving them voluntarily all that data smog or whatever that we leave behind our ourselves
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.400]   I talked to a guy actually whose company
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.800]   is designed to to for marketers so he tries to
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.800]   kind of build behavioral profiles for marketers and brands and he said he was approached by
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.000]   Insurance companies and they said
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.440]   So here's what we'd like you to do. We like you to do exactly what you do
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.440]   For the brands except we want you to focus on people's behavior
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:40.000]   That is a breach of their insurance. So if they've filed a claim a back so name and you see them sharing photos of
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.200]   Themself playing frittany. We would like you to this is the first time I've heard a verifiable case of that
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.800]   This is the the the example everybody brings up
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:54.240]   But I've never ever heard this actually proposed so I think that that's really interesting
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.760]   So I've always said hey insurance companies don't care because
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.000]   When you fill out a form saying I don't do any of that stuff
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.120]   They hope you'll do that stuff because then they can and then they find out about it and then they can not give you insurance
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.560]   So in this case they're they've already paid out claims
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.720]   Ah, they're trying to get the money back
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:19.760]   So they're they're trying to show that fortune could made the claim is basically lying about whatever was wrong with them interesting
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:25.280]   So that's true in fact this company this guy said he wasn't sure he felt sort of ethically
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:30.720]   That it was a little questionable. He wasn't sure whether he was actually going to do it for these companies or not
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.520]   Oh, well, I mean, okay
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.520]   I'm I'm gonna make myself unpopular
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:40.880]   But if someone did lie on their insurance claim insurance fraud is a big deal that costs everybody
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   Fute still, you know
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:50.560]   Figuring that out would be yeah, ah, but it's one step removed from the next step, which is to non insurance
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:55.200]   Right, which is you posted photos of you eating hamburgers. So we're not gonna
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.840]   Heart attack yeah heart claims, right
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:04.240]   Right and that yes, I am or your friend was symptomatic not with diagnosed with MS
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.640]   But because it was your diagnosed thanks to a
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.600]   The Affordable Care Act then they can't they can't deny it, but if they could get pre-crime
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.720]   Pre-pre-diagnosis
[00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:19.520]   Bingo that's it's gonna happen. I guarantee you that they're they're trying to figure out how they could do that right now
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:23.600]   And that's I mean this is one of those things where we need we need better regulation
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.880]   I'm not
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:30.480]   Not a huge fan of getting the government involved, but this is not something we can solve. Yeah, you still have your British roots. I can tell
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:36.800]   Come to Canada. We got all kinds of regulations. You could say it's been a century, but no
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   No
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.040]   All right, let's take a little break. I am liking this panel
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:48.320]   I think we should do this for every week from now on matthew engram is here from fortune.com
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:54.400]   Stacey Higgin bossam from stacey on iot.com. I want to find out how we can subscribe to that stacey
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:58.000]   Just a second just go to that website. Okay, simple enough
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.640]   And let's not get just a bunch of guys going there. Okay, some women be nice because you could use it too
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:12.320]   And uh, do you cover things like the uh, amazon echo? I do that's a thing on the internet. Yeah, huge thing
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.680]   Yeah
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.280]   I was actually going to bring up the connected bluetooth pregnancy test that came out
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:23.680]   Yeah, it came out this week when we were talking about target good. Let's talk about that next. I saw your tweet about your echo
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.240]   allexa tells you you're pregnant
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.440]   It's not what you that what you want. I don't think
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.400]   Tell everyone else
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:37.040]   You like me to order a bassinet. Yes. I see you keep ordering pickles
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.160]   And ice cream. There's something you'd like to tell me
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.480]   Jeff Jarvis the real deal the one and only is also here
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:50.400]   From buzz machine dot com or show today brought to you by casper by my mattress. I slept so well last night
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.400]   Have you noticed? I don't know if you've noticed
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:57.920]   Uh, I look rested like you're looking you're looking refreshed. I'm always I've lost weight
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:01.280]   I'm feeling good and I think as we have learned
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:07.120]   how good how how well you sleep how good a night sleep you have
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.640]   Has a lot to do with your overall health and well-being
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:15.360]   So getting the right mattress can make a big difference now the problem
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:21.120]   I see is that you can't really find the right mattress by going to a mattress store and lying on a bunch of mattresses
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.720]   Broad daylight the sales person's looking at you kind of funny and you know you're kind of lying there in your shoes saying
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.720]   Oh, that's comfy. What do you think honey?
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.520]   The better way to do it would be get a mattress and sleep on it
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:35.440]   for days and nights and weeks and months and then
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.840]   Decide and that's what casper lets you do
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:45.440]   Live the dream the perfect mattress and by the way sheets and pillows too. I love my casper pillows
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:52.560]   Can be yours direct from the factory. These are great mattresses obsessively engineered mattresses made in the USA
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.160]   Sold direct to you so there's no middleman. There's no extra cost
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.760]   So it makes them very affordable and you have 100 nights
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:06.160]   To decide so you buy the mattress it comes in a surprisingly compact box by the way, which was great
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:08.880]   There's there's our box

[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.440]   So, um, I don't you know, I don't understand the manufacturer
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.240]   They might say on the on the website what the materials aren't stuff
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:43.360]   I always like down pillows. I was a down pillow guy for years
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.240]   But the problem with down pillows is to get weird after a while they get lumpy
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.640]   Uh, they they get flat
[00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.040]   So these are not down, but they're not like those rubber pillows either. I hate worse
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.400]   I hate rubber pillows. It's there's dude. I don't know what they're doing
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:02.080]   But these just like the mattresses have this kind of great mix of support but comfort
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.080]   Um
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.680]   It's it's really a great pillow and you can get and by the way get the king because it's huge
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:14.320]   It's a body pillow basically. So I really like I like cuddle up to my body pillow
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.040]   Um, this is
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.360]   TMI TMI. I'm not gonna marry it
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.440]   Uh, but
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.120]   So I I I'm telling you
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:28.400]   My whole life. It's had to be down pillows now completely completely changed
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.800]   This is the greatest always on the cool side of the pillow. Yes. Oh, there it is. See
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.520]   See like a little penguin
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.840]   No, it is and that's true by the way. It really does do that
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:43.920]   Read the reviews and listen to me because I have casper pillows and like I said, we fight over who gets the casper pill
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.600]   I need more
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:50.240]   I will check that out. I used to have pillows all the time. Yeah, I used to have six pillows on my bed
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.320]   Me and me and lisa and I have three pillows each
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.080]   And I now have two pillows because of the casper. I don't need six pillows
[00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:05.360]   They're really great pillows, but that's another story for another day casper.com/stwig promo code twig $50 if any mattress

[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.280]   Stacey higgin bottom is here first time on the show really nice to have you
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.800]   Thank you many many years at giga ohm
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.720]   and now doing stacey on iot
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:29.120]   And that is how often does that newsletter come out? It's weekly every friday it comes out and
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:36.240]   I think it's free. It's free. This is the sixth one. I know what how you can make money at that
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.600]   I'm hoping for advertisers. This is my my media empire plan. So we'll see what happens
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:45.840]   I've got a lot of endorsements and stuff, you know now she doesn't
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:51.600]   Sure. There are no endorsements appearances the internet of things you picked a great beat
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:58.240]   I'm really excited about the internet of things. This is good. You even do a show about the internet of things
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:01.920]   I do I have a podcast on the internet of things also weekly
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:07.680]   And it comes out on thursday's and basically my colleague kevin toffle it all we love kevin
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.360]   Everyone's kevin toffle. He's a regular also on the show
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:16.000]   So yeah, what you're saying is what you're saying is you only work once a week
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.800]   Ha I work all the time
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:25.360]   Like do you know how much time it's I spend on my house keeping everything operational? Yeah, I do know actually
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.800]   I know
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.720]   So it's tough, especially if you have the iot stuff that stuff will bring you down
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:36.960]   All the light bulbs in the oven that talks to you and stuff actually you have a your most recent podcast is about
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:43.920]   Ford bought a Tesla at a great expense they you know on retail and tore it down apparently
[00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:49.120]   And uh, I have to listen to this. What did Ford learn from the Tesla?
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.240]   I'll give you the sneak peek since we're about to publish next week's episode
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:59.040]   Um, they learned about updates that the big learning they have over the air updates over the air updates
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.080]   and
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.040]   How to how to communicate that with drivers and
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.080]   I feel like something else, but that was
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.720]   No, that's huge. I had a Ford Mustang for a long time
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:14.880]   And I never updated it even though there was an update process, but it required going to your computer downloading software
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:18.000]   Putting it on a usb stick as bringing it to your car
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.640]   Going through the menus which are arcane at best
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:28.640]   And uh, I never did it for that reason I remember being at um actually was a gig home conference
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.040]   That stacy was at i'm trying to remember which one now and I was talking to someone
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:37.840]   I can't remember who but the ceo of some big tech company it might have been
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.280]   So no, anyway, I can't remember if stacy was there
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:45.840]   But we were talking about tesla and the over the air updates and he said that he I think he was living in
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:51.440]   Europe or something and he said the car kept grounding out on the cobblestones
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.160]   The ground clearance was too low suspension problem
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.440]   So here's a suspension. Yeah, so he emailed dlon
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:01.680]   And he elon said i'll fix that and the next over the air update his car
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:08.240]   Cars ground clearance increased brilliant, but more than that. I think this is an internet of things issue as well
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.120]   Because we've talked about this on our security show
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.320]   Um when you start putting all these devices in your house and there will be security flaws
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:19.280]   I think of the ring doorbell which had a security flustle
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.720]   It could steal your doorbell and to do and from it get your internet
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:27.920]   Uh, you know your wi-fi password and your access codes and that would be a problem
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:30.640]   So before that was even published
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:37.120]   Ring updated it over the air and nobody even knew that they had this capability and if anybody's going to build an iot device
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.080]   If they don't build in all over the air updates
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.040]   Yeah, don't buy it once don't buy it
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   The the ford guys we talked actually about their security of the show
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:52.400]   But there's kind of two things to think about with over the air updates in the automotive world for the longest time
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.640]   They were verboten because they didn't have the security right measures in place
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.120]   And they didn't want to leave basically
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:03.600]   It's not an open port but the equivalent of a greater surface area for attack
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:05.840]   The other thing is
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.160]   For over the air updates to work just in general
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.520]   You have to actually build your device a little bit differently
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:13.920]   And this is like what's been happening with all the old school routers
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:18.080]   You have to make it so when you update the air and updates the software
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:24.720]   That the device doesn't have to be like turned off and rebooted and all of that and that's actually something you have to decide like at the very beginning
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.120]   so
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:30.560]   We're gonna see more of it, but you know the security stuff
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.640]   You've got to think about you've got to think about it from a design when you're building this stuff too. So
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.840]   It'll be a while
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:41.360]   Yeah, and I guess the president's limousine probably doesn't have
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:45.360]   Over the air updates, which would explain how it got stuck
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:50.880]   On a ramp in ireland. Did you see this video? Did it? No, yeah watch
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.600]   I saw them do a like 10 point turn in the middle of a road here comes this thing
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:58.720]   I mean it's armored so it weighs like 18 tons here it comes to be
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:07.600]   Stock
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:17.040]   So
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.040]   Let's show you again because it's just funny
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.200]   Um, I guess the president got out and pitch-hiked and they figured it out
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.480]   Um, have you ever done that? I think you get a tow truck is what you get
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:37.920]   It's gonna say do they have a special tow truck just for the presidential limo because that thing's like you said it's heavy
[00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.080]   Yeah, it's 40 tons. Yeah, everybody's getting out
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:47.840]   You don't want to be this driver. Oh, they should have those shock absorbers where they can inflate them or deflate them
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:51.040]   Or an ejection seat
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.640]   I'm sure they have an ejection seat. POTUS has been ejecting
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:46:00.320]   I want to keep watching and see if he suddenly flies out of the room
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:08.400]   The PR department steps in and has this man then move in front. Um, yeah, yeah, because they don't really want any more pictures here comes pOTUS
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:12.720]   That is quite embarrassing
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:15.760]   Yeah, let's just let's just block the view and uh
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:22.640]   Nobody usually they usually they drive those roots in in advance, but I guess maybe they didn't account for the ramp
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:28.960]   They didn't account for the president being in the back seat probably or maybe he's got an advisor who's a little heavier. Mm
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:35.360]   Chris christie was joining him for that particular. That's right. Oops. I wasn't gonna insult any particular person. I know I was rude
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:42.080]   I'm sorry. I apologize. You're nicer than I am stacy. I am very nice. Hey, uh, they are continuing by the way as we speak
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:44.080]   They're continuing the facebook
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:50.080]   earnings calls going on right now and as they do the earnings call we're learning some more information
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:59.840]   The total monthly active users is even higher than we said 1.65 billion
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.120]   1 billion monthly
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:06.480]   1 million daily active users on
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:09.600]   mobile
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:17.040]   That's not everywhere. That's mobile according to mark Zuckerberg more than 1 billion people have used facebook daily on mobile
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.680]   The average slightly below that
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:24.960]   They are also restructuring. They're adding a c-class of stock because mark wants to give away money
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.080]   And he doesn't want to dilute his
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:32.640]   Shares and the attitude of the management is look you like how we're running the company, right?
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:38.000]   Well, if you want us to keep running the company you have to have this new non voting class of stock
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.200]   Otherwise, we're gonna dilute mark shares
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:46.240]   He says I won't sell more than a billion dollars worth of stock a year
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.440]   Oh, wouldn't that be nice?
[00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.520]   Me neither. Wow. You got that pledge
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.840]   It's been amazing actually. This is something a lot of people don't
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.320]   Pay attention to I don't think but from the from the minute facebook went public
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:08.480]   Mark Zuckerberg effectively controls that company's kept controlling. Yeah, so not just through the stock he controls the board as well
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.760]   Because he's got proxy votes from a bunch of other co-founders
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:19.200]   So he and of course he named people to the board. So it's not just control this stock. It's effectively control of the entire
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:26.480]   Company going forward and as anybody who watches silicon valley, which is the tv show where I learn all about how this stuff works
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:31.280]   You can get out of that your board. Yeah, that's just like hooli. You don't want to get
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:35.280]   By the way nucleus he closed. Oh, I'm sorry. That's a spoiler. No
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:45.120]   They also said the game of thrones 360 degree video that was put up on facebook last week has drawn more viewers than any video
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.120]   They've ever shown before
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:50.320]   Uh, they also
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:58.000]   Said that they will be that gave an advise an advisory just as apple did last quarter that they can't continue to grow at this pace
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.440]   Because pretty soon everybody would be a member of facebook
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.880]   Yep, um, but they said this is a way off
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:12.320]   This is a way of video watching on instagram up 40 percent year over year. This is charell sandberg c o o now on the call
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:16.080]   Um, that's incredible net income
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.120]   1.5 billion
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:22.240]   Was double what it made during the same period a year
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:27.280]   Wow, that's so kind of company that size. Yeah double. That's
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:30.560]   Double. I mean apples the only one I can think of that's done that
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:38.800]   It really is mind-boggling the addition of leap day this year. This is how this is how much money they make
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.320]   Added 2 percent to this year's returns
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:45.040]   What extra day? Yeah
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:54.320]   In relation to last year. So, you know, yeah, we made more this year, but there was leap day. Don't forget
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:58.800]   Uh average, but this is a big one the average price per ad up
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:04.640]   5 percent in the first quarter alone impressions up 50 percent
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:07.600]   Whereas I remember Google's
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.920]   Price per ad is dropping down
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:12.400]   falling
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.400]   That's that branding versus
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.120]   Tactical exactly you're on to it programmatic. Yeah
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:21.200]   So leo have they reached out to you to offer to pay you to do um
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.600]   Facebook live
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:29.280]   No, I know Jeff you've been you're all in on Facebook live. How about you? Oh god pay me. No, Kristin
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.560]   They don't have to pay us. We'll do it anyway because we're yeah
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:34.480]   Police for the whores
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:40.000]   So I did buy that me vote camera that you talked about Jeff and we shot we saw that at nab last week and uh
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.160]   What you did what you think of it in person?
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.800]   Gotta be pretty interesting
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.440]   It's from live stream these guys know what they're doing
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:53.200]   And uh, you know, I think it's I haven't got it yet, but uh, the demo is very impressive
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:56.880]   You can use an iPad. This is the camera that has 150 degree
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.600]   View 4k view
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.480]   But streams 1080p that means you can use any
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:07.920]   Portion of the screen as the current screen so it allows with one camera that doesn't move
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:10.080]   not only can you
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:16.560]   Switch and you switch on an iphone or an ipad which is wild, but it can also do face tracking so you can move around
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:21.520]   And it will it will it's like there's a camera operator will pan. Yeah, how much is it?
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:28.800]   Uh, three nine now three nine nine. Yeah soon. Wow. That's amazing breakthrough breakthrough. I'm telling you
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.920]   telling you there's uh
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:36.240]   Facebook lives are very interesting. Would you would you use that for for not for shows?
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:41.680]   I don't think facebook live lends itself to the kind of shows we do well. Would that would that camera?
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:44.000]   Um
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:50.080]   Once another discussion is that's interesting. I think I think there is a chance for interactivity through facebook live and and new discovery in new
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.080]   audience and the live part
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:57.120]   That you've discovered, you know as just one element, you know a small element but an element in the show
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:02.640]   I think also works on facebook live, but there's a different question is the output of that camera
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:07.440]   It's designed for facebook live, but it didn't have to be facebook live. No, no in fact you could stream a live stream as well
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:14.320]   Right so only those two could record it and and so the question is it becomes an incredibly cheap location talk show
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:20.480]   Hey, right. Yeah, we'll see. I'll have to use it. Yeah, I know we'll see but it'll be really interesting
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.640]   Yeah for my students
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:26.160]   To be able to produce a show just using it. Yeah, and I wasn't focusing on that
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:30.720]   I mean, I really think the most interesting thing is facebook live itself is a platform for broad fast
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:37.520]   Uh, and you know it's funny because twitter in their quarterly results talked about the
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:44.160]   Periscope and uh, I think that I have to look at the numbers, but I have a feeling
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.200]   I seem to remember that that isn't particularly holding up very well
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:54.640]   Facebook's gonna eat them alive and it's funny because they had the first first mover advantage twitter did with periscope
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.720]   Yeah, but they just don't have the scale
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:01.440]   Yeah, they don't have a messenger. They don't have any daily users. Yeah messenger. What's uh, I mean
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:06.240]   They are getting ad revenue twitter is getting ad revenue out of periscope, so
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:11.600]   What if facebook came to you leo and said we'll pay you 250 grand?
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:16.560]   I think that's their current offer to some content creators really to use facebook live. What'd you do it?
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:19.360]   Well, it's you mean exclusively
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:27.040]   I don't think it's exclusive. It says 250 000 for who's 20 live video post proof. What?
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:32.720]   They're paying a lot more than that to buzzfeed. Uh, maybe they are. I don't know
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.600]   For the watermelon videos
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.200]   Yeah
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:42.640]   Oh man, I'm in the wrong distance. If I were facebook, I would I would really be reluctant to pay anybody anything
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.760]   The argument is they're they're um
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:53.520]   Mimicking the revenue that they presume to get right? Oh, because you can't put ads in it
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.800]   Not yet when they would figure out advertising they believe that
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:02.240]   These these producers will end up making more and it's the way to get a critical mass
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:07.280]   That would be audience that would be a problem for me because I'd be replacing existing ad revenue, right?
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:11.120]   Well, yeah, that's for that for that. So I might create a new show
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:17.280]   I know you were thinking jeff of doing the the new show, which by the way is currently invaded the dot nyc show out of the cuney
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   Studios it looked great this morning. I the video quality was superb
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:26.080]   Yeah, the other guys didn't go and ask us to pay you a quarter million dollars. So for the rights to stream
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:30.880]   Hey, hey, hey, let me put it this way facebook comes along and does off you that take it
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.520]   Take it
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:38.080]   Uh, that's 20 shows a month. That was a lot. That's four shows a week. I mean five shows a week
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.280]   That's a daily basically a daily show doesn't have to be a show
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:48.960]   Could just be a post well, it could yeah, so tell I can't imagine people going into their facebook page and sitting for half an hour to watch a show
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.240]   Can you?
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:55.680]   I think it's ready for short form more personal stuff. I think yeah, it's it's I go a couple things
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.920]   One is facebook allegedly is gonna like leave a leave a video screen on your screen at all the times
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:06.560]   Right, holy, don't worry. I'm not sure but second I keep on going to the story of lonay Ramos from would have is yolm who
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:10.320]   Uh did for
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:14.640]   Broadcast from the new Hampshire primary adding up to 75 minutes four and a half billion views
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.880]   Now how long they were I don't know good point, but people now
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:22.160]   And there's also the issue of how facebook counts views right?
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.880]   I was three seconds a few is you scrolling by it
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:32.400]   Three seconds so I just viewed this uh this video by scrolling by it. I just viewed this video by scrolling by it
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.320]   Did I get anything out of it? No
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:39.520]   But imagine if there was a sort of video player sitting up in the corner you could watch a show
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:42.000]   And be scrolling through your feet at the same time
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.400]   Are you know our experiences that people we make all of our shows our video can be streamed live or watched as video later
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:52.800]   It's still a fraction of the total audience unless a show is particularly visual
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.240]   Most people have time for audio podcasts
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:59.360]   But not for video
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:02.800]   There's all especially with gadgets. There's a big opportunity though. I mean
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.600]   Well, look at what Fox or look at vox is doing, right?
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:11.440]   Yeah, because that needs video you're right you're right Stacy because you want to see that
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:17.120]   Yeah, right. But here's the difference if you put a gadget video on youtube
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:21.280]   You're going to get such a huge amount of traffic from search
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:26.000]   Will you get the same traffic on facebook from search?
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.720]   It depends on who like if you've got if you're a page that has
[00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:38.320]   A million people then probably yes. I mean I can we just launched a facebook page for my stuff and
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:44.880]   The amplification is really impressive. I mean and we're starting from a teensy etsy bitsy base
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:49.200]   Um, so if you're like the new york times or someone I got to think that you can do super well
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:54.880]   What you don't get though is the data you don't get your user data and you don't know who's watching it again
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:57.760]   You're basically sacrificing all of that information
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:01.040]   Yeah, we're gonna get great promotion within facebook
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.920]   Yeah, and we know the only reason we want data is we want numbers for advertising and I gather we wouldn't
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:12.160]   Although they've said this is the the vox blog circuit breaker. It's it does have a presence on the vox
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.800]   On the
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:20.240]   For a second stay with us because I I read that vox was going to do a facebook only blog
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.960]   I get all happy, you know, let's try this out folks in media
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:25.840]   I'm an arguing to meet a company to try this vox is ahead of it. They do it
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:29.840]   So then I look at it and I click on something it goes to a web page on
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:35.840]   And I get all upset. I said what that was the big deal, but of course, I'm an old fart who still uses a laptop
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:40.560]   Uh if you use a mobile, no, it is fully and instant articles
[00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:45.440]   It's an here's the funny thing. I had a long conversation with john herman now the new york times and twitter about this
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:50.800]   Trying to get my head around this where the problem is I think with the architecture of instant articles right now
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:52.480]   Correct me if i'm wrong
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:56.000]   Is that there's basically an rss feed there has to be a web
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:59.680]   But there has to be a web page for the old farts
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:05.280]   And so you you don't really experience it totally on facebook which I think is kind of silly at facebook
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.120]   I think they should create something
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:13.440]   But the short term answers are questioned at least for that kind of content leo because you end up having to have a website and that has
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.000]   um seo then
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.240]   Yeah, but they said the focus is basically facebook
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:25.440]   But it's straight from facebook right custom video that only exists on facebook is it streamed from your
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:30.480]   From your website is it streamed from facebook and stream from facebook isn't yeah, you posted on facebook
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.560]   so what you don't get is
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:34.240]   uh
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.760]   numbers that have
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:39.680]   You get facebook numbers is all you get is whatever facebook dains to give you
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:45.040]   Which to my knowledge so far is nothing so that wouldn't be any help at all
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:47.680]   It's selling
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:52.880]   uh advertising for us even if they allow it apparently they do allow it right or is sir
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:54.880]   Yeah, is there ads are there ads?
[00:58:54.880 --> 00:58:58.240]   Oh, yeah, there's ads there and and you keep on it was on the revenue if you sell it
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:01.600]   Um and you can do ecommerce as well. You can do affiliate links
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:04.400]   And you can do video ads there
[00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:09.600]   That's fairly trying to imagine trying to imagine the facebook's 9 billion
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.000]   video views or whatever
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   Imagine when they do turn on
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.720]   Video ads just i'm trying to picture that now
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:19.840]   What is going to happen?
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:20.880]   I mean the
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.920]   Abandoned of ad revenue is going to be mind boggling. Yeah
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:27.600]   Well, you'd be nuts not to take advantage of this platform
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:31.760]   But you'd also be nuts not to protect yourself because it isn't your platform
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:35.360]   right, right which is which is the the sort of
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.480]   tension that media companies are wrestling with a
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:42.560]   Everyone wants to be on there because you've got access to billions of people
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:50.800]   But it's a black box facebook gets to control who sees your content and when the algorithm runs in ways that we don't understand
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.240]   Um, so this is a this is a show that was live
[00:59:54.240 --> 01:00:01.360]   Essentially a video podcast. I don't see this kind of stuff doing very well. I agree with you stacey if you're showing me
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.720]   Which I don't see them doing a video of a product
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:11.600]   You know like a mark as here. Here's one a mark has brownly style review. This is the phillips hues stuff and they're doing it right
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.200]   the uh
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.720]   AJ style
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.960]   Capturing even though I don't have the sound turned on
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.680]   all of that
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.560]   Yeah, Kevin and I are looking at doing something like that for like as an adjunct to the podcast
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:30.800]   Yeah, because we talk about all this stuff. It's just I gotta learn to edit video. This is non trivial video production. I should point
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.320]   Right
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.680]   That's nancy
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.640]   But some of that's phillips b-roll. I think you need
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.280]   Oh sure it is
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.120]   There's still you have to you have to edit it and put it together and put captions on it
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.520]   I don't even need to go for a sort of sham wow kind of thing you and Kevin
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:50.560]   No production values. I think I fit totally in the sham wow mode. I'm like, yeah
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:53.360]   Well, this is what I kind of think this
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:58.640]   In my opinion what would fit this meat you have to make your content fit the medium, right?
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.240]   Is I mean these should be short. They should be punchy
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:06.880]   They should be emotional and interesting like viral videos in general
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.200]   Uh
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:14.560]   Certainly anything the kind of content I do is not well suited to this at all if you ask me
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.520]   I don't care if this persistent video screen or not. That's not what people want on their facebook feed
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.760]   They want viral hits
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:25.360]   But it might become what they want. Yeah, I mean, it's hard to tell what people are going to do
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.760]   with video
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.760]   I mean, I look at things like
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.040]   Snapchat
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:31.840]   and
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:33.840]   I'm constantly kind of
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:36.560]   Reminding myself that I
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.120]   Suck at predicting what people are going to do and that's true
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:43.920]   And so I look at things like snapchat and I think no one's ever going to do that and then as it turns out
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:46.160]   Hundreds of millions of people are going to do that
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.520]   If I were facebook and lord knows i'm not that lucky in life
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.600]   um
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:55.120]   Versus that you know google did it's it's european black male funded media
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:02:00.480]   I would I would uh do an investment fund where facebook doesn't own the context
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.200]   Because you can't do that I really believe that but that says well
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:08.320]   This is basically a venture fund come start a new media property on facebook entirely you won't have to do production
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.160]   You won't have to do you know who did that?
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.560]   Sales and who did that youtube how does that work? How'd that work for you?
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.800]   Exactly remember that hundred million dollars
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:19.600]   Yep
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.400]   Remember that they went to brands they had the youtube studios they didn't work out
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:29.600]   I know they gave out a hundred million dollars different that's right that was that was going to big brands trying to do this
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.320]   I would say well, that wasn't just big rims it was geek and sundry
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:36.080]   Uh a lot of people's my size uh did it
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:45.120]   Yeah, the problem was that youtube didn't have the social layer right that facebook has well people use your people live on facebook
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:49.920]   They don't make people do live on do they live on well trolls live on youtube leaving horror comments
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:55.440]   I don't know my kids live on youtube, but they know what they're looking at they're looking at music right
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:05.280]   Yeah, mine's watching minecraft videos or minecraft videos right minus two. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, michael our 13 year old will watch minecraft videos just auto play through
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.200]   Yeah, yeah
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.240]   That's his tv he never watches tv. I've never seen him watch tv
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.880]   It's yeah, my daughter. I can only watch tv
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.760]   Years after it's been on tv
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:21.520]   So they're currently watching I think the office like the first year. Oh how fun I envied I
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:24.800]   So it's like everything is
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:31.120]   I mentioned it in at the journalism thing in peruja. It's like everything has become unstuck in time
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:35.360]   So time has no meaning anymore. They're watching shows and
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:42.720]   Videos and listening to music that it might be from six months ago. It might be from five years ago. It might be it has no
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.880]   Time has no impact
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.240]   No
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:52.480]   That's okay. I'm going to take it back to twitter just because I feel obligated to but that's kind of one of the downsides with
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:57.600]   Periscope on twitter is it only lives there for 24 hours. So you're like oh
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:03.200]   Correct. I wish I could have seen that. Yeah, but it's over. Well, isn't but okay facebook's a stream too
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.840]   I mean, you don't go how far down do you go on facebook?
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:12.240]   I don't spend a lot of time on facebook. I don't know how long their video their live videos last
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:16.960]   Oh, they last but they grow they scroll off like just like twitter does they
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:23.680]   But you can find them at the algorithm shows them too. I don't I would be willing to get you could find them in other
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:27.120]   I mean, I guess you could find twitter stuff too. Where you go to the person's page
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:32.320]   And all their video. Okay, if you go to their page, then there's less noise, but still scrolls off
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:37.680]   I I feel like that's not how people are going to use facebook again. I I'm probably as bad as you know
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.680]   You're guessing we're old use anything we're old but I think that they
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.720]   My guess would be that and this is what we learned on twitter
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:49.280]   By the way is you don't try to see everything you just go and you you dip in and you dip out
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:54.080]   And then whatever's there is there and whenever's and facebook and facebook knows this
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:05:00.080]   That's why they spend so much time curating the algorithm. I'm terrible at that. I actually you read try to scroll back
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.240]   That's because you're old
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:08.400]   I'm kind of a complete about like I missed something. What if I missed something you haven't gotten over that yet?
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:14.800]   No, it's like Matthew's value ad though. I mean if you follow Matthew on twitter, you're gonna know exactly what's happening last week
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:25.440]   My daughter is following me again in fact, don't we get angry when we see stuff we already saw on facebook
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:32.000]   That was last week's meme. What are you talking about the dress for or no one from four months ago? That's even worse
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.800]   Yeah, but seriously so that confirms what I'm saying, which is and that's what the latest you don't
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:42.720]   I'm sorry. Go ahead. It's like a glitch in the matrix like it's the algorithm is yeah
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:47.040]   Glitching somehow. No, it's because someone one of your friends reshared
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.200]   Well, what does that mean for anyone who's trying to I mean
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:57.680]   I'm just thinking about like creating a gadget review on that, you know, how then do people find the gadget reviews?
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:05.840]   That's what I'm saying. That's why youtube is a better platform for that and there and get and the seo on gadget reviews on youtube is very good
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:10.160]   You should you know, you should do reviews the phillips hue lights
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:13.040]   You won't believe what happened when we turned them on
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:20.400]   And and and and the seo and actually the seo doesn't matter about you won't believe what happened what that's facebook
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:26.160]   What matters is the cue that the the key words of cue lights people certain
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:32.560]   Because on google you go to google and you say I want to know about the latest sony a7
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:38.960]   R s2 camera and you're gonna see youtube videos actually i'm not but
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:42.160]   Normally you would see youtube videos in a carousel right at the top
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:49.200]   Mm-hmm, uh, and that's how people find their gadget reviews. That's why gadget reviews on youtube are so strong right now
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:53.760]   But facebook you're at the mercy of the algorithm they decide
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:01.840]   Whether they show people your clip or not based on criteria. We don't understand. I just prove myself completely wrong because it's not working
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:09.440]   You picked a really esoteric. Okay, I guess so I guess so you know I know what it is htc 10
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:17.040]   Review about that because that's what people would search for now. I get the guardian and there's youtube
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.640]   Yeah
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:24.080]   No carousel though. No carousel, but that's just weird, but but seriously, that's very likely where you're gonna go
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:30.000]   I don't even care who that is. I don't even I may not even know who did this review. Right. It's not about brand at all
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.320]   So
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.560]   Well, and in a way, that's kind of the problem
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:42.560]   Broaders broadly speaking with media right now as a whole a lot of it comes through
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:49.280]   platforms like facebook and google and twitter right and that's why people have no clue
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:55.920]   Right who the person is what like why they created it what else they do these these
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:58.560]   bits of content just show up
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:02.240]   And there's no context and there's and maybe they enjoy them or not
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:07.520]   But they enjoy them on the platform and they don't click and they don't go to where the thing came from
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:13.040]   Why do you think we we do youtube but we don't spend any it's we don't count on it at all
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.160]   Because that's not for a brand like ours
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:22.560]   That's not where the traffic is going to come from right going to come from people who seek us out by brand
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:26.160]   Which is probably so old school that we'll die any minute
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:32.560]   No, it's coming back though like it's so old school that it's probably coming back. I got some
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:38.880]   Yeah, I got some great. It's like yeah floodpants and because because the only way
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.520]   For people to find your stuff
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.720]   Is is through something approaching word of mouth right and maybe that word of mouth comes through other
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.680]   platforms, but the content consumption
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:58.560]   Can't all happen on those platforms or you effectively get nothing and that's why I am always really kind of nervous about the power that
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.200]   Google and facebook wheeled in this space
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:08.880]   Well in in the lineup. I think there's something about amp pages showing up in the google news caris gotten worse and worse
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:12.000]   I'm you know what Jeff's not worse. That's that's that's better
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:20.000]   Amps stuff to start showing up in the carousel much the model is me what I want to see is amp showing up for the blue links
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.560]   Then anything news the app amps should should link it shouldn't know we don't want Jeff you're misunderstanding
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:30.960]   You don't want that you do what this is is google is continuing to do what I was very worried
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:36.800]   They would do which is favor amp content. They favor fast content. No, they do not
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:41.920]   That's a guy because of the right here we are here
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:48.240]   They've the problem is that the carousel favors amp content
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:52.960]   Well now google news favors amp content. Well, that's another carousel. They just have the carousel
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:56.400]   Right fortunately google news doesn't important at all but
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:03.520]   Is that is that is that any fast content should be favored including blue links? Well google even says
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.280]   Fast is nice, but it's not a huge signal for us
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:14.480]   Amps I've said that to them is clearly a huge signal because they're not favoring fast. They're favoring amp
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.640]   Yeah, and they said I have this discussion and I defended google against that charge
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:23.600]   We're just favoring amp but the but then they say oh we don't but the fact though the carousel is
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.920]   And the carousel is promoted ergo. Yes, google promotes amp
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:31.520]   Especially and they've got to fix that and now they're doing it news
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.960]   Which you know was exactly the thing I was worried about frankly
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.920]   Rollouts the next step so they're also gonna roll out the blue actually must be doing on the phone
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.120]   You're right stacy because I don't see it on my desktop, but
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:48.480]   Who uses google news on mobile then I mean it's no, but I'm just thinking about
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:55.680]   In the google google now the stories they promote right those aren't amp yet and most people aren't looking
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:59.680]   They will be the web no I'm saying most people aren't looking on the web
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:03.920]   So no no google now would be a really good place to put it wouldn't let me just see if we're getting am
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   Well, yeah, I'm not getting up there. Yeah, I don't know. I don't see it there. They're
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.880]   You and how long before google does that right? That's my problem. Well, here's what i mean
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:17.760]   With ampeleo it's again. I've said this before it's not about news. It's about a faster web
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:24.560]   And amp was gonna spread past the news business and past google news and past everything and it's gonna become a standard for faster web
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:30.400]   Period. I hope so. I hope so. I mean the best part about amp is that it's open. I mean that to me
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:37.280]   That's not just a sales pitch. You know, that's that is one of the benefits compared to say facebook in sine articles where
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.680]   So I have a very fast web page because I don't have any ad tech on my web page at all
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:45.200]   And we've done everything we can to optimize the web page blah blah blah
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.800]   Should I I have to now go amp just because I want to be uh, uh priority on google
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.440]   That's what that's what i'm saying is that well that's bs
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.840]   They should be sued
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:12:02.000]   A speed stand has a monopolistic attitude and however you reach that speed stand. Oh, that's fine. Oh, yeah, but that's not what they're
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.840]   They should do. I'm trying to i'm reading this article. I'm not clear on whether they have changed it
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:14.800]   Originally it was just based on speed and so if you achieve that speed through your own tricks or you achieve
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.760]   No, then you get preferred
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:25.680]   Is ampele yes because matthew i defend because the accusation was made they were gonna favor amp and I went to google
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.080]   Wontick jingress and he said no
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:30.240]   We favor speed
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:36.560]   Right, but that didn't count the carousel because the carousel was there in the beta days to showcase what amp could do
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.840]   Oh, fine
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.480]   But now amp is the soul gonna be all uh
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:45.600]   Structure for amp and that's that's not good. That's not what it should be it should be a standard for speed
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.480]   That you can meet multiple ways and amp is one way to meet it
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.080]   And then i'm fine with it
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:55.440]   And and it needs to be a truly open standard with open governments which they're getting to but the sooner they get to it the better
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.160]   well congratulations because
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:06.800]   according to ronin who is at mobi forge the average web page is now bigger than the down mode for doom
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:15.440]   The original install for the original install for doom, which was uh what 2.2 megabytes that can't be right
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:21.440]   My wasn't 22 megabytes is now the average web page has increased in size. This graph goes from
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:28.320]   beginning of the 2011 to the present to the point where it's crossing that that the doom line so funny
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:34.000]   So what is the point of the side
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.520]   uh
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.520]   Let's see
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:42.880]   The guy also pointed at every web page size is shrinking so it is it's not
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:50.480]   Growing that chart you just scroll past shows it's now shrinking and it's actually getting better the gray our top 10 sites
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.520]   So it's getting better in the top 10 sites, but the yellow
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:58.720]   This is by a lexa rank, which is a questionable ranking, but the yellow is all sites
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:04.240]   So only it's only getting better on the top 10 sites right because they're paying more attention
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.120]   I think uh
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:10.480]   He doesn't say but I think it's 22 megabytes. Does that sound right?
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.440]   That sounds really
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.840]   Really large actually
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:19.120]   No megabytes that's huge
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:23.040]   Yeah, wait a minute. Let's see why doesn't he say what the average size
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.760]   In kilobytes
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:29.200]   2,250 2.2 megabytes which fits because that's better okay
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.640]   Just one you're better at math than I am saying or zeros
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.880]   I hate zeros
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:40.720]   But that's I mean that's epic when you think about like mobile data consumption. Yeah and everything. Yeah
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.760]   So
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.680]   So that is kind of depressing news
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:51.520]   And now you understand some good news. Yes. You want to talk about the Comcast data cap expansion?
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.880]   share me up
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:54.400]   because today
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:59.520]   Comcast said that they're going to raise their data cap they hate when we call it data cap, but that
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.200]   It is
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:05.680]   They're gonna raise it to a terabyte from 300 gigabytes from 300
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:10.000]   um when they introduced it in like 2008 it was 250 and then
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.400]   People kept consuming more internet and they were like we're not gonna move it. We're not gonna move it
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.640]   And then they got kind of in trouble for some
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.680]   Streaming practices so they moved it up to 300 and we're like we're gonna try a bunch of different things
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:28.560]   And now today the day after the FCC was like yo charter time or
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:31.280]   No data caps for you
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:34.080]   So this is big. I'm excited
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.600]   Uh
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.000]   Yeah, and a terabyte is probably enough
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:44.480]   I guarantee any year people will be complaining that a terabyte is so the issue really is that Comcast is in the business
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.800]   of selling you premium content over cable and what they don't like is
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:52.480]   People buying downloading premium content over the internet
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:58.560]   Right and uh so you can still do along with this they raise the cost of unlimited data
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:04.000]   And they raise the well actually the average fees are still $10 for each additional 50 gigabytes
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:10.160]   Uh and you it was 50 for unlimited in one of their trial markets. Oh, okay
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:16.000]   It was so it says after the june first change. This is the yards technica article by john broadkin
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.520]   After the june first change fewer customers will need to buy limited data
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:25.040]   But when the unlimited data, but when they do it'll cost them 50 bucks a month to do so instead of 30 or 35
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:30.880]   So what's happened? Of course is that the cost of internet access has gone up
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:37.280]   In a clear attempt to make it the same of revenue as buying premium content over cable
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:42.720]   So that it doesn't matter and you're a court cutter right stacy. I am. Does it save you money?
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:46.560]   Actually, it probably doesn't
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.800]   Now if you guarantee you it doesn't if you watch anything
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.680]   Well, we don't watch a lot of tv
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:55.280]   But I was just thinking that we're with google fiber and everything coming to austin
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.720]   We're actually getting
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:04.240]   Not competitive rates on broadband, but they're tossing in over the top tv for like 50 to a like 50 to 60 bucks a month additional
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:10.560]   Which buying a hulu amazon and netflix i mean amazon prime is kind of you would do that anyway
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.760]   But buying those plus any other shows is kind of like oh
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:19.360]   So you so you are buying the netflix you are buying some over the top stream i'm paper
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:21.280]   hulu
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:27.440]   Netflix and the amazon prime so i get amazon video and i'm actually looking at doing like a stars or hbo
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:33.200]   Right just be on now or yeah, so that it's kind of all be the same as cable seems like it would add up
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:36.960]   You've got about 30 bucks a month now in over the top fees
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:39.520]   right, but
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:45.440]   Yes, and my husband subscribes to mlb live which is like that's really it's like $300. Yeah
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:53.600]   I wonder if you really I mean nobody wants to do this math, but i'm i'm sure there's an actuary at
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.480]   Comcast who was doing the math in total order for sure
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:01.360]   And if you I mean if you buy like shows, but i'm one of the i'm like your kids matthew
[01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:08.640]   I watch things out of stream out of time. I even go to the library and read DVDs. It's crazy. I know old school
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.520]   But i'm cheap
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.040]   Are you kids little?
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:19.440]   I've got a nine-year-old. Okay, so she's still watching like not barny, but bandy maybe
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.920]   She would be so insulted
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:26.240]   She's watching game of thrones. No, she's not
[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.920]   She is not stacy is a much better mother than that. I can tell you right now
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:33.360]   Parent she's watching she really is she watches these
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:40.080]   I'm astonished by them these minecraft videos where they take like red versus blue. I don't know. Yeah, red versus blue
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:45.760]   She watches that yeah, yeah, I shouldn't watch actually red versus that's old school, but like red versus blue
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:49.440]   No, my son 13 year olds been watching those since he was nine
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:55.360]   It's it's dopey stuff. It's like you're watching somebody play a game and then they and then and they're
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:00.000]   They're saying do their narration over it. Yeah, it's really dopey stuff
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:05.040]   But obviously it's fun to watch the kids love it. Yeah. Do you enjoy it? Matthew?
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:11.680]   I've I enjoy it sometimes when I see someone like a nephew or my daughter watching it
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:16.800]   I mean, it's totally stupid, but it's not any stupider than the saturday morning cartoons. I used to watch
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:19.120]   I guess you're right. I'm like a lotion
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:25.120]   Like whenever you're in a waiting room and they've got like the decision channel in it's pretty dumb. Isn't it? Yeah, it's dumb and it's sexist
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.400]   Right. So yes, this may not be sexist
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:32.080]   But it probably has got a lot of profanity. It's probably profanity waste
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:35.760]   Well, my daughter is still at nine. She's very she's not allowed
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:40.880]   Well, no, I was gonna say she's very um, what I don't know the word judgmental of
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:46.240]   Yes, yes, she's just like nothing more than not judgmental than a nine. That'll change. Yeah, that
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:51.840]   Should go the other way completely. It's funny though. I could tell michael loves it. He chortles. I hear him chortling
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:57.200]   Much more than I ever did at sunday morning or saturday morning cartoons. I mean he
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:59.120]   Oh
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:04.880]   My uh, my older daughter who's uh in her 20s watches twitch all the time
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:09.280]   And youtube videos and they're all gameplay. So it's all
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:13.120]   People either playing games or talking about playing games
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:19.600]   Um, she watches shows that i have never heard of right from the rooster teeth network and rooster teeth
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:24.480]   Blue. Yeah, it's incredible. No, that's machinima. Yeah. Yeah, these guys are very
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.120]   Savvy adults making programming for kids
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.680]   I think I mean
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:37.280]   My daughter wants to create her own with her friends and if you think about twitch and
[01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:44.160]   She's just like the next generation or the next network for kids not just for gameplay, but just for like hey, i'm gonna make a cheesy
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.160]   show
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.760]   I watched a
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.760]   Have you seen there's a uh
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.960]   girl who's 12? I think I can't i'm trying to remember her name
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:54.560]   um
[01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:56.560]   And she does a show
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:58.960]   About games obviously
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:02.640]   Her show I would watch that show like it's not for
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:09.920]   12 year olds per se it's just for people who love games that she's really well like I don't know if her parents are
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:14.240]   In you know the movie business or tv business, but she's really
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:16.160]   Articulate
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:22.080]   Um, it's like it's a great show and she created it as far as I can tell all by herself. Oh, yeah
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:28.640]   I'm I'm frustrated because I love Minecraft, but all of the good Minecraft content is in video, which is so hard to consume
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:32.160]   I don't want to watch those videos is when I read it. I'm so old fashioned
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:39.120]   They have those books bestseller in the elementary school fairs for dummies. I just read the Minecraft wiki
[01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:47.200]   Uh, let's take a break come back with more stacey higgin bottom is here batham is here from stacey on iot jeff jarris buzz machine.com
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.840]   I thought you might have had a heart attack. I was worried. It'd be very quiet game stuff
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:56.800]   Yeah, I got nothing to say
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:01.520]   It's like the old old days of twit when you say there's a new monitor out it has a
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:05.760]   476 giga hertz that I would just sit there and wait till it's over
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:11.200]   Well, I'm sorry pick a story and you can you can no no no no no next story

[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:19.200]   So I figure it's good if other people this gives other people a chance to be heard and that's good
[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.720]   Nice. So no, you should pick topics, but which I have absolutely nothing to say

[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:51.440]   Our show today brought to you by texture if you like magazines
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:58.080]   I used to love magazines. In fact, there was but the problem was it's very it's an expensive habit and it clutters your home
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:03.120]   Uh, you know, I they're pretty much as always one article every month in
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:09.440]   I was going to say s square, but there's never anything I ever want to read in s square. However in rolling stone
[01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:14.480]   Or wired, you know, there's always one article. I always want to read
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:18.560]   And then you know, there's the you know, sometimes I like to look at the gossip magazines
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:24.640]   I don't want to really buy one, but you know if you if you buy rolling stone and wired and vanity fair every month
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:30.080]   That's going to cost you like 15 20 bucks expensive. Oh, you're going to subscribe
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:35.520]   Well, the problem is you're subscribing to this magazine for one article a month. That's that like it doesn't make sense

[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.720]   And sometimes you lose the app remote
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.760]   But you never lose your phone. You always know where your phone is
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:06.160]   I have remotes for every I even have remotes for like my onkyo ar
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:09.280]   AV receiver. I have
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:12.240]   All sorts of stuff in here
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:13.920]   I like my remotes
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:18.720]   Also, I have a whole folder remote software. Oh wow. I know that's quite a pain though
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:21.120]   Cause then you've got to get your phone. You got to get your software
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:25.200]   So I'll use the I know I'll use the remote if I've got the remote there
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.680]   But but it's nice to have kind of a guaranteed access because there's nothing worse
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.720]   They're getting up and changing something. Yeah, don't you hate that? No, there's other
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.680]   words than wanting to get up and change something and not being able to
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:41.840]   Right, you're stuck watching what's on because you can't find the remote
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:45.680]   That that's a real problem
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:48.720]   All right. I watch a lot of tv. Please don't judge me
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:50.320]   I
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:53.200]   I'm not channeling my internet show. I love the culture
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.640]   It's the culture. Hey, Stacy. I was gonna ask you about
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:04.320]   I think this is in the lineup when when NEST said it was gonna deprecate the was it revolved?
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:06.080]   The revolved, yeah
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.520]   Oh, yeah, do you have any thoughts on that?
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:10.240]   Did you not read my medium post?
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:14.080]   I want to hear what Stacy said. I did read your post
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:16.720]   So I think
[01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:20.560]   I think it's a black eye for the industry. Yes. I think they could have handled it much better
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:25.440]   Uh, I I talked to a bunch of people to find out how they sunsetted their devices
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:31.440]   The options out there right now are creating like escrow for your code and open sourcing it
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:35.360]   Um, they did that for how I can't think of the device right now
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:39.600]   They've done it for a couple devices and then you've got these like die-hard engineers who work with it
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:43.760]   And they'll keep smart things smart things did that they move to a new hub
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:50.640]   But they didn't kill the old hub. They didn't kill the old hub smart things is kind of a wacky situation right now because they had some issues
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.720]   um, but
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:54.480]   there there's also
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:59.280]   There's a couple things they they didn't communicate well with their users. They didn't say hey
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:03.600]   We're sorry. This is going to happen when they originally did the deal
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.880]   They didn't say they were going to shut it down when they decided to shut it down
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:11.440]   They didn't actually tell everybody I I had a revolve as a review user
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:17.600]   And I actually didn't get a notice from them until like two days after all the kerfuffle started
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.680]   so
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:22.320]   Whatever notification they were doing was really wretched
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.880]   um, which is
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.880]   Why everyone was pissed?
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:30.160]   and
[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:34.960]   I understand why they had to kill it. It's just the way they communicated it the way they
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.240]   refused to open it up all of those things are kind of
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:41.680]   Just stupid. It's arrogant
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:50.160]   I the other thing I liked about this piece is it revealed that stacey has a bizarre penchant for weird connected devices
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:55.680]   Like the burg printer. Oh, that was the one that was open sourced if you go to jit
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:58.080]   there's still
[01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:00.080]   You can still use it
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:02.880]   Theoretically you have to work really hard
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.680]   Do you have to know how to use git?
[01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:10.080]   That's the only problem, but if you can clone a git rip depository and build from source
[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.800]   Your goal. Well, there you go
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:18.240]   They actually there's a couple of people who are really very helpful on the little printer chat board
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:20.720]   I was looking at them and I'm like wow, they're walking like
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:26.800]   like 30 year old people who have no tech experience through this and what is this burg little printer?
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.320]   What is this thing?
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.680]   So burg was a design consultancy and they built this thing
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:37.200]   You basically went in online and you filled out like oh, I want articles from the guardian
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:44.000]   I want instagrams. I want this this and then like every day it would print out those things. I'm like groceries
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.800]   ribbon
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:52.880]   It's yeah, it was it's totally like a wallpaper kind of thing like in terms of I kind of like it
[01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.560]   I wish I had one. I like it
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.120]   Well, you probably could buy one real cheap
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:00.160]   And it still works because they opened see this is by the way
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:05.360]   We're evolved totally should have done is they should have opened source the server and let somebody run the server
[01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:08.160]   What's the Japanese word for?
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:14.000]   Objects that are kawaii kind of useful but a taku a kind of dumb
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:18.080]   I'm trying to think of it. So this fits like that
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:22.640]   That word would fit kind of bizarrely fascinating. I mean, it's sort of useful
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:29.200]   It was it was a concept but so this is kind of an interesting issue and I bet it's going to come up again because
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.280]   staples which actually launched their own hub
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.080]   I think at 2013
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:39.120]   I'd have to double check when they did it, but they're actually
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:44.720]   About to make an announcement about that hub and I'm really curious how they're going to handle it because
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.640]   they've got
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:47.920]   probably
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:53.280]   Last I saw they had about I'm going to say about 50,000 but that was it like CES in 2015
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:31:00.640]   So if you think 50,000 staples connect hub customers are suddenly about to hear the fate of their home hub
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:07.440]   So uh, so what happened what happened with revolve that last we heard we talked about it a few weeks ago was
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:11.520]   That nest was going to give kind of refund some people their money
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:16.080]   Was it case case by case case by case
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:22.880]   They didn't sell a lot of revolve they sold less than 10,000 of them. Yeah, so
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:26.320]   They were expensive though really expensive. Um
[01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:29.360]   So that that was kind of the thing
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:34.320]   That's the last we've heard of it. Oh, yeah, I don't think it would be so hard to keep a
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:37.520]   server running for let's say a thousand
[01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:43.120]   The issue there. There's a couple issues because it connects to so many other devices
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:46.640]   When someone else's integration changed
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:52.320]   Some person would have to go change that and from a security perspective. They've got to keep right?
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:56.000]   I mean, it's it's this is a huge issue for the internet of things. I mean revolve
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:03.120]   I know I'm I'm sad nest had a chance to really show the industry how to do something and they just screwed it up
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:05.680]   And haven't found the words right?
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:08.560]   I found the Japanese word. Oh
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:15.600]   It's it's chindogu chindogu and it means so chindogu. It means useless accessory
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:22.720]   So it's a cool object that does something that is mostly useless. There are so many chindogu things in this business
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:27.200]   I have so many of them like in my house. I want to catch for you to make a note
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:30.480]   Note to self the chindogu podcast
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:33.360]   The chindogu chindogu
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:35.520]   This is working this weekend chindogu
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:38.240]   How how to listen to the word
[01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:42.160]   I think it's called age
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:46.160]   Wait, no, Matthew's been googling it since he mentioned
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:52.560]   That's it's just it's just a simulation for where you're gonna go through an older age Matthew. It's like Japanese
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.560]   So
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:57.920]   Wednesday actually I may be too late. There is an official
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:00.800]   Chindogu society
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:03.040]   Yeah, it's a big deal. Uh-huh
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:09.520]   Home of the international chindogu society. They even have the chindogu of the day
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:13.520]   The hay fever
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:16.560]   It's a great concept
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:20.480]   I don't know why the image links are broken, but apparently uh, this would be a great thing
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:24.960]   They have come out of your berg a little printer every day the chindogu item for the day
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:26.800]   So there's one I just found one
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.200]   It's a helmet that you wear on the subway
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:35.840]   And it has a suction cup that sticks to the window and so it keeps you from falling forward when you fall asleep
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:40.960]   I would I would eat that for an airplane. I would be amazing like velcro on the back
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:44.080]   It actually looks like a plumber's friend at the back
[01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:49.120]   Many of them are homemade I think
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:52.720]   The american version is kickstarter
[01:33:53.680 --> 01:33:56.320]   Is the chindogo society of the united states?
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:03.120]   Absolutely. I bought for instance perfect chindogo the floating bonsai tree
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:09.200]   I wonder if they got funded. I think they did because I think they took money out of my account
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:11.200]   Uh
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.240]   Floating bond
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.440]   So it's a yeah, it's called air bonsai
[01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:21.040]   It uh, it is a bonsai tree that uh use it floats in the air
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:24.160]   What?
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:29.440]   Very good stacy has obviously spent some time in the world of chindogu
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:31.840]   Uh
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.600]   It is a magnet
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:40.880]   powered device and uh, thank goodness here. They are floating bands bonsai trees. They are now a reality
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.840]   And of course they're floating speakers made in japan
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:50.800]   Uh, I'm so excited about this mine should come any day now
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:52.800]   Yeah
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:57.360]   There's a good one. That's what I have. I own that's the one. Yeah, I'm the ostrich biller on the show
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.760]   Yeah, ostrich, pileo. Yeah, pileo. Yeah, I have it
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:04.160]   Okay, one little note it le if it leaks and it did spring a leak
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.400]   That's not good
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:10.080]   Tiny little that would be bad tiny little static e foam pellets just
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:14.000]   Now what could go wrong though with the floating bonsai tree? I think that this is
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.800]   This is going to be good forever
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:20.400]   Okay, just rotates in space
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:25.280]   What a weird place if it grows off its axis shut up
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:29.440]   Don't don't bring up problems that don't exist
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.920]   physics
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.920]   Damnio physics
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:37.280]   Um
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:42.560]   I'm trying to buy we're all distracted now. I'm on ebay trying to buy a burg little printer
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:44.480]   Oh
[01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:46.480]   I'm looking at chindogu
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:50.080]   If we're distracted, what's our audience doing?
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:55.360]   I like show us more weird crazy gadgets. Yeah, I'm telling you the chindogu show
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:00.480]   This should be the chindogu show. I want to do that. I think it already is
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:04.880]   Yeah, I think it's devolved a little bit a little bit anything to say about twitter
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:13.520]   Mm. Yeah, I mean the verges article kind of said it all nothing twitter is doing is working
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:18.800]   Well, that's the weird thing though. I didn't write about it, but if I had written about it
[01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:23.600]   I would have said some things worked so they added users for the first time
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:26.240]   That's right in like a year five million new users
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:30.000]   That was the last thing that everyone was beating up on them about including me
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.080]   Yeah, but it's only figured out five million
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:34.080]   They figured out how to add new users
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:38.400]   But then so it's it reminds me of people someone spinning plates
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:44.000]   So they get one plate going and and then another plate falls to the ground and they have to start it again
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.960]   So they got new user growth working
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:50.960]   Right, but now revenues fall enough the table and next quarter revenue will be
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:54.400]   Substantially lower than they thought because they're moving people
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:57.360]   Like their advertisers are moving to video ads
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:00.960]   And so they're not getting as much revenue from things like promoted tweets
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:06.000]   So it's like the target keeps moving. You know that the goal post keeps moving
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.160]   and
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:12.160]   Periscope continues to shoot sideways video, which really didn't help
[01:37:12.800 --> 01:37:14.800]   The earnings call
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.240]   Well, it was upside down last time if you remember the last earnings call it was upside down
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:20.080]   So it's actually getting better
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:25.920]   It's gotten one sort of rotation. I was like next time. It'll be it'll be right next time. It'll be perfect
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:30.400]   It's four it's 45 degrees better every time
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:32.960]   And that's and that's all we care about
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:38.320]   I actually thought it was a joke the first the last call when it was upside down. I thought someone was pulling my leg
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:41.120]   Just holding their phone
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.920]   They're literally holding it wrong
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.720]   Um
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:49.120]   This is a good line from jack dorsey
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:54.720]   Asked about facebook dorsey said we've been doing live for 10 years. We believe we have leadership potential
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.600]   Amen
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:59.280]   Leadership position, but
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.760]   Maybe that was a Freudian slip could have been a cotender
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:03.920]   He had potential
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:05.920]   I could have been somebody
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:09.280]   Said about two bit bunk, which is what I am
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.000]   Uh
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.760]   Talk about their deal with um, is it the nfl? I'm not a
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:21.280]   Yes, did they talk about how that worked? Oh, they know they said they want more of them though
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:27.280]   So they're going after other sports as well. It was a remarkably good deal 13 million dollars for 13
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:28.560]   Well, right
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.680]   But yeah, because they're effectively just rebroadcasting
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:34.640]   Right, so this is very clever of the NFL
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:42.720]   NFL effectively sold the same rights that they sold to two broadcasters. They sold them again, right to twitter
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:45.040]   You know we say it's incremental income
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:48.800]   And I don't understand so
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:52.880]   We were talking about facebook live and whether that's the way people are going to use facebook
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:58.080]   Is someone going to watch a whole football game streaming on twitter? Yeah, it's a link
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:02.240]   It's a link. No, it's not only watch it on it's well, but you know what i'm saying
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:06.400]   It's it's that's the equivalent of what it is. It doesn't it doesn't fit into the experience of twitter
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.680]   In a way that you might as well. You just it takes every screen and you watch it
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:13.440]   Well, how was that twitter? It could be so awesome though for
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:18.000]   if they get did tools for like instant gifts or like
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.120]   Being able to chunk segments out like almost editing
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.200]   I don't think the NFL is going to ever do something like that
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:26.560]   But that's like that would tie into how people share things
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:28.960]   Right. Oh definitely. Yeah, definitely
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.640]   Same thing is you got to be native to the platform. It's what I was saying about doing that
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:35.120]   So giffy I wrote about
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:39.840]   Giffy raised a bunch of money. They've they've effectively created a content studio
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:47.200]   They're the ones who who do a lot of that's interesting for sports leagues and for first tv shows
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:53.840]   That is interesting so they're effectively giftifying everything. It's a you know, it's a consumer product because it's a keyboard
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:58.800]   But it's all free. Uh, it's uh, you know, you can embed gifts on verus various messaging platforms
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:02.400]   But but the money like buzzfeed the money is in making gifts
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:07.280]   Social gifts for brands so they have teams of people who go
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:12.960]   And help the morons who run the oscars create gifts of their content
[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:19.040]   And now they're effectively building a content studio that will just give a fight everything. I bet you producing
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:21.360]   movie stars would pay them
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:26.800]   To make you know like here's the chanting tatum can at least give you an awkward hub gift
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:32.240]   Very useful right and that that's that's an ad's evergreen man
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:38.400]   Right. I gotta think like jimmy phalan has like a gift master right just pulling stuff. He's got to sure
[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.240]   Can we talk about talk show?
[01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:44.400]   Okay, let's talk about talk show, but let's take a break and then talk about talk show. How about that
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:49.840]   Sounds good because uh we're getting up on the two-hour thing and I don't I don't want you to turn into pumpkin
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:53.280]   But uh while i'm doing this ad states you might want to run until your daughter
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:41:00.640]   To dust off the gear vr because you can now play minecraft on the gear vr in three there you go
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:06.800]   Look at that all baby. I can't wait. I'm going home and doing that. That's what i'm doing tonight
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:11.280]   My wife gets mad at me when she's thinks she sees me wearing the gear vr
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:15.120]   She's thinks i'm watching porn, but i'll tell her no, honey. I'm mining
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:21.200]   I'm uh, i'm harvesting my my wheat. It's minecraft porn
[01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:26.160]   It is kind of that's awesome. You have to buy it though. It's an additional seven bucks
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:33.360]   Calora get out of here. I'd smell it instantly. Yeah, I will i'll go home and buy it tonight
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:36.560]   Of course galaxy phone not not included

[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:56.560]   Uh, I don't know if I would ever use this
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:59.600]   That was my question for you guys. Yeah
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:09.040]   Group group chat sort of public group chat well it comes from the the insight that what you see and you see it on instagram and facebook
[01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:11.040]   a lot you see people's
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:17.360]   Private text conversations which they've screenshot and put on there like here's as an example
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:23.600]   This is from the sippy's medium article a chat between Taylor swift and ed sheeran
[01:44:23.600 --> 01:44:31.280]   Okay, this the fact that you can look over the shoulder and see what tate and ed are talking about his cool and then it's so cute
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:37.520]   Let's go to sleep. I'll talk to you soon says tate ed says in a busil swizzle
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:40.400]   She says like you said ed
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:47.040]   He says that's okay tate and then the punchline you think for multi platinum lyricists. We'd do better
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:50.720]   That's on instagram on Taylor Swift's account
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:54.880]   Well imagine if you will
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.280]   a messaging app that simplifies the process of
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:02.640]   Saying funny things and then making them public
[01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:10.320]   And that is what this is that's what this is Taylor and ed sheeran ever do that. Well, I'm sure they're hoping
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:15.040]   They're publicists might have them do it if it's a big deal
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:18.240]   I mean that's but that's what i'm curious about i'm like
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:22.880]   Who is this aim dad? Is it like snapchat and i'm just too old to understand why this matters
[01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:28.960]   Could you because they talk about it like it's a a talk not a talk show like a podcast kind of thing
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:31.520]   Just these quick moments you would have a show
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:32.640]   Yeah
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:35.680]   But I don't I mean so it feels to me as though
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:41.520]   I mean that happens on twitter, right? We see people having conversations
[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:45.360]   Arguments mostly on twitter and we all get to watch
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:50.000]   That's kind of I think what this is right. This is it but it's invite only right?
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.400]   So then only some people would be able to see it. No, no, you share it publicly if you want to share it
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:46:00.320]   Yeah, it's ios only though so far. I think yeah, so anybody on the app would be able to so if you go to the home screen of the app
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:02.960]   Which I I don't I haven't installed. I don't have an iOS device here
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:08.400]   Somewhere I must have one um you will see just like periscope. You will see promoted
[01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:10.800]   Okay talk shows
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:12.800]   I mean it feels to me as though
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:18.960]   Unless you're gonna get a bunch like unless you're looking at sheer and a bunch of others are gonna start using it
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:22.800]   What is what's gonna pull people into that network?
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:29.680]   16 15 different 16 different chat apps sexting how long before it goes to sexting public sexting yeah
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:34.560]   Yeah, it'll be like the chat roulette. Yep. How long before that? Yeah, everything gets there sometime
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:41.600]   So i'm not saying it's not interesting. I'm saying is it gonna be no a service that people will actually use
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.600]   I don't know. I don't know. I feel like not
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:51.360]   I think the only reason it's getting any attention is uh because of michael sippy, right?
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:56.880]   Okay, I was very curious about why he was with twitter. Well, he was vp a product
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:01.680]   Yeah, i'm a smart guy and and it's it's well designed from what i can tell i'm just not
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:07.200]   Clear on how the use case is different enough from lots of other things
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:11.760]   So so you know a trend is any two things that we see but i've seen a
[01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:16.320]   Company in uh stealth so i can't talk about it but from you know an old friend
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:19.200]   That also tries to fix twitter in interesting ways
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:21.840]   you know, I think that's that's a
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:26.640]   Really interesting that that there's something about twitter that's out there is not working and twitter
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:30.080]   Is not fixing itself and so are there opportunities to start a new twitter and fix it?
[01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:32.960]   Not do you remember that field? Yeah, I don't mean that
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:34.320]   branch
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:37.120]   Yeah, it was a similar idea it was to take conversations
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:42.560]   Into a different place because twitter was the best place to do that that was a little high
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:48.320]   Brilliant guys was a little highfalutin. You know, I thought so have a serious conversation here as opposed to uh
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:50.800]   Hey, tay
[01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:52.880]   And it was invite on difference, which was yeah
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:58.080]   This feels kind of like vines, but it also feels like not organic at all which texting feels
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:05.840]   So like a conversation is kind of organic. So do you like I mean am I like Matthew? Hey, let's do a talk show about the history
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:09.440]   Right, right right exactly. Stay safe
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:15.680]   I don't know. I mean again going back to my inability to tell whether something is going to be
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.360]   dumb or
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:21.360]   massively huge. I mean this could be it could actually fit some sort of
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:26.320]   market desire it could fit a need that people have to
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:29.040]   to do something quasi
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:30.400]   public
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:32.400]   That's like chatting but
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:36.080]   You know, not just them. I don't know to be honest. I don't
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:43.520]   Well, they spoke actually didn't they just add like a group messenger or something? I just got stuck on like this
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:46.160]   It's like being on conference call or something awful
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:49.040]   Or a group text
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:54.320]   Yeah, I mean you get added to those things. I got added to group dms
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:56.960]   randomly and uh
[01:48:56.960 --> 01:49:03.440]   Yeah, it's horrible. Do you think so that uh people children younger people who grew up typing on a phone?
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:07.200]   Not us obviously because it's only a few years old but
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:13.280]   Uh are more comfortable with typing on a phone than we are. I mean I find that just a very pain definitely
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:20.160]   But maybe a lot of that's all my daughters do right and snapchat and texting is
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:22.880]   In fact our youngest who's 18 was
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.880]   snapchatting
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:25.920]   me
[01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:31.040]   Responding to a snapchat that she had shown me that was of her mother
[01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:37.920]   So it's like meta levels of snapchat are happening simultaneously and then other people are
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:44.560]   Texting her on snapchat about the thing that she just shared so I can see if messaging is
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:48.960]   Becomes the sort of main way in which you interact period
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:52.240]   Then maybe maybe something like talk show makes sense
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:55.040]   I I think it's a non-starter
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:58.080]   But very serious. I don't think it may pay any attention if it warrants sippy
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:01.360]   Jeff you want to feel old
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:04.080]   The verge is going all squee about this
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:12.640]   1993 HD footage of New York. It's just like being in New York in 1993 ancient time. Oh my god
[01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:15.680]   It's like these people didn't have a web yet
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:20.800]   It's just like today. I look like it too. Yeah, they look bored
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:22.320]   Um
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:28.560]   They're all looking forward instead of at their phones. Look at that. Oh, that's it. Oh wow. That's a good point. That is a very good
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:33.680]   They're not looking at each other and there's the world's right. It's New York. They're not looking at each other
[01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:37.440]   Let's not let's not assume there's any intimacy involved now. Thank thankfully
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.760]   They have something to look at instead of just staring into this
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:44.640]   There's the BTC 5 wow jeff knows that area
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:50.160]   It looks like battery park. I'm not sure anyway fascinating
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:55.280]   They're like the first Stacy hit the Stacy hit the right observation on this one
[01:50:55.280 --> 01:51:00.400]   Yeah, have you seen the uh have you seen the historical photo?
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:05.440]   Um the caption is I hate this modern technology that's getting in the way of
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.840]   people communicating and it's
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:10.240]   Men on a train car reading the newspaper
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:12.960]   And everyone's reading a newspaper
[01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:17.840]   Uh jeff you spend some time on the uh, you said you spend some time on the train. I imagine that you
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:23.120]   Used to read the newspaper way back. Oh, that's what you pick up when your phone battery dies, right?
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:25.600]   Yep
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:29.360]   So back to Stacy's point if you've seen the story from algsburg germany where they're putting
[01:51:29.920 --> 01:51:33.440]   Stoplights in the sidewalk so that if you're looking down at your phone, you're gonna
[01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:39.760]   They should they actually should have it like using like google's physical web or something
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:43.120]   They should uh beam it to your phone. You get a notification walk now
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:48.640]   The technology is getting there. Oh, yeah, they could just do it in the phone. Who needs uh, yeah that way. I don't ever ever look up
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:53.920]   Exactly didn't someone there was a there was software you could get that would effectively
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:56.080]   Make your phone
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:52:00.960]   Transparent it used the camera and showed you right what was behind the phone reality
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:03.920]   So that you wouldn't walk into things
[01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:10.560]   Here it is. It's not really traffic lights. It's just and it's so people don't walk onto the train tracks. So actually that's probably
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:12.720]   Which is probably a good idea
[01:52:12.720 --> 01:52:16.080]   Yeah, it's red but it turns red when you shouldn't walk right
[01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:20.080]   God if you're looking at your phone and walking on a train tracks
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:23.520]   That's done when it's work. I think that's
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:30.640]   I think maybe natch Germans or the German the most amazing other Germans is is how they really don't walk. They don't jaywalk
[01:52:30.640 --> 01:52:37.760]   No, there could be no car in sight. Not for two years. Nobody is gonna. I don't care. They're a very orderly walking
[01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:39.360]   They don't lock yeah
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:43.120]   They're kind of like Canadians in that regard. Yeah, although Canadians
[01:52:43.120 --> 01:52:49.600]   Do they no we walk all over the place. Oh, no, not like New York
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:58.480]   Yeah, no, nobody does it like you know jaywalking in Austin. So what I know when I was in college. It was crazy
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:53:00.720]   I was sober too
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:06.240]   It was just for jaywalking the often just one to be worse. Stacy. I don't think anything to do with jaywalking
[01:53:06.240 --> 01:53:08.720]   when I lived in Edmonton
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:12.240]   If you even approached the edge of the roadway
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:15.840]   And looked as though you might go out into the road
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:20.640]   Not at a crosswalk not even had a stoplight, but in the middle of the road
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:24.880]   Cars would come to all. Oh, yeah, just think just in case you might walk across
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:29.280]   That's that's very polite Canadians very polite. That's how it's supposed to be in California by the way
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:34.560]   Yes used to be you used to be it did used to be people were very good about not running you over
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:42.560]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no, that guy fell right off the platform
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:50.560]   Pay attention. That's that's that's yeah. That doesn't look staged either. No, that looks real tip your uber driver
[01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:55.440]   Hmm. They don't get tips. Did you not I thought they were getting tips?
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:54:00.400]   I knew they got paid but they got to do it like or lift us and put it in the app
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:03.440]   They it's not and they won't say uber says we're not gonna put it in the app
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:06.720]   Um, that's just that's just pissy
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:12.000]   But thanks to the consent decree that uber has made with the ftc
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:16.640]   You drivers now could put signs up to say I don't get a tip. Please tip me
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:19.360]   That was the whole shtick was
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:22.400]   I I do now, but but I didn't realize that so I feel like a schmuck
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:24.800]   I mean
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:29.680]   Because I never tipped I thought oh you're getting tipped. I just get out of the car. It's all
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:31.600]   Black cars. Yeah
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:36.640]   Well, and one of the benefits of the well for me at least one of the benefits was just not having to carry
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:40.640]   A while money and not having to get out your wallet and not having to just get out
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:44.080]   That's why lift is so much better. You just tip upwards. Yeah, right?
[01:54:44.080 --> 01:54:46.240]   Well, and didn't isn't uber testing also
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:52.240]   In some areas like where they won't wait as long for you as well and they'll just drive off
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:55.360]   Wow, I don't know if you guys saw that it's like it's they've changed the
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:55:01.280]   Point in time where a driver can leave from five minutes to two minutes and they're piloting that in certain cities
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:03.040]   two minutes
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:08.160]   two minutes, which I mean I usually wait outside for my ubers unless I'm in like a dodgy area, but
[01:55:08.160 --> 01:55:15.440]   That's really tough because I can see my drivers just being like, uh crap. I can't find her because you know
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:22.800]   They're across the street or down the block and well when you're in New York and there's an uber car every third car is an uber
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:25.680]   It's kind of hard to know which car is yours
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:29.120]   I've spent a lot of time looking in saying leo
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:33.920]   Model it tells you the model. I only drive the same car and black
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:39.040]   Students, although black horse. I'm a man of the people. I take the I take the bricks. That's why
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:41.600]   Cisco. I almost got into this guy's car
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:49.440]   And it wasn't newber. It was just his car, but he was driving on whatever it sounds car or marquee
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:54.480]   And I'm I opened the door and he's like, what are you doing? That's why I thought the pink mustaches were a good idea
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:57.200]   Because I felt episode
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:59.440]   Matthew, I think yeah
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:02.000]   Be a moderate a moderate side fall episode getting into
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.560]   And then the guy then driving off
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:06.800]   We need a new sign fell not to get back to tv
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:10.800]   But we do need a new sign fell because the more a's and times have changed and now all the things
[01:56:10.800 --> 01:56:17.040]   To whine about are very different well better yet to the things that all of the plot points that would be ruined by a cell phone
[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:19.360]   Right. Right. Right
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:24.000]   I was gonna say if you read twitter basically that's twitter's money maker. They should license
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:29.840]   Our content I guess and create the next sign felt because if you scroll through twitter, that's basically what it is people
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:34.240]   First world problems. Yeah first world problems first world problems
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:39.440]   This is the show of first world problems ladies and gentlemen. I thank you so much for joining us
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:46.000]   Let us wrap it up with some picks or tips or tools or numbers
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.240]   Would you like to start with a number Jeffrey?
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:56.800]   Yes, I would and I think how can I start with any of the number but two as in episode two of dot nyc
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:58.320]   Yay
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:57:06.000]   Our beta our beta of the new attempt at a twitty show in new york at kyuni and so today we had a wonderful show
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.760]   with our first time like I want to try out
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:16.400]   uh co-host julia furlan who is just great who's from buzzfeed and um

[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:32.800]   We talked about the news. We're trying to figure out the forum and all that the only issue with the title is that there is a dot nyc website
[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:37.920]   It's the new york city department of transportation. I know but what what name is not going to be taken
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:42.800]   No, that's true. So how can we find this without going to the nyc dot?
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:46.000]   Well, because well the thing is until it gets out of beta
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:52.480]   Uh, you guys know you what you know you guys won't put it up on the feeds, but it is on youtube
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:58.240]   Okay, so the link is there. I don't know what you search for. It's under dot nyc show. Okay. Um
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:01.120]   And the link is on the rundown
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:03.360]   Um

[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:14.480]   On the web feed

[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:25.360]   That's studio really I you know what I think you should stay in that studio. I really feel like that looks great
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:32.240]   Whiplash leo jesus. Well, you could do whatever you want, but that that actually i'm pleased at how that looks the lighting's great
[01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:37.200]   Um, it's it's you know, I mean nobody watches video anyway. It'll be
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:43.200]   It'll be audio so it doesn't really matter. It sounds sounds very good. Yeah, it really does look great
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:45.040]   I'm very pleased
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:51.120]   And by the way, that's uh the stream that we got here. So that's another thing that's working well. I think
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:52.720]   Yeah
[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:57.120]   So how so I guess if we follow you on twitter, we'll know what's we'll figure it out as we go. Yeah, we're
[01:58:57.120 --> 01:59:03.360]   Until june. We don't have all of our equipment and my schedule is weird. We're doing all kinds of different things
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:08.560]   But uh, so we're we're trying to i'm gonna go to the dld conference and try to do some stuff from there
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:14.240]   Uh, we're just gonna try different things for for a few weeks and then see what we like and try out some co hosts and get a regular
[01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:17.440]   Rotating crew of co hosts so that I don't screw it up with my schedule
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:20.880]   And you have somebody more interesting and younger and more fun than me
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:23.600]   and um
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:29.040]   But it's it's fun. It's exciting. You're gonna cover in New York city startup scene. What is how would you do start up tech the
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:31.680]   the intersection of tech with in New York with
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:38.480]   You're being the center of the universe how it intersects with news and media obviously but also with fashion and finance and advertising and
[01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:41.040]   And whatever the hell we want good
[01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:45.760]   All right, yeah, unfortunately, we haven't got a youtube
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:49.440]   Uh channel you can't just
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:56.880]   Go to youtube.com/dotnyc for some reason. It's like maybe because you have to have 500 likes first
[01:59:56.880 --> 02:00:03.280]   Or something. Oh, there's some youtube as we handed the channel. I think over to you or something. No, no, we have admin
[02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:06.000]   But you own it. Uh, i'm just not sure how we get to it
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:10.320]   Yeah in youtube you can't just search for dot nyc or yeah, you can
[02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:13.680]   So if you go to youtube.com and do a search for dot nyc
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:18.560]   You'll have to scroll down all the department of transportation stuff. But look for a forgotten yc show
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:22.560]   Look for a red dot. Let's see if you search for dot nyc show

[02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:39.520]   you know and

[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:59.360]   It's great. So we're starting
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:05.360]   Can't wait at some point we'll put up we did we did a first show last week and there was some confusion
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:07.920]   It wasn't really on facebook live. We were just playing with that
[02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:11.680]   We have a real show with real recording with me debating emily bell
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:16.400]   Oh, I want to see that. Yeah, because the facebook audio is coming from your your phone
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:21.760]   And that was that was that was just for the fun of it. So we referred to facebook live right we recorded a real show
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:25.760]   And uh in the same studio with the same sound and the same lights and same goodies
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:28.160]   uh, though more comfortable chairs
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:31.920]   And we uh emily and I debated facebook good or evil. So that's fun
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:36.960]   Stacy on iot.com is where you'll find stacey higginbotham
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:40.720]   And I hope you'll find her her here a lot more often
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:44.160]   And he possibly what's your you want to tip? Yeah, I want to tip
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:48.640]   All right. Um, this is for people who are interested in the smart home and are kind of like holy cow
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:50.720]   I want to do a bunch of things and I want them all to work together
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:53.200]   There's a website called smart home db
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:59.760]   And that is a great place to go to actually I go and check like hey is this zigby compatible?
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:05.600]   Is this z wave compatible? It's very handy. So is your house like totally wired and everything you talk to it?
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:08.400]   Yes, I can talk to it. I could also give you a
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:12.800]   This is this is a tip that requires you to have kind of a bunch of things or three things
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:16.000]   So I have a smart things hub
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:21.280]   Two lights and echo of course actually four echoes
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.480]   That is a lot of echoes a lot echoes
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:26.000]   Wow
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.440]   I've got an echo and a dot and I felt like I have well I one of the decos is a dot so that does that no
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:34.160]   I'm sorry. I do have I have four echoes and a dot. I'm sorry
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:37.760]   So here's here's a tip for you. So if you've got an echo
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:44.640]   And you have an app called you know me on your phone. Okay. Um, that'll connect with your hues
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:47.760]   your echo
[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:51.040]   I can't remember wemo. I think sonos so you can use it
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:54.080]   Sonos oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:58.400]   So the caveat on that is that the sonos stuff it only
[02:02:58.400 --> 02:03:04.560]   It will only play like what's been playing and I think you could play from your favorites. So that's the thing so you're like
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:10.320]   I won't say her name to upset your audience, but echo turn on
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:17.760]   Uh, sorry. It's it's a you know me skill. So no, it's actually I'm trying to remember now how how I acted
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:21.200]   You know me right and why oh n o m. I
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:28.560]   Yes, but the thing I was going to say because this is actually really useful if you have the logitech harmony connected
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:34.080]   I have that too. Yeah, okay. So use you know me to set up your like Netflix. Don't you have
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:37.280]   echo
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:44.000]   Turn on Netflix and chill and then all of a sudden your light all your harmony stuff will come in through that to the elixir
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.160]   the echo
[02:03:46.160 --> 02:03:50.720]   Isn't that awesome play with it? It's it's amazing and it all starts with you yo, no me
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:53.360]   Why don't you want to say Alexa?
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:55.120]   Because triggers it stop it
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:58.080]   I didn't want to be a jerk
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:00.080]   Stop it
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:05.520]   Next you're going to talk about getting the throne spoilers everybody thinks that's so fun except the people who have echoes
[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:11.760]   Don't do that either. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is that's a good tip. I'm gonna get this app
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:14.880]   I have all the stuff and it's all disconnected
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:19.440]   Yeah, so the next thing is you set up the rules in that app and you can call it
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:22.640]   You don't have to call it Netflix and chill, but I'm gonna call it Netflix and chill
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:27.360]   Hell's yeah, there you go. Maybe game of thrones and thrill
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:31.120]   Do you have anything for us Matthew Ingram?
[02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:38.000]   You know, I've been racking my brain trying to think I'm like here is so old compared to you guys
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.040]   I have nothing that's smart in my home, including me. I have no smart objects
[02:04:43.600 --> 02:04:45.600]   I have a couple of dumb cats
[02:04:45.600 --> 02:04:48.080]   Do you have an android app you like or anything like that?
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:51.280]   They're all old though. Nothing you probably know about all of them
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:56.240]   Um, I think I mentioned an made share which I really like which allows you to share
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:05:01.040]   You set up your own share lists so you can share something to multiple things
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:05.760]   I want something that will let me post to all the social networks. So that's what I do
[02:05:05.760 --> 02:05:07.920]   I when i'm saving something
[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:10.000]   So let's say I click a link on twitter
[02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:16.080]   I save it to insta paper. So this is where the OCD comes in. I save it to insta paper. I save it to pocket
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:17.360]   um
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:21.760]   I post it to a flip board magazine that I curate about media
[02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:24.720]   which you should subscribe to and uh
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:27.680]   And I sometimes post it to facebook
[02:05:27.680 --> 02:05:34.400]   And a twitter so I can do five things all at once and then it just it makes it easier to do multiple things
[02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:40.240]   So you don't have to write a like go to if this then that and set up scripts and all that nice
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:43.040]   Yeah, nice. I'm gonna uh
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:50.800]   I'm gonna subscribe to your media flip board right now. You should yeah, it's awesome. Somebody's suggesting uh
[02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:55.280]   Instead of uh game of thrones and chill. We just say winter is coming
[02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:58.320]   And then winter comes
[02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:00.800]   If you got a nest or you can take a cold
[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:04.160]   Turn the thermostat way
[02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:06.160]   Let's take it literal. This is an app
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:11.520]   Uh andro dor ios that johnny jediare travel guy told me about on the radio show and I just love it
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:13.440]   How many times are you in a plane?
[02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:15.520]   You're flying over something you look at the window and go
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:19.120]   I wish I knew what that thing was that body of water that mountain that
[02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:22.400]   Strange shape that looks like uh crop circles
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:26.000]   Well, this app is called apity fly over country
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:32.720]   And it's from the university of minnesota. It is such a great idea and actually it's it's geoscience focused
[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:34.800]   Although it will tell you all sorts of landmarks
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:39.360]   So what you do is you draw a line on the as you're about to go on a flight
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:43.520]   You draw a line on the map here. I'll show you on my uh my phone
[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:48.160]   You draw a line on the map say omg. I'll be flying from uh here to here
[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:52.640]   And then it will save I actually threw who I in by accident
[02:06:52.640 --> 02:06:55.280]   It will save all the map data
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:59.200]   And now even though you're in airplane mode you got leave your gps on obviously
[02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:02.800]   You will have a map with points of interest and even better
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:10.720]   If you look at the website like geographic stuff like uh geologic stuff like you're floating over glacial drift
[02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:15.040]   Rock it's uncasolidated of course dead and drital
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:20.240]   Lithology about two pudders works in the phone and it's not illegal or anything
[02:07:20.240 --> 02:07:23.840]   It's not illegal to have a gps on you don't have the wi-fi or the bluetooth on
[02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:27.760]   Wait, are they showed you dinosaurs? They show you dinosaurs
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:32.400]   That's cool. Yeah, isn't this cool the theropita was right down there as you uh
[02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:36.960]   So the nice literally I said that to myself flying back from Italy
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:42.640]   I said I wish I had a thing right it would show me what i'm flying on right isn't that so cool
[02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:48.000]   Uh, you can i've done it before with maps like the here maps that store offline
[02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000]   You can't the reason and I guess if you could use the wi-fi in the plane you could do it
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:57.680]   Although it'd be very slow. I was not on plane wi-fi. Yeah, it's better just to have it pre-download it and then it'll all be there
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:01.040]   This is actually from the university of minnesota geoscience department
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:02.800]   Uh, what's the name again leo?
[02:08:02.800 --> 02:08:07.600]   It's called flyover country and you can find it on there it is flyover country fly map
[02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:11.360]   Now right now it's us only but they are planning to expand it internationally as well
[02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:14.000]   So they're adding more maps all the time. It's really cool
[02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:19.200]   My favorite is when I flew from for example once south africa you're going over lands that wow what's that right?
[02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:21.360]   And
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:25.040]   I always want to know this stuff. This is funded by the national science foundation
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:29.760]   So it's also great. Take a nile seat. So yeah, we'll go get that. Isn't that cool?
[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:36.080]   I just love that. Thank again a tip of the hat to johnny jet who told us about that uh on the radio show this week s free
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:38.880]   flyover country
[02:08:38.880 --> 02:08:41.280]   Wow

[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:33.600]   Uh, it's really nice to have i was watching cbs this sunday morning on sunday
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:38.240]   And they said we're gonna give this segment seven minutes because it really needs some time

[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:48.000]   That's a long segment
