[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.880]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show the covers,
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.000]   the Google verse, and all the cloud stuff that's
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.320]   all around us every day.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.680]   Joining us, I couldn't take a two-better people
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.680]   to have on the show as regulars, the one the only Jeff Jarvis
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.520]   from buzzmachine.com, a great observer of all things Google,
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.000]   the author of what would Google do,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.400]   but also the new journalism, the new press.
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.680]   He is a professor of journalism at the City University of New
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.880]   York, and it's so good to have you here, Jeff, as always.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.880]   That's the boring stuff.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.800]   That's the boring stuff.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.600]   The good stuff is the book, What Would Google Do,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.200]   What You Must All Buy Now.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.480]   Gina Trapani's book is the complete guide to Google Wave,
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.880]   at completewaveguide.com.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.880]   She's also the creator of Life Hacker, still blogs there,
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.200]   and on her own site, smartawared.org,
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.520]   and is currently working to create transparency in government.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.040]   Right?
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.880]   Yes, sir.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.080]   Is it escape labs?
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.320]   Is that what is it?
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.960]   Expert labs.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.040]   Expert labs.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.840]   Expert labs.org, yeah.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.520]   Yeah, hello.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.200]   If the government messes up, then they go to escape labs.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.720]   Oh, why?
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.200]   Escape leapt to mind there, but it did, didn't it?
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.440]   So the big panversome of New York
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.760]   has been using its services this week.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.440]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.800]   What time?
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.360]   So he's decided not to run.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.480]   Even though all the rumors were false,
[00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.440]   he's decided not to run.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.800]   New York politics are beyond me.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.760]   I tell you.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.360]   Jersey's enough for me.
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.960]   By the way, Gina is a Jersey girl today,
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.120]   and that's why she's so orange.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.640]   She's got the tan in a can.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.240]   Asbury Park, baby.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.000]   She was born to run.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.000]   Biggest story, I guess, of the week
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.760]   is this weird case in Italy where the Italian courts said,
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.160]   what is it, three or four Google executives were guilty--
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.000]   Three out of four.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.240]   --were guilty of wrongdoing in a video that
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.080]   was posted on YouTube, up on YouTube for two months of a--
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.080]   now, I've seen reports that the kid was down center.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.240]   I'm another one that he was autistic.
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.120]   I don't know which, but of a kid being teased,
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.360]   and he was taunted on this video.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   The video was up for two months.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.080]   Google says the Italian police contentists
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.760]   would be pulled it down within two hours.
[00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.240]   However, prosecutors still went after these executives
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.360]   and they're found guilty of not pulling it down.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.960]   And the issue--
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.280]   A violating privacy.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.680]   It was a privacy law in Italy.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.000]   And of course, the issue is, is Google
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.400]   responsible for the content posted as a publisher would be?
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.600]   Or are they a common carrier?
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.440]   And merely as they are in the states required to pull it down
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.480]   if there's a complaint.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.480]   What does this mean, Jeff?
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.840]   I mean, how can Google--
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.400]   I did some--
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   I think it's dangerous for the internet.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.200]   We're going to find ourselves in a position of being ruled
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.400]   by the lowest common denominator.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.800]   And in the case of Italy, it's this law.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.280]   In the case of China, it's their censorship.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.720]   In the case of the UK, it's their libel tourism.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.080]   Because you can be at risk.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.800]   An American executive is now at risk
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.560]   for what someone in Italy did on a service.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.520]   And it's patently absurd that Google
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.120]   should be expected to review all content before putting it up.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.680]   Well, I did a little back of envelope calculation.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.920]   I hope I'm not stealing your number, but 20 hours--
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.680]   I don't have one yet.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.200]   20 hours?
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.680]   Good.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.680]   Before the show's over, I'm sure you will.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.880]   20 hours of video uploaded every minute to Google.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   So I calculated that you would have
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.200]   three shifts of 10,000 employees each, looking at video,
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.200]   pretty much nonstop.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.960]   That's 30,000 new employees just right now.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.800]   And then of course, next month, it'll be more and more
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.920]   after that, more after that, just to review every bit of video.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.760]   And now I had blogger into that.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.360]   It's not doable.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.600]   Leo, the comments on your site and buzz.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.440]   And anything that's public, it is absurd.
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.560]   I mean, if I go to buzz and say that, you know,
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.720]   Leo will report where he's strange sweaters,
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.680]   then I'm now liable in Italy.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.280]   Because that's a private matter, of course.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.880]   So--
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.040]   Very.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.040]   What really happens here is that the internet itself
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.640]   is at risk.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.640]   This is an ignorant view.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.880]   These judges are not the only ones in the world to hold it.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.000]   Because they're thinking of the internet as a medium.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.520]   It was Doc Serals who taught me that the internet is not.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.720]   It's a place.
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.920]   It's a place where people connect and do things.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.080]   And it is public.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.240]   But let me play a little bit of a devil's advocate here.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.280]   Unlike, say, the phone company, don't they benefit--
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.480]   I mean, isn't YouTube making money on these posts?
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.680]   So in some ways, aren't they more like a publisher
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.800]   in the sense that they put ads next to these posts?
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.640]   Well, I don't think that--
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.440]   A was, by the way, was Google Video not--
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.200]   Oh, OK.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.720]   It wasn't YouTube.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.520]   And I don't think they have any ads there.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.720]   So I think the answer to that essentially is no.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.680]   And the phone company makes money on our phone calls.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.120]   If I get a lot of people to call me by doing something scammy,
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.360]   then they're going to make money along the way.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.040]   So I don't think that works.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.040]   The other argument is that Google-- this video
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.240]   went, unfortunately, for the sake of mankind,
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.440]   had a lot of traffic for those two months
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.320]   before Google was notified given a takedown notice.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.560]   And so some would argue that Google should have known that
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.720]   and should have just taken it down.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.000]   But that's a short step from that to having
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.120]   to monitor and vet all content that's put up.
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.720]   But it was up for two months.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.600]   I thought that there were complaints about the video
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.800]   before the Italian police contact.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.480]   I thought that was the issue, that Google has been contacted
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.440]   and they were asked to take the video down,
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.800]   but they didn't for a while.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.960]   Isn't the two months really the issue?
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.400]   That's a failure of--
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.640]   Customer service.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.360]   Yeah, basically.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.960]   Right.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.440]   Right.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.920]   That's a customer service issue.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.400]   I mean, let's--
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.640]   I mean, I totally agree with what you're saying, Jeff.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.360]   I think everyone-- I don't know.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.800]   I'm going to assume that everyone knows that checking everything
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.640]   the minute that it goes up is insane.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.480]   But I do think there may be an issue of responsiveness
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.640]   on their end.
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.960]   If someone did contact them about this video,
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.080]   which it sounds like someone did,
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.440]   that if they should have responded sooner, unless they
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.200]   have a special-- oh my god, it's the police filter.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.800]   I don't know.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.200]   Wouldn't you-- I mean, it's such a chilling effect
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.200]   on a company that its executives could go to jail
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   for something like this.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.560]   That's the real problem here.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.320]   And then it can happen in another country.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.480]   And so do we all get to the point of saying,
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.720]   every company around-- now lawyers and companies all
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.160]   around the world now are saying, up, more liability.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.720]   Are you sure you want to allow communication with the masses?
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.080]   The masses do dastardly things once in a while.
[00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.000]   You'd better cut off all that communication,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.960]   all that conversation, the entire benefit of the internet.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.520]   Tidally, your blog post is Italy Endangers the Web.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.000]   It's not a danger to Google.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.160]   It's not a danger to executives.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.800]   It's a danger to us, to the web, to an open web.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.560]   In the UK, they have what's called libel tourism.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.560]   If you're a dastardly chic somewhere in the world--
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.760]   this has happened-- and someone writes about you.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.680]   And just once, it's read in the UK,
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.000]   you can be sued under the UK's rather, I think,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.680]   backward libel laws that you are presumed guilty
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.960]   until you prove yourself innocent.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.160]   And it's a way to harass you.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.840]   And it's a way to chill speech.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.560]   The Italian move is a way to chill speech.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.640]   You also have Berlusconi trying to control the internet
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.560]   and keep people from saying nasty things about him.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.560]   And there are a few nasty things to say.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:22.000]   Then you add in Iran and China, and it becomes a real problem
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.040]   for the internet around the world.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.560]   What do you have?
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.520]   You have a Balkanized web where every--
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.640]   there's a little fiefdom everywhere.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.920]   Or do you have just the lowest common denominator web?
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:32.440]   That's my fear.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.480]   It's the lowest common denominator.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.680]   Is it some lawyer somewhere will say to some boss?
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.280]   Can't do that because it's illegal in Estonia.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   Right.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.280]   Right.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.600]   An executive who'll go unnamed because he works somewhere
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.720]   near that company called it the Axis of Medieval.
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.320]   And I think that's what we're getting here
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.160]   is people who don't understand the essence of the web.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.800]   This is the problem not just in this.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.440]   It's a problem that I have with newspapers
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.640]   that they don't understand the economics and structure
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.120]   of the web.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.680]   And they want to recreate their old world here.
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.880]   And this is a case where, I think you're right, Leo,
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.240]   they're making a parallel to publishers
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.120]   because they think that the internet is a medium
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.760]   and is controlled and can be controlled.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.400]   Instead, as you said, as a common carrier,
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.880]   or it's a public square.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.760]   You point out that we have Section 230 in the US, which
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.880]   says, quote, "No provider or user of an interactive computer
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.600]   service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.520]   of any information provided by another information
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.760]   contact-- content provider."
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.880]   It's the so-called safe haven.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.800]   It was incredibly forward-thinking of Congress, of all people,
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.560]   to see that and to see that if we did not have that protection,
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.600]   we wouldn't have speech.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.640]   It protects bloggers.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.520]   It protects YouTube.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.440]   It protects all of us.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.080]   Protects me.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.520]   It protects me as a broadcaster.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.000]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.680]   No, it doesn't.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.160]   I'm a publisher.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.440]   But it protects me in my forums.
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.000]   Well, there's some of the things that others put up
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   on your site.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.560]   Right.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.800]   You're not liable for it, or you have a safe haven regarding.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.280]   The Wikipedia page for Section 230
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:07.680]   is very good that goes into the case law since.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.080]   And it's not perfect.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.360]   But it's-- and I argued it's the first amendment of the web.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.280]   Somebody came in-- I forget who it was-- to my comments
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.720]   and said, well, no, it protects the service provider.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.160]   It doesn't protect the speaker.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:22.960]   True.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.360]   But without it, we'd have no speech.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.200]   Right.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:32.160]   You have to be able to be indemnified as a content provider,
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.000]   or you're not going to put any content up.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.880]   But you're not going to allow others to do so.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.200]   And there goes conversation.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.520]   And we're back to our medieval world
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.000]   of a centralized world where institutions and brands
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.760]   control everything, which is exactly what Mr.
[00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:46.120]   Berlusconi wants.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.680]   And Mr. Murdoch.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.480]   Yes, as soon as I was talking.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.920]   You suggest that we have something
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.240]   like John Perry Parlow's declaration
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.480]   of independence for cyberspace.
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.600]   Well, we tried to get some wonderful piece.
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.880]   It was 1999, written in Davos.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.000]   There I did it again.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.240]   And I recommend it highly.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.720]   I think Leo, you should do a dramatic reading of it
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.560]   with full verve and vigor.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.600]   Actually, John Perry Barlow should do it.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.760]   Exactly.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:16.720]   Well, could with musical background from the dead.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.480]   But that would make it too mellow, I think.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.680]   And Rebecca McKinnon, a really respected blogger
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.600]   and journalist about China, was arguing
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.400]   after the Chinese situation with Google
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.760]   that we needed a constitution of the web.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.960]   And I fear that a little bit in that it could codify too much
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.560]   under law and treaty, which is not what we want.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.440]   If you listen to Barlow.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.560]   But I do think we need a statement of rights,
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.680]   a bill of rights for the internet.
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.240]   And we need to use that as the standard
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.280]   and use that as the explanation of what this is.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.960]   And it doesn't come from governments.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.960]   Doesn't come from institutions.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.080]   It should come from us, the users.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.800]   You know, I might do a dramatic reading.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.120]   It's worth quite amazing.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.720]   Barlow, who is a writer with lyricist for The Grateful Dead,
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.600]   really knows has as a way with words.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.760]   Listen to the first paragraph.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.600]   Governments of the industrial world,
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.200]   you weary giants of flesh and steel,
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.840]   I come from cyberspace, the new home of the mind.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.240]   On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.960]   to leave us alone.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.560]   You're not welcome among us.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.840]   You have no sovereignty where we gather.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.360]   Well, I wish it were true.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.080]   That's the expectation we have and we need to say it.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.200]   Yeah, no, you're right.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   Governments derive their just powers
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.960]   from the consent of the governed.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.320]   You have neither solicited nor received ours.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.880]   We didn't invite you.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.320]   You do not know us nor do you know our world.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.600]   We, you know, I think it's really, there is a divide.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.120]   And I've observed this and I've talked about this
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.440]   with the friends of mine.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.000]   Between, it's even between people.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.360]   Sometimes, Amber McCarthy and I call the rest of the world
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.360]   the Straits where they, they just,
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.200]   you know what I mean?
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.600]   They're, you know what I mean?
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.280]   They're the weary giants of flesh and steel.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:06.360]   They're the old school folks who don't get what's going on
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.760]   in the new media and social media and cyberspace
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.520]   and kind of interpret it through their very limited
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.480]   perception from the past.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.600]   And like streets as in normals or streetcars and
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   readers.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.800]   Well, not readers.
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.680]   We're talking normals because they're plenty of
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.560]   plenty of gay straits in this case.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.640]   But no, I mean, yeah, they're there.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.720]   They're there are people who, but it is like that.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.840]   It's that same division, you know, of people who get it.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.360]   You know what I used to just say they don't get it.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.760]   I tried to stop myself from using that phrase and don't get it.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.400]   And it's true.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.960]   They don't, but in my little boring world of news and media,
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.080]   I came to see that we have a responsibility to educate them
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.720]   because not knowing it is what is not understanding this world,
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.120]   not getting it is what is leading to the destruction
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.000]   of newspapers, coast to coast.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.200]   Yeah. And frankly, I am.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.600]   I agree with you, but often I just want to throw up my hands
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.800]   and say, oh, I guys don't get it.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   Because it was to an editor of the editor,
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.400]   former editor of a prestigious paper
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.880]   who left in December to do foundation work.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.200]   And so she's, you know, of the old world.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.360]   And she shocked me when she said, you know,
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.760]   I'm getting to think that we should just let the sooner
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.600]   the old institutions die, the better.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.280]   Right. I get accused to say that all the time.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.800]   And I don't even talk that way.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:32.480]   But I think that part of the question we have here is,
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:37.280]   is do we have the faith that the genius of the world,
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.400]   the Zuckerbergs, the Larrys and Sergey's will take over
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.000]   the world soon enough?
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.600]   And we shouldn't worry about the dinosaurs.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.880]   They'll huddle together against the cold wind of the internet
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.920]   and perish.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.240]   Or do we who get it, we think,
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.840]   have some obligation to try to shake them
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.160]   and make them understand it?
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.480]   Yeah. I mean, and somebody's pointing out in the chat room,
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.680]   I think this is true that geeks sometimes
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:06.240]   abrogate our, our rights and our interests
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.400]   by not being political.
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.760]   You know, we don't, you know, Larry Leisig's great.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:15.560]   'Cause, you know, we were talking with Larry about,
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:20.000]   you know, the fight over intellectual property
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.320]   in the commons and all of this
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.160]   and this horrible copyright, infinite copyright law
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.000]   and stuff.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.640]   And the temptation for geeks is just break the law.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.960]   Say, screw it. We can get around it.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.800]   We can break it.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.960]   And he says, no, you can't break the law.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.080]   He says, you have to change the law.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.120]   The only tenable position is to say, look, we've, you know,
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.360]   if you care, don't break it, change it.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.480]   And that's, this is almost the, the, the debate
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.800]   between Gandhi and Malcolm X, you know?
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.160]   Do you, do you, do you civil, is it civil disobedience?
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.720]   Is it passive resistance?
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.000]   Is, do you get political? What do you, what do you do?
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.840]   And I think we have to,
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.600]   - Do we recognize as in the Google China case
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   that the internet is a new land?
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.440]   - Right.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.240]   - And there is an effort to colonize it.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.960]   And the king of Spain is trying to make it,
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.520]   - Right. Get out of our cyberspace.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.200]   - It's trying to make it hers.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.040]   - Yep.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.520]   - And we're trying to say, no, it's the peoples.
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.640]   Do we need a, you know, a,
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.680]   meeting on a hot day in Philadelphia
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.600]   to hammer out our, our, our bill of rights?
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.840]   - This is what John Perry Barlow says.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.960]   "These increasingly hostile and colonial measures
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.480]   to place us in the same position
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.960]   as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.640]   who had to reject the authorities
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.480]   of distant, uninformed powers.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.280]   We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.280]   even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.440]   We will spread ourselves across the planet
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.760]   so that no one can arrest our thoughts.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.920]   This is 1996, it's really prophetic.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.920]   - Is he gonna win? '96?
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.000]   - '96.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:50.840]   - Wow.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.120]   - It's totally prophetic.
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:52.960]   - Yeah.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.360]   - We will create a civilization of the mind in cyberspace.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.400]   May it be more humane and fair
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.640]   than the world your governments have made before.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.160]   And you could say, well, it's a little Pollyanna-ish.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.360]   It's a little, but you know what?
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.560]   I also think it's true.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.400]   - Yep.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.880]   - And it's something we do need to fight for.
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.840]   - It's a standard we need to hold up.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.080]   - Do you think that this is gonna be gradual,
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.640]   an evolution and that, you know, the older,
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.760]   people who don't get it, the norms kind of fade away
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.880]   or is it gonna come to conflict?
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.600]   - I think it's gonna come to conflict
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.680]   but that's what I've seen in the news business.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.840]   The way I describe it is the internet is an avalanche
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.240]   and it starts at the top of the hill
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.280]   closest to those things that are most like it.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.280]   And that's medium.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.240]   That's why we think it's a medium, no, it's not.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.240]   Because the business is similar,
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.560]   the interaction is similar.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.640]   So look at newspapers as the scenario in the coal mine.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.480]   That's what's happened here.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.000]   And there's a lot of hostility.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.840]   There's a lot of argument.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.840]   There's efforts to go change laws.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.600]   You know, in Europe we see the Germans
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.480]   trying to change copyright law.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.400]   We see that happening in the US, movements do that.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.480]   So there are others trying to change law, by the way,
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.280]   and make them worse.
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.280]   So what the hell are we doing?
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.600]   We're sitting by and we're not doing anything.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.480]   - Yeah, I think we need a manifesto
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.480]   or something, we need to get off our duffs.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:16.800]   - You don't think doing shows like this and blogging
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.680]   and talking about these things
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.560]   just the way that we do is doing something?
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.920]   - Is it, yeah, it is, but is it enough?
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.760]   - We're reaching the right people.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:25.680]   We're preaching to the choir.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:26.840]   - We're preaching to the choir somewhat.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.920]   I mean, if you listen to this show,
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.600]   you must be somebody who gets it.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.120]   - True.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.800]   - I have to say, I talk on the radio,
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.880]   which reaches a much broader, more diverse audience
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:38.120]   all the time about this stuff.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:43.120]   And you have to be a little subversive and subtle.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.720]   You can't exactly wave a pitchfork.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.520]   But I think--
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.640]   - But there you go, you're doing a radio show.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.920]   You know, mainstream radio show.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.880]   I mean, I think it's important to have our little gee-gong
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.560]   claves like shows like this.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.880]   - Yeah, because it's a refuge.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.720]   It's a refuge.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.560]   - Yeah, but it is.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:00.400]   - Which is where we can fire.
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.920]   - Exactly, it is where we can fire.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.320]   - This is our cell.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.320]   - This is our media--
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.160]   - But stuff.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.400]   - Leo has been giving us the media craft machine.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.880]   (laughing)
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.880]   But now we have to go to his morning show
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.320]   coming soon from New York.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.160]   - Yes.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.480]   - And start to speak to a different audience.
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.160]   Hey, chat room, chat room.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.760]   Does anybody here disagree with what we're saying right now?
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.600]   - Of course not.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.080]   - Or are you all the choir?
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.200]   - They're all the choir, aren't they?
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.240]   I mean, they're in the chat room for crying out loud, right?
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.840]   - Yeah, but they're going off into the world.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.960]   They're all, you know, they're normal companies
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.120]   and they'll spread the word there.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.040]   We're infecting them.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:32.880]   - There you go.
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.320]   So that's exactly the message.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.120]   - Let's give them the tools to better infect.
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:37.960]   - Yeah.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.800]   - Let's give them the--
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.080]   - And that was Larry's message is,
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.640]   don't break the law, change the law.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.360]   And so, you know, geeks don't want to be political.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.120]   We don't want to get involved,
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.040]   but we've got to otherwise.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.040]   That's, I think probably the thing
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:52.600]   that is missing is this sense of urgency.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.840]   And maybe this Italian court decision
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.920]   will help a little bit in that sense of urgency.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.680]   It isn't a given that we will have
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.960]   an open internet forever.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.360]   It could be destroyed easily.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.880]   - And it could be used to change other pieces of law
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.200]   again like copyright and--
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.040]   - It is.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:11.000]   Look at this crazy act of treaty.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.560]   I mean, they're trying to get this stuff biased.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.760]   So you don't get--
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.120]   - You seem more optimistic.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:19.960]   - I guess I am.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.440]   I think I just, I don't know.
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.320]   Maybe I'm just too young.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.160]   I don't know.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.000]   That just seems crazy.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.320]   I'm like, that's never gonna happen.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.600]   (laughing)
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.440]   - It's very natural.
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.640]   - It's bringing out our old children with the 60s thing.
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.640]   We're gonna grow our hair.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.480]   - Right.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.320]   It's true.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.160]   - There's a few slides in.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.480]   - But it gives us, it gives me hope anyway
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.120]   that the young person like Gina
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.640]   sees this transformation happening.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.120]   - Maybe I'm totally naive though.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.400]   And I feel, you know, and I just haven't, you know,
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.560]   live, I haven't seen, I just, I don't know.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.280]   That seems like it just, it'll never happen.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.200]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.200]   And I'm actually feeling a lot,
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.360]   I'm sitting here feeling a lot of guilt
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.080]   for not working more to change a law
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.080]   and breaking it more.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.320]   - No guilt, no guilt, no guilt, no guilt.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.240]   - No, but you know, no, it's an important point.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.120]   It's an important point.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.680]   And it's something I think we should probably
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.640]   all take the heart.
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.960]   Although it does seem hard to believe.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.440]   I mean, you know, I read Jeff's piece about Italy
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.840]   and I agree, but I guess I felt like, I don't know,
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.880]   maybe I'm kind of a nerd about this,
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.880]   but I kind of felt like, well, maybe there just needs
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.280]   to be better procedures for, you know, complaining
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.480]   about content and helping Google make that decision faster.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.320]   The two months of the thing that stuck to me.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.160]   - I think that's true too.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.680]   - I think the way to do that is crowdsourcing.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.880]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.720]   I agree.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.480]   - Oh, Martin, you know, Google's great to speak.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.880]   I'm sorry, Gina, go ahead.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.440]   - No, I mean, I think Google's biggest mistake
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.160]   was just not being more responsive.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.800]   We're not having the controls to bubble up the stuff
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.120]   that's upsetting people that people are complaining about.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.000]   I'm sure people complained about that video
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.680]   and that video got a lot of views.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.200]   So Google should have just been more responsive to that stuff.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.120]   So that's the only thing.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.560]   If the standard is it offends someone,
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.440]   then we're in the same boat because everything
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.360]   will offend someone somewhere.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.640]   And so Google would prefer to have an official
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.800]   notice of takedown so that it can say to its audience,
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.280]   that's why I took it down, not just 'cause we didn't like it.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.800]   'Cause then they're in the boat of saying,
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.560]   why did you take this down, not that down?
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.640]   Gee, you took it down when it was the down syndrome kid,
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.840]   but it wasn't when you had just the geeky kid.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.640]   You know, what gives here Google?
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.000]   And they're in a difficult position then.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.120]   I think that their audience could help,
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.760]   not in the sense of if just someone complains
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.640]   because then you're in Howard Stern land.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.440]   You're in the world of three people complaining about a show
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.680]   and the FCC dorks giving it a big fine.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:42.200]   But I think you could have a trusted jury of Google users
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.640]   who could alert Google.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.480]   They're in the same boat when it comes to advertising problems.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.040]   When they decree a site, a spam site,
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.000]   and the site says, no, this is our service.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.120]   We're an aggregator.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.800]   Google finds itself in a position,
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.240]   I think it's the one greatest weakness they have
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.800]   'cause they have to act like a monopolist
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.720]   that they just decide on their own.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.400]   And I think it'd be better off to have a jury
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.000]   of those advertisers peers decide what it is.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.720]   - We-- - Absolutely,
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.600]   I think that's a good solution, or partially solution.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.000]   - This is something we're gonna be talking about a lot
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.400]   for a long time.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.040]   But I'm gonna take a break right now.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.360]   We're gonna come back and talk about more assaults
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.560]   on our freedom from our own people.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:28.160]   Facebook tries to patent the news feed, actually succeeds.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.320]   And apparently there's some additional patents
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.440]   coming down the pipe from Facebook that are even worse.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.600]   - China-- - Why is up to that?
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.240]   - Yeah, what is, come on.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.640]   - They're gonna patent getting laid from the internet.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.640]   (laughing)
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.720]   They might have a case there.
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.960]   (laughing)
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.920]   That might, you know, that's what they should be patenting,
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.240]   not the news feed.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.840]   Also antitrust accusations against Google
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.280]   and Street View in trouble in Europe,
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.040]   China widens its net censorship,
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   and now the number of companies who were hacked
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:04.240]   in that China Google hack has widened to a bigger number.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.760]   I don't wanna say any numbers in case it's Jeff's.
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.040]   - I don't have it on a number of users.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.520]   - Okay, you now have 60 seconds to get a number.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.440]   (laughing)
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.480]   And Gina, you get a tip, and who's gonna help me get a tool?
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.600]   I'll let the chat room do that,
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.640]   but first I wanna tell you about a great tool
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.240]   if you are in the support business.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.680]   It's go to assist express from the folks at Citrix.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.520]   Now, you know Citrix, it's the name in enterprise
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.480]   for remote access.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.040]   They licensed their remote access technology to Microsoft.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.560]   That was the beginning of RDP.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:34.240]   They've created really great consumer versions
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.400]   of their remote access with GoToMyPC and GoToMeeting,
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.560]   and now GoToAssist.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.440]   GoToAssist is for the IT or support professional,
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.360]   the person who has to support software,
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.240]   maybe even the alpha geek in a family or a group
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.200]   where the person who gets called upon
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.560]   to fix her friends and relatives' computers.
[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.920]   This is a program that will make it so much easier for you
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.600]   if you've ever had to do this on the phone,
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.800]   just the ability to reach out into somebody's computer,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.120]   however far away they are and fix it is just a blessing.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.600]   You don't have to have it pre-installed
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.080]   on Aunt Matilda's computer, Uncle Bertie,
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.360]   you just send him an email saying,
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.960]   "Burt, click this link," or go to gotoassist.com,
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.880]   start a session and I can get into your system
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.920]   and I can fix it, not only that,
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.720]   I will know what operating system you're running,
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.040]   what security software you're running,
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.880]   what's running in the background.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.200]   If you're a pro, you can have eight sessions at once,
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.400]   that means you can start a scan and are installed on one
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.080]   and move to the next, the next, the next, no wasted time.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.400]   You can do unattended sessions.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.440]   Once you get it set up,
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.640]   then anytime you wanna get in there,
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.840]   if they give you permission, obviously,
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.120]   for security reasons, you can fix it.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.160]   Or even if you've got like a malware bites
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.720]   or a red shack or whatever you wanna copy it over,
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.280]   you can do that.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.200]   This thing is made for the support professional
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.120]   and you can try it free for 30 days.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.120]   I want you to try it now by going to gotoassist.com/twig,
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.960]   that's g-o-t-o-assist.com/twig.
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:01.120]   Go to assist from Citrix.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.200]   It is a great product we thank you for their support
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.840]   of this week in Google.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.680]   Hey guys, I have to get you something
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.360]   and then you're gonna get in the mail the next couple of days,
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:11.200]   but do you mind if I show you ahead of time?
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.040]   - Not at all.
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.520]   - I gotta go over here and get it.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.840]   - I hate surprises, yeah.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.880]   - Oh, this looks good, Jeff.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.680]   This looks really good.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.000]   - I saved one for myself and I thought,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.400]   you know, we're gonna do this week in Google
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.320]   at South by Southwest and I thought that,
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:32.040]   and so I sent you all of these and you have to bring it,
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:35.480]   it is an official Google.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.880]   - Snug it. - Snug it.
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.280]   - Nice. - Nice.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.320]   - It's just like it.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.000]   - Yes, you all get one.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.200]   - Very soft, very plush, very downy.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.040]   - You want to know?
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.000]   - I can bring myself to five because I was embarrassed
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.880]   but always desperately wanted.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:50.400]   (laughing)
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.800]   - No, I hate it.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.400]   (laughing)
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.360]   - My wife is gonna be thrilled about this.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.920]   - You know, I almost sent you two Gina
[00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.000]   then I thought, well, I should send,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.160]   then I have to send everybody two.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.960]   So if, if you want more--
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.320]   - Oh, my wife wouldn't wear it, I guarantee you, Leo.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.240]   - You know, that's it, exactly.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.920]   - Oh no, she's just gonna make fun of me when I went on.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.000]   - Gina, it's big enough for two.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.840]   - Awesome.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.120]   - I mean, it's big enough for a house, frankly, it's huge.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.160]   But there you go, and it says Google right on it,
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.520]   there it is on the pocket, special pocket,
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.280]   just the right size and even has a little,
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.120]   just the right size for maybe an iPhone
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.960]   or an iPad right in there.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.360]   - Or an XS1.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.920]   - Oh, yeah, wait a minute, what am I saying?
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.720]   That's the Nexus One pocket.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.560]   (laughing)
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.960]   - So we get bonus points for walking around
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.840]   self-wester in there.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.480]   - You know, you can't walk in it, it's like--
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.160]   - It's gonna look like Google Monks.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.640]   (laughing)
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:43.800]   - Okay, okay, maybe, we totally will,
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.240]   especially if you go, you put your,
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.560]   'cause it sleeves.

[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.080]   - We will, we'll come up with some.
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.480]   I'll write some.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:55.920]   ♪ It only is bad ♪
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.800]   (laughing)
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.320]   ♪ China is bad ♪
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.920]   - Algorithms first, people later.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.840]   ♪ Oh, Python, we love you ♪
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.440]   - So yeah, I thought we'd have fun at South by Southwest.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:12.400]   We can all wear a Google, Google-slike.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.840]   - Awesome, thanks Leo, I'm excited.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.640]   - So Gina, I'm gonna give you a chance
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   to retract your swipe recommendation from last week.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.480]   - Ooh, oh. - Oh.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:25.480]   - I am, I'm gonna retract my swipe recommendation.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.720]   I like my three month-- - Ooh!
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.080]   - I know, I know, I like swipe very much
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.000]   and I posted about the beta, the leaked copy.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.620]   It wasn't even a beta, it was a leaked copy
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.040]   and I should have said this, I should emphasize this
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:36.880]   a little more last week.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.080]   I should have said that it was leaked copy,
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.560]   that it wasn't coming, it wasn't in, it's not in the market.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.120]   'Cause the swipe team contacted me and said,
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.000]   "Hey, you know, we don't have a downloadable version
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.880]   of swipe and that's intentional.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.160]   Their business model is OEM,
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.640]   the less only certain phones will ship with swipe."
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.160]   So forget I ever said the word swipe.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.000]   (laughing)
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.760]   And instead-- (laughing)
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.360]   - I took it off immediately, no, you know,
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:58.200]   it was good actually that you did--
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.920]   - Oh, there'd be more Italian jail any minute.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.760]   - Yeah, yeah. - No, it's good
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:04.280]   that you did that because they had never said this
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.560]   and nobody knew. - Yeah, actually,
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.800]   I don't, you know, whatever, they're business model cool.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.880]   I wish them the best.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.880]   - It's a strange business model because--
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.720]   - It is. - As people
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.640]   in your blog pointed out, we all wanna buy one.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.480]   - Right, right. - And they won't sell it.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:18.720]   - Right, so go into the Android market
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.360]   and search for shape writer, shape writer
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.560]   and it is fully supported, downloadable Android keyboard
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.720]   replacement that does exactly what that other program does.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:32.240]   You can swipe your finger across the keyboard to type words,
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.320]   it actually offers like dictionary suggestion
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.440]   the way that Android default keyboard does,
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.240]   which is super useful and it works just as well.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.720]   It's fully supported, there's no weird errors,
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.760]   you'll get updates through the market as usual.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.600]   So, shape writer, shape writer--
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.160]   - Is it basically the same thing where you just draw the--
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.960]   - Free, exactly the same functionality.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.440]   Yep, works really well.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.960]   - Sorry, swipe. - Yeah.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.800]   - Pfft. - Whoops.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.000]   - Sorry, whoops. - They said our model is to--
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.960]   Our business model is OEM licensing, okay.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.480]   - Yeah, okay, okay, good luck. - Okay, whatever you want.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.320]   (laughing)
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.120]   - That's cool, okay, I mean, you know.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:09.920]   - It's their business model.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.640]   They can choose a business model.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.720]   - Absolutely. - But as somebody
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:14.040]   pointed out in your comments,
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.800]   in the comments on your blog,
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.240]   you got a product people want.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.880]   People are downloading it illegally,
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.160]   they're offering to pay it, pay for it.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.720]   They're saying we will buy it, please--
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.560]   - It's been market place.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.400]   - Proven marketplace and you say no, you can't have it.
[00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.200]   I'm glad I'm not investing in swipe,
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.040]   that's all I can say.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.640]   But anyway, we apologize for this.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.320]   - I'm sure swipe is now very glad to go after Eugene.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.360]   - She did nothing wrong, she did nothing wrong.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.560]   And it wasn't clear that that was a pirated version
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.640]   or anything, it just was floating around.
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.480]   I had it too.
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.720]   - Geeks trying things and giving them feedback,
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.320]   which would be very valuable to them.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.400]   - So in a way you gave them a chance to tell people
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.840]   that that's not a legitimate version, so there you go.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.600]   - Yeah, there you go. - There you go.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:00.800]   And to find a better one, shape writer,
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.280]   which I immediately installed.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.240]   - Good, good, good.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.920]   - So Facebook, Pat--
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.280]   I can't even say it with a straight face.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.720]   Patents the newsfeed.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.440]   So this is the patent.
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.760]   They got it on Tuesday for quote,
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.920]   "Dynamically providing a newsfeed
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.240]   "about a user of a social network."
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:25.840]   I mean, I guess you could say that they copied it
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.520]   from Twitter, but Twitter neglected the patent.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.360]   - Thank you, Twitter.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.280]   - They applied for the application in 2006,
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.880]   which by the way is before Twitter existed.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:39.160]   - Well, the feed existed before Twitter, didn't it?
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.760]   - You'd think that I mean a newsfeed, well, I don't know.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.600]   I mean-- - Isn't a newsfeed a blog?
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.920]   I mean, what do they try, patent brevity?
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.040]   Like, I don't know, I mean--
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:47.880]   - You're right. - Isn't a feed
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.080]   of updates or a reverse chronological order?
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.240]   I mean, really?
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.320]   At this point, I don't know.
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.080]   - You can't blame a company for trying to patent
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.360]   something that they think they created,
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.320]   but I actually blame the patent office for not--
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:05.440]   - For approving it? - For approving it.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.280]   - But what is the point?
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:08.720]   So you file a patent-wise, you can sue other people, right?
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.440]   I blame a company for that. - Or, or,
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.200]   so you can keep others from--
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.760]   - From using it. - From, from,
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.880]   Harrison U, but in which case, say so.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.120]   - And a lot of patents are in fact applied for that reason.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.520]   We have no intent of forcing people to license it
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.840]   or keeping people from using it.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.720]   We just, we wanna make sure that there's no issue
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.480]   about us using it.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.480]   - So here's the patent. - September 2006
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.040]   was the fuhrer over at.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.960]   - Okay. - And when did Twitter launch?
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.680]   - Twitter, I signed up for Twitter December 2006,
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.880]   but they were around in, I think, late summer
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.400]   or even summer 2006. - Oh, my God.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.960]   - So they were around before then.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.600]   Which might have been why Zuckerberg
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.440]   had all filed a patent.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.760]   - In March 2006.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:55.280]   - I don't know, that's right about the same time.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.120]   - The same time here, yeah.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.240]   - WikiAnswers.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.080]   Answers.com.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   - About the same time.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.880]   So here's the diagram in the patent.
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:04.480]   Start generating news items,
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.680]   attaching informational links, attaching active links,
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.400]   limiting number of viewers,
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.960]   assigning an order, displaying news items.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.800]   That's the patent.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.080]   That's the process that's patented right there.
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:19.320]   I guess, you know, if it's very specific
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:22.360]   and that's kind of what they've got a patent for, I guess.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.400]   That's okay.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.280]   - So I'm looking at this article and there's a last graph
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   that says, "It appears this patent surrounds implicit actions.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.920]   This being status updates, which is what Twitter is based on,
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.720]   are not part of this patent."
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.440]   - In other words, 'cause Twitter's explicit,
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.640]   it's kind of somebody did it.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.240]   Said wrote it. - Right.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:45.080]   - This is about stories about the actions
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   of a user's friend.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.280]   Friends, excuse me.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.200]   - It's automatically generated.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.200]   - Right, so automatically generated sort of,
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.720]   it needed like metadata, right?
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.560]   So Leo, you friend someone else.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.320]   - I don't see that in my news feed, that kind of thing.
[00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.720]   - Okay, okay.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.200]   I can give them that.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.120]   - I still wish they'd say that they're not gonna try
[00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.600]   to hold onto it, but they're a company
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.880]   that kind of does do that.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.120]   - Well, is there anybody else who does that?
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.560]   - Well, if you see what your friend,
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.680]   I don't want you to Netflix,
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.200]   but do you see what your friends there are?
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.320]   - Yes. - Are you ready?
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.640]   - Yeah, the Netflix feed,
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.520]   you can subscribe to a friend's feed.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:21.840]   - Yeah.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.480]   - And, you know, the argument I make is that they're,
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.360]   the winner in social will not be a service
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.720]   we all sign up to, 'cause the internet is the social network.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.040]   And the winner is he or she who brings organization to that.
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.400]   - Right.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.800]   - And so that's the risk of this one, I think,
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.640]   is that what you want is something that pulls together
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.600]   in some algorithmically clever way
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.200]   and prioritizes for you, stuff your friends are doing
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.880]   on Facebook and Twitter and Netflix and Buzz and wherever.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.520]   That's what we need.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.720]   - I felt very bad yesterday,
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.640]   I'm not yesterday last week because we,
[00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.280]   at the end of the show had ended
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.520]   and I brought up demand media.
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.040]   And we started what I, was an incredible conversation,
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.240]   but Jeff, I knew you had to go to pizza.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:06.880]   (laughing)
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.720]   So I cut it off.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.160]   - It's the sake of my marriage.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.000]   - Yeah.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.680]   - I cut it off and people, I got a lot of heat,
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.880]   and heated mail for people saying,
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.720]   - Really?
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.640]   - Well, they were really fascinated by it
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.440]   and they said, "This great conversation starts
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.880]   "and you stop it."
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:22.600]   But the real mistake I made was that I started it.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.440]   So we can continue it now and in fact,
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.440]   there's a very interesting article in B2B memes.com
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.440]   that actually quotes Matt Cutts talking last week
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.120]   on this week at Google about these content farms
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:43.080]   and what they took from the conversation
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:48.080]   that we had last week is that Google
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.280]   might in fact wanna rein this in.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.800]   Matt was not cleverly because Matt is very smart
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.200]   and he was not explicit about that,
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.680]   but what he said was that they're gonna try
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:01.200]   to get more links to original content,
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.880]   original creation and have signals of quality.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:08.720]   So all you do is rewrite the 87th page
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.240]   about how to fix your toilet.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.080]   - Right.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.240]   - You shouldn't, even if you have great SEO,
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.480]   that's gaming Google, you shouldn't rise up.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:20.000]   Bob Villas, magnificent masterpiece about fixing toilets
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.200]   that would rise up because it's original and high quality.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:29.280]   And you actually then blogged on Monday about this
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.360]   a little bit.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.960]   - A little bit, I also full disclosure here,
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.200]   I think I mentioned on the show or after the show last week
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.520]   that I was asked to join in a advisory board of demand
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.360]   and I declined.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.520]   - Right.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.280]   - Passing up stock that probably will be worth something
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.080]   when they go to the IPO, but other things matter here.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.280]   And I don't do it as a condemnation of demand
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.400]   because my real problem here is that I think that demand media
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.200]   had some key insights that matter for everybody.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.120]   And I point that out and that scene is positive.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.400]   And so I don't want people to think that I'm saying
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.480]   tolerant or positive things out of a financial interest.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.960]   - Right.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.800]   - And the key insights for demand media are number one
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.200]   that they listen to what the audience wants
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.760]   and that's what they create.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.160]   - Which is not a bad thing.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.040]   - No, it was such a ding moment for me.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.160]   When I consulted for about.com, I saw them do that.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.560]   They'd check their search queries.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.400]   - Yeah.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.440]   - And right, if they have people asking a question
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.280]   for which they didn't have an answer,
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.120]   they wrote the answer.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.920]   - It's just a formalized way of doing what a lot of media does
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.320]   which is serve its audience.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.160]   - Absolutely.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.560]   - But we didn't do that in old media.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.760]   We just said, I can decide what you want and what you need.
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.480]   - It's one of the reasons I like to talk radio
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.920]   and I like doing a call in radio show
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:40.200]   'cause you answer the questions people are asking.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.520]   So in a sense, that's demand media too, isn't it?
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.360]   - Right.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.320]   And the other thing they did is that they cut up the task
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.600]   of creating a piece of content into 11 discrete pieces
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.960]   and job that out in the marketplace.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.720]   So they'll pay you 20 bucks to write that toilet page
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.400]   or make that toilet video.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.000]   And somebody else will copy edit it
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.800]   and somebody else will fact check it and so on and so forth.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.880]   The copy editor I think will make about $2.50
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:03.720]   for doing that.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.560]   - Wow.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.880]   - And people are up in arms about that
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.480]   and I understand that it's harsh,
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:09.600]   but welcome to capitalism.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.640]   - If that's what people, yeah.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:12.840]   - If there are people willing to do it.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.680]   - Yeah.
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:15.800]   - Well, we're where I think demand is gonna get hit
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.640]   and there's plenty who are somewhat like this.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.400]   You have associated content at Suite 101
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.760]   where the writer decides what to write still.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.280]   You have about.com that has dedicated guides.
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.240]   You have the upcoming C-Today Well,
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.520]   which is trying to figure out what it wants to be.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:33.320]   And though I think I saw somebody tweeted this week
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:35.160]   that there was an assignment on C-ed
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.100]   to name the prettiest news anchor in your market.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.640]   That's improving the world, but fun.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.920]   (laughing)
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.760]   - Ugh.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.520]   (laughing)
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:46.880]   - So these are all different models
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.920]   and demand really took it to a new level.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:53.040]   But I think that what Matt said on the show last week
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.600]   is really, really, really important
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.120]   because it's Google saying it's recognizing
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:59.840]   that they've got to find signals of quality and creativity.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.480]   - That's the key.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.920]   It's not about how cheap it is.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.760]   It's not about how it's generated.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.040]   It's about whether the content has quality
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.280]   and you wanna surface the best quality content.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.960]   - And it is Google's interest to do so.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.800]   - Yes.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.400]   You don't wanna be fooled by SEO.
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:16.120]   You wanna have the best quality content surface.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.960]   - And the more the choice comes.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.200]   Go ahead, Dejira.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.840]   - I was gonna say on their European public policy blog,
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.960]   Google posted like their three main elements
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.400]   of their search philosophy.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.000]   And the first one is not surprisingly
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.600]   algorithmically generated results.
[00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.640]   The second one is no query left behind.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.960]   And the third one is keep it simple.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:37.200]   So the no query left behind means that
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.240]   when they get complaints about one query
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.320]   not returning good results,
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.680]   they don't go with an edit, you know,
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:42.720]   the results for that one query.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:45.600]   They make a broad, they make a generalized improvement
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.880]   that's supposed to, you know,
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.920]   improve an entire class of queries.
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:51.800]   So, I mean, what Matt's saying is like,
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:53.440]   yes, we know that these content farms
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.040]   may not have the best quality content.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.840]   It's up to us to refine the algorithm
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.720]   to the place where it can figure out,
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:01.880]   you know, regardless of who created it
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.400]   or how much it costs.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.240]   - Right.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.480]   - And actually, I love the last graph of this post.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.240]   The author pointed out that if you search
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.880]   for the words search engine on Google,
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.920]   the first results are Altavista,
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:17.360]   Dogpile, web search, Bing and Ask.com.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.000]   So, I mean, that's pretty amazing.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.160]   I mean, that's certainly an algorithm.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.000]   (laughs)
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.320]   - You know, that goes to another issue for Google this week
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.880]   is that there were three complaints
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.200]   of antitrust put up against them,
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.680]   arguing that Google is favoring its own stuff.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.800]   Well, name me a media site that doesn't promote
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.280]   its own stuff.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.080]   - Do you think that's why you find Altavista,
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.760]   Dogpile, Bing and Ask on this search page
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:44.760]   is because Google's trying to avoid accusations of that.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.640]   - I mean, they seem to be using that.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:50.400]   - Yeah, I mean, they're using that to prove like,
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.960]   hey, our algorithm is not biased.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.800]   - Well, come on though.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:55.400]   No, in fact, if you look at this result,
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:57.200]   it's like the worst possible.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:01.440]   - Yeah, and actually, the last sentence of that post is,
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.840]   I guess I'd better get back to work
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.680]   (laughs)
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.080]   saying it's a more crappy result.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.080]   (laughs)
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:09.680]   Those are not good results.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:12.720]   It almost is like Google bent over backwards
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.080]   to show the worst possible results.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.840]   - Right, so maybe they were using,
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.720]   you know, if you're a cynic, you think,
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.880]   well, they set that up just so they can make that point,
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.200]   but I don't know, I don't know if they go to that trouble.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.200]   I don't think God, editor, is there controlling search results.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.400]   They take a lot of pains to make sure
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:35.520]   that everyone understands that it is an algorithm.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.360]   - I remember talking with Larry and Sergey,
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.560]   but back when Google was actually reaching out to journalists
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.880]   because they wanted coverage or something.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.400]   - Because they needed coverage?
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.920]   - Yeah, it must have been very early.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:46.760]   - It's just yadda good, yeah.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:48.080]   - I remember going to a dinner.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.760]   PR people invited us to dinner in San Francisco,
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.200]   South Park, very nice restaurant.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.320]   Larry and Sergey were there.
[00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:57.080]   They gave us all those Google Brio trains,
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.280]   you know, they say, "G-O-O-G-L-E."
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.560]   And Larry and Sergey answered questions.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.520]   It was great, I remember talking to them.
[00:43:02.520 --> 00:43:03.400]   And one of the things they said,
[00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.960]   which I thought was very interesting,
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.360]   and I just can't remember the exact details,
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.320]   is that I think it was Larry,
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:13.320]   every day would go, would look at the tail end of search.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.160]   (laughs)
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:17.640]   Like the the the drags at the end, what was left?
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.520]   And and and was always every day
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.960]   trying to improve that algorithm.
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.840]   So yeah, no search left behind.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.400]   And not doing it, as you say, by hand,
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.800]   but improving the algorithms.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.040]   - It's the only thing that scales, right?
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.360]   - Yeah, and I just thought that I was,
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.200]   to be honest, I was really impressed.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.480]   It was an engineering answer to the question
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.680]   that really made sense to me.
[00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:39.960]   - It was wrong here, it's wrong,
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:41.680]   a lot of that. - Yeah, we love that.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.960]   We love the idea that there's a perfect algorithm.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.520]   - Yes, yes, and that's why we love Google.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.000]   - Algorithm is not Google.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.680]   - There we go, wait a minute, let me write that down.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.600]   (groans)
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.880]   - It's like the idea that that could exist
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.000]   is just so appealing that I just make me love Google more.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.200]   It's a trap, it's a KPR trap.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.520]   (laughs)
[00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.840]   - And they fool me.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.680]   It's like I'm just gonna keep working on my algorithm
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.520]   the rest of my life will work out.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.280]   - It'll work out, it will, it will.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:10.360]   Just one rule to rule us all.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.080]   - This is just better algorithm than.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.360]   (laughs)
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.200]   - So the Europeans are mad because Google, okay,
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.040]   Wired reports, the European Commission
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:20.240]   has acknowledged receipt of three antitrust complaints
[00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.080]   against Google.
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:23.160]   Google said, "Not we've done nothing wrong."
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.240]   And disclosed that British price comparisons
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.360]   like found them, French legal search engine,
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:33.160]   E-E-U-S-T-T-Fals, and Microsoft owned Chao from Big
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.200]   were the complainants.
[00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.520]   (laughs)
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.560]   - So the people complaining are other search engines.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.640]   They say Google abused its dominant position
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.720]   to promote its own services while competing sites
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.720]   were penalized.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.920]   - Right, we're right back in a Microsoft land, aren't we?
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:47.240]   You're using your dominant position
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.600]   with the operating system.
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.840]   To promote your browser,
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.320]   you're using your dominant position with search
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.320]   to show YouTube videos.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.840]   - But this is what Google has consistently said
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.800]   and they said it again in their response,
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:01.880]   our algorithms aim to rank first
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.400]   what people are most likely to find useful.
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.160]   And we have nothing against vertical search sites.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.000]   You mean, indeed, many vertical search engines
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.480]   like those three or moneysupermarket.com.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.080]   Typically rank high in Google's results.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:18.360]   - Here's the problem when you get to court and discovery
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.240]   is Google gonna have to hand over the algorithm.
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.760]   - This is a Coke formula.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.840]   - Can't they do it just empirically and do some searches
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.240]   and say, "Here's what we got?"
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.640]   They've got to prove at some point
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.400]   that it is the algorithm that does it.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.800]   - Yeah.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.080]   - I mean, if it gets to court,
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.200]   it's really a,
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:42.520]   well, I'm trying to use a podcast safe word.
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.680]   - Go ahead. - To those things
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.600]   for Microsoft to do.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.320]   - BS thing to do.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.160]   - Yeah.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:48.000]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.480]   - This is a good--
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.840]   Microsoft uses MSN and MSMBC to wrote, "It's stuff."
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:54.160]   - Yes, everybody does.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.240]   I'm, what do you think I do?
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.640]   - It uses their whole page and wrote their stuff.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.360]   - But I guess if you're saying we are an agnostic search engine
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.680]   that's gonna produce the best results,
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:06.040]   you should do that, whether it's Google or not.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:06.880]   - They say they do.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.720]   - They say they do.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:13.200]   China has widened its censorship.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.600]   It's not going the right direction.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.880]   I guess at some point, Google's gonna have to make good
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.920]   on its promise and pull out.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.760]   The Chinese government is, according to a wired,
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.200]   threat level blog, David Kravitz writing,
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.160]   "The Chinese government is imposing new internet
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:28.200]   restrictions demanding personal website operators
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.680]   to acquire government permission to operate their sites."
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.160]   This is for all dot-c-n domestic domains.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:38.720]   - Yeah, that's a ran killing Google mail
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.040]   and requiring everyone to use the government's email system.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:41.880]   - Horrible.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:44.060]   Horrible.
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.880]   Of course, you know,
[00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.000]   Geeks, first thing to do is get a proxy server running.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:48.840]   - Yeah.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.080]   (laughs)
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:50.920]   - Yeah.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.760]   - Yeah, well, that's obvious.
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:53.600]   - Obviously.
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.920]   - Yeah.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.040]   - That's why God created tour.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:00.120]   The government said, "The latest move which also requires
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.600]   site owners to submit a photograph and show identification."
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.000]   You probably should have to hold up a newspaper
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.120]   with today's date on it.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:08.960]   Was targeted at tackling pornography.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.960]   That's what they always say in China.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:10.800]   - Oh no.
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.280]   - It's about pornography.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.720]   Critics say, of course, it's based on silencing dissent.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:20.360]   So since China does not seem to be moving forward
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:23.960]   in opening itself,
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.920]   when does Google, when does Google,
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.760]   when is the deadline?
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.400]   When does Google pull the plug?
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.240]   - They didn't say it.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:33.000]   It was Civa, but nothing keeps on giving me crap in Twitter
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.160]   saying they haven't done it yet.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.000]   When I said, well, they didn't say that
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.280]   when they were gonna do it,
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.840]   there's obviously diplomacy takes time
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.240]   and Google's a nation now.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.480]   (laughs)
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.600]   - Do they have to wear those big sashes across the chest
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.000]   and morning coats?
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.400]   - I'll bet Larry and Sir, you would like that.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.400]   (laughs)
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.240]   - I would love it.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.080]   - Or bristle might too.
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.120]   (laughs)
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:54.120]   - What was that?
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.640]   There was, and I don't know if this really happened or not,
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.040]   but Bill Gates, or not Bill Gates,
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.800]   Steve Jobs supposedly went around to the Wall Street Journal
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.120]   and other New York newspapers
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:06.440]   to coerce them into creating content at the time,
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.080]   so creating content for the iPad.
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:11.320]   But the Scandal Journal report of it said
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.480]   he was wearing a strange top hat.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.200]   When he was doing it.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.480]   They didn't mention a sash, however.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:21.440]   I don't know what, I don't even know what that could be.
[00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.600]   I would like to see a picture of that.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.240]   (laughs)
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.600]   Nexus One may be coming to Verizon March 23rd.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:33.480]   Isn't that the first day of spring?
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:37.320]   First day, that's what they said, spring 2010.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:41.480]   This is according to neowin.net, which is a rumor site.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.080]   That would be, it would be,
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.400]   also the first day of the CTIA Congress,
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.880]   which is a big cell phone conference.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:54.120]   So do we regret getting the T-Mobile version?
[00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.480]   - No, I like GSM.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.560]   - I agree, but I've gotta tell you,
[00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:01.080]   T-Mobile is worse than,
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.680]   I was just on Florida because of my parents,
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.600]   and it's not.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   - Yeah, I'm getting worse.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.440]   - I'm getting worse.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.240]   - You went versus AT&T.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:08.080]   Gina, how's your experience with it?
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.840]   - My experience has been pretty good.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:11.360]   I tell myself it's because like,
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.680]   San Diego's a second tier city,
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.480]   so things are not too bad, so one of the advantages.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.760]   But it's been okay even on the road.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.600]   - You know when the test will be?
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.560]   When we're in Austin for South by Southwest,
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.840]   and all those geeks with their iPhones are going.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:24.680]   (clicking)
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:25.520]   - Exactly.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:27.840]   - And we're going, well I've seemed to have three bars here.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.360]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.760]   - Can I make a call for you?
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.880]   Would you like me to do an internet search for you?
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:33.720]   - Yeah.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.560]   - Wouldn't that be nice?
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:38.240]   - I talked to my brother for about an hour today on my phone,
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.320]   and he was on his iPhone,
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.960]   and the call dropped three times on his side.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.120]   And he was just like, oh, sorry, I got an iPhone.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:44.960]   Like he didn't even.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.400]   (laughing)
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.320]   - And everybody goes, oh, oh, that's you.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.160]   - Sure.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.160]   - Of course you have an iPhone.
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.680]   Well, of course we didn't expect that call to survive.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:57.840]   LifeHacker has a list of the top 10 Android apps.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:59.640]   - Oh yeah, I wanted to, I bookmarked that,
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.840]   especially for Jeff.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.000]   Kevin wrote this at LifeHacker.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.240]   Kevin is a twig listener,
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.640]   and he is also my like Android guru.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.160]   Really, we need to have Kevin on some time.
[00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:08.640]   - Let's have him on next week.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.720]   - Yeah, he's got the goods.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:11.560]   I'm gonna ask him, I'm glad you said that publicly,
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.960]   'cause now he can't say no.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.800]   - Come on, Kevin.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.320]   We're gonna, here we'll give you a nice plug
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.680]   for your article on LifeHacker.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.560]   He recommends number 10 layer.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.440]   That's the augmented reality browser.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.080]   You know, this is cool, totally useless,
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.080]   but it's kinda cool.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.760]   I mean, it's totally useless.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.120]   Do you use it for anything?
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:33.280]   I use it to show off the Nexus One.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:37.280]   - Yeah, I mean, it is kinda one of those novelty things,
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.640]   but worth it.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:39.800]   I mean, it's definitely a,
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.240]   oh, this is cool kind of app.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.440]   I can't say that I use it a lot,
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.560]   but I think it was worth being on a list.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.560]   - Listen, listen, which I do use
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.240]   and it was just upgraded,
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.240]   which really made it frankly a lot better.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.080]   Got rid of some of the things that were--
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:56.600]   - Yeah, that syncing in a Google Reader key.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   Anycut, which is super, supercharged shortcut manager.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.200]   You can add shortcuts to your desktop.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.600]   And that's just something that iPhone doesn't do.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.960]   You just can't, they're just certain kind of shortcuts
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.960]   that you can put on your home screens on the iPhone.
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.520]   Anycut is really great.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:16.360]   Secrets, which is a password pin secure.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:17.920]   - Oh, it's key pass compatible.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:19.000]   'Cause I use key pass.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:19.840]   Yeah, okay.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:20.680]   - Yeah, you use key pass.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.600]   You can transfer your key pass database onto your phone
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:23.760]   and secrets will open it.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:27.280]   Slide screen, which I tried out for a while
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:28.520]   and really, really like,
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.840]   didn't wind up using it continuously
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:33.120]   because it didn't support my Google Apps account.
[00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.520]   But if you're using just your Gmail account,
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:35.840]   slide screen's pretty fantastic.
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.680]   - So what does it do?
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.800]   - It replaces your home screen with a kind of news feedy
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:45.800]   like view of your information,
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.840]   your most recent SMS messages,
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.520]   your most recent email, your Twitter stream.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.400]   And you can kind of slide up and down,
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.680]   up and down the screen and expand different sections
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.520]   of the screen to read more.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.520]   And it's just beautiful and it looks really good.
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:01.600]   Yeah, try it out.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.240]   The free version has a little add at the bottom.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:05.120]   There's a premium version to get rid of the add.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.160]   Like I said, I had a little trouble with my Gmail
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.920]   versus my regular Google account versus my Google Apps account.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.320]   But for someone going straight, it's a...
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:14.360]   - I always buy the premium version,
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:16.160]   even if I don't think I'll use a program again or whatever.
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:17.800]   I just want to support Android developers.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:18.880]   And it's a buck, it's two bucks.
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:19.800]   I just want to give them money
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.680]   so that they know that there's a market.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:23.520]   - Definitely.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.320]   - It's my little way of saying, come on, keep going.
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.400]   - Yeah, keep going, keep going.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:29.080]   Cooloo proper, what you talked about last week?
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:29.920]   - Great program.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.120]   - PDA net, which we...
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.720]   - Yeah, that's from you, I got that.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.560]   Yep, yep.
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.400]   - PDA net we talked about for tethering,
[00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:38.040]   for straight up tethering, no reading.
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.440]   - Now I use a different task killer.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:41.880]   So I'm gonna have to look at this new one.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:43.320]   Task killer free.
[00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.480]   - Yeah, I actually haven't used task killer.
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.360]   - What do I use?
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:50.200]   It's camera.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.360]   - But I have gotten questions about,
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.680]   how do you GTD on your phone?
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.400]   What's your tasks on your phone?
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.960]   - Well, no, this is for killing,
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.640]   not to do list, this is for killing running tests.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.600]   - Oh, yeah, okay, for killing all kinds of stuff.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:04.760]   - I use the call advanced task killer, that's what I use.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:05.800]   - Gotcha, gotcha.
[00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:07.840]   - And so I think they're probably all the same.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.840]   This one has a little ad at the bottom, so it's free also.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:11.200]   But you just kill everything that's running.
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.040]   Boom, boom!
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:13.880]   - It's very nice.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.320]   - Very satisfying.
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:16.160]   - Yeah.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.560]   - And have you noticed, I'm noticing a little bit of lag
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:21.040]   sometimes on this, and sometimes I'll turn it on
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:25.080]   and it won't recognize my finger presses right away,
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.560]   which is very frustrating, you can't get in.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:27.760]   - Yeah, I have the same problem.
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.400]   I don't even have, I shouldn't say this,
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.280]   but I don't have a code on it.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:32.120]   - I just gave mine away.
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:34.240]   - I just turned it on, it has the same problem for me.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:35.400]   - You just gave yours away.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.040]   - Anybody wanna see that again, let me just do that again.
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.800]   She's Louise, it's that.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:42.920]   I just say you know what my password is.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:44.640]   - I know it's so funny because I don't know,
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:48.840]   are Google people more, 'cause the iPhone it's a number,
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.200]   but on the Google you draw a pattern,
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.840]   and I'm not, I could remember the number easily.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.520]   I could, the patterns, I had to like, I forgot it.
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.520]   I had to try and try it again.
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.360]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:01.400]   - Couldn't remember the pattern.
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.600]   - And also, I mean, the screen, it's like,
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.240]   if the screen is clean and you do your pattern,
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:06.600]   like you can see.
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.960]   - That's a good story.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.360]   I mean, you can get it away.
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.200]   - Why you had to do it?
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.880]   - I don't know. - You're right.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:14.200]   - Oh, look, there's the smear.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.440]   - Yeah, exactly, the smear, the finger grease smear.
[00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.440]   - So you should change your pattern every day.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:19.800]   And then not clean the screep.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.640]   - Spreep smears.
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.480]   - Yeah.
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:22.760]   - So I went to Best Buy, who I love,
[00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:25.360]   and full disclosure is that I've,
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:26.720]   they've brought me out there.
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:31.400]   And I got the screen protector that they have in the store,
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.520]   and it's kind of jelly-ish.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.520]   - Ew.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:35.360]   - I get it.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:36.360]   - I don't want to gooey-screep.
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:39.600]   - I love the one that I have for my iPhone,
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.360]   which is the crystal one they sell in the store.
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:42.200]   - Right.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.920]   - Which the store was nice enough to put on for me.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.920]   Any recommendations for anybody about,
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:48.600]   do you guys use a screen protector for this thing?
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.160]   - Yeah.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.120]   - My phone is naked.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:52.960]   - Me too.
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.920]   - I even got rid of the case.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.040]   - Yeah, I went through a phase where I covered everything
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.280]   and a gel of skin and the whole thing.
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:54:59.640]   And then finally I was like, you know what?
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.480]   Like, the whole point is that you use it.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.320]   - It's so beautiful.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.720]   And that's exactly right.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.320]   The phone, look, in a year,
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:08.280]   this is gonna be crapped up no matter what you do, right?
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.080]   But now I feel like I'm just not being helpful at all
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:11.920]   to Jeff.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.480]   - That's all right.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:14.320]   - That's all right.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:15.160]   - The one that you got.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:16.880]   - I'm gonna be natal, obviously.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:17.880]   - No.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:18.720]   - Okay.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:19.960]   - I've got one of those, you know,
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.080]   keyboard protector things,
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.000]   like those little rubber things
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.680]   or for my keyboard, really for crumbs,
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.680]   because, you know.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.480]   - 'Cause you eat while you're typing.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.800]   - Yeah, but it always gets me looks
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.400]   when people see me on my phone.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.880]   - Do you have like plastic on your sofa and--
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:33.960]   - It's the keyboard condom.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.560]   No, no, no plastic on those.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.160]   But I definitely has a keyboard condom.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.160]   But no protector on my phone.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.000]   - I guess it's, you know,
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   we're all anal about something.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.240]   - I used to have the silicone case and everything,
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.640]   'cause it is a little slippery and thin,
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.400]   but it's just so beautiful and elegant the way it is.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.000]   I just like, I like to have it just plain.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:49.840]   And, you know what,
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.360]   I'm gonna have another phone in a month anyway,
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.200]   so what does it matter?
[00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.480]   (laughing)
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:54.320]   You know me.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:55.440]   - But for people like Jeff and I,
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.120]   you commit to a phone.
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:57.560]   - Oh, you're committed.
[00:55:57.560 --> 00:55:59.440]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.600]   I'm a little butterfly that flits from phone to phone.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.640]   I don't ask me to commit.
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:05.480]   - Fickle Leo.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:06.960]   - Fickle.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.680]   Number two is wave secure, which I don't know.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.680]   It's free to March 31st though, so get it.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:12.520]   What does this do?
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.720]   This backs up all your data.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:15.880]   - Yeah, backs up your data and locks.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.840]   Now, I didn't know about this one either,
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.040]   but you can do a remote wipe,
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:21.640]   it backs up your phone's data to you.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:24.360]   - I have another program that I use that's similar to that,
[00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:26.200]   that also does an antivirus scan.
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.200]   I don't know how useful,
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.280]   but does an antivirus scan of everything
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:31.400]   when I download it.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:34.160]   It's called Lookout, and it's also free.
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:37.720]   And it has a backup, you know,
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.000]   it has the antivirus data backup
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.480]   and it also has a missing device.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.720]   Doesn't have the wipe now, but maybe it does.
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:46.560]   Let's see what the missing.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:51.480]   Locate your device or make it scream from my Lookout.com.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:52.960]   So my Lookout.com, yeah.
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:55.800]   So that if you like lost it in a sofa cushion.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:56.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.040]   - You can make it go, it's a, I'm over here.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.080]   So I use this, I don't know.
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.640]   I don't, you know, it has a virus scan
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.160]   and it scans new downloads, and I don't know.
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:09.080]   I have no idea if there's anything, any merit to that at all.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.640]   - You know, I wonder how long is it gonna take
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.080]   until now or makes it into the market?
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.280]   - That's inevitable, right?
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.560]   - That's what we know that Android buy up market,
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:17.960]   you know, that's like, it's a really,
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:20.720]   it got market penetration when there's a virus
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:22.480]   or an hour in the market.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.560]   I hope that doesn't happen.
[00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:26.120]   - These things are such obvious targets
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.320]   because, you know, all you have to do is make a phone call
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:31.560]   to a special number that costs you 40 bucks
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.000]   and the bag that gets 30 bucks
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.680]   and it was worthwhile, let alone all the data you got on there.
[00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:37.520]   - Yep.
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:40.880]   - Number one, I also use this called Astro File Manager.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:44.840]   And this is just to actually look at your files.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.040]   - Yes.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.000]   - I don't.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.320]   - Just important, to every geek,
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.680]   one must be able to get access to the file system.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.680]   Even though a lot of UI designers would say,
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:56.920]   "Ah, the file system should be abstracted away
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.560]   "from the user, you shouldn't have to look at it."
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:00.400]   I don't know.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:04.120]   - I like being able to browse my folders.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.440]   - Yes.
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.560]   - I'm right to browse my folders.
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.320]   - It just seems like if it's got a file system,
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.000]   I should have access to it.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:10.840]   - Yeah.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.040]   - Bucks the heck out of me on my iPhone.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:15.080]   For some reason, I cannot get my photos off the iPhone.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.600]   Nothing will take them off.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.360]   And I just wanna say, well, let me browse the file system
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.120]   and then get them and figure out what's wrong with them.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:21.960]   But I can't.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:25.360]   So this is nice, it's nice that they have it.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.360]   It exists.
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:31.320]   So we'll get Kevin on, KevinPurdy, lifehacker.com.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:32.680]   That was his article.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:36.400]   Did you get a number yet, a tip, a tool?
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:37.920]   Do you wanna just take the day off?
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:39.080]   - Can we talk about Gmail?
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.800]   - I've got a number if you don't go to the news.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:44.120]   You just took one, 323 was the first one I had.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:46.200]   Which was a cheat, I know.
[00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.760]   - Gmail, oh yeah.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.160]   - Well, the Gmail stuff, yeah.
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.160]   - Gmail, what's the deal?
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.680]   - Yeah, so Gmail graduated a bunch of labs features
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:55.800]   and retired a few.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.960]   So I love the whole labs thing that they did.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.960]   So they have these experimental features.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.560]   Any Google employee can plug them in
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.400]   and anybody, you can enable them or disable them
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:07.360]   and it comes with this disclaimer that they might just break.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.520]   And what I love about it is that Google is using usage numbers
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:13.920]   based on who's enabled, how many people have enabled each one
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:15.840]   to decide which one of these features should get built
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.040]   into Gmail by default?
[00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:20.000]   And which should we get rid of entirely?
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.320]   So they use that feedback.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.440]   So I think that when labs launch,
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.440]   I actually flew to Mountain View
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:26.080]   because one time that I went to Google
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.600]   and they launched, I think, with 13,
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.520]   the number of features grew to 60.
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:32.960]   And so this past week, they graduated six.
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.680]   Search auto complete, which you'll see
[00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:37.000]   when you just start to search for your Gmail search box,
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.880]   you'll see an auto complete drop down.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:41.840]   Go to label, which is a keyboard shortcut thing.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.440]   The forgotten attachment detector, which is brilliant,
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:46.320]   if you type like, hey, I've attached this file
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:48.840]   and hit send without actually attaching the file.
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.160]   Gmail will pop up and say, hey,
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:53.320]   did you mean to attach something before you send?
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:58.000]   YouTube previews, which is just embeds a video in your mail,
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.560]   custom label colors and vacation dates.
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.640]   So those are now built into Gmail based on user-on-user
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:03.480]   in labs.
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.320]   They're now built in Gmail.
[01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.160]   And then they retired a bunch.
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:08.520]   Muzzle, fixed with font, email addict, location
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.600]   and signature, random signature.
[01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.400]   Presumably, because folks just weren't using them.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.960]   So I'm excited about that.
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.480]   You'll see some new stuff in your default Gmail.
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.600]   And I mean, the only way that I think
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.760]   that they can make labs better is if regular people
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.000]   could contribute features.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.680]   Yeah, that would be nice, wouldn't it?
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.440]   It would be nice.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.400]   It would kind of like wave extension.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.520]   Well, you wrote the Better Gmail Firefox extension.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:32.200]   I mean, that's one way to do it is to kind of do it
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.200]   from the outside.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.120]   Do it from the outside.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.320]   But the thing that's crappy about that
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:39.040]   is the minute they change HTML, it's all a JavaScript.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.560]   The minute they change the HTML or any of the user interface,
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:43.440]   it's not an official API.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.840]   You know, it's like, then stuff breaks.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.000]   So yeah, that's one way to do it.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.360]   But certainly more efficient to do it from the inside out.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.720]   So that's what I really like about labs.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.560]   And also, it's great because a lot of the labs features--
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.680]   in fact, when I went to the Gmail web,
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.760]   I went to the Google campus and they announced labs.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.640]   They actually had a printout of all the user scripts
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.480]   that I included in the Better Gmail Firefox extension
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.720]   taped to a whiteboard.
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.320]   And so he started with your extension
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.360]   and tried to make a labs feature.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.640]   Which was a huge-- like, such a compliment for me.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:16.520]   And someone said to me, well, were you upset
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.640]   that they were basically making your--
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:22.800]   to talk to your extension, not necessary?
[01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:23.960]   And I was like, absolutely not.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.800]   I mean, anything I can take out of it great
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.520]   if I can simplify it further, fantastic.
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.640]   So yeah, so that's--
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.200]   I really did the labs.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.600]   The labs model, I really like that they change--
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.840]   they're evolving Gmail based on usage
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:41.360]   with these experimental features.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.320]   Cool.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:46.760]   So if you go to Gmail and just click the little green lab
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:50.240]   flask in the upper right hand corner,
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.240]   then that's where-- that's how you get to the labs.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.960]   My favorite lab feature did not graduate, though.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.640]   It's canned responses.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:58.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:01.320]   Which probably only people with insane amounts of email
[01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:04.480]   like I get would use, but love canned responses.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.320]   And a few other really good--
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.440]   I want-- it's very sensitive to the existed,
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:10.480]   but I can't find it anywhere.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.440]   I want to be able to mark something just not just
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.000]   in a filter to delete it from now on.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.480]   I want to send the signal back to these PR people.
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.440]   And if the email has an unsubscribe option in it--
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.800]   Do it automatically.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.680]   I want to do that if I so request.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.720]   Oh, interesting.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.200]   Because the problem is--
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.240]   at some point you just make it with spam.
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.400]   And that's not in there.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:32.640]   And that's what they don't want.
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:33.360]   They don't want to--
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:33.600]   Right, right.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.480]   The problem is they don't know that you've done that.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.200]   I want to be able to mark somebody's email spam
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.000]   and have Google send them a message and say,
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.800]   this user reported you as spam.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.920]   What are you doing?
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:43.920]   Right.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.200]   Right.
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.120]   Just to get to them.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:47.680]   Because it's satisfying to do that, but they don't know.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.480]   So you want to canned response.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:53.040]   Jeff basically says, please unsubscribe me from your list.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.640]   No, that actually does the action.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.720]   Click on the unsubscribe.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.920]   Oh, that clicks on that unsubscribe.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.760]   They just snare.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:02:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.800]   And it's that, by the way, hit to be our people who
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.840]   send me irrelevant stuff.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:06.080]   And it doesn't like Michael Arrington from over here.
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.880]   But it's bad.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.200]   When I unsubscribe, I'm trying to shut you up.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:14.160]   Don't send me another email saying, OK, you're unsubscribed.
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.760]   Just put salt on the wall, people.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.240]   No.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.120]   Stop.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.000]   That's funny.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.120]   Somebody sent me a link in the chatroom to an iPhone explorer
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.240]   that allows me to browse files on my iPhone.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.320]   Thank you.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.480]   iPhone-explorer.com.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.120]   And I just deleted all those pictures
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.080]   that I couldn't get rid of.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:36.880]   So thank you.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.200]   Chatroom is very useful.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:39.640]   And I might as well mention to Jeff
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.480]   that there is a Suggest a Lab feature.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.640]   There's a link right at the bottom there
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.680]   where you can suggest that feature.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.280]   There's quite a few in here, actually,
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.160]   42,725 to be exact.
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.360]   So you might not be like on the top of the list,
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.280]   but it'll be in there.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.640]   I guess that could be your tip.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.160]   How about that?
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:58.720]   That's your tip.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:00.080]   Well, I actually do have a tip.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:00.520]   OK.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.080]   Just launched this week.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:05.800]   This is a-- there's a new option in the side of your Google
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.960]   Search results location.
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.040]   So I just search for hamburgers,
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.560]   because I'm going to have dinner soon,
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:13.000]   because I'm in the East Coast.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   And so if you click on--
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.840]   do a Google search, click on Show Options,
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:22.240]   and down on the left side, under--
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:23.280]   it says All Results.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.000]   If you hit Social, we've talked about this already.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.160]   That's results from your friends.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:30.760]   If you click on Nearby, you'll get location-based results.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:31.800]   Oh.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.160]   There's a McDonald's in Asbury Park, New Jersey.
[01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.000]   Oh, what a surprise.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   Yes.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.480]   Look at you even get image results.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:40.240]   Oh, local image results.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:40.880]   Hey, this is great.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.840]   This actually was one of the stories
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.120]   we were going to talk about is they are slowly rolling out
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.600]   the new Google Search UI.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.800]   And so there's a three column thing.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.640]   And if you don't already see these extra features,
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:54.920]   you're going to start seeing them soon.
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.400]   This is really--
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.560]   I think this is great.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.280]   Anyway, I can narrow it down.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.200]   Yeah, it only makes sense.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.000]   It only makes sense.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:02.760]   It's much more useful.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.880]   And you could turn it on and off,
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.800]   so it's not like you have to see it.
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.240]   All right, there's your Nearby tip.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.600]   And now, Jeff--
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.520]   Well, all right, the number is a bit of a cheat,
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.120]   but what the heck--
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.080]   What's 3.23, though?
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:13.600]   You said that.
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:14.120]   What was that?
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.400]   March 23rd, this one--
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.880]   Oh, OK.
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:17.400]   Verizon.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:18.280]   Got it.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:18.960]   It was a cheat.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.600]   I bet it was a cheat.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.640]   I do think we're going to try to cheat her.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.080]   So I'll use a news story here.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:27.360]   And the number is 100+, which is the number of companies
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:31.400]   targeted by the Google hackers, according to Security
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:34.400]   Vendor ISIC partners, this from Robert
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.240]   of Bill and the Computer World.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:40.840]   And that they've identified 34 hack companies
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.080]   that, for example, in a single command and control server
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.640]   used in the Google attack.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.600]   And the discovery of another 68 servers
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.680]   could mean that many more companies were compromised
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.960]   than previously thought.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:50.460]   Wow.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.040]   So they think it's over 100 companies.
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.600]   Wow.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:58.840]   Which I wish that these companies would stand up and say so
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.560]   because they've got to--
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.880]   Google's standing out there all alone and naked,
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:06.600]   fighting this.
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.160]   My tip of the week comes from the Google page itself.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:13.160]   If you go to google.com and it's a timely one,
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.000]   you want to know more about Chile and the magnitude 8.8
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:17.520]   earthquake.
[01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:19.240]   For those of us who live in San Francisco and live
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:24.600]   through a 6'9" 20 years ago, 8.8 is unimaginable.
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.400]   Google's got a crisis response page.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:29.960]   This is something they've always done so well.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.800]   And they're doing it once again with donations
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:36.000]   to UNICEF direct relief, resource updates,
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.840]   linked to the State Department for Americans
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.720]   with friends in Chile or family in Chile,
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:47.160]   a map mashup that includes a person finder where you can either
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:49.160]   say, I'm looking for someone or I have information
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.600]   about someone so useful.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.880]   And Google's always been very good.
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.280]   And it's good that Google does that because during Katrina,
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.320]   there were 100 people finders.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:59.480]   So you had to have a people finder to find the people finders.
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.800]   And you've got to centralize this.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.480]   Centralize it.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.040]   Yeah, and it's built on Google Appsbot.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:05.720]   It's which is interesting as well.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.840]   And that's neat.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:12.040]   So did they do this or did somebody--
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.160]   I'm not sure who built this.
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:17.840]   I imagine they did it if it's on their official kind of Chile page.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:18.320]   Yeah, it's on--
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.640]   But several people twittered this to me, this person finder.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.760]   It's chilepersonfinder.appspot.com.
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.240]   Right.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:24.760]   Very cool.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.760]   I assume that this was an internal thing.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:28.160]   But it neat that they deployed it on Appsbot so quickly.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.240]   Boy, it's just really neat.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:32.520]   I mean, this is where you can really step up and make
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.400]   a huge difference, and they've really done that.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:37.960]   It's Creative Commons, licensed under Apache 2.0 license.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.040]   Oh, good.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:42.200]   So yeah, it's a person finder at googlegroups.com
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:43.480]   for the mailing list.
[01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:43.640]   Right.
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:44.120]   That's neat.
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.920]   I think that'll be used again and again.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:48.320]   Facebook will be patented as soon as--
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:51.720]   I'm sorry.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.880]   I was sitting on the wrong screen.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:53.320]   There it is.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.360]   That's the screen I was going to show you.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:00.720]   Jeff Jarvis is the man in charge of Buzzmachine.com.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.720]   It's always great to have you on, Jeff.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.040]   Awful to be here, Leo.
[01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:05.440]   We're going to have fun in Austin.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.840]   We'll be doing this week in Google in two weeks from Austin
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.960]   from South by Southwest, which will be so much fun,
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.440]   wearing our Google slinkets.
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:19.000]   And we will have a chat.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.360]   And so we will go.
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:20.880]   We will go.
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.040]   I'll give you each a candle.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.160]   Keep the open flame away from the slanket.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.560]   And we will go down the road.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:28.960]   We're going about a block away.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.560]   In our slankets, chanting our chant.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.320]   Look for that.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:34.600]   It'll be a highlight of your South by Southwest.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.120]   Gina Tippon--
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.920]   I have one request for all Leo's fans.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:37.760]   They'll us out.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.360]   You know, we have a lot of fans in Austin.
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.360]   In fact, we did the screensavers in Austin.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.480]   And I remember we went to the county line barbecue
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.440]   in Austin, and they fed us all.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:49.920]   And it was the most amazing barbecue.
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.000]   They brought us a whole ton of stuff, right?
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.280]   And I ate and ate and ate.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.640]   And they said, OK, next round.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.640]   And they brought us a whole ton of more stuff.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.920]   And it was like-- it was an endless barbecue.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.440]   And then we went in the smokers.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.480]   And I still-- I think my clothes--
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:06.800]   five years later-- still have just a little tang of hickory
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.240]   from that.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:07.840]   It was amazing.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.080]   It was really fun.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:09.880]   I cannot wait.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.040]   We were going to have a good time.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:11.960]   I'm at the Omni.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.120]   Are you guys downtown?
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.600]   Are you--
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.720]   Oh, I'm at the old--
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:16.220]   No.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:16.880]   --tells downtown.
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.560]   Were you--
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:17.560]   --the disc--
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:18.440]   --the discolar.
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:18.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.440]   I'm across the street from the convention center.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:20.940]   Good.
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:21.640]   So we're all in the same.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.160]   We're all downtown.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:24.160]   You planned ahead, Gina, and did it early enough.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:24.660]   Oh, no.
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.240]   You're at the best hotel, though.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:26.880]   I did.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.520]   Well, one year, I waited too late
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:30.680]   and wound up hiking across town in Sandals.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.200]   And it was really bad.
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.320]   So now I book in literally like--
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.400]   gosh, it was like four or five months ago
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:37.920]   that I booked my hotel because I was just like,
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:40.160]   I will get into the Hilton.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:41.120]   But I like the Driscoll.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:43.440]   I think that's going to be fun.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.400]   I've always wanted to stay there.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.520]   I'm bringing Jake.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.520]   Oh, yeah?
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.560]   Well, we'll grab--
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:49.000]   Jake should come on the show then.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:49.520]   Great.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.720]   I don't have a blanket for him.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.720]   You'll have to--
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:52.480]   He'll have to improvise.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:52.960]   --fit in together.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.800]   He can wear a Moo Moo.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.440]   Oh, yeah, just one sleeve each.
