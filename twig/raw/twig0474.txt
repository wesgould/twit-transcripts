[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, I'm Jason Howell, filling in for Leo Lapour
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.600]   one last time. Today we've got Jeff Jarvis joining us, also Aunt Pruitt from Tech
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.400]   Republic is going to join to talk about a number of stories Google related. We've got tons of
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.520]   hardware announcements in October, not just Google's event. Where in the world has Larry Page been
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.680]   hiding? Oh yeah, his Caribbean island. Gmail offline is apparently giving Jeff an aneurysm.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.600]   Google Home Mini is the most popular smart speaker and more. This week in Google is next.
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:42.000]   Netcast you love. From people you trust. This is Twig.

[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.240]   Howell. I'm sitting in one last time for Leo Laporte, who is, he's got to be sad at this point. He's at
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.880]   that point in his vacation where like the end is near, and you're like trying to like squeeze every
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.920]   last inch of whatever out of your awesome vacation. But you know it's time. It's time to return to
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.240]   reality. Anyways, I've had a lot of fun sitting in for him, so I'm happy to be here one more time.
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.360]   Joining us this week, we do not have Stacy, but we do have Jeff Jarvis. How's it going, Jeff?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.800]   And I'm not in a hotel somewhere with horrid Wi-Fi.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.720]   Well, I mean, I guess we kind of had you last week for maybe two minutes, I think, about.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.240]   See, the weird thing is everybody else thinks you look like dead and miserable and you don't know it.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:40.320]   Right. Yeah, I mean, it was it was it was pretty choppy at a point. It was just like, yeah,
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.840]   this just isn't going to work. It looked like the worst I've ever had, because you guys were just
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.280]   forgetting it, forgetting it. We're not moving on. Well, we're happy to have you on such a
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.880]   personal light to be here connection today and joining us once again and Pruitt and I'm a huge
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.320]   fan of your work. It's great to get you back on tech republic.com. CBS interactive.com sounds
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.720]   like your your work is broadening at CBS interactive. Yeah, it is. Thanks for having me on. He is
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.280]   always a pleasure to be here. Absolutely, man. We're talking always good to have you.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.320]   Yeah, we were talking a little bit about the about things kind of catching up before the show
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.160]   and realized you were more or less you were in the path of the hurricane that just passed through
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.360]   North Carolina. And that was pretty crazy. Now, granted, where I live is about 200 miles inland,
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.200]   but that storm was massive and it just sat there. You know, I believe at one point,
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:42.560]   they said it was moving about two miles per hour. Yes. And it just sat there. My friends in Raleigh,
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.720]   they took a beating. But by the time it got here to the Charlotte area, it was mostly rain. So it
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:56.240]   wasn't that much wind. It was enough wind to knock down a few flimsy trees. But it was a lot of rain,
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.920]   lots and lots of rain. The poor dogs around here, they didn't know what to think. Yeah, no kidding.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.000]   Instead of going for a run, they go for a swim, I suppose. Pretty much. Yeah. Well, then it sounds
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.200]   like your neighborhood is okay. But like, but beyond that, like you're kind of stuck in your
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.240]   neighborhood. So you know your neighbors and your own community. It's nice. I have a decent
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:25.760]   surroundings near me anyway. So I'm fine staying right here in my own yard. Yeah, right on. Well,
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.920]   we're happy you're okay and safe. And yeah, and it's great to get you on. I mean related to this,
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.240]   we might as well mention it. It's a real quick hit, but Google apparently is matching up to $1
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:45.040]   million in Hurricane Florence relief. Apparently you can donate to the American Red Cross and 100%
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.120]   of that donation is going to go to the charity. And you know, $1 million in Google money is
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.000]   dropping the bucket. But still that's good. You know, that helps obviously.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.640]   So if you're going to give, you might as well give through that and get it matched.
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.640]   So let's see here. Where do we even begin? Do we begin with Larry Page, the
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:16.480]   obvious case of what's that? That's a little old. I don't know. Is it? I don't know. I mean,
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.680]   with this has kind of been, it's kind of been an interesting scenario, right? Larry Page used to
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.720]   be the face of the company. We have hardly heard anything from this guy. Meanwhile, the company is,
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:39.920]   I don't know, more under the microscope now than it ever has been. Yet he is mostly out of
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.680]   public view hasn't really been in public view since 2013 as relates to product launches or earnings
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.200]   calls. 2015 is related to any sort of press period. Like he just don't see from this dude anymore.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.960]   Yeah, I was saying we haven't seen him for years. So apparently he spends all his time on his
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.720]   Caribbean island, which I didn't realize he has a Caribbean island, but he does. Oh, I know that.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.360]   He has the power to be in that position and not be at these different meetings and things like
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.080]   that. That's why he hired the people he hired because he trusts in their abilities. Yeah.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:17.360]   And I mean, Mr. Pachar is a sharp cat. So he doesn't necessarily have to jump on all of these
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.240]   things in Grandstand and whatnot. That's why he spent the bucks to hire those people.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.080]   I want to move on to Google Island with Larry. Remember, that was one of his last major huge
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.680]   IO appearances was talking about having an island. Oh, that's right.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.720]   Yeah. With Google laws, right. So he's so I want to move on. Larry, come on.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.000]   By the sentence. That's what he's doing. That's what he's spending all his time on. He's creating
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.520]   his Google Island. What was it? Me.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:48.720]   Someday, maybe, you know, I think what we're leading up to is somewhere down the line. I don't
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.280]   know if it's two years, five years, seven years or whatever, be made by Google event.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:07:00.240]   Much like Apple's event is now made at its new spaceship campus. The made by Google event will be
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:07.760]   held at the Caribbean Island, the Google Island, whatever that ends up being down the line and
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.200]   I would love to get it done. I would love to get an invite for this. I'm just and I will go there
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:21.440]   and I will defect. Dang, I forgot to move back home. Yeah. Isn't that a bummer?
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:28.000]   I was I was with a Googler today by chance just having coffee and and and and I oh,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.240]   Pixel three next week. And I'm a big sister. You are a fan boy, aren't you? I said, yeah.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.240]   Heck yeah. So you've been you've been following. We're talking about made by Google. So we might
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:43.040]   as well just jump right into that. I'm sure you've been following Jeff because this is probably
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.360]   your next phone, right? The three or the three I sell. Well, you know, I found it really interesting
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.320]   with the Apple announcement. Who was it? Buzzfeed's reviews said, hey, it's fine, but you really
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:58.560]   know rushed upgrade really nothing much. And I can imagine I'm trying to, you know, every time it
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.520]   happens, I'm a chump, like Leo, I'll jump and buy it. At least I don't have to buy 20 brands like
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.840]   he has to buy. But I don't know, it depends on on whether the Pixelbook, presumably we have that,
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.680]   is magnificent. I'm not sure I'm gonna try to avoid buying both this time. I'll see if I succeed.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.120]   I don't know, you could be buying multiple things. It sounds like sounds to me like there's going to
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.560]   be a whole lot of different types of devices there. Obviously, the couple of Pixelbooks,
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.400]   we talked about that a couple of weeks ago, I think you were off on that episode.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:35.040]   But yes, the the Pixelbook lineup that I think there's going to be either two or three that are
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:41.600]   rumored to appear the Pixel three and the Pixel three XL, which we see some new renders that have
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:48.160]   appeared in the last couple of days, this time with Google's kind of fabric casing on the back,
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.400]   which I think they had a fabric casing a couple of years ago. They do, which I like by the way,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.280]   I like to do. It was a nice case. So I hope they do it again. It'd be nice.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.560]   So we're seeing more and more of these things. I mean, this is just the most leaked device in
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:08.000]   the history of the world, as far as I feel. Just, you know, planning that just ever so slightly.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.480]   Okay, make sure we leak a video or leak an image out on Tuesday. Okay, now we'll do another one on
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.280]   Friday night when we think everybody's out partying and whatnot. Yeah, just they know what they're
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:28.880]   doing. It's marketing 101. Yeah. The colors though, the mint phone looks like a preying men is pooped.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.040]   It actually reminds me of an expo. Do you remember the next bit, Robin? Yeah, yeah,
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:42.160]   kind of had a little bit of that color to it. Exactly. But yeah, I mean, white, black, and then
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:48.400]   hidden in the source code somewhere on that web page, somebody found a reference to a pink
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.000]   color. So why would the color of the hardware be in source code?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.800]   That's a great question. I mean, it basically, what this is tied to is some sort of a promotional
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:04.960]   page to draw up, you know, kind of interest and anticipation around the upcoming announcement.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.160]   And when you go to the page, it kind of has an outline of a phone and the back color of the page,
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.960]   the background is either, you know, this mint color or black, you know, with the two tone
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:20.640]   that matches the back of a pixel device. And for whatever reason hidden in the source code of the
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:26.960]   page, there is a fourth color that was not the phone. It's the source code of the page. But
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.480]   it references this fourth pink color. And if the other colors were actual colors of the phone,
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.920]   then it, then it, you know, one could argue, oh, well, maybe this is a fourth color of the phone.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.040]   Maybe they're going to have their rose gold or their pink color.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.520]   Or somebody had a bet. Can we get this? We can Google to talk about the green phone.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.840]   Exactly. Yes. How much of this stuff is being planted? How much are we playing?
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.120]   You got it on set crunch.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:11:03.120]   I tell you what I'm not going to buy. I don't think is the Google smart speakers,
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.640]   since I think I've used mine like twice on the show only.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.680]   So which one are you talking about? You're talking about the Google Home?
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:15.280]   Yeah, I have the Google Home thing with the speaker, with the, I mean, the screen event.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.320]   Oh, the one with the screen. So, so you. A home hub thing. Like thing. Yeah, I'm not,
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:26.560]   I'm not enthralled. Not really into it. I mean, I couldn't use it because my kids would get
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.360]   fixated on the YouTube aspect. Have you used any of these devices, the ones with the screen app?
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:39.040]   Yeah. I didn't want any part of them. I don't own the, the, the home max or any of that stuff.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:45.760]   I never really wanted any of those devices in my house. I'm connected enough with my cell phone.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.120]   Yeah, fair enough.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:54.080]   So I just, just never really had the need for it. And plus I like my audio to sound good.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:12:01.360]   So if I'm going to spend, you know, 300 bucks on something as audio related, it better really
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:09.040]   sound good and not just necessarily be something to put in my living room, you know? Yeah, the max
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.000]   sounds pretty good. But I mean, it is pretty expensive. It's kind of big and ugly. It is a
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.360]   little big. Yeah, and it's, it's pretty ugly too. Well, apparently, Google Home Hub is a device
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:29.600]   that we might see on the October 9th event. And this would be Google's own branded version of,
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:34.400]   you know, a Google Home with a screen, a seven inch screen in this case. And actually,
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   the back of it, if you click on the other image in that carousel with that shows the back,
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:44.000]   it really does kind of look a lot like the Google Home Max from the fabric and kind of rounded,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.480]   curvy aspect of it. But yeah, so anything that makes perfect sense that Google would want to
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:55.680]   have their own of these, it's interesting that they let third parties release them before Google
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.840]   got around releasing its own. They let the third parties kind of scoop them by half a year,
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:08.000]   basically. The only thing that bothers me about next week is the pricing. I'm not sure what the
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.480]   pricing is going to be, but I just can't grasp the fact that we're paying $1,000 for a dad
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:22.720]   gum cell phone again. You know, it's just boggles the mind. If I'm not able to run Premiere Pro on it
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:30.240]   or something like that, why am I having to spend that much cash on a smaller computer, you know,
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.360]   laptops are cheaper than that and laptops can run Premiere Pro.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.400]   Laptops really, really good pockets.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:44.080]   Right. There's certain value I suppose. I'm not saying that I've had $1,000 is the right price
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:50.080]   for a phone, but they are priced differently for better or for worse. Like it's not the same,
[00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.680]   but yet we're, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know how to explain it, but it is very
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.320]   justification. It is that it's the single device I use more than anything else.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:09.120]   Right. And that's part of your complaint too. But I, you know, so that I know I'm justifying
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.280]   to me and my wife, but I'm spending $1,000 on my phone. My wife who's kept the same phone for the
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:19.840]   last 22 years because they're all too darn big. Well, speaking of which, that was a fascinating,
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.760]   did you guys cover that much that the feminist outrage about the size of the Apple phones?
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:33.600]   No. I heard a little bit about that on Twitter that there are that that women complaining that
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:40.240]   they're too large and then bozos going after the women for complaining that they're too large on
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.720]   Twitter and back and forth is the usual wonderful discourse we have at the station now.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.240]   But, but they just, they are offering nothing but really large phones.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.880]   They basically, Apple is basically given up on the smaller form factor and
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.760]   yeah, I mean, there are a lot of people with small hands are complaining.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.600]   That's the smaller phones. Yeah. Exactly. Well, there's only one way to fix that.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.680]   Don't buy them. That's not going to happen.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.560]   Go down. When you got a texting, yeah. That's not your thing.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.080]   The only way you talk to them is texting.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:19.840]   My son is talking on a Nexus 6 with a shattered screen right now.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:27.680]   You think I care about the device. You don't have to buy these phones.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:33.760]   I'm still going to get sucked in, but we don't have to buy these phones.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:36.080]   That's the only way we're going to send the message of
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:42.240]   we don't have to have a $1,000 cell phone. You can figure out a way to bring the cost down,
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:48.640]   not to really rag on Apple, but they mentioned all of those recycled parts in that iPhone,
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.320]   but it's still $1,000. I don't get it.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.560]   Brand premium. I mean, there's a piece of it that is that also, right?
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.320]   It's like buying perfume. Yeah.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.560]   Right. You're buying a few drops of chemicals and you're paying a fortune for it.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.920]   It's brand premium.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:10.240]   Yeah, because you can say that the perfume I use or the phone that I use is the one that
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.960]   everybody wants to see in their hand. I got it. I was willing to pay the premium to get it.
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:21.040]   Jason, Dr. Android, if this word of business expense for you,
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:27.280]   what in a new Android phone would make you say, yeah, I got to get that.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.840]   Man, you know what? That is such a, that is a really challenging question for me to answer,
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.200]   because at this point, it's true. I review phones. I review phones that come out,
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.880]   and so therefore, I really rarely ever have to pay for a phone, because I've always got a new one
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:48.880]   to review or hear it twit. We buy the phones that we bring in. We definitely buy the pixels
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:55.760]   that I end up with. So my perception on this is very skewed. I do think that $1,000 is too much
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:01.280]   for a phone. I don't know. This is a really good, I've got the Pixel XL 2. It's a really good phone.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.000]   Yeah. What are you carrying now?
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:13.120]   Oh, you're muted. Sorry, that's better. I thought you were just saying.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.040]   I think you just really wanted us to guess.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.640]   Like, I don't know. I should know. So what is it? I'm sorry.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.680]   The Pixel XL 2, I've had both of the pixels.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:33.120]   I remember when I got the first one, and I did my little review of it and whatnot, and I thought
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.000]   the device was nice for the hardware, but I thought it was really, really overpriced.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.600]   Personally, I'm getting a little bit of hardware fatigue when it comes to smartphones, because
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:52.000]   they're not really innovating. The cameras are changing because of the software inside,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.160]   but for the most part, these things, they all look the same and they almost all do pretty much
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:04.400]   the same stuff, depending on how much money you spend. And it's just too much now.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:11.280]   Did we get too used to expecting really big updates? And now it's just impossible to impress us.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:19.280]   I think that's fair. But that was, that's because we were fortunate enough to be around
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:26.080]   this stuff all got started years ago, and we were able to see those huge incremental jumps
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:33.840]   each season when it was time to get a new device. Like I could remember seeing the Droid X for the
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:39.760]   first time, and that 4.3 inch screen just blew me away. And then the note came out and how everybody
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:49.200]   laughed at it being so big. And we just continue to iterate with these really, really nice features,
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:55.520]   and then finally it came to sort of a stalemate. We just started getting more ram and more disk space.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:02.960]   So are there disk space on the phone? I wish I had to put a floppy into my phone.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.720]   You hear it wind up and everything.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.960]   Yeah, they'll soon be big enough for a 5 inch floppy.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.920]   I don't even know anymore because I'm so much into the love of either Google.
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.040]   Are there three fools left who still sleep out to get an iPhone?
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.840]   Before it arrives? On the iPhone release day?
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.880]   I don't think I've seen that.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.440]   There's certainly not the news coverage of it that there was.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.520]   No, maybe that's why. I don't see.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:37.520]   Guaranteed there's a certain number of people that are willing to sleep out there and make sure
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.400]   they are at the front of the line for whatever reason. But remember that?
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.160]   They're not the same question we have.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.040]   Oh, right. Yeah, ridiculousness. Absolutely.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.240]   Yeah, I'm like the idea of Nexus back in the days with those phones.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:55.040]   They were not terribly expensive. They wasn't the best of phones,
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.560]   but you still had a pretty nice experience because of the clean
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:06.640]   operating system. And I wish that we could continue down those same lines instead of having
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.840]   to spend so much more money on these smartphones.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.800]   And people, I hate this, but people are going to continue to buy these things.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:21.280]   And it's just going to make it worse down the road, especially when you have Verizon and AT&T
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:27.200]   saying, "You know what? You don't have to pay $1,000 right now. Just give us $50 right now.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:32.960]   Give us another $70 next month. And then the next month, give me another $70 and so on and so on."
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.800]   And people are thinking, "Oh, okay, I'm getting a deal."
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   Well, the whole notion of the subsidized phone, just one day, just left.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.200]   All right. And I never went for the subsidized phone deal since I didn't want to be trapped.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.520]   Of course, because I'm stupid enough that I keep on buying these phones here after here.
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:57.760]   But I didn't want to be trapped. My last car I kept for like 12 years or something,
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:03.840]   and I didn't lease it. Well, oddly, I would be trapped with a car, but then I kept it for 12 years.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.640]   Sounds smart to me.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:16.000]   Yeah. And it does seem like we've got a bunch of hardware announcements coming up in October.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.880]   Everything's hitting in October, right? So we've got, obviously, we have the made by Google
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:26.000]   event happening October 9th. Microsoft has a service event October 2nd. Huawei has an October
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.600]   event for the Mate 20 and the Mate 20 Pro in London. Razer, we're hearing rumors pointing to an
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.600]   October 10th date for the Razer Phone 2. But beyond that, then you start to get into Samsung's
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.640]   event. They have an October 11th event that they'd now announced. Four times the fun,
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:48.000]   a Galaxy event is how they promoted this on their invite. It says more ways to express
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.360]   yourself than ever before. And there are rumors that point to this being a Galaxy phone with four
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:58.560]   cameras. So you're talking about ways that these phones can differentiate themselves.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:05.280]   It seems like right now the push is definitely around the camera and making the cameras as good
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.760]   as it possibly can be, which by the way, the Pixel does with a single camera and it's
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:15.600]   probably considered the best mobile phone smartphone camera that there is right now, one camera.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:21.760]   A lot of the other companies are just throwing cameras onto their device to like boost the number
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:28.400]   to increase the quality of it or so we can assume. The selfie sounds like it's the phones.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:36.240]   That's the fact that the matter of selfie cell phones and the better you can make that customer
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:41.360]   look with that phone in their environment so they can share it out and be brag-adocious all
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:47.840]   over social media, the more those phones you're going to sell. Samsung does a great job of tapping
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:53.520]   into the psyche of everybody and giving you all these cutesy bells and whistles to say, "Hey,
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.960]   this is going to make you look great by this phone." I don't buy into that.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:05.360]   Well, there are a lot of people that do, right? The selfie camera is probably the more used camera
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:12.960]   and a lot of people's toolbox than the other, the rear-facing camera. And then you're going back
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:19.280]   to the Pixel. The Pixel 3 is expected to have two front-facing cameras while still having the
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:27.040]   single rear-facing camera. So they're going all over the place. Google knows it's all about the selfie.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.400]   Yeah, I'm very curious to know why the two on the front. If that's a security measure for like
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:37.760]   face scanning. Yeah, I wonder if it's a sensor, an additional sensor. Yeah, or what it's for.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:42.960]   Is it for wide shots or whatever? So Samsung's not the only company doing this, like, let's throw
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:49.920]   a ton of cameras on the phone. LG also has an announcement coming up October, is it third or
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:55.760]   fifth? It might be the third. They say, "Come see what's next." They tout in the ad specifically.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:02.800]   LG V40 ThinQ. LG's fourth flagship this year, by the way. So they've been releasing a lot of
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.080]   flagships. The invite even says, "Take five." So it's hard to know whether that means this is their
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:13.440]   fifth attempt at a flagship this year, or does that mean there's five cameras? And that's what a lot
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.680]   of people are thinking. There might actually be five cameras on this phone, two on the front and
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:23.600]   three on the back. I'm waiting for them to put cameras on the side. Side-firing cameras.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:29.440]   Yeah. And you're the photographer of the group. What could you do with side-firing cameras?
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:36.720]   Hey, that's how you get those 360 images. I could totally see something crazy.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:42.320]   Lots of software stitched together, yeah. I could totally see something crazy like that,
[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:52.560]   but I don't know who has the guts to do it, because there is a market for those big octagons,
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.440]   or whatever, that has eight different cameras on them. I think Mr. Alex Lindsey has one.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:03.200]   There's a market for that, because it's an immersive bit of content that you can create.
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:10.560]   If you can put that on a phone, why not? But I don't think anybody has the guts to do it just yet.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.320]   Are you talking about, well, jump is one of the examples of jump.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:22.560]   That was it. Yeah. You kind of like 360-degree array of little cameras that create a full wrap
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:29.040]   around image. I guess, yeah. But I don't know how necessary that would be if you just had two
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:33.520]   fisheye lenses, one on the front, one on the back of a phone. That would be good enough, too. But
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:41.280]   who knows? Who knows? All I know is that in their phone companies rush to try and keep innovating,
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:47.120]   they're either doing crazy designs like the, what was the phone a couple of months ago that
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.400]   actually had the top that opened up. It hit the front-facing camera and tell the--
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:57.680]   The motor. The motor, which apparently was more elegant than I figured it would be.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.440]   Because we want moving parts inside of our smartphones.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.960]   Yeah. I'm not sure I buy that.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:09.760]   Longevity-wise, I don't think that holds up over time. But yeah, so they're trying to innovate.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.640]   They're trying to do what you were talking about. Yeah. I give them credit for that. But
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:20.080]   that's just something that's not necessarily practical. But then again, is any of this stuff
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:23.520]   practical when it comes to smartphones? Most of the time, no.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:31.200]   Not really. The one that we haven't mentioned is the OnePlus 6T, which OnePlus has been
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:36.400]   teasing pretty heavily ahead of a October announcement. I don't think we have a date for this yet.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:41.840]   Their latest bit of news, they've confirmed that there will not be a headphone jack on this new
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:48.160]   phone. So they've joined the masses. This is the first OnePlus phone to eject the headphone jack
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:55.680]   in place of an USB-C port and an included dongle. Samsung's holding steady though.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.440]   I got to give Samsung credit. They're like, "You have no credit for that. I don't like
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:09.040]   their software, but I love their hardware." Yeah. And the fact that I still use a dongle and wired
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:16.160]   headphones is one reason why I give them credit. Because I hate Bluetooth earbuds and Bluetooth
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:21.840]   headphones because it always gives me interference. I don't care where I go. I don't care what I wear,
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:29.440]   what song, what device. I always have interference with Bluetooth and it's annoying. But every time I
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:36.320]   plug in a wired headset, no issue. And I have great quality sound with my little Sennheiser earbuds.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:41.680]   I'd agree with that. I've come around a little bit on Bluetooth.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:50.880]   Really? Well, so the Jabra 65T Elite are the ones that I use. And I don't get interference with them.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:56.880]   And I expect interference when I use Bluetooth devices and I don't get it with that. I don't get
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.880]   any dropouts. I don't get interference. So as long as it continues to work just as well as my
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:09.520]   wired headphones do, then more and more I'm like, "Okay, I get it." But most earphones that I've
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.160]   used don't do that. So it's not dependable. I just happen to get lucky, I feel like.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.360]   I need to write that down to Jabra. What's it called?
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:23.600]   65T Elite. Those are the ones that I have. And they've got really great battery life. The
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:28.240]   little case that charges it up. You hardly ever have to charge that sucker. They sound great.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.480]   I feel like they give you good isolation. I like them a lot. And they're not that expensive in
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.760]   the grand scheme of things. They're like $160, $160, $150 somewhere around there. You could
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.840]   probably find out sale for $140. But yeah, we check those out.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:48.640]   So let's take a break and then we'll jump into a whole lot more news. We got a lot of stuff in
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:53.040]   the doc today. We've hardly even scratched the surface yet. But let's take a moment to thank the
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:29:02.080]   sponsor of this episode of Tech News Weekly. Sorry. This week in Google. Let me just say Leo's
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.720]   been gone a really long time. I've been filling out a lot of his shows. My brain is much.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.680]   I know in your sleep you talk about your other shows.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:15.760]   My apologies. This episode of This Week in Google is brought to you by Masterclass.
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:20.640]   If you guys have not checked out Masterclass, it's really something special because you end up
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.920]   watching kind of walkthroughs on people who are masters of their craft
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:31.520]   as far as how they do what they do. And they're brilliant at what they do.
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.120]   Yet you almost get to sit in the room with them and learn from them.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:41.040]   Imagine learning new recipes from Gordon Ramsay, photography tips from Annie Leibowitz.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:47.440]   So many other people. Like you go in here, you're going to see an endless list of recognizable
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:52.560]   notable names at the top of their craft. And you can do that with Masterclass. Masterclass offers
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:58.480]   online classes taught by the best in the world. Each class is shot with cinematic production

[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.040]   you know, it's broken up. It's almost like reading a book is broken up into chapters that focus on
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.920]   specific things and all of it's being taught by these people that you know very well. Samuel
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:25.520]   Jackson, he's awesome. You can learn from Samuel Jack. You know that's going to be awesome.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:32.000]   You can choose lessons from classes taught by over 35 masters. Malcolm Gladwell on writing.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.640]   Ron Howard on directing astronaut Chris Hadfield on space exploration. Like it's just kind of
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:46.560]   crazy when you start going through here. Serena Williams, Stephen Curry, and so many awesome names,
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:52.960]   Hans Zimmer. So you just kind of filter through the list. You're guaranteed to find something that's
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.840]   going to appeal to you. And whether you're doing this to learn specifically, or maybe you're just
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:03.360]   doing it out of curiosity, right? Like I love really good documentary and I love learning about things.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:09.600]   And that's kind of what I see in Masterclass. I might not necessarily be, you know, expecting to
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.640]   become a space explorer somewhere in my, in the course of my lifetime. But you better believe I
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:19.920]   want to listen to someone who's done it and experience through their eyes and their vision
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.960]   what that is like and what it takes to have that kind of determination. So it's really fascinating
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:31.360]   stuff. New classes always added, always being added. Whether you're pursuing your passion or
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.080]   developing your career, you're going to find a masterclass that is perfect for you. Masterclass

[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:21.600]   We'll see if I can prevent myself from doing that again throughout the course of this show.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:28.880]   I apologize. Hey, did you hear about Android Pie and the sudden settings change that happened
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.760]   on a number of Pie devices? Yes, I thought I was losing my mind. So it happened to you.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:41.760]   It happened to me. I'm sitting there trying to watch the weather reports and stuff at the time.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:48.240]   And I used you remember when I was on all about Android that that storm radar app that I shared.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.960]   I was going through that trying to follow the path and that little red icon popped up and I'm
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:58.960]   like, why did I what did I push to make that happen? And it just sort of caught me off guard
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:04.400]   and I turned it off. But it wasn't long after I saw on Twitter everybody was up in arms like I
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:12.640]   didn't turn this on. And it's it's pretty scary. But the thing is, I'm surprised it took this long
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:19.520]   for us as in the public to catch Google and doing something like that. Yeah. Well,
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:26.320]   I'm speaking of experience. Did you experience this, Jeff? The battery saver going on without
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:31.600]   me asking. Well, here's the weird thing. I swear that's happened to me like four times over the
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:41.280]   last year. Oh, wow. So there must be some combination of gestures and things.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.920]   Right. Well, turn it on that I don't know about or whatever it is. But yeah, it's happened to be
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:53.760]   more than once. And you know what? No big deal. World didn't fall apart. Sure. I kind of thought
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.240]   when before I knew that it was an actual thing that happened, I just assumed that it was like a
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:03.760]   butt dial like I had it in my pocket. Yeah. And the screen woke up and something pushed and oh,
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:09.360]   my battery saver mode is on. But then I then I realized, oh, well, no, actually, this was pushed
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:14.880]   out by Google. Google said it was an internal experiment to test battery saving features.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:20.240]   It was mistakenly rolled out to more users than intended. But what this story ended up doing was
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:25.600]   kind of alerting people that may not have considered it or thought about this as a possibility before
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:32.080]   that even when you own your phone, Google still can own your phone. If it really was.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.880]   But Google also gives us security updates and is like that that we're quite grateful for.
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:44.400]   Absolutely. Sure. It doesn't internal mean internal to Google and its four walls and offices and what
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:51.120]   not. That's what I would take is internal testing. If it's if it's going out to other users, then
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:56.800]   that's more like a pilot test. And then you would would like to assume that they notified a group
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:01.680]   of pilot testers or beta testers or what have you. That doesn't seem like this was the case here.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:03.760]   So I didn't like the word in in their little statement.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:10.320]   And you know, you brought up an interesting point too, which is that when you were looking at this,
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:14.000]   you were looking when you were looking at your phone and notice that it happened. It was right
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.560]   around a time of, you know, pretty pretty big disaster was about to was shaping was taking
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.640]   form around you. We talked about this a little bit on all about Android last night. My initial
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:29.280]   inclination was to be kind of what you're talking about, Jeff, like, yeah, of course, Google can
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.440]   do this. I kind of always assumed that they couldn't no big deal. I just turned it off and
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.800]   moved on with my life. The extension of this, however, is what if an accident like this does
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:44.160]   happen? And let's say in the example I used last night, I think it's perfectly fitting to, you know,
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:49.440]   this hurricane. What if what if they accidentally trigger do not disturb and what does do not disturb
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:55.440]   do it mutes your phone, it blocks your location? Absolutely nothing unless you have to notice
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:59.120]   that there's a little circle with a line through it on your display that tells you that you're
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:04.560]   being blocked from all this stuff. So hurricane is passing through. You miss a message from someone
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.360]   who needs your help or something like that because that happens. And then suddenly there's a big,
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:17.840]   there's a literally there's a payload attached to this mistake. And so to that end, it's kind of
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.960]   silly that an accent like this did happen. Sure, it didn't end up being a big deal as far as we know,
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:27.200]   but certainly could have. Well, I was thinking the same thing that there's this stuff where you
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:34.080]   can control your kid's phone. Sounds just fine. Right. What if what if your kids out and
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.560]   you know, at a party and needs to call you and you don't know every day, you know,
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.120]   four o'clock, we cut them off because there's too much phone going on.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.960]   Those kinds of it's also like people wanting to have theater is cut off all cellular access,
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.920]   but what if there's a surgeon in the room? These these uber efforts to change things on us.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:37:01.680]   Yeah, that worries me. Right. Yeah, family link is is the Google version of what you're talking about.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:08.160]   Right. They actually just had an update, which they're expanding their features to teens before
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:13.920]   it was just kind of narrowed in on children under 13s that parents could kind of monitor their use
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:19.520]   and everything. And now they're expanding it so that it can be used for teen accounts as well to
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:26.320]   do exactly like what you're saying to use assistant to say, Hey, gee, lock Heather's device or whatever.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:31.200]   I predict the next version of the story will be that husbands and wives can do it to each other.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:36.480]   Right. Well, you know, and there were a lot of people that that see changes like this and they're
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:44.240]   like, that's it's not okay. You're you're you're, you know, we're conditioning our children to live
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:51.760]   in some in some sort of a surveillance position. But I can see both sides of that, I suppose.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:57.760]   I mean, I'm a parent, so I'm struggling with certain issues along these lines, but my kids
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.880]   are still very young. So I haven't got to the really challenge. You just wake and reaganz until
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:07.840]   new technologies do things you can imagine. Yeah, totally. Just smart. Your kids are smart.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:13.600]   They'll figure it out. Yeah, okay. I know. Because you saw there was a study in why you
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:20.880]   I saw last week that looked at who's sharing the worst of the fake news crap. And they had like
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:27.920]   1500 of the worst of the worst. And then they looked at Facebook and who's sharing it. And guess what?
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:34.320]   It was white men over 65. And all these interventions we want to have the kids are sharing all the
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.920]   stuff the kids are fine. The kids get it just fine. They're fine. It's the it's grandpa and
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:45.360]   ma and her dad that are doing this. So the kids are okay. Kids will figure it out.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.840]   Kids will be all right. That'll be fine. We old fries because an old fart. The old
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:59.360]   farts that want to screw up the world. Kids are okay. Oh, yeah. Oh, I don't know. I think I think
[00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:06.240]   you're right. I mean, obviously that's that's the way it is. Like it's impossible for us to understand
[00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:12.960]   the depth of the level of understanding that kids who are growing up in an age where there is
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:19.200]   nothing other than accessibility to this kind of stuff. What their understanding truly is because
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:24.960]   they've lived their life through it. We've kind of emerged into it. And we've had to
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:29.520]   reanalyze and reevaluate. I'm sure there will be things in their lives that they will have to
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:35.920]   reevaluate and reanalyze because their kids will be the natives in that regard. But yeah, it's
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:40.160]   hard to know the right way. I'll tell you, it's real hard to teach and try to use Gilligan's
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:46.800]   Island references to work. It's dang it. That should always work. We're not dang it. No,
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.040]   what was it? What was that? What was it? You said we're going to do it.
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:53.760]   Dagnabbit. No, what'd you say? Oh, you're muted again.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:40:00.240]   Muted. I hate when I do that. That gummy. That's it. That's it. I think that's a show title.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:08.480]   It's actually been one ever. Oh, has it? It's on one. It's a show title one time.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.240]   All right. All right. That's your signature.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:15.120]   I think so. That and Brown liquor. To the moon, Alice.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:19.840]   To the reference nobody gets. Can I tell you my favorite story of the week? What's that?
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:25.680]   The smart replies story. Okay, so kick that one off because I think I may have missed this one.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:29.680]   So yeah, I put it in the last minute. So smart replies, you know, looks at all these responses
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.160]   and makes up a response that you should give an email. And I've talked about how I feel guilty
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:38.800]   using it. Like the human didn't really send you this reply, which says, yes, I'll be there.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.680]   No problem. Right. All these smart replies are there. Well, AI goes off our behavior. So guess
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:48.800]   what smart reply tried to get people to say often. Which could, by the way, I think improve the
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:55.760]   whole world. I love you. Oh, that was an estimate. I'm down with that. Yeah.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.720]   But I'm thinking, imagine, I mean, you got to you got to reveal with your boss.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:07.040]   Yeah, actually, that lead, I love you. Yeah, there's still that signal, though. You know,
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:13.920]   I'm down with that plant plant that's the Google. It may be Google should force us all to do that.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:19.120]   What that's, you know, this hate going around in this world plant that we'll see the above that.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.560]   I totally dig that as annoying as it may be to some.
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:28.240]   Don't even give us the opportunity. Just start sneaking that in at the very end of everyone
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:33.120]   or emails to each other and suddenly think of the impact that would have if suddenly everyone
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:39.120]   you don't even know. You don't even know. I love you. There would be change, man.
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:47.040]   With regards to the smart replies, I do like the fact that there's one little detail within them,
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:54.000]   and that's the exclamation point. Speaking with a colleague of mine over the years regarding
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:42:00.320]   corporate communication to people, and I had to train them up. I said, you know, you could say
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:06.320]   the same thing and put a period on the end versus an exclamation point. Yeah. And it just makes a
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:12.400]   world of difference to an end user. You know, if you just say, thank you, period, they just thank
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:18.960]   you. Any other IT jerk, but if you say thank you at an exclamation point, they feel like, hey,
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:23.520]   he has personality, even though it you're no different. No, so I was thinking about that.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:28.160]   It was something about that exclamation point really makes a difference. And I'm starting to
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:34.720]   see that more and more in the smart replies that come up in my messages. Well, and is that a
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:40.240]   but that's a reflection of how you communicate, right? Smart. I don't know. I don't like that.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.520]   You don't you don't you don't add a lot of explanation. I don't.
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.000]   Exclamation points. I have always used tons of exclamation points, almost to the point to where
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.160]   I feel like I overuse them. And so I've had to like peel back in the other direction. But I've
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:56.000]   definitely noticed my smart replies use them. And I just kind of assumed it was because I do.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.960]   No, it's definitely not. Okay.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:05.200]   Bremer said that she was dating a guy, Yale, which goes to this. And he and he had a rule that said
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:13.760]   you should use three exclamation points in life. And he'd already used one. I like you.
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:20.880]   I said, I said, I'm glad you didn't marry him. So I'm old enough, gentlemen, I am old enough.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.920]   Not only did I use a typewriter, not only did I use a manual typewriter,
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:30.640]   I was thinking about this the other day, I completely forgot this in in my day.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.720]   I took typing class in sixth grade. The way to get an exclamation point was you had to hit a
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:40.480]   apostrophe then backspace period.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:45.840]   Wow. So you better really mean to use the exclamation point.
[00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.840]   You had to do DIY exclamation points. Interesting.
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:56.880]   Yeah. How old is that? We'd be a lot less assertive if it took that much work.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:03.760]   Right. But see, my personality, I've always tried to be
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:12.160]   black and white binary, if you will, because I personally think that that keeps confusion down
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:18.240]   when I'm trying to communicate a plan to someone or whatever that we have going on,
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:24.160]   because I hate it when I was working in the world of support, saying something to a user,
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:31.360]   and they just totally go the opposite direction of what I was expecting or they felt like I was
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:37.680]   going to do a different action at a different time. And so I trained myself to just be as robotic
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:46.560]   as possible. It may sound rude to people, but that's how I got stuff done. Just black and white,
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:52.560]   periods, commas, perfect capitalization. Every now and then through an exclamation point,
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:56.160]   if I felt like somebody needed a warm and fuzzy, but most of the time, no.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:01.680]   Man, I'm so I'm so the opposite of that. And I realized it.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:08.720]   Ask my family. Yeah. Like I so often I'll write an email and then I have to go and
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:14.080]   in part of my checking the email is to make sure I have put in too many exclamation points.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:18.800]   Like every every sentence ends with it. I'm like, why am I so excited about every single thing I'm
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:24.400]   saying right now to replace them with periods? And I have to specifically go in there and do that.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.920]   I'm I'm I'm I realize I'm admitting too much right now.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:32.720]   I'm being a little too open to you all. It's because it's because I love you.
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:40.720]   So I just bought a book that I put in the the rundown. I see it. It's that
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:50.240]   doc chat is the is the shady characters, the secret life of punctuation. And and I love this
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:55.760]   kind of crap as geeky as hell, but how all of these these various things have the asterisk,
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.480]   the dagger, the height, the life of the hyphen and the dash. Yeah, you know what the manic
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:05.920]   you'll is? No, man, it was a little hand manic. It was a little hand that you put in point and
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:11.440]   something that was important. You very early in printing. Yeah. Okay. The answer.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.440]   It's too bad. There's no audio book version of this.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:24.240]   A little hard. I know. I would love to see how they pull that off. But it makes sense that there
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:29.600]   isn't. Interesting. That sounds like a fascinating book. But you know what? What we call the hashtag
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:36.480]   is actually called a pound, right? Nope. Nope. It is called the Octo Thorpe.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.000]   It's amazing. We don't call it that.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:48.080]   Yeah. Imagine the role would be different if it was, you know, well, just Octo Thorpe that.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:51.840]   Octo Thorpe life. Yeah.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:47:02.960]   That just doesn't. The Thorpe Yolo title says Carson. Octo Thorpe life. I guess,
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:07.200]   colon life. Yeah. It doesn't quite have the same ring to it.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:17.600]   Oh boy. That was a fun little tangent. Where should we go next? I have a feeling they're not as
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:23.120]   fun. Hey, how about the car? So this one's this one's real quick. Google Maps for CarPlay
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:30.640]   apparently is now out to support iOS 12. iOS 12 came out yesterday, I think, for iPhone users.
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:38.880]   And what does that bring? That finally brings from what little I know about Apple brings third-party
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:46.000]   maps to CarPlay. So third-party map app support. And now Google Maps rolled out its update today
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.880]   to support it. It lacks voice control through Siri. But apparently when you're running the app,
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:57.200]   it still has voice control through Google. So you can still kind of use Google's voice
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:04.400]   control to do the things. And Waze is going to have an update as well very soon. So that was quick.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:09.280]   I mean, that was a fast inclusion and sounds like iOS 12 is opening up a little bit more.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:14.400]   As far as that's concerned, so that's good. I'm not smart enough to understand how it works. But
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:21.040]   when you use Google Maps, Google collects all of this data trying to figure out patterns
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.880]   and where you're going, why you're going, what time of day and things like that.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:32.000]   If it's on iOS, how does that data collection work? Is that something that Apple has approved?
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.800]   Is it something that goes back to the Apple data centers and Apple uses it to make the experience
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:42.640]   better? I wonder how that works. Yeah. Well, and couldn't you just use Google Maps?
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:50.480]   And I mean, if you're of your laptop, right, you could use Google Maps just in your browser
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:55.360]   and Google Maps operates as Google Maps, right? Right. So is it that kind of relationship?
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:02.160]   It's just running. But even then Google, if you're running it in the browser, Google is looking at
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:06.480]   your IP to figure out your location and things like that. Yeah, needs to.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.640]   So I just wonder, because that's just data collection, and I just wonder how is that
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:20.480]   jiving on the iOS side and Apple trying to be as lockdown secure as it normally is.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:28.320]   If you use your Starbucks app, it says, "Find stores near me." And so you gave permission to
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:33.920]   share your location. Okay. Okay. So I think it's just it. But the difference is it's sharing
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:40.480]   your location constantly as it changes. Right. And what's the rule that are the other
[00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:45.680]   rules about recording that information and how that's done? Right. You know, because if I go to
[00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:51.680]   get into my vehicle right now and I put my I don't have a fancy car or anything like that, so I still
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:58.160]   use my phone for the navigation. And if I was going there right now and pull up the nav,
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:04.240]   it will say, "This is how you get to your son's school." Because it knows right about this time,
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.760]   you're normally going to pick up your son from school for football practice.
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:14.880]   It I never really navigate it to the school. I know how to get to the school. But for some reason,
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:20.480]   Google knows about this time every day, he's Monday through Friday, he's heading over this way.
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:29.200]   And I just wondered, how was that on the iOS side? I'm guessing that kind of predictive
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:37.840]   stuff isn't happening. Definitely not on the iOS level. Maybe it happens when you pull up the map,
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:42.800]   but I haven't used it to know. But maybe it would have some further insight in there because
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:54.400]   within the Google Apps world, you've given Google overview over your calendar and over your navigation
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:59.680]   history or your location history via Google. So maybe it could make those inferences. But
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:06.560]   yeah, I just I don't think it's a total guess on my part, but I don't think it's as detailed or as
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:11.040]   comprehensive in the Google Apps world on iOS as it is on Android.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:21.040]   We don't have a Google person on speed down. Oh, well, we have support as we tested out a few years ago
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:27.760]   live on the show. But I don't know if they give us what we were looking for. I don't think that's
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:32.320]   open anymore. I think that was like the Nexus help line that we got in the setting.
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:41.200]   We do or we did we don't anymore. This one though is is very interesting related to
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:49.520]   the car Google just announced that it struck a major deal with Renault, Nissan Mitsubishi
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:56.720]   Alliance and basically starting in 2021, they're going to start putting out vehicles that the
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:02.000]   infotainment system. I'm not sure how deep it's going to go will run on Android. So it's a really
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:08.720]   big deal for Android. You know, Google's been trying for years now to get Android going in the cars
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:15.200]   in vehicles. And I mean, we got to wait a couple of years, but this is yeah. And by the way, look
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:21.360]   at that 2021. What a ridiculous industry. Right. Fones are changing constantly. We got we got six
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.880]   cameras on our phones. They're they're doing all kinds of things. They're flying and taking the
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:29.040]   selfies of us in the car. We will change that in about five years.
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:34.240]   So it's kind of crazy. We're going to have to wait until then to see anything. But I mean,
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:38.400]   you're talking millions of vehicles. I guess you're talking millions of phones too. But I don't know
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:42.800]   why I guess the turnaround time on vehicles is that much longer? Maybe they already had deals in
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:49.280]   place that they got a burn. I thought I was in negotiations. Yeah. Yeah. That's true to the
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:53.120]   contracts. Yeah. I thought I desperately wanted it. Android Auto, I talked about the show at the
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:58.160]   time when I was buying a car and I went right on. I didn't end up getting it. Mazda is supposed to
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:02.160]   have put it in like a year ago or hasn't been in there. But then I had a rental car and put it in.
[00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:09.920]   I didn't like it. Yeah. It's so nanny state. Yeah. It does. It does kind of it does definitely control
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:16.880]   all aspects. I have it running on my phone and I have now I have like a Bluetooth trigger on it.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:22.640]   So when I when I turn on my car, it automatically removes the interface from my phone and replaces it
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:27.840]   with with Android Auto. And that's nice. And that says I can't really interact with it. And it
[00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:31.920]   represents what you would get it out of Android Auto. But there are there are a decent amount of
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:38.080]   times where I'm like, this is just too limiting like and and also as simple as it tries to make
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:43.200]   it, it still complicates things as far as getting from one place to another. You you don't want to
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:48.240]   have the tap as many times as you actually still kind of agree with you on that. I agree with you on
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:53.360]   that. Yeah. So but one thing that's really interesting about this partnership from what I
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:58.960]   understand, it's not necessarily a deal around Android Auto. It's a deal around Android deal
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:04.480]   Android as the OS. Oh, which is a big deal. Yeah. So I and I who knows, I mean, this is 2021. So
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:09.360]   who knows what that where that lands down the line. So it's all about admitting that they can't do
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:15.120]   OS consumer. Right. Consumer phrase. He didn't know us well. Right. Right. And so that's me.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:21.680]   Does that mean Q and X is officially gone now? Because Q and X was running on a lot of these cars
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:29.920]   for for many years. I don't know if it's officially gone. Probably still still around.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:38.960]   But I can remember seeing my Zorati at CES one year and it had this beautiful IFE in it. And
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:44.560]   when I asked what was, how was this powered? And they said Q and X and I said, what?
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:54.320]   It's just caught me off guard. Yeah. Oh, apparently, apparently there was an Android Auto update today
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:59.760]   too. So I guess this would fall in line. I guess this just happened. But the Android version of
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:07.280]   Apple Music now works with Android Auto. So good. If your Apple music use are on Android, then
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:14.240]   there you go. You're happy. Google wants everybody happy apparently. Yeah. See if you just learned
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:23.040]   that it'd be OK. Google just wants you to be happy. That's all they want. That's all they want.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:29.600]   You to be happy. They know attention to that man behind the curtain. Tell them what makes you happy
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:36.800]   and they will make you happy. This is fine. Everything is just fine. Just relax. Everyone.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:42.320]   Let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this weekend Google. See what I did there. I got it right.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:47.840]   And then we'll get into more news stories. We've got a lot more to talk about. But first,
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:53.440]   this episode of Twig is brought to you by Grammarly. For those who don't happen to know,
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:57.440]   we've talked about Grammarly on the show many times. I'm a big fan of Grammarly because,
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:03.120]   like, I think I'm an OK writer, but I definitely make grammatical mistakes and Grammarly definitely
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:08.240]   points them out to me and then helps me correct them and exclamation points. Yes, exactly.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:15.120]   You're a little too excited, Jason. And then over time, what I've noticed in using Grammarly
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:19.200]   regularly is that over time you start making less of those mistakes because you've been
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:24.640]   corrected so many times. I still use the exclamation points plenty of times, though. That'll never
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:29.280]   change. So you should check it out because it really does help improve your writing for all
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:32.560]   sorts of different occasions. It's a great way to double check your important papers,
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:37.920]   your documents, even avoid future typos. Like I said, they have a free version that you can use
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:43.680]   to get started and to check it out. And it's available cross-platform. So you can get it online,
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:51.360]   in desktop, on mobile. It's all kind of running on the device and out of the way until you need it,
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:56.000]   which is kind of the beauty of Grammarly. Grammarly's premium version allows users to personalize
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:01.360]   their experience settings to write for different occasions. So maybe you're writing for schools
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:06.080]   different than you're writing for work or when you're getting creative. All those things kind of
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:12.640]   have different personalization around how you write for those things. And you can have Grammarly
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:20.160]   remember new words as well. In addition to spelling and Grammarly, premium helps with advanced punctuation,
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:25.920]   structure, style within context, vocabulary suggestions, conciseness, and readability for
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:33.040]   different occasions. And 85% of surveyed premium users identified themselves as stronger writers
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:39.040]   and 76% now find writing more enjoyable. Like I said, it's out of the way until you need it.

[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:15.200]   Let's see here. We've got Google and T-Mobile teaming up on 911 calls, location. This has always
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:23.600]   kind of been a big problem, right? And apparently 80% of the calls to 911 operators come from wireless
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:29.840]   devices. And the big challenge has been that when a call comes into 911 from a wireless device,
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:34.720]   they don't have nearly the resolution on location that they do when it comes from a
[00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:39.520]   landline. When a call comes from a landline, they know exactly the location of that call and if they
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:43.440]   need to send someone out right away, they can. On wireless, it's a lot more elusive,
[00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:47.440]   a lot more difficult. For whatever reason, they've never figured this out. And I don't really understand
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:52.800]   why. It seems like a really important thing to figure out. Well, Google and T-Mobile struck a deal
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:59.520]   that will pass along Google's emergency location services via the carrier when those calls come
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:04.320]   through. So at least with T-Mobile, that'll improve things. I'm just amazed that things that deals
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:08.320]   like this haven't happened before. Make it work because that's where all the calls are coming from.
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:15.920]   It makes you wonder where people's priorities are from a business standpoint. But kudos to T-Mobile
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:21.200]   and Google putting that out because nobody has a landline these days. It's just it is what it is.
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:30.720]   Even a big office space uses some type of VoIP option instead of the traditional what they call
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:40.960]   it, POTS, P-O-T-S. What it was that plain old... Plain old... Plain old... Tailbone service.
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:48.880]   Television. Yeah. Sorry. Not say, I called this show Technus Weekly.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:54.560]   We can all have me a couple of us today. Exclamation points on me.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:58.560]   Octo Thorps too. Yes, Octo Thorps all around.
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:08.480]   What else do we have here? Let's see here. New Mexico has apparently filed a lawsuit against
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:14.320]   Google and Twitter actually going for both of them along with select app developers.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.920]   Basically, there was a UC Berkeley study that analyzed 6,000 right around 6,000 children's
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:25.520]   applications found in the Google Play Store. What they were looking for, they were reviewing them
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.840]   to see if they were in violation and if so, how of COPPA.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:37.680]   It basically enforces that data isn't collected on children at the age of 13 without parental
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:44.880]   consent. Google says that it's developers, says to its developers that they are the ones that are
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.360]   responsible for informing about their compliance. Apparently, all these apps were pulled from the
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:55.440]   Play Store's designed for families section. So that's no good if that's the case and yet they're
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.360]   still not in
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:03.680]   the story. Is Google accused of doing something wrong or enabling the app producers of doing
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.480]   something wrong? I think both from what I understand, they're basically saying, "Google,
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:15.360]   you did something wrong by presenting these apps in certain settings." What I'm saying is,
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.240]   I don't think Google collected the data on young people.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.840]   Yeah, that's really good question. That's really good question.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:27.920]   That's really good question. I wouldn't think so, but yeah, I didn't catch that data point.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:33.120]   It seems to me it's more focused around the apps and what the apps are actually pulling because they
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:40.240]   were tracking data shared and this was via permissions and all that with the apps themselves, data like
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:46.240]   personal information, location information, Wi-Fi, router, geolocation, insecure, transmissions.
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:52.800]   They're supposed to be secure in some way. That tells me that maybe it's on the developer side of
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:58.320]   things. That's probably exactly why Google says, "Hey, we tell developers you must be in compliance,
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:05.840]   so it's their problem that they're not doing it go after them." To that extent, I don't know why
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:13.920]   they would be going after Twitter as well in that regard. They're sweeping them all up, it sounds like.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:19.920]   I was just signed out of my account, so this might take me a few minutes to come back in.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:25.200]   Oh, Jason, I'm not going to have you do this again. Jason's going to mess up his password.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:30.000]   Jason was locked out. This was a classic on the show. I think I remembered this.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.440]   Yeah. It was a Google voice and two-factor authentication.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.960]   I felt so bad. Your face just got all pale.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:47.440]   It was awful. I remember, wasn't it Matt Cuts who rescued you? Got you back in.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:51.360]   Yes. That's Matt Cuts swooped in. He rescued me.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.360]   Watch out. Jason's trying to sign in again. This could be troubling.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.720]   I looked down and said you've been signed out. I have no idea why that happened, but it did.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.640]   It's so strange. It must have timed on or something.
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.520]   No, it's just like the whole battery saver option. It's just another signal.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:12.000]   Just another signal. Thankfully, I'm back in and my account still exists.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.240]   So we're good. You want to talk about Dragonfly a little bit?
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:24.720]   Got a few stories related to Dragonfly. Dragonfly is the censored search product that Google has
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:32.400]   been working on, reportedly working on for the Chinese market. Very controversial, obviously,
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:36.720]   because it involves a highly censored version of the search product and a whole lot of concessions
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:42.080]   made to make it operational by the Chinese government standards in the country.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.760]   Apparently, there's a list of seven employee names from Google who have left the company
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.960]   in protest that is actually circulating on an internal email list within the company.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:58.080]   Most of them first heard of Dragonfly with the original intercept story,
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:04.640]   which is what broke the news to everyone. The names really haven't been disclosed publicly yet.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:10.800]   I guess the sources on this story weren't willing to share outside of Jack Polson,
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:16.640]   who was a senior scientist who actually had been reported last month as having resigned
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:25.360]   in protest of the list. Obviously, there's still a lot of internal debate about this product.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:30.480]   I'm sure there are a lot more people that probably feel as strongly as these who have stepped away.
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:36.000]   You got to give those guys credit for standing up for their values and saying,
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.640]   "I'd rather not have a job than be a part of what's going on here."
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:49.120]   That takes a lot because it's tough out there.
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.800]   Well, I don't think it's too tough for them.
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:52.960]   Maybe not for them.
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.960]   But even so, I still agree with you.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:59.680]   I was thinking it could be different if they were protesting Walmart.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.120]   It wasn't another Walmart in town.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.560]   But I don't belittle what they're doing at all. I agree with you.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.600]   Importantly, too, I think that they're doing it in time that
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:13.120]   with pressure on, maybe Google will come to a census.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.320]   Maybe. I hope so.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.480]   Maybe. It doesn't seem likely at this point more or more.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:22.960]   It seems like they're continuing further down this path.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.120]   The intercept has another story that they published, another biggie that says that
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:32.400]   "Dragonfly is being crafted to link a user's searches to their personal phone number."
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:39.520]   So if someone in China does a search via this as yet unreleased Google search product within the
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:43.920]   country, their personal phone number will be attached to those search queries,
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:48.560]   which would ultimately, obviously, make it much easier for them to be tracked,
[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.160]   depending on what they're searching for.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:57.200]   Some of those blacklisted item search terms include human rights, student protest,
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:00.560]   Nobel Prize in Mandarin. That's just to name a couple.
[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.360]   It's scary stuff, man.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:09.520]   I'm scary stuff, what people are limited to in different areas of the world.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:22.080]   And then there were 16 US House lawmakers last Thursday who addressed a letter to Sundar Pichai.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:26.640]   I think there was also a letter a month before to Sundar Pichai.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:30.160]   Anyways, questions about the company's decision to return to China?
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:34.000]   What restrictions is it going to place on the search engine?
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.320]   I feel like we're hearing about those restrictions, but they want some sort of a formal answer here.
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:39.840]   What are those restrictions?
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:45.440]   If Google left China in 2010, why has it suddenly decided that now is the right time to move back
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:50.880]   in? And maybe this ties back in with the first story of the show, which is that we don't hear much
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.080]   at all from the people who used to hear about in things like this.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.880]   Larry Page is all...
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.520]   Sir Gibran.
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:00.320]   Sir Gibran.
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.440]   I mean, they're silent as far as this is concerned.
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.040]   A lot of that control has gone to...
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.960]   Why am I suddenly blanking...
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:09.920]   Pichai.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.440]   Pichai, yes, Sundar Pichai.
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:20.080]   Yet, in certain very public cases, Google has given the opportunity to talk about certain things,
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:24.080]   maybe not necessarily related to this Chinese search product, but the hearing a couple of
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:29.680]   weeks ago, and instead of sending someone, they send nobody. So it's just weird bottling up of
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:34.880]   information, this control of information that's happening right now from Google as a company.
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:41.360]   Unfortunately, we all still have to realize that Google and Alphabet, they are a business first,
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:47.200]   and with business, profit is what matters first. You're not in business for fun. You're usually in
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.160]   business for profit.
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:48.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:55.440]   You know, Matthew Iglesias, who's a political writer, says the Vaynerston just now on Twitter,
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:04.880]   that Amazon... Jeff Bezos realized the profit doesn't matter. Growth does. He hates profit.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:06.240]   Well, he doesn't grow.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:07.920]   Well, he doesn't spend a lot of money to grow.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:12.080]   But it sort of goes hand in hand in his...
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.080]   In his standpoint, his growth gives him what he's got.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:14.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   What do you got?
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   What do you got?
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   What do you got?
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   What do you got?
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   What do you got?
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   What do you got?
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.200]   What do you got?
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   Right.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:15.600]   You know.
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.960]   I get that.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.400]   Smart man.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:23.200]   It's easy to say, "I don't care about money when money's being thrown at you."
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.120]   Right.
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.720]   It's a whole different perspective.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.000]   You know.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.960]   It's about like the bill that Google has to pay you to the EU.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.560]   You know, it's a lot of money for some people, but...
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.280]   Sure.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.840]   But it's not so much Google or Apple.
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.120]   Yeah, maybe not so much Google.
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.120]   Absolutely.
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:49.360]   Let's see here, Google Home Mini, best-selling smart speaker in Q2.
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.280]   I'm not sure I would have guessed that.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.240]   I would have guessed that.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:52.800]   No, I'm going to either.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:57.120]   Did you listen to that speaker, Mr. Howe?
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:57.760]   Listen to it.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.160]   Like, I have them throughout my home.
[01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:01.280]   We have the...
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:05.120]   We have two regular Google homes in the kitchen living room,
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.280]   and then we have minis in the rest of the house.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:11.760]   See, I see those speakers as something that's pretty much good enough for
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:14.720]   shower time.
[01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.000]   You know, just in the morning shower and you want to have your
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.280]   ecstasy of gold playing,
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:22.560]   or are you getting ready?
[01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.160]   That speaker is good enough for that.
[01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:24.720]   Yeah, sure.
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:29.920]   But outside of that, I'm sure nobody in the chat room knows what ecstasy of gold is.
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:36.080]   But I just don't see why those speakers are so popular.
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.120]   I just can't wrap my head around it.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.960]   Price, low profile.
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:45.520]   Like, we've got them in...
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:51.760]   Actually, no, I also have an insignia alarm clock that has a system.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.040]   That's in our master bedroom.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:56.000]   That was actually a really great buy.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.800]   I have to say, we got it for like 20 bucks is normally 50,
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:02.880]   and it sounds really good for the price.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.760]   But anyway, the mini we have in our girls bedrooms,
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.480]   and then the den or whatever.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.840]   And in that case, they are not of discerning taste,
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:13.120]   as far as music is concerned.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:13.600]   Okay.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:13.920]   Right?
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:14.880]   They don't care.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.920]   They are stoked about the fact that when they wake up in the morning
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.400]   and they're getting ready for school, they can say, "Hey, G, play,
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.640]   Beatles," or whatever.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.440]   Thank you.
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:26.560]   And it'll play and it's totally perfect for them.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.400]   Would I put that in my kitchen or my living room,
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.920]   or expect great sounding high fidelity music out of it?
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:35.760]   No, but as an assistant device, it's fine, and it's pretty inexpensive.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.120]   I think that's why it's doing so well.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.040]   There are a lot of really good sales on the home mini that bring the price.
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.680]   Clearly a market for it that I had no idea about.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.280]   I mean, it's a way to get it in every room,
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:51.280]   which is obviously that's Google's goal,
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.920]   is to have an entry point, a price point that you can expand it.
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.840]   And I mean, like I said, in our house,
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.760]   we've got these things in every single room now.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:02.400]   And it's pretty awesome.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.240]   Like to be able to announce in one room,
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:05.520]   "Hey, it's time to wake up."
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.760]   And then all the speakers wake up and go,
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.320]   "Oh, good morning.
[01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.760]   It's time to wake up."
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.920]   And then suddenly two minutes later,
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.360]   "This is a live."
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.000]   It's awesome.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.600]   It's like my home is smart.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.800]   That's cool.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.360]   Remember, way, way, way back when,
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.320]   and like Brady Bunch days, you had an intercom system in the house.
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.760]   It's kind of the same thing.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:26.160]   Right.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.560]   It's not live intercom, though.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.680]   That would be pretty cool.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.560]   It's not that yet.
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:33.840]   But there was a reason it couldn't be, right?
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:35.680]   No, I don't think so.
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:37.920]   I think that'd be pretty neat if it was live intercom.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.600]   Maybe someday that we'll get that.
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.560]   But yeah, so the Echo Dot was the second.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:46.960]   So the Google Home Mini 2.3 million shipments in Q2 2018,
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.680]   20% market share there.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.720]   The Echo Dot was second at 2.1 million.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.280]   So the Google Home Mini edged it out by 0.2 million,
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:58.880]   essentially shipments.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:01.440]   Apple HomePod didn't even make the top five,
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.400]   but apparently it counts for 6% market share for the quarter.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.160]   But I thought it was--
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.600]   That was a little one.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:08.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:11.920]   In that realm, yeah, Apple's not doing nearly as hot.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:15.760]   Late to the game and super expensive is kind of what happened to them there.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.320]   So Jason, I know you discussed this a few weeks ago.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:18.800]   What's up?
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:19.280]   I was on the show.
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.080]   I was on the death of Inbox.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:26.080]   So we talked about that last week, and I wanted to ask you about it.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.280]   And in the rundown, there's also that Google's going to get rid of its
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.880]   browser app and just go with Progressive Web App and Gmail.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.160]   So I'm just looking at that.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:44.160]   I turned on Gmail for the first time in probably a year and a half or how long.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:51.040]   I got addicted Inbox to the updates and priority and quarantative stuff.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.160]   This is disturbing me.
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:53.360]   Are you an Inbox user?
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.760]   I'm an Inbox user, yes.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.000]   And I am really sad.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.440]   I'm having to come to terms with the fact that I'm going to have to totally upend how I'm using
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.800]   and use to using email for the past three years.
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:15.520]   And since we're both Chromebookers, now we also have a PWA app rather than the browser app,
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.240]   which just makes me a little nervous.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:23.040]   Is this stuff really going to be downloaded in the background?
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:26.160]   If I haven't opened up the Gmail tab.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.080]   Oh, wow.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:36.720]   So you're saying on Chrome OS, if I go to Gmail or if like they're sun setting the Gmail app,
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:37.680]   I think I missed that.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.080]   It's in the rundown.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.280]   There's sun setting the Gmail browser app and going with progressive web.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:46.640]   The offline Chrome app.
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.440]   Go offline.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.840]   Sorry, offline should be clear offline.
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:50.400]   Got it.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:50.720]   OK.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:59.280]   So now it's just going to be a PWA of progressive web app, which is fine as far as it goes.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:05.200]   But I just have this nervousness that I won't have opened Gmail for today's.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:09.520]   I get on the airplane and I say, oh, no email for the plate.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.000]   That makes me nervous.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:12.960]   That's a forced break.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.440]   They're messing up.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:16.720]   That's OK.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:20.720]   You still have that $1,000 tiny computer in your pocket that has GBP.
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:29.120]   So yeah, this has to do with offline only.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:30.880]   Roach, I'd use a lot.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.280]   And I think from what I--
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.640]   OK, I see what you're saying.
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:37.520]   So I missed the progressive web app aspect of this.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:41.920]   I just assumed that what it meant was that the Gmail site,
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:46.960]   the new version of Gmail with the updates that rolled out however long ago,
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.320]   enabled offline access somehow.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:50.880]   But you're right.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:54.880]   How would I install that if I was suddenly out of internet?
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.200]   How internet activity or access?
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:57.760]   Right.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.640]   How would I get to that?
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.680]   Yeah, now I'm curious how that's going to work.
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:06.400]   I don't find myself in that position very often, but that would--
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.120]   that would suck.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.440]   Users will need to enable offline access in their settings.
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:17.120]   And if you have a school or work account, your G Suite admin,
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:19.120]   you may need to allow it as well.
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.320]   That's a big caveat.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:20.720]   OK.
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:24.560]   So then I would have to go into settings on Gmail.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.640]   Looking to see if I can get--
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.320]   if I can find that.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:31.520]   And there is an offline tab, offline unavailable.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.240]   It looks like there is not enough space available for offline mail.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.120]   This may be caused by--
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:37.440]   What?
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:40.560]   It's a hard drive space or a web browser mode.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.400]   So where are you seeing that?
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.520]   Where did you go to that?
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:47.920]   I went into Gmail and then into Settings, and then into offline tab.
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:48.960]   The offline tab.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.400]   Oh, man.
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.560]   Is that telling me that I don't have much space on my Facebook?
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.720]   That's ridiculous, Jason.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.000]   And I don't see the offline tab.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:58.560]   Where is that again?
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.040]   Sorry.
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:15:59.920]   I'm in Gmail.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:00.720]   I go to Settings.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:01.920]   Yes.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.400]   I see general labels in box accounts.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.880]   And if you go all the way to the right, there's themes.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.720]   And before themes is offline for me.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.640]   I don't see themes in offline.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.480]   It ends with add-ons and chat.
[01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:15.600]   Oh.
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:18.480]   And then I have advanced and offline and themes beyond--
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:18.960]   Oh, there it is.
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:19.600]   Offline and the--
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:20.240]   So there's offline, right?
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:20.480]   Was it--
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.600]   What's the next line?
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.480]   Unavailable.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.040]   Oh, you know what?
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:23.280]   This is--
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:23.760]   Oh, god.
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:24.400]   I'm going to kill--
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.840]   I'm going to kill Jason on a kill.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:27.120]   I'm going to kill--
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:27.600]   I'm going to kill--
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:28.640]   Calm down, Jeff.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:29.200]   Calm down.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:29.440]   I don't know.
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.160]   Where's my pipeline?
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:31.120]   I don't know what it is.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.240]   You're going to guess what it is.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.200]   Is it Google Apps?
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.480]   Yes, it is.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:37.360]   Contact your administrator for further details.
[01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:39.600]   Google!
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.160]   I'm just--
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.920]   This is like--
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:42.720]   This is killer.
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:43.680]   This is like--
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:44.960]   This really kills me.
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.000]   Huh.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.480]   Now I got to go through 87,000 steps.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:52.000]   Whatever that happens on this fakakta thing.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.960]   You know, just to add one Android app,
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.480]   you wouldn't believe what I have to go through.
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:58.720]   There's literally like 87 steps.
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:00.640]   And now this is Contact your administrator.
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.160]   I am the F-E administrator of Google,
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:05.040]   and I have no F-E-N idea what I'm F-E-N supposed to F-E-N do
[01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:06.720]   to get my own F-E-N email.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:08.800]   You're killing inbox.
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:09.600]   You're killing the app.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.440]   You're not letting me do offline here.
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:12.480]   This is not cool.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.840]   Google, are you watching?
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.520]   This is not cool.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.800]   The entire company--
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.480]   I pay you for this service.
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:19.440]   It sucks.
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:21.520]   Oh, boy.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.560]   It sucks.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:26.240]   The entire company is watching you right now, Jeff.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:26.640]   And it's--
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.760]   You know, you know, I'm a fan.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.040]   I just said earlier, I'm a fan boy.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.640]   You know, I got all your stuff, right?
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:32.640]   This is so basic.
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:35.920]   You're acting like a cable company.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:36.880]   Stop it.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:37.200]   Stop it.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:39.520]   So--
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.200]   Well, I'm trying to understand my--
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.720]   So I get it on your end.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.680]   I mean, I don't get it.
[01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.720]   I don't get why it is.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.280]   Watch out.
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:45.520]   I get it.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:46.560]   Watch out.
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:47.520]   So let's--
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.080]   Empathy or--
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:48.480]   Come on.
[01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.040]   But--
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.640]   So I'm looking at mine.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.000]   Mine is not a Google Apps account.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.120]   This is my personal account, my normal personal Gmail account.
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.640]   It says offline unavailable.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.280]   Are you getting the same not enough space or it's a different?
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:01.040]   Though I just says offline unavailable,
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:03.440]   contact your administrator for further details.
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.360]   As if they gave me any details.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.120]   It's not just further details.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:09.600]   I got to contact me to find out what I don't know.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.880]   You didn't get an email notification about it
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:13.920]   or anything like that.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.440]   You just had to read a press release.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.840]   Oh, geez.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:21.440]   So for me, it says it's a space.
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.920]   It says there's not enough space available for all of my men.
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.000]   So go to--
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.920]   How do you find out what your space is on your machine?
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:28.720]   So my machine has 93.8 gigs available.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.160]   Jesus.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:36.400]   My Gmail account is at 8% full.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.640]   Plus it's only supposed to-- oh, that's obnoxious now.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:39.120]   Wow.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.200]   It's only supposed to do 90 days worth anyway.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.800]   It's only supposed to deliver the amount of email.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.800]   Yeah, I don't believe it when it says that.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:50.720]   I think I've looked at both things that could possibly be either Gmail space
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.240]   or my device space.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.560]   And neither of them are anywhere near full.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.480]   In fact, they're near empty.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.160]   I don't know.
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:01.200]   So I search for G Suite offline Gmail.
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.880]   First thing is Chrome app, which is what they're getting rid of.
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:12.240]   Well, I suppose they did just mention or just announce these things, but still.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.240]   Still.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:18.560]   So I go to the Enable Gmail web offline for your domain.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.880]   In your Google Admin console--
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   console, go to-- this is torture, torture, torture.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.040]   Where's Tofo when you need him?
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:32.560]   Yeah, well, he was on last week and we were going around the horn about--
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.400]   Oh, we got to get him roused up about this.
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.120]   Yeah, that's a great idea.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:35.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:38.640]   Kevin, Kevin, if you're watching, get roused up, please.
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.000]   We need to talk to them.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.680]   Stand on behalf of Chrome OS users world around.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:44.880]   I just fixed this, Kevin.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:50.160]   I just really don't want to have to get used to not using inbox again and switching over all of my bundles.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.360]   Like, I love the bundles.
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:52.000]   I use them.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.520]   Just bummed.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.040]   And too.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:59.360]   I'm an inefficient email user.
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:05.680]   Inbox never really worked for me in my workflow, so I never really jumped into it.
[01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:09.120]   I'm not an inbox zero kind of person.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.080]   I don't.
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:10.560]   No, I don't.
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:16.080]   I don't have stuff in there that's just stored for years or what have you in different folders.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:19.840]   And then, far as my actual inbox, I'll keep things in there.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:27.280]   Mark this on red just as like a reminder for me to, you know, knock something out eventually,
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:33.840]   you know, if it's really bad, I'll take those emails and put them on my, on my calendar as a task
[01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:34.800]   or something like that.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:42.240]   But I never really needed what inbox tried to offer users as a way of managing their messages.
[01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.680]   Never really needed it.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.440]   When I open Gmail, it just looks really cluttered to me.
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:48.400]   And it does.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:49.680]   Same here.
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.040]   The one thing I missed in box.
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.240]   It's a lot slower too.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.240]   I missed one thing in inbox.
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.080]   One thing, one thing only, which was Marcus on red.
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:56.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:01.360]   Because I see something is, no, no, no, I don't want to, I want to, I want to come back to that.
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.840]   So I'm Marcus on red and Gmail and it never was an inbox.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:04.960]   It never was an inbox.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.240]   I was always, so.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:09.600]   So then you'd find yourself like I'd get a, I'd get a notification and I'd be like,
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.920]   don't tap it because I wanted to stay on red.
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:12.480]   Exactly.
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.720]   Show me just enough for my notification.
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:15.040]   Okay.
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:15.920]   I think.
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:17.280]   That's where I was done.
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.000]   Just kind of.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:18.480]   It's like.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:19.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:21.920]   It totally screwed up my workflow.
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.440]   So I was done right then.
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:26.960]   I may have had inbox on my phone for an hour.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:27.520]   Oh.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.800]   It didn't last.
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.240]   No, I like it and I'm going to miss it.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:36.160]   Maybe my problem with Gmail is that I have the view wrong.
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:42.240]   I had it on default and it shows all the like little attachments and pill shaped
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:43.440]   levels and stuff.
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.800]   I think I tried cozy.
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.840]   I believe that's what I.
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.600]   After pulling compact or the other ones.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.680]   Well, maybe it was comfortable.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.680]   Either way, I don't.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:59.040]   It's still a little too small and a little too much too slow compared to what it used to run like.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:03.840]   So then is Gmail what you actually use and or have you found like a third party solution?
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:04.080]   Nope.
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:04.960]   I use Gmail.
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:10.000]   I route everything from personal to business through Gmail one way or another.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.920]   Google. So I'm doing the instructions right now.
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:18.000]   Go to your apps G Suite Gmail user settings.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.600]   So I click on that link to do that.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:24.160]   And then it says scroll down to offline.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:24.560]   It's not there.
[01:22:24.560 --> 01:22:25.840]   Huh.
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.040]   I will bother you.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.720]   I won't bother the world with this anymore right now.
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.360]   I promise, but.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:31.440]   Frustrating.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:34.080]   Frustration.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.880]   We have the Google change law.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:40.560]   There is a Google rant with Mr.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:41.120]   Dart Mr.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.480]   Jarvis and Mr.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:45.360]   Tofel that that Google rage log.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.400]   Yes.
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:46.800]   I got it.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:47.200]   I got it.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:47.680]   Enable.
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:49.520]   Oh, you did it.
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:49.840]   Say.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:52.000]   You know, let's see if it works.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:52.160]   Okay.
[01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:55.280]   So save loading loading loading loading.
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:56.720]   That's a new podcast.
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:57.680]   The Google rage log.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:58.560]   Loading loading loading.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:04.080]   You can you can have that.
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.320]   Yeah, loading loading loading loading loading loading.
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.680]   Why is it so hard Google?
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:08.320]   What's the problem?
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:08.960]   Not going to work.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:10.960]   Studies will say.
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.080]   So now I'm going to reset.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:14.960]   I'm going to go to my Gmail settings.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:17.760]   And see, I've been still in a real.
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.920]   Chromebook for a couple of months.
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:20.720]   Unavailability.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:21.680]   Totally behind.
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:24.960]   Still unavailable.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.560]   Dang.
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.280]   After all that.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:28.800]   Not even available.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.600]   All right.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:30.560]   Well, enough of that.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:30.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:31.360]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:32.160]   That's okay.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:35.280]   I wanted to make sure that we we resolved it somehow.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.400]   And even after all that.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:37.440]   Yeah, even.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:40.640]   Well, we resolved it to the point to know that even when you jump through all the hoops,
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.680]   you still didn't make it through.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:42.400]   Kevin's hopeful.
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.480]   We got to get him really mad about this.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:46.560]   Or I'm fine, Kevin.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.760]   If you belittle me and say,
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.200]   Oh, Jeff, this is really easy.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:49.920]   Let me show you how.
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:50.400]   That's fine.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:50.880]   That's fine.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:51.600]   Because they don't know.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.200]   It's fixed.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.800]   Because then there's a resolution.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:54.960]   Right.
[01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:56.320]   Exactly.
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.360]   That's totally cool.
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.920]   Speaking of the change log,
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.320]   why don't we jump into the Google change log?
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:05.840]   The Google change log.
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:15.600]   Chrome OS 9 is rolling out now.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.960]   If you haven't got it already,
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:17.600]   probably have.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:18.800]   But if you haven't,
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:21.520]   you can look forward to a new material theme.
[01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:27.200]   Lots of white and pill shaped bars and bubbliness.
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.920]   You probably like the changes.
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.320]   An improved and more powerful omnibar.
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.240]   Some more stuff happens in the omnibar.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.520]   Linux for Chromebook beta is now supported,
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:40.000]   running Linux apps, editors, command line tools,
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:40.720]   that sort of stuff.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.000]   There's a nightlight mode for shifting the color display
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.280]   based on sunrise, sunset, and that sort of stuff.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.440]   And a whole lot more.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:53.040]   Did you guys get the Chrome OS 69 update?
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.200]   See your tabs are kind of like rounded now.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:56.960]   Yeah, it's pretty.
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:57.680]   Pretty.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:58.560]   Bubbly tails.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.320]   All about the bubbly things.
[01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:00.960]   Well, pretty.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.920]   RCS, that's rich communication services.
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:07.040]   We definitely talked about in previous episodes.
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:08.400]   Support on iAndroid.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.880]   Hardly ubiquitous standard at this point,
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.320]   as much as Google would like it to be.
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:15.840]   So now Google and Samsung have announced
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:20.000]   that Samsung is further committing to Google's RCS standard,
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.960]   which is probably going to help along those lines.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.000]   Oh, that's big.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.520]   There's going to be a number of older Samsung devices
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.080]   that will now work with Google's RCS technology,
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:33.120]   along with all new Samsung devices going forward.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:38.320]   Samsung obviously is the biggest manufacturer of Android devices.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.720]   So this is, yeah, it's kind of a big deal.
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.080]   If you're looking for broad support,
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.680]   this is a great way to cover a heck of a lot of devices in one swoop.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:48.640]   Now we just got to get the carriers kind of on board as well.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:49.360]   That's awesome.
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.080]   That's awesome.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:51.280]   Kudos, Samsung.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.560]   Yeah, not bad.
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:57.440]   Google's mobile app development tool, Fabric, is going away.
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.680]   It's not going away, really.
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:00.960]   It's folding into Firebase,
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:06.640]   which is Google's current mobile and app development platform.
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:08.800]   And so if you're using Fabric,
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:13.520]   you should know that support for that is going to end mid 2019.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.320]   But like I said,
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:15.840]   that's going to fold into Firebase.
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.200]   So transition over to Firebase, if you have not already.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.280]   And then air quality mapping via Street View Cars
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:24.320]   has been happening for a while.
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:25.200]   They've been testing it.
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:31.040]   They're now expanding this with 50 newly equipped Street View Cars
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:33.200]   that are ready to do this type of data collection.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.800]   It allows them to kind of show snapshots
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:41.040]   at a moment of time of air quality in a particular area
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.160]   that the car happens to be.
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:45.440]   That's kind of fuel for data scientists to use
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.120]   with other air quality models.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.080]   So kind of using these vehicles that they already have out,
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:53.200]   the fleet of cars already out there to generate data
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.160]   that can be really useful for research and a whole lot more.
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:59.120]   I didn't get a chance to read this about the AMP project.
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:01.040]   I'm wondering, Jeff, if you did, do you--
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.520]   This is, yeah, this was important.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.880]   So Leo, we're here.
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.000]   You can start with ZamP Rant.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.960]   Not Ant Rant.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:09.760]   AMP Rant.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:15.200]   So when Google started AMP, Accelerated Mobile Pages,
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.520]   which we won't bother explaining it again,
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:18.720]   is I think you want to know what it is,
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:20.720]   they said it would be an open source project,
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:21.920]   but Google was running it.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.400]   And the question always was the governance.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.880]   Now, they had plenty of contributors to the code,
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.720]   and they were open a lot of ways,
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:30.480]   but Google was still the boss.
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.920]   Well, they hit the point now.
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:32.800]   They say it's a scale,
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.800]   but I think it's also just the right thing to do
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:36.160]   where they're opening it up.
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:41.520]   So there'll be a high Puma Chamber of contributors
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.560]   who will decide things,
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:43.680]   and it'll be more open source,
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.440]   which I think will give it more faith
[01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.280]   in the marketplace, so I think it's a good move.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.360]   Even if you are messing up why email Google
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.480]   says something nice about you.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:54.240]   Every nice thing has to be balanced with the criticism.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:57.440]   That's how we make sure that Google continues to improve.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:00.640]   And finally, YouTube Gaming,
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:03.360]   that app that apparently had no reason to exist
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.400]   outside of YouTube itself.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.160]   I think Google is now realizing that.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.960]   They released this app, YouTube Gaming,
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.120]   to be kind of the home hub for gaming content with YouTube,
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:14.480]   and I think now they're realizing
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.680]   that, hey, YouTube's a great place for that to be hosted.
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.360]   So we'll put a tab in YouTube instead,
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:20.880]   and you can get to it from there.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.160]   So as far as I understand,
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.600]   that's kind of the changes being made.
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.600]   The YouTube Gaming app is going to go away.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:30.080]   It's all going to be folded into the YouTube experience itself.
[01:28:30.080 --> 01:28:34.160]   And I'm guessing that somewhere down the line,
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.880]   Google Play music is folding into YouTube music.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.320]   Somewhere down the line,
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.400]   they're going to make this realization with YouTube music,
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.040]   and then YouTube music is going to become a tab inside of YouTube,
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:45.840]   and it'll just be even that much more confusing.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:50.560]   I don't fault them for trying to silo the whole gaming platform.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:51.680]   Oh, totally.
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.320]   But it is what it is.
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:56.960]   Everybody still just watches it on YouTube or Twitch.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:57.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:00.400]   Well, and you can still get to that gaming experience.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:04.080]   Actually, they're making improvements to finding
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:06.560]   the channels dedicated to games.
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:07.760]   This is the Fortnite channel.
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:10.880]   These are all the people that are broadcasting with Fortnite.
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:15.360]   I just realized Kevin C Tofel in chat.
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.000]   Oh, good.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:16.480]   Did you guys see this?
[01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:17.360]   Or in the chat?
[01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.080]   Whatever, anyways.
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:21.840]   Says, "Bring it on.
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:27.440]   I'm trying to see if he has any sort of insight into what you are saying."
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:28.720]   This is really simple, Jeff.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:30.000]   Just switch to Yahoo Mail.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:30.480]   Oh, OK.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:30.960]   There you go.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:31.440]   There you go.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:33.040]   There's your solution.
[01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:33.360]   Funny.
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:34.800]   Cool.
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:38.160]   Thank you for bringing the solution to Jeff's problem.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.360]   This is how you troll, folks.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:42.800]   I'm going to switch to MCi Mail.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:47.600]   And that is the Google change log.
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:50.800]   What do I like you Kevin Tofel?
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:54.560]   Let's see here.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:57.840]   Before I get to the final ad and then we get to tips and tricks and anything.
[01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:00.880]   He said later on, he said, "I joined late, so not sure what you were discussing."
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:08.720]   Still, well, I think even if you didn't know, you knew.
[01:30:09.200 --> 01:30:10.960]   Because you played it very well.
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:15.120]   Any last story that you want to get in there before we do the last ad and do number stuff?
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:15.360]   Oh, OK.
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:15.920]   All right.
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:16.640]   Hold on.
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:16.960]   I don't know.
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:17.760]   I just want to make sure that--
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:18.080]   Thanks, though.
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.680]   Oh, I thought this was interesting.
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:20.960]   Path is going away.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:21.600]   Remember path?
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.600]   Yeah, I do remember path.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.240]   Yeah, path.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.680]   It was a challenge at Facebook.
[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:28.880]   Once almost bought by Google, if I remember correctly,
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.800]   Google was going to buy path.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:33.840]   And I'm not sure exactly what happened.
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:34.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:34.880]   That's right.
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:38.400]   I tried to buy it for $100 million when it was just months old.
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.760]   It says, "The TechCrunch article."
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:40.960]   Wow.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.160]   Well, that was a mistake.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:44.800]   And if you only knew at that point--
[01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:50.720]   Really, when you're at that crossroads, you can go two different directions and
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:53.120]   you can take the money now or you can bet on the future.
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:54.320]   Obviously, they bet on the future.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:57.600]   You don't know at that moment whether that was the right bet or not.
[01:30:57.600 --> 01:30:58.160]   But obviously--
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:58.640]   This is true.
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:00.480]   It's as zero.
[01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:05.280]   A lot of companies bet on the future and it doesn't happen.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.280]   But anyways, they're going away.
[01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:08.400]   Any others?
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:16.320]   Well, so Mark Benioff spent $190 million buying Time magazine when he could have just
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:17.600]   subscribed to it for $30.
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:24.160]   He really wants to make sure he keeps getting the subscription delivered to his doing.
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:25.680]   You know, I don't know what I would do with Time magazine.
[01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:27.520]   What was the last time you bought a Time magazine either of you?
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.120]   Well, three years.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.720]   Oh, I don't even know.
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:31.440]   Too long for--
[01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:34.400]   I don't know if I've ever bought a Time magazine, to be honest.
[01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:39.920]   They always have some of the best photography, but I hardly ever pick up one to keep.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:42.080]   But I love their photographers, so.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.840]   I mean, it used to--
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:45.680]   That used to be a powerhouse magazine.
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.040]   That was like a must.
[01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.440]   It was, but who needs a general interest magazine anymore?
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.640]   So if the--
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:54.480]   Hey, Mowgles out there, if you're going to put big money into saving journalism,
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:55.680]   I got some ideas for you.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:56.800]   Just call them.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.280]   Mark, hit Jeff up.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:01.360]   He's got ideas.
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:05.280]   OnePlus has a TV that they're going to release.
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:06.240]   That's kind of cool.
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:07.360]   They're going to do a TV.
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:08.960]   You're pretty soon, I think.
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:11.760]   And you can actually help name it, you know, because they like to do their--
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:15.840]   They not learn from their previous mistakes.
[01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:16.320]   I don't know.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.240]   The name and convention.
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:24.400]   What was the TV, McTV box or something like that?
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:27.200]   Yes, right.
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:30.480]   Or McTV pants or whatever.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.960]   I don't think it's going to be the kind of thing where the community votes
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:36.000]   whatever it ends up being.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.680]   They have to do it.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:40.800]   But I think they're opening it up for ideas.
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:44.880]   And if you're part of the community, you can give your idea and maybe it'll be chosen.
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:48.160]   But yeah, I think they're giving themselves more control.
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:49.600]   What are you showing us, Jeff?
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.640]   I don't know if you can see.
[01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:51.120]   Barely see.
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:53.120]   There's a turkey's in deer in my backyard.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:53.680]   Turkeys in deer.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:54.080]   Wow.
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:54.960]   There's some turkeys.
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:56.400]   That looks like my backyard, man.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.320]   And there's some deer just hanging out together.
[01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.520]   Dude, that is so cool.
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:32:59.920]   I wish--
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:00.880]   I wish in the kingdom.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:03.200]   I wish I could look out my window and see wildlife.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.760]   That's every day at my house.
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.840]   I love the turkeys, best of all.
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:10.720]   The deer are just tall rats that eat your trunks.
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:13.360]   It's so normal to you guys.
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.520]   Don't even blink, but that's awesome.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:19.200]   Ever once in a while, I catch turkeys walking down the middle of the road here in Petaluma.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:22.640]   There's this pack of turkeys that everybody's just used to seeing.
[01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:24.480]   And they roam the city.
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:25.040]   It's weird.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.000]   Turkeys travel in packs or is that just when they're--
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:31.920]   Well, I don't know. There's more than a couple of them together.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:34.720]   So I don't know if it's called a pack when you're talking about turkeys.
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:39.840]   What is it called that you call a flock?
[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:43.120]   They are called a rafter.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:44.720]   Oh, no.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:47.680]   No, that's only if they're domesticated.
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:48.960]   Wild turkeys are still a flock.
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:50.160]   They're a flock.
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:50.880]   OK.
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:51.280]   Thank you.
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:57.120]   Asclamation points, tech news weekly and packs.
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:01.840]   These are the three mistakes I have made on today's episode of this week Google.
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:02.160]   All right.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:03.920]   And with that, I'm going to go ahead and take a break.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:07.680]   And then we will jump into tips and tricks and numbers and all that.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:12.320]   But before we get there, this episode this week in Google is brought to you by Wink.
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:17.920]   You can spell that W-I-N-C if I ask you to pick out a wine that you'll love,
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:21.680]   but you haven't had before, where would you even start?
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:25.280]   Wink makes it easy to discover great wines, what it's all about.
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:27.360]   And if you like wine, you're going to love this service.
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:31.760]   Wink's wine experts select wines matched to your taste.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:35.200]   It's all personalized for you and shipped right to your door
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.920]   and starts at just $13 a bottle.
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:43.200]   And let me tell you, it's pretty awesome coming home to a box of something on your doorstep.
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.000]   When you know that there's wine inside of that box, it's even better.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.040]   Delicious Wink wine selected just for you.
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.800]   It ends up being the best day or month.
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:52.640]   You're like, all right, well, what am I going to drink tonight?
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:53.680]   Because this looks really good.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.960]   You just fill out Wink's palette profile quiz,
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.560]   simple questions that your average store clerk wouldn't ask
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:03.120]   or be able to translate into a recommendation,
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:05.520]   questions like, how do you take your coffee?
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:08.400]   And how do you feel about blueberries?
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:12.320]   Then a Wink actually sends wines curated to your taste based on your answers.
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:15.040]   They've also got this down to a science.
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:19.440]   The more wines that you rate, the more personalized your monthly selections become.
[01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:23.520]   And Wink isn't just a wine club, it's a wine company.
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:28.240]   Wink actually works directly with top winemakers and growers from around the world
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:30.560]   to make all of their own wine.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:36.320]   Each month, there are new delicious wines like the insanely popular Summerwater Rose.
[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:42.720]   They also partner with local artists to develop wine labels that are unique works of art.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.040]   And you know, you can tell a lot about a wine by the label that's on it.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:50.880]   It kind of almost to a certain degree, it helps sell the wine inside.
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:54.640]   And it lets you gives you an indication about what you're about to drink.
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:59.600]   No membership fees, you can skip any month, you can cancel anytime,
[01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:01.280]   shipping is covered.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:04.480]   And if you don't like a bottle that they send you, they'll actually replace it with a bottle
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:05.520]   that you'll love.
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:06.800]   No questions asked.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:12.720]   So sit back, relax, or even celebrate with Wink.
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:16.320]   You don't have to settle for the same bottle of wine that you always get anymore.

[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:37.360]   And we thank Wink for their support of this week in Google.
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:40.080]   All right, shout out for Wink.
[01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:41.360]   What's that?
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:41.840]   I like the...
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:42.880]   One shout out for Wink.
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:48.000]   I like the fact that most of the time I drink a scotch whiskey,
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.640]   what have you, but I wanted to try Wink.
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:53.920]   And of course, I couldn't go through all of those bottles of wine.
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:55.760]   I'm not a total wine, though.
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:58.480]   And it was time for my next box to ship,
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.800]   but they have that built-in service that says,
[01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:01.200]   "You know what?
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:04.400]   If you just want to pause it for a minute here, just hit pause.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.320]   And we're not going to ship you anything right now.
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.160]   We're not going to bill you anything right now.
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:10.960]   When it comes around for the time again,
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:14.560]   we're going to send the next box out to you,
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:16.000]   but we'll give you a little bit of time.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:16.960]   I like that.
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:17.680]   Yeah.
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.920]   You can kind of put it on pause and pick it up when you need to.
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:21.280]   It's a cool couple of like...
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.280]   Rad on.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:26.800]   Okay, so Ant, why don't we give you first stab here?
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.720]   What is your stuff?
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:29.920]   It's in here is Ant's stuff.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:30.400]   What you got?
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:34.640]   Oh, you're muted.
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:38.240]   I keep hitting that button.
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:38.720]   Sorry.
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:39.600]   How do you do that?
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.360]   She's...
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:43.360]   Um, I wanted to mention...
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:45.040]   Just a strong silent type.
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:50.720]   The Hurricane Florence that recently passed by here in the Carolinas,
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:52.320]   specifically North Carolina.
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:38:00.560]   You mentioned earlier about Google saying that you can make a donation in Google or match that.
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:03.280]   And I'm all for that, but there's something else that I think
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:08.480]   and that needs to be considered is given blood.
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:10.640]   I don't know where everybody stands on that,
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:16.640]   but there's a lot of people that were injured and hurt and it's pretty serious.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:22.480]   And a lot of times the blood banks, they need able-bodied people that can give blood
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:27.760]   to help save lives in these serious situations like this.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:34.960]   So if you can and you're able to hit up your local blood bank and just say,
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.640]   "Hey, I'm here to give a pint of blood and help somebody out to send me."
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:41.200]   If you don't want to do that, then definitely, by all means,
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:47.840]   send $10 to the Red Cross or somebody to help out all of those that are affected by
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:53.920]   Hurricane Florence and how slow she moved over our region one mile per hour.
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:54.720]   It was brutal.
[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:57.040]   Yep.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:58.400]   Can't even imagine them.
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:00.160]   That's a really, really good point.
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:02.160]   There are many different ways that you can give to,
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:06.720]   doing them in times of disaster and all this kind of stuff.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.080]   It doesn't just have to be money.
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.080]   Some people would prefer not to give money, right?
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.880]   If you give blood, you know it's going directly to the cause.
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:18.000]   Depending on where you're sending your money, people might not have the utmost confidence.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:18.800]   It really just depends.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:20.160]   So that's a really good point.
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:22.320]   Excellent.
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:25.040]   Jeff, what's your number?
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.440]   So this won't surprise people, I'm afraid.
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:31.840]   Nearly half of telephone calls will be scams by 2019.
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:33.520]   It says a report.
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:40.400]   And these are also scams that practice what we call neighbor spoofing,
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:43.600]   where you think, oh, this call must be okay because it looks like my call
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.600]   because it has the same area code and the same exchange.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:52.080]   But no, it's a spoof number and it's a recorded voice or a robo voice or whatever,
[01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:54.400]   or just a bozo voice.
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:40:00.320]   And it's making telephone unusable, not just cell phones,
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:01.760]   but also home phones on flat and still.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:06.160]   I just, while I was in the show, I saw two luckily the phone company now says they're spam,
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:08.720]   but it's gotten awful.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:11.200]   Telephoneing has now become useless.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:17.280]   So that was a happy way to end the day, but don't fall for any scams, people.
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:18.080]   That's crazy.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:23.040]   The amount of phone calls that you get with your area code or something that's close to you or
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:23.440]   whatever.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:28.480]   And it just, it really sucks when you're waiting for a call from someone that you know you don't
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:33.280]   have in your book, like maybe a business is going to call you back or whatever.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:38.800]   And you get that call that's unidentified, you pick it up and there's like a three second pause
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:43.600]   and then the click and then the, we're calling because we've been trying to notify you.
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:44.320]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:46.400]   It's like, ah, I've been taken.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:53.120]   I remember I was on with you, Jeff, and I think Stacy was on that episode two.
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:41:00.800]   It was a couple of months ago and I showed off the Google phone app and they made a change
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:07.520]   where you can go in there and you can redirect identified spam calls from directly within the app
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:08.960]   so that it never gets your phone.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:10.800]   Has that cut down?
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.560]   Because it's totally cut down on my phone.
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:12.960]   Really?
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:13.200]   Yes.
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.800]   Oh, good.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:19.680]   I used to get way more calls and now I get far fewer and it's specifically.
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:21.440]   You want to do that again for folks?
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:25.040]   Here, let me not show it because I need to see that feature.
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:26.480]   See here.
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:30.320]   It's not blocked numbers.
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:33.840]   So if you go in, okay, so this should be good to show.
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:38.000]   I don't know if you have my overhead shot.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.840]   So I'm in Google's phone app.
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:42.320]   I'm not going to go back out because then you'll see all my calls and everything.
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:46.560]   But if you go into the settings of the Google phone app, there's the caller ID and spam.
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:49.360]   When you go into their filter spam calls, you want that on.
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:53.040]   And I think if you haven't ever switched it on, it's off by default.
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.360]   Yeah, mine is off.
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:55.760]   Okay.
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:00.080]   So switch that on and it totally has helped for me.
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:05.760]   I used to get so many calls every day and I get the big red banner identified spam.
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:05.760]   Yes.
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:07.600]   You see only red screens all the time.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:08.480]   It's annoying.
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:13.520]   And so that's Google's identification that triggers that red screen.
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.800]   This is taking it the next step to say if they already know that it's a spam and they would
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:22.800]   normally show you the red screen instead, they're just going to prevent it from even ringing your
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:25.280]   phone. It might go to your voicemail, but you won't see it ever.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:34.480]   Then the other thing is in your history, if you long, so you go to your history of phone calls,
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:39.520]   if you long press on the phone number, you can block and report a spam that number.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:40.000]   Yeah.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.680]   I do try to do that.
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:42.240]   I'll be on the phone.
[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:42.720]   Right.
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:44.480]   So between the two of them, yeah, it has helped.
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:46.000]   It still happens.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.360]   It does.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:53.440]   Calls definitely still get through, but minimizing them to same levels really does help.
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.320]   Yep.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:43:01.600]   Speaking of blocking things, my app that I'm going to show off today was actually on last
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:03.760]   night's episode of all about Android.
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:08.320]   Last night's guest, Rose Bahar from Android Police, showed it off.
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:09.760]   And it's actually it's a great app.
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:10.320]   So it's worth.
[01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:11.920]   Sorry, my voice is going.
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.200]   It's worth featuring here.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:15.200]   It's a 99 cent app called Bouncer.
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:19.760]   And you can see their bouncer temporary app permissions.
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:26.400]   The idea behind it is that you might not always want permissions for an app to be open.
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:31.840]   And so what happens is that if I happen to, let's see here,
[01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:38.160]   so this is the Fortnite installer, right device, would you like to remove this permission?
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:38.960]   Okay.
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:40.080]   So I shouldn't have to do that.
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:45.840]   So if I go into Fortnite installer, let's see if I can show this off the way I did last
[01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:46.080]   night.
[01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:49.600]   It's probably just going to work totally differently now because I'm trying to demonstrate it a second
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:49.840]   time.
[01:43:49.840 --> 01:43:51.840]   So it'll go in here.
[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:57.120]   Have I already, I may have already given the permission for this.
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:01.600]   So Fortnite installer, it's unlocked.
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:02.160]   It's unknown.
[01:44:02.160 --> 01:44:02.400]   Okay.
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:10.000]   So if I was to go into Bouncer and say that this is okay, keep the permission so it can
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.680]   write the device files.
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.560]   I might be getting this backwards.
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:15.840]   So my apologies if I am.
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:18.400]   See here, update.
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:21.200]   No, I'm not doing it.
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:28.000]   So what it's supposed to do is it's supposed to recognize that you're opening a permission
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:28.800]   for an app.
[01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:33.440]   And then the second you hit home, it would undo that permission change.
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:36.240]   And I think I'm getting it, getting it twisted up and showing it off.
[01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:39.520]   If you want to see an actual demonstration of this, watch last night's all about Android.
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:40.480]   I promise this was not a.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:42.800]   She was a great guess on there.
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:44.320]   Yeah, no, Rose was great.
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:48.560]   But the idea behind it is that if you have it running perfectly on your apps,
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:50.240]   then it's working in the background.
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:55.760]   So when you go to use this, this particular app and it wants access to your camera and you
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:59.600]   don't want it to always have access to that camera, but you don't mind it having it now,
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:03.600]   you can temporarily grant access to that app for the camera.
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:08.000]   And then the second that you hit a home to exit that app at the end of your session,
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.680]   it will change that permission back.
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.080]   It's the right back.
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.160]   It's a temporary app permission switch.
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:22.240]   And I'm not doing a very good job of demonstrating it, but you should check it out for yourself.
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:26.960]   I did it properly last night and it was kind of cool that it just kind of happens in the
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:27.520]   background.
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:33.120]   It's 99 cents and it's just kind of a cool way to kind of keep control of your permissions
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:34.080]   in a different way.
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:35.120]   It's called bouncer.
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.280]   And yeah, check it out.
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:40.720]   But that is, I think that's it.
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:44.800]   I think we've reached the end of Octo Thorpe life, as it were.
[01:45:44.800 --> 01:45:48.000]   And this is a lot of fun.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:53.040]   Ant, Pruitt, really appreciate you hopping on today and hanging out with us for a while.
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:56.240]   It's my pleasure and an honor.
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:45:58.000]   Trust me, truly an honor.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:58.400]   Cool.
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:45:59.360]   Ant underscore.
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:00.800]   Always great to have your friend.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:01.440]   On Twitter.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:04.480]   And of course, you write for techrepublic.com.
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:08.000]   Got more stuff coming all over CBS interactive.
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:09.440]   Sounds like so.
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:14.960]   That's like they're also doing photography, doing a lot of drone photography.
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:15.280]   Stops.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.240]   Drone photography.
[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:16.640]   Foot talk.
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:17.920]   The picture is a feat.
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:19.680]   A photography.
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:23.040]   I have this product right here that was sent to me.
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:32.640]   Oh, I recorded a little quick first look earlier today, but it is a horrendous video
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:34.080]   in my edit was crap.
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:38.800]   So I'm going to have to rerecord and maybe I'll get that first look up tonight on my YouTube channel.
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:39.920]   What was that controller?
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:40.320]   What is it?
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:43.280]   That is called the Loop Deck Plus.
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:48.800]   Last year, the company sent me their original model and I reviewed it.
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:54.240]   And it's the console that you use with Adobe Lightroom to help give you more of an analog feel
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:57.360]   for processing your images.
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:00.640]   You know, instead of using your mouse to click on the sliders and stuff like that,
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:06.160]   yeah, you can use this device that has knobs on it to make it a little more natural for you.
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:11.840]   Unfortunately, it doesn't really work well for my type of editing because I like to use
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:19.120]   Awaken tablet and a stylus because I do brush strokes and things like that in my photos.
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:26.080]   But as of today, they had a firmware update that allows this device to work with Lightroom,
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:34.080]   Aurora HDR, Capture One, Beta, and now with Adobe Premiere Pro.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:38.720]   So I'm looking forward to trying this out far as color grading my videos because
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:43.840]   it would be nice to be able to use knobs and stuff to try to make sure you have
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:46.240]   skin tones right in your videos.
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:48.480]   So it's going to be fun.
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:53.280]   It's going to take me a week or so to review it, but I'm looking forward to it.
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:53.760]   That's cool.
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:59.360]   Yeah, it really reminds me of a lot like in the in the audio world, you can get these audio
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:03.600]   controllers. These, you know, I mean, it looks very similar to an audio controller.
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:08.880]   And the trick with those always is like, yes, they promise a lot and there's a lot of capability
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:14.000]   within them, but you have to stick with them long enough to kind of rewrite your processes,
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:20.000]   your approach for working with tools has to change on a fundamental level to include that
[01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.880]   control surface for you to really get maximum benefit out of it. And that takes a little bit
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:29.120]   of time and a little bit of effort to make that happen. But once you get recently,
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:34.000]   you really are recently did a video about Premiere Pro and its keyboard shortcuts.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:40.080]   Because I hate using a mouse, you know, I used to spend a whole lot of time in the Linux,
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:46.720]   so I never really saw a mouse. But when I'm doing video editing, and I can just use keyboard
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:52.880]   shortcuts to navigate through the screen, it makes that edit so much faster. So I'm a little nervous
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:59.120]   about pulling this device in. But at the same time, I'm like, Oh, those knobs will make it easier
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:07.520]   to make my skin just really pop on the screen, you know, right on. So people will be able to find
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:12.000]   your your kind of video walk through that. Where would they find that on tech Republic?
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:18.880]   No, this is going to be on YouTube. I have a write up already. I don't know if they put it up today
[01:49:18.880 --> 01:49:24.400]   or not on tech Republic, but I'm going to do my video on my YouTube channel. Just go to youtube.com
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:32.080]   slash and prove it. It's pretty much the channel based on getting beginners started in the world
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:36.880]   of digital content creation. I don't always talk about photography. I also talk about videos and
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:42.720]   every now and now I talk about writing because sometimes it takes a little work to get something
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:49.520]   on the page and publish. Yeah. Yep. Right on. Well, and appreciate it. And best of luck with
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:55.200]   that. We'll we'll keep tuned into to read that once it's all right. Thank you. And watch it.
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:02.560]   Jeff Jarvis, great to have you back, man. Are you still upset with the whole Gmail thing?
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:09.360]   Yes, I am. This is this is this is a big deal. All these all these apps. I'm sorry. One last time.
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:13.120]   All these apps users you have out there, all these all these G Suite users you have out there.
[01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:18.320]   And all the Chromebooks you're selling think this through Google. Geez, think like a customer. You
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:24.320]   used to do that. I'm disappointed in you. I'm leaving it there. If you come back and tell me how
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:28.320]   I'm being stupid, that would be fine. It will fix up. It'll be okay. You be forgiven. Right now,
