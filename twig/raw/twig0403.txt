[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, Stacey and Higginbotham is here.
[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.800]   Jeff Jarvis has the week up, but that's okay. Danny Sullivan from Search Engine land joins us.
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.240]   As we talk about Google and authority, fake news,
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:20.640]   and how you distinguish between the two, we also talk about a very big scam going on with Google Docs right now.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.240]   And some great tips, including a way to make Mr. T give you directions next time you drive.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.560]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.880]   Twig.

[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.440]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, a show where we cover the latest news from the Google verse,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:46.120]   which includes the web verse, the internet, the Facebook verse, the chapter and verse Stacey Hagan-Botham's here from the Internet of Things Podcasts.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.720]   IOTPodcasts.com. Hello Stacey.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.440]   Hello, I thought you were going to just say the Internet of Things verse.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.440]   It is the IOT verse.
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.440]   Actually, there's some IOT news.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.440]   We'll talk about it.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.440]   Also, Danny Sullivan from Search Engine Land.com and Marketing Engine Land.com. Hello, Danny.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.440]   Hello.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.440]   And I see the Starship Enterprise on the shelf to your right.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.440]   That's pretty sweet.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.440]   Oh, yeah, I switched it out.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.440]   Pretty sweet.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440]   That's my giant Mega Blocks 17-0.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.440]   Really?
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.440]   Really?
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.440]   Really?
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.440]   Very good.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.440]   You can make that a Mega Blocks.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.440]   It's a Mega Blocks did.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.440]   It was a very different kind of a build, but I was very excited to get it.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.440]   Interesting.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.440]   It's nice.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.440]   I can't show you the little things on the end.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.440]   The engines will glow even, so it was very good.
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.440]   Nice.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.440]   Nice.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.440]   So, before you go any further, please do not open any links in the Google Doc you may have received.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.440]   Apparently, this is just breaking this afternoon.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.440]   A massive phishing campaign targeting Google accounts.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.000]   Journalists particularly targeted.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.240]   They are malicious links.
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.880]   And apparently, if you click on it, you will then give permission to something called Google
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:17.520]   Docs, which is in Google Docs, and it gives you access to your Gmail.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.840]   You can read, send, delete, and manage your email on your behalf.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.840]   How nice.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.080]   That is scary.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   How nice.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.080]   You can remove it.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.080]   You should remove it.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.680]   Here's Tom Warren with his tweet.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.280]   Apparently, he's got a good screenshot, so I'm thinking he might have got a bit.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   The emails.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   I think a lot of us have received it.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   Did you get it?
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.280]   Stacey?
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.840]   I got one, but it was after the clicking.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.840]   Or after the clicking.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.840]   After the clicking.
[00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.840]   Wow.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.000]   Where does it show up?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Does it show up in a document?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It's just an email.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   It's an email.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   inviting you to the document.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.760]   Apparently comes from H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H S
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:04.100]   dot mailinator.com and the recipients are BCC, is it your habit to just go ahead and
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.880]   open those shared documents?
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.720]   I usually look but because that looks sort of legit I might have if I were it's flipping
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.100]   through I might just click it and be like oh did one of my editor said me something click
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.600]   right.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.600]   So.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   Wow.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.880]   I mean it's caught a bunch it's caught a bunch of people that ordinarily wouldn't get
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.080]   caught by something like that.
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.680]   So it looks like it was fairly spent to get it all up to them but yeah but people had
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.600]   gone around saying no don't open this by that point.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.280]   So I was like you.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.640]   Thank you to everyone who who went this way before I happened to.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.160]   Well and I'm protected because I don't actually ever read my email.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.280]   Well there you go.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.280]   Must be nice.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.120]   Now I'm looking at the one I got right now and it looks just like what you got that would
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.520]   have been an alarm to me like it's like it's avoided you to open this document and that
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.240]   whole to H H H H H H H H H H I'd be like what?
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.440]   Yeah this is definitely if you're just flipping through but I mean I don't know some days
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.720]   when like if I get back from a meeting or something or I've been on the phone I inboxes
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.880]   like you're just like clicking through you know.
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.760]   Well and notice by the way this one appears to come from Joe Bernstein at Buzzfeed.com
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.960]   it isn't in fact and it says Joe Bernstein involved you invited you to the following
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.960]   document.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.960]   I don't know if that's customized for whoever it's aimed at but you could easily not realize
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.680]   that it actually came from H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H H
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.040]   Yeah it looks like it comes from one of your friends.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040]   Right.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.600]   Or at least a legitimate contact.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.600]   Wow.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   Wow.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   Wow.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.560]   Okay I didn't get one.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.560]   I'm sad I'm hurt.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   Do you want me to decide what?
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.840]   I mean we can make that happen.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.840]   And do we know if anybody got bit by like besides I mean anybody who clicked would have.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:01.320]   Well apparently I mean the the vice article I read was that it was all over Twitter and
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.520]   that several journalists like several unnamed journalists have been infected.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.240]   I think so being more advised.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   Wow.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.320]   So I'm doing a quick search on Google for Google Docs.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.000]   There's certainly plenty of coverage of it.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.200]   So yeah it looked very sophisticated in the sense that it I think all seemed to come up
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.080]   off of a Google domain or I think that's how it was meant to look as well.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.080]   So.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.960]   Wow look at the Petaluma City Schools sent me an email saying there's a widespread email
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.680]   scam.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.280]   Do not open.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:37.960]   So wow that went out 30 minutes ago.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.240]   That makes sense actually my kids my kids my imaginary other child.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.200]   My kid is on Google Docs.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   Right.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.520]   The schools use Chromebooks in Google Docs.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.120]   So they think at this point though it's something that Google would somehow be able to identify
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.600]   and stop.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:01.600]   Like if you clicked on the link because if I understood it like the link took you into
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.480]   the link took you into a Google domain.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.560]   It looked like there was some kind of actual app that was running off of Google's domain.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.000]   It's not the Google created it but you know you can you can create pages on Google's domain.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.640]   You can create you know all sorts of things that actually have a Google URL because Google
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.640]   has these common things are licensed out.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.920]   So I'm I'm spinning through articles myself to try to see Vox has one what we know and
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.760]   how it works.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.360]   So what would happen to me how it works.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.360]   Wow.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.320]   I'm glad we led with that because presumably there are people watching live who may be
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.320]   bit with it.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.920]   We've done good work here.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.520]   We have done our job we can go home.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.520]   Thank you everybody.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   Good night.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.520]   I would love it.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.520]   You're right.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.320]   This shouldn't be possible.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.320]   There should be.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:49.720]   I'm sure Google is working on this right now.
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.520]   There needs to be malware protection in.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.840]   It says that like you know it takes you to Google's real login page apparently and
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:02.320]   then when you enter your password you get read elected Ray direct to third party site.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.640]   So what's happening and how they're taking it.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.160]   They're using Google's all off.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.800]   I don't know.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.240]   I can't tell enough of what's happening but that's one of those things you think Google
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.720]   would do at the very least Google you know could put a big thing up on their their password
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.320]   login page right now saying warning.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.720]   Yeah I don't think they want to do that.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.760]   I don't think.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.240]   Two factor two factor two factor but that wouldn't save you either.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.560]   I don't know would it not if it's there.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.320]   If you want to change your password so presumably once you get access to the accounts password
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.960]   you try to change it so like the person didn't get in.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:43.000]   Yeah I don't know when you're it's you're giving permission to another site and then
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.960]   I don't know.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.800]   I don't know like when you authorize another side if it needs to have two factor or not.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.760]   So here's in the Google subreddit.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.480]   It used the existing Google login system.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.480]   So that's actually.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.000]   This is very scary.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.200]   Yeah because that means they were using OAuth they had set up a page to use Google's OAuth.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.840]   Oh look at that does bypass two factor.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840]   Oh okay.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   Since the email emails.
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:15.360]   Oh and then yes so the first thing they do once they get Gmail permissions is to spread
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.600]   it and that's why it's coming to you from someone you know.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.040]   Yes that's why like I won't I won't share with you who sent me mine.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.040]   So somebody you know.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.760]   By the way though you should email them back and say you were infected because that's
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:33.400]   the if you get it from somebody it's the sign that they were bit.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.400]   They know.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   They know.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.760]   I won't ask how they know.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.560]   I'm like you know it's the same service public service message you offer all your friends
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.600]   when you're suddenly like oh dude your Skype spins band.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.200]   You're this has been just got bit.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   It's been a long time though since yeah.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.840]   I mean there was a Skype one that was fairly recent but other than that it's been quite
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.920]   a while since I've had to do that it used to be like you know like once a month one of
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.080]   your friends would have something you know.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.080]   It is apparently spread quite severely.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.680]   I'm our chatroom Reverend Denson and a mini is telling me in the chatroom the use three
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.600]   universities he does work with have sent out the email that I got from the pedaloma schools.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.880]   It's pretty widespread and it makes sense.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:24.920]   It's what's scary about this kind of attack email is instant and it's it this stuff spreads
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:25.920]   so fast.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.840]   It's one of the reasons any viruses or dubious value these days you're going to get a virus
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.560]   within minutes that will take a day for them to to modify their software to detect.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:42.440]   If you clicked allow if you did log in and clicked allow you're done.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:48.680]   If you didn't click the link close the tab or press deny you're okay.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:54.320]   What was that a thing from something like a CHH if they're what was that thing again.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:11:00.240]   HHH mailinator or a CHH any email that's the actual email it's from but it won't say
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:07.520]   that it will say from somebody you know and it will say CC the HHHH if you did get bit
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:13.760]   revote revoke access to Google Docs because this quote Google Docs is not Google Docs
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:19.760]   and the real one doesn't need access because it's your Google account so if you see in
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:28.240]   your access list Google Docs that's bad and then you'll look in your sent box because
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:35.040]   those are people you just spammed.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.160]   And then form whoever sent you the email of course that their accounts been compromised
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.960]   as Stacy did.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.240]   It sounds like Google shutting it down is Google has it been stopped.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.640]   That's an interesting question could they.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.440]   What do you think Danny could they somehow.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.320]   Well that's like what they said globally revoke the permission.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.760]   If you're going to their password page I don't understand how when you go to that password
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:06.840]   page it's it's a Google app doing this other type of thing they create a web app and Google
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:12.200]   it sounds like it's some kind of application that has gotten into their system to use that
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.960]   password page or or in some way in a sufficient way and they should be able to block that.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.480]   They should be able to say well we know what's we know what's happening here because it's
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.440]   all sending back to this other thing.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.200]   I guess so if you authorized it you're authorizing application that by now presumably Google has
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.040]   shut down.
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.960]   Yes I guess someone in the chat room saying that Google did disable the app.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.240]   Okay so it's all right you're safe.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:40.200]   Well are you I mean if you go in and change your password you're safe but otherwise they
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   still have access.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.280]   They did not get your password there use Google's own system which does not give them
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:53.720]   a password it merely authenticates and then you add this bogus web app to your account
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.760]   which then mines your Gmail.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.440]   We don't know if there's an additional payload that's unknown at this point.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.560]   Okay what is the point of this.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.560]   What else are they doing right?
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.120]   I mean clearly did they grab all your contacts or they could have grabbed all your email
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.480]   by doubt they did because the quantity of data that would be.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:16.560]   Yes a lot of you got to be downloading.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.000]   You know it's very possible and I'm sure Google is actually looking because now Google has
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.600]   access to their source code.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.760]   So I'm sure Google is looking at their app to see what else it did it may well be that
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.160]   the only purpose of the app was to spread itself which would be kind of an interesting
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.720]   joke.
[00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:38.160]   But there's no further compromise as far as I know because you didn't you use Google's
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.560]   own authentication system.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:44.200]   So there's an actually an important distinction I'm sure everybody watching knows that but
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:50.480]   you can make a page that looks like a Google login page and steal people's credentials.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:55.640]   Danny how can you tell if that's what you're getting or if you're getting a real Google
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.480]   authentication it's a pop up.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.600]   Well I mean you know usually your first clue is to look at what's in your address field
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.560]   right because you know it should look like it's a pop up because you haven't addressed
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.560]   field.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.480]   Oh you want to cause a pop up well.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.400]   Yeah I'd probably be wary if you're getting a pop up then too because like why are you
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.520]   getting that kind of a pop up type of thing.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.200]   But the pop up is what Google does.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.720]   Now when I go and I try to authenticate something it usually takes me to a page where I have
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   to do that.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   And that's fine.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:32.240]   And now our news editor is telling me you can read the link but I mean like if you can
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.120]   find the link and like I said most cases I usually see it it's in a browser and I can
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:40.080]   see the link.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.360]   You can tell I'm very saying if you get the pop up right click and you should be able
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.960]   to use an option that you see the link and the link should generally be from a Google
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   domain not something like you know such and such dash dot Google etc etc.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.920]   Even further advice is coming in from Barry Schwartz saying right click copy the link and
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.520]   paint it in the notepad so that you can see it better.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.760]   Well let me let's use as an example.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.760]   I'll do it.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.760]   I'll do it right now.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.760]   Do it.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.760]   This is unroll this is unroll.me which you absolutely do not want to sign up for right.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.760]   What's your password?
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.760]   No.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:21.480]   Now this is this is this is the authentication box you get and you get this from many people.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.480]   Where is this?
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.600]   This is unroll me which is something you do not want to sign up for.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.600]   We've talked about that.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.680]   Yeah because you guys sign up with Google Yahoo Outlook or AOL.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.680]   Those are all sign up.
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:30.840]   This is OAuth too.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.120]   This is these so when I click this I should get an OAuth dialogue.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.120]   Let's see what we got.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.120]   Continue.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.120]   Awesome.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.520]   And that's what I'm talking I guess it is a page and then you're right you can see at
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:43.520]   the top.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:50.160]   And that that you know but the problem is people look at these.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.400]   And that by the way that by the way ought to if you have two factor trigger the two factor
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.400]   to come in as well.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.080]   It will I do have two factors so the next step will be.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.840]   And if it were and if it were a fake system then I don't think you would get the two factor
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.080]   because you know it's not going to be able to Google system is going to with it.
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.560]   This says HTTPS colon slash slash accounts.google.com.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:18.240]   The problem is you might also see accounts.google.com.tv.com or something else.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.400]   And if you so you've got to look at the whole thing between the slashes.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.840]   You should also look at the certificate.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:30.080]   You see it says secure and you know I can learn more about my secure connection.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:34.520]   You know this is this annoys me Google changed how this works by the way.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:41.520]   It used to it used to give you a chance to look at the certificate right here.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:46.920]   And it doesn't and this is really annoying in order to get the certificate.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.240]   You now actually have to go elsewhere on the page.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:57.600]   I'm going to close this close this get back here to get this certificate.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:03.240]   I think I have to go over to Jesus is crazy.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.240]   Is it developer tools?
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.840]   I think I do.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:08.840]   And then security and view certificate.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:11.600]   That is I really sad that Google did that.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:17.440]   That was a change fairly recently in Chrome.
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.160]   And so that's too many steps.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.920]   It should be I could right click on secure as per that.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:29.080]   I should be able to click on secure and say see certificate right over here.
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:35.600]   Instead this is crazy developer tools in which normally opens here or here.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.080]   But you go and the word security is off the menu to the right security.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.960]   To be honest I don't even think when people are going to get to the point where they're
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.480]   going to try to look at a certificate and understand it's telling them what it's like.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:50.160]   That's why we want it to be easy because if you could pop up the certificate it says
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.960]   issued to start at Google.com.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:58.920]   And then you can verify that should be a much easier thing than this ridiculous developers
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.240]   tool.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.240]   That's not the way to do it Google.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.920]   And I was a little disappointed that they changed that recently.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.720]   Anyway, because I check certificates a lot.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:10.720]   All right.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:16.840]   Should I just go ahead and I'm going to click and see if it asks for my two factor.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.760]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.840]   Should I allow unroll me to get my mail?
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.760]   Now I'm not.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:29.080]   I guess it's not going to ask for my two factor because remember I'm logged in on into Chrome
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   on this.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.600]   Anyway, let's just deny.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.600]   Deny.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.240]   I deny you.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.240]   Oops.
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.440]   Looks like you declined access.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.080]   Damn straight.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.880]   What made you decline?
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.160]   I'm worried about security.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.320]   That's in there twice by the way.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.400]   So that's clearly a popular answer.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.040]   I'm really, yeah, we use security.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.440]   Bank level security as well as your emails provide a security.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.520]   Really secure, net buy.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.480]   All right.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.280]   We encrypt your data before we sell the metadata.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.720]   Exactly.
[00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:12.080]   So did I make a mistake?
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:16.720]   I just read an article said that you shouldn't buy a new pixel right now.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.760]   This is a bad time to buy a Google Pixel.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.760]   A Pixel phone?
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.760]   Pixel phone.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:21.760]   Wow.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.960]   Because, well, is it a good time to buy it?
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.880]   It's the best Android phone.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.880]   Android.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.880]   You disagree?
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.880]   I love it.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.760]   Well, I had bought the little one and then I decided I wanted a big one.
[00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.680]   This was after I got the Galaxy S8 because I thought, oh, yes.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.120]   You should definitely get the big.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.120]   Just all big phones from now on.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:45.120]   Only big phones.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:48.760]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.400]   not in the big phone club, but keep going.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.600]   Well, I thought, that's why I got the little phone.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.120]   I thought maybe I'm not in the big phone club.
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.600]   I was like, because I used to have an iPhone 6, you know, S and I got the 7 and the big
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.040]   one and like, look at the S now, I'm like, oh, I can't deal with that.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.040]   Plus, you got the plus.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.040]   Got the plus.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.800]   So, and then same thing with Pixel, so I thought, well, the Pixel would be great.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   I'll get the small one.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.800]   That'll be awesome.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   Like, no, it wasn't awesome.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.800]   What's the big one?
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.800]   So I traded it in for the big one.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:15.600]   I got the big one and I'm, because I thought I was going to use the S8, the S8 and then...
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.600]   Is that traded in?
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.600]   That's awesome.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.600]   I didn't trade it in.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.600]   Oh.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:20.600]   She had multiple pixels right now.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.080]   I said that so that people wouldn't think that I was...
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.080]   Sorry.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.080]   I'm throwing money at one.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.080]   So you got the big Pixel.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.960]   Yeah, I traded it in.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.600]   I put the old one in the drawer and I got a new one.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.600]   Yeah, I completely...
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.880]   You could at least sell it on eBay.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.200]   I will do something with it.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.320]   You know what I actually do?
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.480]   And I give it to staff, staff members.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.040]   I saw the yesterday, I saw Burke was about to order a 6 PS and stop.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.880]   Don't order a 6 P. I've got phones up the butt.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.880]   He said, I want a phone.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.400]   They certainly don't want a phone that came from up your butt.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   No.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.400]   No, no.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   No, it's actually...
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.320]   I gave him the other one, the little Pixel.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.440]   He says, "Too small."
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.440]   So...
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:05.080]   But he has now the HTC Ualtra, which is big.
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.400]   But I'm going to keep the S8.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.320]   I got the S8 Plus and I like it, but I don't like it enough.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.360]   I think Samsung junked it up and it reminded me how much I liked the Pixel.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.240]   Well, the pure Android is nice.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.240]   It is nice.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.240]   It's so much nicer.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:23.360]   And if you like Android, I think going with the Google branded phone is great.
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:26.640]   And unless you want to go for Motorola, which pretty much doesn't mess with them too much
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.640]   either.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.640]   Motorola is a good choice.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.640]   But...
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.640]   It's just so expensive.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.640]   All right.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.640]   Tell me about it.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.720]   Anyway, David Roddick writing at Android Police said, "Even if you can, which by the
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.920]   way you can now, I thought it was going to be a long way to as a week.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.760]   Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore."
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.400]   I'm not sure I agree with this.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.960]   He says this.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.280]   This is kind of the ultimate in spec geekiness.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.480]   The Snapdragon 821 is old news.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.560]   Oh, come on.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:02.800]   It doesn't support advanced network features across the four carriers, which aren't available
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.280]   yet anyway.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.640]   Right?
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.280]   And then he says the Pixel 2 is coming out.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.880]   Well, yeah, but in September or October.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.120]   Well, it's not that far now though.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.920]   It's May.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:15.920]   May?
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.680]   That's not July or August?
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.680]   That's six months from now.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   May?
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.680]   You're phone along.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:22.680]   Nurse it along.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.320]   You think your phone you got now can't last six months?
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:26.520]   What's it doing going?
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.520]   I can barely walk now.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.760]   I just give up.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:37.000]   He also points out that Google has told people that we will stop supporting it October 2018
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.520]   and stop doing security updates like a year after that.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.520]   Is that...
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.680]   I'm a little disappointed.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.440]   I thought Google was going to support these like they supported Nexus.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.600]   I just got...
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   I thought Google was going to have things like proper inventory so you could buy them.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.600]   I know.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.600]   I know.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.600]   I don't think he can support them.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.600]   This was like Google.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:05.080]   No, we were really serious about our phones, which is like the third time they've been serious
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.080]   about phones, right?
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.120]   Because we had the Nexus when they first came out with the Nexus and then we did different
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.840]   things like now we've got the Super Nexus and then it was like, and now it was like we're
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:15.840]   got the Pixel.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.680]   We're really super serious about this phone.
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.280]   We're running ad campaigns.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.640]   It's got Google Assistant, everybody.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.200]   And then you can't buy it.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.560]   That doesn't tell me you were super serious about the phone.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.080]   That tells me it's still kind of like a little bit of a hobby.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:33.160]   Well, you know, I get not wanting to gamble on getting a bunch of inventory because you're
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.480]   not certain if you'll actually sell it.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:40.880]   But it also then when people do want to buy it and they can't buy it, like, you know,
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.520]   I want to say that doesn't happen with Apple, but of course it does happen with Apple, but
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.080]   that happens with Apple because there's so much demand not because Apple goes, well,
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.440]   let's only produce a little bit and see if anybody's interested.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:57.280]   So I can't, I do not understand why Apple can't keep air pods in stock.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.320]   I don't understand why Google can't keep this phone in stock.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.440]   It seems to be a epidemic in the tech industry that they just don't can't make them fast
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.440]   enough.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.200]   I don't know why that is.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.520]   But I think you should buy a Pixel XL if you if you need a phone right now.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.480]   Like obviously if you can limp along for five and a half months, fine.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.320]   You know what, you need a phone right now.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:27.680]   You could easily get a good solid $200 phone if you wanted to get a Moto G get the fifth
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   generation Moto G.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:34.920]   If you wanted to get to the fall when the long generation phones are going to come out,
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.920]   right?
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.960]   And he does make a good point, which is that this was a flawed, the Pixel was a flawed
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.320]   phone out of the box that Google had a, rushed it out and had to compromise.
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.280]   It doesn't have, it's not waterproof, doesn't have wireless charging.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.600]   There are a lot of issues with it.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.640]   It does have, I will submit the best camera on the market better than the cameras.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.720]   Better than the Galaxy S8 even.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:03.360]   You could argue that the dual lenses on the LG G6 make it more attractive.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.800]   I've seen some really nice wide angle.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.840]   I lent, I lent one to my son to try because he is all into photography.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.160]   He sings or the Pixel?
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.600]   He's got a Pixel and he would totally be using the Pixel because of the camera.
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.600]   Yes.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.320]   If only it could do Apple messages.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   Yes.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.960]   That's it, by the way.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.080]   Blame Apple for that.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.160]   That's a, oh, I know, I know, but that's like, that's the lock in for him right now.
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.920]   All his friends use messages and no one wants to be like, they can't do group.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.200]   Nobody wants to be a green bubble anymore.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.200]   I don't want to be the green bubble.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.640]   How did we get back to here?
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.640]   I know.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   All right.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.640]   I know.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.840]   You've been very critical of my story choices.
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.120]   No, I wasn't thinking of the story.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.840]   I was thinking because you were complaining about eye messages and I was going all the
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:55.840]   way.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.080]   I could complain about Aloe.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.840]   I could complain about Aloe.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.840]   Aloe.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:00.840]   Hangouts.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.840]   What's wrong with Google?
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.320]   Well, no, that's what I'm saying.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.520]   I'm saying, I feel like we're all the way back in like the early odds again.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.200]   Oh, oh, you didn't mean us.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   You meant in general.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.200]   No, no, not you talking.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.400]   It's like we're all using aim and ICQ.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.400]   Yes.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.400]   So I'm just like, oh, how did that happen?
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.400]   That was more like it just aside.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.400]   It was not a criticism of your story choice.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.400]   I'm really, really excited.
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.400]   I'm very sensitive.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.400]   I'm very sensitive.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.400]   I'm very sensitive.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.880]   I'm pretty sure this video sitting in front of you now.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.880]   What do you think, baby?
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.880]   I think it looks really nice.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.280]   It's awesome for this.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.280]   Look at this.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.280]   I can zoom in.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.280]   It's really nice.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.280]   I can.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.640]   Oh, man, look at this.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.640]   Let's go to search.
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:44.400]   Let me go to search engine land and show you how good, how good your site looks.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.160]   I just want you to put that weird circle thing up there and do something awesome.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.400]   Oh, I watch.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   Oh, I can do that.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.400]   Look, you know, I can scroll.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.160]   I can see it's got a knob.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.480]   Your site now has a knob on it.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.480]   Look at that.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.360]   And oh, you're really going to like this.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.640]   Let's get a, let's get a really good story from.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.640]   I'm like, Danny Sullivan.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.360]   I heard the talk.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.360]   Which one?
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.360]   This one, how Google assesses.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.240]   Actually, that was going to be my next story.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.760]   That was my next story.
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.560]   So, so I really like to make it big so everybody can read it.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.200]   And then let's say Danny says something really interesting.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.720]   Watch this.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.160]   I can then go, Oh, look at this.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:26.080]   Danny's talking about page rank, you know, Google didn't just reward pages with a lot
[00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:27.080]   of links.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.600]   It tried to calculate how.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:32.000]   By the way, this is really germane to our conversation last week, isn't it?
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   Yes, it is.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.400]   I was like, I saw this and I was like, Oh, it's so sad that Jeff is not here to talk
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.400]   about this today.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.440]   But Danny sent you wrote this.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:40.640]   We can ask you all the hard questions.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.200]   We fought for 40 minutes.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.760]   We fought for 40 minutes last week on this.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.600]   Battle it out.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.600]   Was there some kind of fight?
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.960]   Because I got a tweet somebody saying that I needed to fight more or something.
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.840]   I was like, but I wasn't even on the show.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.680]   So I should let you recap the the battle, Stacy.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.680]   And I will if you don't want to, but.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:00.680]   Oh, God.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:01.680]   So.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.360]   I'm a dog in this hunt as they say in Austin, Texas.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.800]   I use that phrase just yesterday.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:13.240]   Anyway, so Leo is of the opinion that Google is going.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.240]   It's losing.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.240]   Authority.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.440]   The moral high ground authority.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.840]   There you go.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.360]   When it comes to starting to dictate what's truth and how it's going to show things and
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:29.120]   what has authority and Jeff is of the opinion that because Google is an authority that
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.760]   we turn to, it should favor absolute truth like science.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.400]   And then we got into this whole digression of absolute truth and algorithms being biased.
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.040]   And it was a long, long time.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:50.640]   Jeff, as you know, is part of the Facebook craigslist integrity initiative and journalism.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:56.600]   In fact, CUNY, his university has kind of been charged to keep track of news, integrity
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.320]   and kind of to divvy out the money.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:04.720]   They put aside a lot of money to help people, advertisers and platforms do a better job
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.280]   with fake news.
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:09.320]   My concern, and this is actually right up your alley, Danny.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.560]   So I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:18.200]   My concern is that in my opinion, in the early days of Google, it was it.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:25.760]   The whole point was to reflect what's on the internet and to rank it using page rank based
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.520]   on other pages interest in it.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:33.720]   It ranks more highly because that's what more people are talking about and not to judge the
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:38.360]   ferocity of the content, not to judge the content at all.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:43.960]   And I'm concerned that if Google starts getting in the business of judging the content of pages,
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:50.360]   that is a serious kind of, I think it breaks page rank.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:57.120]   And my fear is that, talk about filter bubbles, now you've got a Silicon Valley company as
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.240]   the ultimate arbiter of truth.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.000]   And that worries me.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.400]   So gosh, we're to unpack.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.240]   In Google's original system that was called page rank, they talked about it as being the
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.560]   democracy of the web.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.640]   And the idea was that links could be like votes.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:24.080]   And so the pages that got the most votes or the most links potentially would win.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.080]   And this is what the article I talked about today goes into.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.320]   It was never just a counting game.
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:33.160]   Even from the start, they tried to figure that some links were more equal than others.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.640]   They did think about quality.
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.640]   They thought about the quality of the links.
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.600]   And we acknowledge that they've had to do that.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:42.000]   I mean, that's what Matt Cutz does, did with his spam fighting.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Right.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.360]   And then in addition, they didn't just look at the popularity, but they also would look
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.880]   at say the context of the links.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.960]   This is why you would find Amazon at the time.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.960]   You search for books.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.160]   Amazon would come up for number one.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:58.040]   If you search for cars, you wouldn't find Amazon because even though Amazon had a lot
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:02.880]   of links and a lot of important links, nobody was linking to Amazon saying cars in or near
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.560]   the link, so it wasn't contextually relevant.
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:13.680]   And I think that when you talk about back when it started, the idea of just fake content
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:21.240]   or untruthful content or debatable topics, I don't think you had as much of it that was
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.240]   going on.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.640]   Instead, you had relatively lots of authoritative content.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:26.640]   It's not perfect.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.480]   There was obviously such an issue, but the real challenge back then was simply the people
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:39.360]   who were trying to spam and completely mislead and completely try to rank the search algorithm
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:44.320]   so that they would just get monetary gain or some other benefit off of it without having
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.880]   any real relevancy.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.280]   People will debate whether or not SEO is just spamming and it's not because Google
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.080]   even will tell you you should do it.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.400]   If you're relevant and it makes sense for you to be doing it, it's a good thing you
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.240]   should be happening and doing.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:03.400]   But you go into extremes or you can have just outright misleading stuff, but it wasn't
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.800]   like I'm trying to alter your opinion necessarily.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.120]   It was more like I'm just trying to hijack some traffic.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.360]   These days, you have a lot of content that's out there.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.320]   We're in this post-truth world that's going on.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.400]   And yeah, I think that Google does need to figure out how to deal with it.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:25.840]   And I think it's perhaps a little too freak out prone to say that Google is preventing
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:32.200]   you from getting to content or they're putting you into a bubble by some of the changes that
[00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.200]   they're trying to do.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.400]   One of the challenges, first of all, they literally don't know what's authoritative.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.440]   And that's part of what the article I got into today was explaining.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.640]   There's no signal that they look at and say, "Well, now that's an authority."
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.440]   Or, "Here, that's truth.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.480]   They don't know what truth is."
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.520]   And how could they know what truth is when you even get into some issues where even we
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.280]   as humans don't know what the truth is, right?
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:58.400]   So what they're trying to do is look at a bucket of metrics to figure out whether or
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.880]   not something seemed to have some authority.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.520]   And the change that they made wasn't, I saw a little bit of what Jeff wrote and he was
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.400]   like, "Google's now going to wait more towards authority."
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.400]   That's not new.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.880]   It's not like Google just suddenly decided to wait more towards authority.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.400]   What's new is that they're going to wait more towards authority when you start getting into
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.280]   more granular kinds of searches.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:24.640]   So if you had searched for Holocaust, it wasn't like Google said, "You searched for
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.640]   the Holocaust?
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.240]   Well, for authority, we don't care about that."
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.800]   They would give you really authoritative sites.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.720]   So when you would search for things like, "Did the Holocaust happen?"
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.480]   Google would say, "Well, that's not a very common search that happens."
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:43.080]   So you might really want something that's more granular and more specific.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:47.400]   Just like you say you search for a weird computer error that you got, you might type in the
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.560]   computer error.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:52.440]   You don't want to get some page off a scene that says, "Computer errors are bad."
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.600]   You want to page it specifically talks about that error.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.400]   And so Google's algorithms in these specific searches would tend to skew towards, "Let's
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.280]   go for the very specific content, even if it doesn't necessarily have as much authority
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.800]   as it seems like it needs to have."
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.960]   So when you would search for, "Did the Holocaust happen?"
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.520]   You'd end up with pages telling you the Holocaust didn't happen.
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:18.760]   They were the only pages discussing it because people weren't writing a lot of content explaining
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:24.520]   why it really did happen because so many people understand it's accepted back.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.280]   It's just like why you wouldn't find a lot of content necessarily on why the earth is
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.280]   flat.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.280]   I just did that.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.960]   It's funny he should say that.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.000]   I'm sure you'll get some, right?
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.360]   Well, actually mostly what I got is proofs that the earth's not flat.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.360]   Right, right.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.360]   But then that's been kind of a joke thing that's come up.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.360]   So then people...
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.360]   Maybe that's not the best one.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.480]   You do get the flat earth society, but it's not in the top.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.280]   But it's not.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.480]   And then it's...
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:55.920]   So they would skew towards these granular things and then you would get sites that are
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.600]   out there.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.880]   And it's like, is that the best thing to be doing?
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.440]   And the algorithm isn't perfect.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.760]   The algorithm has to make decisions all the time.
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.040]   So you could say, well, if they go to more authoritative content, they're biasing it.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.000]   Well, if they don't go to more authoritative content, they're biasing it.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.920]   The algorithm is not unbiased.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.440]   The algorithm is going to have a bias just like anything that makes decisions.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.400]   That's the point that both Jeff and Stacy did make.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.400]   So there is bias in here.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.400]   So I don't want...
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:28.400]   But I think that that doesn't give you permission to add more bias.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.880]   Well, I don't even know what more...
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:35.000]   Which one do you want to have as little bias as possible?
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.520]   No, there's no such thing as little bias.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.520]   Bias isn't...
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.320]   Yeah, you're just...
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.320]   There's bias.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.720]   Yeah, you can't have less or more of it.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.080]   You can double down on a position that's biased.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:48.080]   But...
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.400]   Well, I would say use as little bias as possible to give you good search for the...
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.280]   Obviously, part of the problem is the quality is harder to find.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.280]   But let's assume that...
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.280]   Quality is bias.
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:04.640]   I mean, if you're choosing quality, like let's take it away from search for a minute.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.480]   Okay, that makes sense.
[00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.480]   If I'm picking a table...
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:09.120]   That's a matter of taste.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.360]   Well, in its quality is part of the bias.
[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.400]   I may choose to spend more for that.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.400]   So, sorry.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.280]   No, no.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:25.000]   So, presuming that Google is going to have to define the word quality in some fashion.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.280]   And I think the way they define it is a quality link is the link that gives you what you're
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.280]   looking for.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   Well, actually, they don't define quality.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.280]   They don't want to.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.280]   I know they don't want to, but they have to.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.280]   It's implicit.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.280]   It's implicit.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.280]   No, but it's implicit in what they're doing.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.280]   That's like defining pornography.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.760]   No, but they have to because it's implicit in what they're doing.
[00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:47.080]   So even if they don't want to say they have somewhere in that algorithm, a definition
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.080]   of a quality.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:54.400]   I would define it as they don't want to generate search results that make a lot of people's
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.960]   eyebrows go up and say, "What are you doing?"
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.960]   Right?
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.600]   So that's the kind of example.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   That's a good...
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.600]   Okay.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.600]   Let's assume that.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:12.400]   That kind of is my point, which is people's eyebrows going up isn't always a good metric
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.560]   for whether that information is important.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.160]   And in fact, people's eyebrows went up as I brought up last week.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:26.400]   I don't want to get in this whole thing again that when was it Galileo who said that the
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.560]   earth revolves around the sun, their eyebrows went up?
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.560]   Sure.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:34.160]   No, I don't think so.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.160]   So that's not the best metric in a lot of areas, including science.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:44.960]   I think part of the difference is if Galileo had published something today out on the web,
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:48.280]   first of all, even then he was respected, right?
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.720]   So he would be publishing with some degree of authority.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:52.800]   It would be recent.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.760]   So it would show up as part of the news discussion that would be happening.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.600]   It's not like it would just be like, "Oh, well, that freaks us out.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.120]   We're going to get rid of it."
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:05.960]   And you'd have almost like an immediate debate about what was going on from there.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:07.920]   So I don't know.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.640]   I get what you're concerned about with the filter bubble.
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.320]   There are good reasons to be worried about that.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.320]   Those actually are e-risons.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.280]   You'd be more worried about the personalization of search that Google has done since like
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.720]   2009, not because of their shift with authority, right?
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.160]   Because everybody sees different results.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.640]   You do a search there, I do a search here.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.800]   That's the filter bubble part I reject that I don't worry about.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   So wait, okay.
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:39.760]   Let's take your Galileo example and say that that is a bad example, not because it doesn't
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:45.120]   fit your argument, but because in that timeframe, there was not a rapid fire discussion among
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.520]   people who were deemed authoritative.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:52.320]   There was the church and people like mailing letters back and forth, which is not.
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:57.960]   So Google, it doesn't make sense to argue that in relation to the world we live in now
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:03.840]   with Google and how information is talked about and shared now.
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:09.720]   So picking quality today, like Danny said, Galileo would have a much easier story.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.880]   It's easier time of it because other people would see his stuff.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.880]   The church would not.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.880]   He'd be shouted down.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.880]   I don't think so.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:16.880]   I don't think so.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.960]   And that's the problem is that people with controversial opinions are shouted down.
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.480]   That was controversial for the church.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.480]   Well, all right.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.040]   Then he's Galileo, but people with you will acknowledge that people with controversial
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.520]   opinions today get shouted down.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:31.520]   They are not.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:39.480]   So remember the dude who said autism that vaccines cost vaccine cause autism.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:43.160]   Yeah, scientists were like, well, that's crazy.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.240]   But a lot of people were like, oh, that makes a lot of sense to me.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.880]   And that was that was something that got hold even though it wasn't true.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   And he came back later and said, yeah, I made all that up.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.880]   So.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:59.680]   But I think it's also important to understand that it's not the change that Google's making
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:04.160]   doesn't mean that the results are necessarily going to be clean of controversial opinions
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.600]   or or, you know, yeah, I like what you said about it.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.560]   The more granular the church, the more likely you're going to get those eyeball opinions
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.560]   is the general.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:17.720]   But it if you're going to do a search for did the Holocaust happen?
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:21.160]   And the first thing that they were listing was a white supremacist site telling you that
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.480]   it wasn't.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:27.600]   And then virtually all the rest of the page was made up from denial stuff.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.640]   Let me ask you this.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.640]   Somebody in the chat.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:36.640]   No, somebody in the chat room kind of encapsulated my thinking very well.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:42.720]   And let me ask you if this is nuts to say this.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.760]   But he said, I should find it.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.560]   He said, I think it was reverb, Mike.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.480]   Yeah, Google's the card catalog, not the periodical section.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.640]   Do you know what I mean by that?
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.640]   It's both.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.120]   Well, it's both.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.600]   But if so, okay.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:04.240]   But it's and it's also too simplistic an argument because your card catalog is I want some books
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:09.520]   on this topic and the librarian comes back and says, here are five books, right?
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.080]   So that's what I thought we have in the library.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:14.080]   Right.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.280]   Google has a million thousand books on it.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.040]   And she want to ask for.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.920]   So it could dump 500,000 books at you.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.400]   But that's not very helpful.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.720]   It has to sort them in some way.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.160]   It has to decide which ones it thinks are the most important ones that it tries to show
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.600]   you.
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.000]   And that's what actually a librarian would have done in a library if there were a lot of choices.
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   He said, I just don't know.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   I'm trying to get started on this topic.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   Right.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.240]   So you know, a really good book.
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:43.000]   So a library actually is curation.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.160]   But the card catalog is not the card catalog is an attempt to be complete.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.880]   But Google doesn't do that because that you will be unusable.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.760]   You don't want a million research results.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.720]   You want to you want to have an order.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:59.800]   I get the goal that we want to have unbiased.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   Just saying it's impossible.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   And that's my question.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.680]   I just there aren't unbiased things.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.000]   And I also what you're saying about, well, I don't want it to be as biased.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.400]   But I think it's easy to think of being too biased in terms of say political views.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.040]   Do you want Google to be more liberal and less conservative?
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.040]   Not really.
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.880]   I don't think people would have to do that.
[00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:18.880]   Very much not.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.880]   But that's.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:21.880]   And that's my concern.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.880]   Right.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:23.880]   Right.
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.360]   But the idea of saying, well, I don't want it to be as authoritative because I want to
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.160]   get, I don't know, less stuff.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:31.400]   I get that as well.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:33.600]   But then it's like just trying to find it.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:37.560]   I think they are trying to find the balance that's in there in a way that provides results
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:40.840]   that work for most people most of the time.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.680]   And this is why I'm glad you were here.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.760]   If you really want to find some of these sites and you really want to get ID, it's not like
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.760]   the sites aren't in Google.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.480]   It's not like you can't locate that.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.560]   That reassures me.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:55.160]   You actually you actually crystallized it for me because you said a general search.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.920]   The more general a search, the more they're going to impose an order on it, the more specific
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:06.800]   a search, the more likely you're going to find the variation of thinking on that.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.560]   And so, and that actually is, I think, a good way to compromise.
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:16.160]   So if you, you know, if you search for Holocaust, that's different from searching, you know,
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:21.360]   did the Holocaust happen or even more, I want to read Holocaust denier sites because you
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.560]   would, Google would give you those.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:24.560]   Yes.
[00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.720]   If you were explicitly, and that is a different thing, right?
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:32.720]   Like if you just like want to find Holocaust denial sites, Google lists them and you can
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.160]   find them by search for them.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:37.920]   And that actually reassures me because then that gives me what I do.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.720]   And that goes into the other thing too, which is part of the change they made, which was
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:44.240]   not to detour you into some of these weird areas, right?
[00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.800]   You search for Holocaust and it suggested the Holocaust happen and all of a sudden it sent
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:53.200]   you off into this very specific, you know, discussion, which is not really what you were
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.200]   intending.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.000]   Yeah, I mean, that's, and it comes, this came up because of snippets, right?
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.560]   So in a snippet, it would say no.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:04.920]   Is climate change real?
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:05.920]   Yes.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:11.000]   Because a snippet is Google deciding what is factual.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.760]   But that's different from search results.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.160]   And snippets are the really the most problematical thing here.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.200]   And that's why you can still search for who invented homework and Google will tell you
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:26.080]   is Roberto Nabelas in 1995 in Venice.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.640]   Oh, yeah, it's still up to be up forever.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:30.640]   To be up forever.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.120]   Oh my God.
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.120]   Okay.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.080]   I didn't mean to bring this back, Stacey.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.680]   I know this is a well-worn.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.920]   How did we get here?
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:41.200]   Well, I just, but I, but we had Danny on.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.600]   He wrote this article on authority.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:43.600]   I thought this was a different thing.
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.600]   He's kind of looking at the surface.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.600]   And he is making.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.120]   But I'm glad actually I'm glad.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.120]   Yeah, right.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.120]   It was all.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.120]   It's you started, Dan.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:56.720]   I'm glad that you were here because I think you actually did say that's something that
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:02.680]   reassured me and because of you deep understanding how Google works, that actually is reassuring.
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:06.240]   General is one thing specific is another snippets.
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.800]   Forget about it.
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.240]   You did move the conversation forward, didn't he?
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.240]   Yep.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.640]   She's grudgingly admitting that.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   I'm not.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:18.400]   I am thankful, especially if that means we don't have to come back to it.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:24.840]   Before Stacey is so tired of my Bet Noir, my obsessions.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.800]   We all have our, I have crazy obsessions.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:27.960]   What's your obsession?
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.360]   What will you bring up every time on this show?
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.600]   Oh, probably net neutrality.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.520]   Okay, let's do it.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:35.520]   Let's take a break.
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:36.520]   Let's do it.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.680]   There's some, there's quite a bit of news on net neutrality.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:42.320]   We're going to, we're going to fuel Stacey's obsession next.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.320]   Oh, dear.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:48.360]   And then we want to talk about Google's results because there's a lot to parse there too.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.800]   Our show today brought to you by the best new way to search for business travel.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.800]   Upside.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:59.720]   I'm just like, I'd be kind of fell in love with Upside over the last few months.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.440]   We book a lot of business travel.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:07.200]   And you know, if, when I was at Ziff Davis, big company, there was literally a travel
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.200]   bureau.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.920]   There were people you would call and they would book your travel for you into the whole
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:14.600]   thing and they had pre-negotiated prices with the airlines and the hotels.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.600]   And that was awesome.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.880]   But most businesses aren't that big.
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.720]   Our business isn't.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.160]   So Upside kind of does it for you.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.840]   Upside is the best new way for small and medium sized businesses to book their business
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:26.840]   travel.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:32.840]   Comes to you from Jay Walker who founded Priceline and you know, after his great success with Priceline
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:37.320]   he thought, well, where else can I, where else can I make the world a better place?
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:40.640]   It bundles flights and hotels together for one low price.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.880]   You will save a lot of money.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.520]   And then Upside is very smart.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:48.360]   They have a little bonus for the people doing the travel booking, a free gift card with
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:52.360]   every trip you book and good gift cards too.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:56.520]   Amazon, there's actually, you can see a variety of gift cards when you look at the website.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:47:00.480]   Go to upside.com and check it out.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.000]   In fact, do a trial booking.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.360]   Just see, you know, compare it to other sites.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.360]   See what you get.
[00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.720]   I think you're going to be really pleased with the results.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:16.280]   There's no need to spend time with a long, you know, elaborate list of choices and prices.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:19.520]   Upside instantly finds the best six flights and hotels.
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:21.800]   You get to choose, by the way, no mysteries.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:25.640]   You get to choose the hotel by name, airline by name, flight time.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.680]   You still get all your frequent flyer miles and everything.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.440]   They have great 24/7 concierge level customer service.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.440]   You can call them.
[00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.440]   You can email them.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.320]   You can chat with them or reach them on social.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.280]   And that is before, during and after every trip.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.840]   So that's really nice to have that.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:44.040]   That's one of the things a good travel agent gives you is someone to call if the flight,
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.560]   you know, got the late or canceled.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:51.040]   If your frequent business traveler, your company is going to save a ton of money and
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:55.320]   you are going to get a gift card worth $1,000, $2,000, even $300.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.400]   Now, when we do it because we're paying for the travel, we just apply the gift card right
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:04.240]   there to the cost of the flight or the cost of the hotel.
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.920]   So you can apply it directly.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:10.200]   But if you're doing it, you know, because your company makes you do it, you get to keep the
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.440]   gift card.
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.080]   You actually get even more with overseas trips.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.000]   You'll get the gift card via email.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.640]   Within 72 hours after booking, you don't have to wait till you travel.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.120]   There's no limit on trips or gift cards.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:27.560]   And the gift cards are for a variety of different businesses, Target, Nordstrom, Amazon, 50 different
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.560]   brands.
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.520]   They even have a hub where you can keep track of your gift cards.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.960]   This is just a win for everybody all around.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.360]   Book your business traveler at upside.com.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.880]   By the way, use a promo code twig when you do it.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.800]   That'll let them know you heard it here, which is good for us.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:46.400]   And it'll guarantee you $100 minimum gift card on your first trip.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.440]   Save big on travel and get a big gift card every trip.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:55.040]   Minimum purchase required seasight for complete details, offer code TWIG.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.480]   This is all we use now.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.320]   Once we discovered this, it was like, and I did get to talk.
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:03.560]   I was actually, I said, can you know, before we do the ads, can I talk to Jay?
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:07.840]   Jay is like such a character.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:11.240]   And I said, was William Shatner your idea for the price line ads?
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.840]   He said, yes, it was.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.760]   Yes, it was.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:19.480]   That was like in 1999 or something, 2000.
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:28.080]   And I said, Bill owes you a great debt because it made him the hippiest guy in the world.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.640]   It was great for Bill and obviously great for price line.
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:31.640]   This isn't price line.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:32.640]   It's upside.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:32.680]   It's a
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:36.680]   nice list and it's awesome.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.680]   Let's see.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:41.360]   And who knew that Bill Shatner could do karate, right?
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.080]   Or sort of.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:49.120]   So Stacey has a little obsession and I don't blame her.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.520]   And it's something we call internet freedom.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:56.080]   Thank goodness Congress has decided to vote for internet freedom.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:50:00.880]   I'm just seeing if that will set her off.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:06.760]   So that's just, this is just a bill proposal and people propose bills all the time.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:12.040]   But you'll notice that my two senators from Texas, home of AT&T are.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:15.920]   The Restore Internet Freedom Act.
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.240]   What does it do?
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:21.400]   It makes sure the FCC will never again.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:24.480]   Thank you, Mitch McConnell, Marco Rubio.
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.760]   Thank you, Tom Cotton.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.200]   Thank you, Ted Cruz.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.760]   Thank you, Mike Lee.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.680]   Well, thank you, Paul.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:40.120]   Rand Paul will never again try to enforce net neutrality.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:41.360]   That's freedom.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.680]   Freedom if you're a big ISP anyway.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.280]   Not so much for people.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.360]   What's so tough about this story is holy cow.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:53.320]   I mean, having complained about this forever and tried to cover it forever, this is such
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:55.360]   a hard sell to normal people.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:01.360]   Like you look at the hub, rightly so, about ACA and health insurance issues.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:07.720]   People are like, people get that and the Senate is still, the Senate and the House are still
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:13.800]   trying to cram something that what looks to be like many Americans are not in favor
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   of.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:19.000]   But when it comes to net neutrality, this is so hard to make this fun for girls.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.880]   I kind of blame Tim Wu because it's the worst possible name.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.080]   They should say, I'm against internet discrimination or something like that, right?
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.480]   Yeah, so here's the deal.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:38.240]   The carriers are, these people have been lobbying the governments like AT&T and Verizon for
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.320]   over 100 years.
[00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.840]   This is not a new game for them.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:45.800]   They have, they're at it for the long haul.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:51.000]   And so, originally we talked about discrimination and then people got mad because how can you
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.360]   talk about how can you define what discrimination is, especially on our networks?
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.360]   We know what it is.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:02.360]   So people tried to get away from that because the words were tainted.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:08.000]   So, safer, you're going to be net neutrality means you're not going to weigh in on the
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.560]   bits, the all bits are equal.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.560]   Right.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:16.000]   Now, Ted Cruz says net neutrality is Obamacare for the internet.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.840]   Ted, what the hell does that even mean?
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.560]   What does it even mean?
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.800]   Good, great soundbite.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.640]   Obamacare for the internet.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.400]   Is that even?
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.000]   Well, a lot of people like Obamacare.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:38.360]   Well, but no, it's clear that the word Obama applied to anything will make it bad.
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:42.040]   So this restoring internet freedom act, by the way, you're right.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.040]   It's not a bill yet.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.480]   It's just perhaps a bill.
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.480]   But it would...
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.000]   Just call it trickle down internet nomic.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.160]   You know, I'll say it again.
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.680]   I said it last week and I think it...
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:52.680]   It's not nomic.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:53.680]   It's really...
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.680]   When somebody said this, I saw a tweet.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.240]   I wish I could give the guy credit.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:04.080]   He said, "Where net neutrality with the FCC tried to do does not regulate the internet.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:10.080]   It regulates companies called internet service providers who want to break the internet.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:13.720]   It tells them you may not break the internet.
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.720]   It is not internet regulation.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.360]   It's not saying what can happen on the internet.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:22.400]   It's saying companies provide internet to people shall not."
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.880]   Now this is the opposite and this is where...
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.040]   We're really in an Orwellian...
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.760]   Actually, what is it?
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:33.160]   1984, where peace is war and truth is...
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:35.000]   Lies are truth.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.480]   What do they call that speak?
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.480]   Double speak.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.480]   Double speak.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.480]   Double speak.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:44.600]   This is not the restoring internet freedom act.
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:53.240]   This is the restoring the rights of internet service providers to gouge you act.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:58.320]   It would prehebit the open internet order and it would prohibit the FCC from ever issuing
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.320]   a similar ruling.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:01.880]   Now remember, I did say that it's up to...
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:02.880]   I want...
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:03.880]   What happened?
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:04.880]   The internet's been nullified.
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.400]   My screen is black.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.120]   Wait, this is an episode 404 yet.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.560]   What happened?
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:18.320]   I did say last week Congress has to decide, not the FCC.
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:20.880]   It's appropriate to say, "Congress, what do you think?"
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:26.920]   I think if they made this a bill, they might see some opposition on the floor of the House
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.280]   and the Senate.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:36.080]   Now what really stuck in their craw the last time was that after...
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:42.080]   Was Tom Wheeler kind of being a little wishy-washy on whether or not he was going to implement
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.080]   title two.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:44.080]   He was.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.080]   He was.
[00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:49.360]   And then I'm not sure if the timeline totally meshes up.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:53.720]   If it was John Oliver's dingo speech that really did things.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:59.440]   But at some point in time, the White House did come in and say, "Hey, look, a lot of
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:03.240]   people are really upset about this.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.120]   This is becoming an issue.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.360]   Can we look at this?"
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:10.400]   And then Wheeler did look at title two.
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:17.000]   But before then, he had people on his staff who were already advocating for title two.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.360]   And this was not a foreign proposal.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:23.000]   It's just one that he was like, "I'm not really that into it.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   Can we do it in some other way?
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   This is going to cause a lot."
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   Because he knew the drama.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.920]   Yeah, he was right to try to find another way, but there was no other way.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:31.200]   And then I judge told him.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.300]   Yeah.
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:36.000]   And so yeah, if we want, if we won't Congress to go back and deal with the Telecommunications
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.320]   Act, but right now it feels like all we are doing in Congress, and this has been the
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.840]   way for a while, I'm not going to blame it just on this administration, we're just
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:48.920]   like, we're fighting back against a status quo that is ancient.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:54.680]   And anytime we try to move a step forward, we're just making these stupid knee-jerk laws
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.600]   to put us back.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:59.200]   It's so frustrating.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:03.800]   Well, this is our particular Bayley Wick net neutrality.
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.160]   And of course, I have a big stake in it.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.880]   You all have a big stake in it.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:12.440]   Because we provide content on the internet.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:18.760]   And if, you know, this is why we care, if Comcast were to say, "Netflix isn't going
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.800]   to count against your bandwidth cap."
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.680]   And Comcast has, I think, draconian bandwidth caps.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.920]   A terabyte doesn't sound like a lot of it is.
[00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:26.920]   Not much.
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:27.920]   That sounds like a lot.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:28.920]   It's not.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:30.520]   If Comcast were to say, "Oh, good news.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:35.440]   Netflix will not count against your bandwidth cap," but "Twit would," and that in its very
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:44.520]   essence is net neutrality, non-neutrality, then it would be harmful to me and my business.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:51.040]   I, the Twit exists because you can get bits from the internet easily, right?
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:55.920]   And so does Search Engine Land, so does Marketing Engine Land, so does the IoT podcast.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.880]   So we are very much impacted by this.
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:05.880]   And as a result...
[00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.000]   And as a Republican, you would think having to go and do a separate deal with every ISP
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   to make sure your bits made it to the end consumer is time consuming, it's expensive,
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   etc.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:16.480]   So it doesn't even pass the efficiency test from that perspective.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.840]   I would love to see Congress take this up.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:24.520]   Let's take up this stupid freedom act because I think that we would then write to our members
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:27.240]   of Congress as we've shown that we're capable of doing.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:32.520]   We showed it, Tom Wheeler was convinced by more than a million comments on Titan 2.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:34.480]   You know, I got a car yesterday.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:35.480]   It was fastened.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:36.480]   It wasn't Uber, Lyft.
[00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:39.040]   Those are not in Austin.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:43.160]   But my driver, I was talking to the driver and he was going out of the country and he
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:47.160]   said, "Yeah, you know, I'm really upset right now about net neutrality."
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.160]   Yay!
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:51.440]   I was like, "Tell me more about your thoughts here."
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:55.480]   I couldn't believe I was having a conversation with a normal person.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:57.880]   And they brought it up, not me.
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:59.760]   It was very exciting for me.
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.760]   Good.
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.240]   Kind of scared of a little with my passion.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:06.000]   And people who watch this should be, and I would love to see Congress take this up.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.320]   I would love to see Congress not only take this up, but also look at taking up improving
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:15.120]   the competitive landscape among internet service providers.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:19.440]   Because part of the reason this is an issue is you don't have choice.
[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:23.120]   I mean, we're lucky here we have SonicNet as our provider.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:28.000]   Sonic doesn't have bandwidth caps, fights, you know, do all the things right.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.320]   So we have an internet service provider that believes in net neutrality.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:34.840]   But at home, I don't have that choice.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:38.240]   And most people in this country don't have the choice.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:44.640]   86% of internet users in the United States have two internet service providers to choose
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:45.640]   from.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:51.360]   They're cable company and they're phone company, neither of which in the case of the big companies
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:53.160]   support net neutrality.
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:56.000]   I'm trying to think if there was a way to do it where you likened it to getting phone
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   calls.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.080]   I just have to play with the metaphor a lot more.
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:06.480]   But like, you know, one way of describing it is as if you were to say to someone, hey,
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:08.800]   telemarketer is going to be able to call you all they want.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:13.480]   And it's not going to use any of your minutes for phone.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:18.320]   But if people you know and love want to call you, it's going to cost them a lot more money.
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.320]   Good analogy.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:23.160]   You know, and people I think would be like, what do you mean it's going to cost them a
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:25.000]   lot more money just to call my phone number?
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.640]   It's not like a paid number.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.080]   Well, you know, they haven't paid us.
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:31.560]   So we have to charge them more or whatever.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:35.840]   So you know, there may be some ways of playing with it along like that because, you know,
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:38.040]   in terms of how can you think of it as utilities.
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:39.040]   Far, far from money.
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.040]   The same thing.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.480]   Sorry, but it goes to the same thing with the privacy stuff.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:47.360]   It's like the ISP I'm buying, like I'm buying my electricity.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:52.000]   I'm not expecting them that like my data gets sold to telemarketers.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.360]   I'm not expecting that if I want to buy electricity that I'm going to have to pay less if I use
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:02.720]   a certain appliance, you know, or I have to pay more if I want to use an appliance.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.800]   Not not because the appliances inefficient, but can you imagine like, can you imagine
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.400]   if you had a house and you're like, well, I want to put in all world full appliances
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.440]   and they're like, oh, you're going to use world pull appliances?
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.160]   We're going to charge you twice as much for electricity.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.160]   And you're like, why?
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.080]   They use the same electricity as like another appliance.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.120]   Well, we don't have a deal with world pull.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.120]   Right?
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.760]   Like, I don't care you don't have a deal with world poor.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.760]   None.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:29.760]   I'm buying electricity from you.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.600]   What I want to put into it doesn't make a difference.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:39.240]   But the consumer won't actually even see those trade us because someone like Leo has to make
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:46.040]   them and he's probably going to, you can't pass the cost of internet content exactly
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.040]   down to the user.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.240]   No, because I'm free.
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:53.320]   Well, so, and you are too.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.600]   And frankly, so is Danny.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.880]   So how could we do that?
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.560]   You know, we're screwed.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:03.760]   It's far had Manju in the times did a column where he was trying to frame it as an issue
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:12.440]   of consumers versus big corporations, which that's I mean, at its clearest.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.840]   That is what it is.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.800]   But we're arguing for consumers.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.120]   We're arguing that they were arguing in favor of something they haven't seen yet.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.080]   They don't know that there's a problem against the unknowns.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.240]   So you might not get the hottest, coolest new service.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:29.520]   Snapchat might not exist.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.760]   And people are like, ah, Snapchat exists.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.720]   I'm cool.
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.560]   It's a very hard thing.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.560]   And yeah, I, I can't believe we're here again.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:43.640]   Again, see, this is my theme for the show.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.040]   How did I get here again?
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.040]   Stacey Rewind.
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:52.600]   This is the show I realized I've lived all of this before and I didn't enjoy it the
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.600]   first time.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.600]   Yeah, we have.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:58.160]   Well, as you point out, it is not an official bill yet.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.160]   It is a proposal.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.080]   Well, it says they submitted legislation.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:07.080]   But you know, remind me again how a bill becomes a law.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.080]   I don't.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.520]   If you find sponsor, enough sponsors, you get the bill.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.080]   Nine sponsors, nine senators.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.080]   Yes.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.080]   That seems enough.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.080]   And then, then they're going to have to vote on it and then, or just go to a committee.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:23.360]   I think it goes to committee first and then the committee says, I'm going to walk to the
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:28.560]   committee and I'm standing online with a lot of other bills just to buy in my time.
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.360]   I didn't pay attention to that.
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:35.920]   Actually, I'm just a bill on Capitol Hill came after reading.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.920]   What was it?
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.360]   It was a, it came after schoolhouse rock came after my time.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.360]   You know what?
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.880]   This is what I was going to say.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:44.880]   Play it.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:45.880]   Leo.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:48.880]   I'm going to because I'm sure it's on a bill.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.960]   I showed it to my daughter.
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.720]   I'm sure it's on YouTube, right?
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.720]   Well, I hope and pray that I will.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.520]   But today I am still just a bill.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:03.000]   Hey, Bill, now you're a law.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:06.800]   Here we go, ladies and gentlemen, schoolhouse rock.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:13.240]   You sure got to climb a lot of steps to get to this Capitol building here in Washington.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:17.200]   Well, I wonder who that sad little scrap of paper is.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.640]   Who is that sad little scrap of paper?
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:25.040]   Yes, I'm only a bill and I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:30.760]   Well, it's a long, long journey to the Capitol City.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.760]   It's a long, long wait while I'm sitting in committee.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:37.440]   But I know I'll be a law someday.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.720]   At least I hope and pray that I will.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.040]   But today I am still just a bill.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.080]   Hey, Bill, you certainly have a lot.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.080]   You know what?
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:48.880]   I have never seen that.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:49.880]   Oh, it's.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.840]   I know it because everybody of your age sings.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.880]   I'm just a bill on Capitol Hill.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:57.800]   It taught you so much.
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:58.800]   It did.
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.000]   Like it's only more people could learn it.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.680]   Well, now I know it's got to get out of committee, right?
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:09.880]   We got to find the schoolhouse rocks people and have them do a song about net neutrality.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.360]   You know, John Oliver, they did the best one, right?
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.360]   That's the one.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.640]   But that was like a six minute effort.
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.480]   And a lot of work.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:25.360]   And you know, he's obviously a raging liberal, so I can't trust him.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.600]   He's not authoritative by Google standards.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.040]   Not by my standards, man.
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:30.240]   I can't trust that, man.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.480]   He's all for regulation, government regulation.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:37.080]   All right, enough.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:38.760]   We got the point.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.920]   Make keep in touch with your Congress critter.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:48.560]   And when they have it open for comment yet, Ajit Pai's proposal, but when they do, we
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:51.400]   will let you know exactly how.
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:56.160]   And the other place to go and stay on top of this is eff.org, the electronic frontier
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:05:00.600]   foundation, right on the front page.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.680]   The FCC wants to eliminate net neutrality.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.680]   We can't let that happen.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.960]   They will tell you everything you need to know.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.040]   These are great people.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:13.040]   It's the number one nonprofit defending digital privacy, free speech and innovation.
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.800]   And they're nonpartisan.
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:20.560]   But they really, they tell you how you can get involved.
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:23.160]   Don't surrender the internet.
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.760]   And this is really good.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.760]   This is really good.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.800]   Email your representatives better yet.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.800]   Call them.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.840]   Always call.
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:33.840]   It's easy.
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.960]   I'll even call mine, even though.
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.040]   Is Ted Cruz your, he's one of your senators.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.040]   Who's the other one?
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:42.080]   Yeah, both John Cornyn and Ted Cruz are my...
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.880]   They're both sponsors.
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.880]   And they're both sponsors.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:45.720]   Isn't that nice?
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.320]   But you know, I call them all the time.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:51.840]   I even call my representative who sent us a letter saying that, you know, he's actually
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:57.760]   okay with what Trump's doing in every aspect of his administration.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:00.000]   I still call them.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   It's really...
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   I don't know.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   I was about to say hopeless.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:13.280]   I feel like it's ceciphy and I feel like it's almost out of our control at this point.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:17.480]   And sometimes I kind of wish that they could get everything they want so they could see
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.640]   how crappy life would be.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:20.640]   That happened.
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:21.640]   But then we're stuck with it.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.920]   So you see that in...
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920]   Is it Kansas?
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.880]   There have been some lovely stories written about it.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:28.880]   Oh yeah, Kansas is a good example.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.840]   I mean, when they get everything they want...
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:32.840]   Anyway, anyway.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.040]   Hey, let's talk about them.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:39.640]   Let's talk about why I just got a Google Pixel and it won't let me choose Hangouts as my default
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.880]   messaging app.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:41.880]   What?
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.880]   Why?
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.560]   Why can't you use Hangouts?
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:47.720]   I don't know because it's a Google Phi phone and Google Phi.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:51.760]   Text messages come in as Hangouts but they apparently don't want me to use it to send
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.760]   out as SMS-ish.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.360]   I have to use Android Messenger or Facebook.
[01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.680]   There was a bug with that.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.680]   I don't think it's a bug.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.120]   I think this is the new thing.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:03.200]   Are you a Google Voice user?
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.200]   Yes.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.200]   I've got a Google...
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.240]   And this is a Google Phi.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.240]   This is a Phi phone.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:12.400]   I've got a Google Phi phone and I've just hangouts on it just fine.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.400]   I know but no, no.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:18.440]   I'm just saying go into apps, choose your default apps and it's where it says SMS app.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.440]   What are your choices?
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:24.560]   Well, in my case Facebook Messenger messages which is Android messages and signal because
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:27.500]   those are the three messaging apps I have installed not Hangouts.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:30.600]   But what does Binget the default do for you anyway?
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:36.680]   It means that if you send an SMS it goes through Android messages and you send an SMS
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:38.580]   from Hangouts.
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.280]   I can but it's not the default.
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.320]   Yes, you can.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.320]   Just use Hangouts.
[01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:44.320]   If you send from...
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:45.320]   No, no.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:48.960]   On my dock the Hangouts is the messaging app on my dock.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:51.480]   So when you send from Hangouts you're sending from Hangouts.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:56.880]   So the problem is when you receive but if you've clicked on Google Voice, redirect anything
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:02.800]   from Google Voice to Hangouts then it'll come into Hangouts.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:05.080]   It's a Phi Phi phone home.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.440]   It doesn't matter that it's a Phi phone.
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.680]   That's just a SIM card.
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:15.680]   No, I'm telling you that's a little fix it.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.680]   That's how I fix it.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.960]   Switch from Hangouts to a new text messaging app.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.960]   But you don't need to switch.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.240]   You're happy with what you're doing.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.480]   I know Google.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:24.480]   Just use that.
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:27.440]   I don't have the little thing in front of me to show you but just go into Hangouts and
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:28.440]   make sure you've ticked.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.440]   I know.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.440]   I know what you're talking about.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.600]   No, I know what you're talking about.
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:37.760]   And I am and I still am and text messages now come to both Android Messenger and Hangouts.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.880]   I haven't had this problem.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.320]   Well go ahead and try it.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:45.360]   You haven't updated the latest version of Android 7.1.2.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:47.160]   Connect Hangouts in Google Voice, right?
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.240]   Yeah, no, no, no.
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.240]   Look in your phone.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.520]   Look in your Pixel phone.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.160]   You can no longer make Hangouts your default SMS app.
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.920]   I guess I never used it as my default.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:57.440]   I never set it in the first place.
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:59.280]   All right.
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.920]   So you get your SMS messages in two places.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.920]   I don't think so.
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:06.120]   I don't ask.
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:07.120]   It's confusing.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.120]   I have to go look.
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:11.120]   Google's dropping SMS support from Hangouts.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:12.120]   I can't go look right now.
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.360]   I'm on the phone.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.240]   But that wasn't the same thing.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.960]   But that was for Google Voice people.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.600]   And that's not for Google Voice people.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:20.120]   No, five people were exempted.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:21.680]   I understand.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:24.200]   I'm not a Google Voice person because I lost my stand.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.240]   I am and I'm not.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.000]   If I go to watch, you know this.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.400]   If you go to voice.google.com, watch.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.400]   Go ahead, watch.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.240]   You have to log out of Google Voice.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:35.240]   It brings you to Project 5.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.240]   I know.
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.240]   It's a great nightmare.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:43.880]   You have Google Voice on one account and you have Google Phi or Phi as I like to call it.
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:44.880]   Why?
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.200]   Like Jeff on another account.
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.840]   You can never be logged in.
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:51.800]   You got to totally log out of that Google Phi account.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.960]   But I don't want to log out.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.840]   I'm using Google Phi.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:57.360]   But what do you care on Google Phi on the web?
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.680]   Because this is how I see my billing and my thing.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:05.000]   But just open it up in an incognito tab.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.200]   Why are you going to Google Voice anyway on the web?
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.200]   You only need to do it once.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.880]   I have Google Hangouts on my desktop.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:16.640]   You sound like you're I think you have you ever heard of Stockholm syndrome?
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.320]   No, I know.
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:24.640]   Do not get me going on Google and the nightmare that it is with Google Voice.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:29.720]   And just even when they rolled out the new app, it was a piece of crap because it looks
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:30.720]   cleaner.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.120]   But do you want to send animated gifts with Google Gboard?
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:35.080]   No, you don't get to do that with Google.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.560]   So I'm like back on Google Hangouts.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:42.960]   And I would abandon Google Voice and Google Handouts and all the mess that they've got
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:43.960]   out there.
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:44.960]   No one knows what they're doing.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.600]   And like you say, you try to Google, Google Phi.
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:49.720]   And I'm like, I'm sorry, you're you're going to Google Voice, but you were Google Phi on
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:50.720]   another account.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.960]   You could never ever go and you're like, Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.960]   Oh, and why?
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:55.960]   I guess I didn't get them started.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:01.360]   At this point, can't I have a Google Phi account with a Google account that is like a Google
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:05.040]   Docs work, whatever Gboard, whatever they're calling the new stuff.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.580]   Oh, G Suite got a G Suite account?
[01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:08.740]   No Google Phi for you.
[01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:09.740]   Why?
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:13.920]   I don't know where Google we can't handle the fact that people who pay us money to have
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.640]   services can't actually get to use all the services will give everybody else for free.
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:23.360]   So yeah, I got some issues with Google and their big messed up thing.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:27.880]   But I've worked around them in fact, because, you know, when I was in Japan, I turned on
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.280]   my Google Phi phone.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.800]   I had internet and it worked.
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:35.320]   And I had Google Voice, so I could still get phone calls from the US and I could send out
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.800]   messages and that was very convenient.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:38.880]   So I live with it.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:42.520]   I endure it just for those occasional overseas trips.
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:46.080]   Wow, Danny, that felt really cathartic.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.680]   I enjoyed that a lot.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:54.520]   I mean, I kind of want like a T-shirt of you doing this.
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:12:00.800]   Oh, it is embarrassing though, because Google Voice is such a great service, has potential
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:06.200]   to be such a great service and they've just shoved it off into nowhere land.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.520]   And you're just like, what is wrong?
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:11.480]   And my only guess is because they just don't think they can make any money off of it.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:13.760]   So, so I ask everybody this.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:14.760]   I go down the street.
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:21.000]   I asked the guy in a 7-Eleven, what's going on with Google's messaging strategy?
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.080]   Do you know Danny?
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.600]   Because Stacy and I don't know.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.600]   How do those kind of things come?
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:28.520]   I mean, we have like 20 different apps.
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:34.600]   I usually say, well, if I, if you buy a slushy, we can talk about nintr neutrality.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:39.040]   Why don't we just launch an app, call it Messenger, because everybody else gets to call their
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:46.160]   apps generic names or call it Google Messenger and roll everything into one and make it work.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.600]   I don't need all over here and hang out.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:54.720]   I would make an, I would make actually a very nice default messaging app.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.720]   I have to think there's some external force being applied here.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:01.680]   Maybe antitrust regulations or something.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:04.640]   I mean, they're worried about the EU or something.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:10.040]   I tried it so hard though, because it's not like they have any huge stake on the messaging
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.560]   platform, right?
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:12.960]   It may be it's carrier pushback.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:13.960]   I don't know.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.360]   I don't know.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.360]   I don't know.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.360]   But it's a mess.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:23.280]   And if they launch at I/O another messaging app, I'm going to lose money.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.280]   I can't do that.
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.280]   Google I/O is coming up.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.440]   It's only a few weeks out.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.440]   I will be there.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:28.920]   Jeff Jarvis will be there.
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.320]   Stacey, you're not going to I/O this year.
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.320]   I'm not.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.120]   You know, I'm supposed to be here.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.800]   I think I might be hosting your live chat.
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:36.800]   That would be awesome.
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:37.800]   I was going to ask you to do that.
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:38.800]   That's fantastic.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.840]   So, yeah, Carsten's already on it.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:41.840]   Good.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:45.760]   And we'll be sitting in the audience and maybe we'll call afterwards and be part of Teweig.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:48.480]   And I think we actually, we have a room at Google.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.840]   Chris Dibona is helping us again this year.
[01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:56.400]   So we can that we can after the keynote go over to the room and do this week in Google.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.400]   Because it's Wednesday, right?
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.400]   The keynote is Wednesday.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.640]   Are you going to pull on interesting Google people into the room?
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.640]   You should.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.640]   Last year we got Matt Cutts in.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.040]   I don't think he's around on campus anymore.
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:11.560]   By the way, does anybody know what I know Matt is the interim director of the government
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:15.960]   data service or whatever they call it, but US data server.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:18.360]   But what exact is he is he digital services?
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:19.360]   Is he still there?
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.360]   Is he doing anything?
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.360]   He would have to kill you.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.640]   I feel like and by kill you, I mean metaphor.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.080]   He was all internet data.
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:30.040]   Yes, Carsten and Tonya to reach out to Matt and say, are you still doing that?
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.040]   He's still there.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.240]   Is he still doing there?
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:34.240]   That's got to be a thankless task.
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:39.720]   Well, you know, I think he sees it as I'm doing good work for America.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:47.060]   Didn't didn't the president just announced that he is he's got a new technology board
[01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:51.080]   advising him and he's asked everybody including Google to be on it.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.980]   Yeah, no word yet about whether anybody is going to.
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:56.420]   I think Jared's going to run that board too.
[01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.860]   So Jared's in charge, man.
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:01.660]   Yeah, he's the guy who can do it all.
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:02.660]   Yep.
[01:15:02.660 --> 01:15:07.260]   Elon, maybe I don't know there is you know, there's the business advisory council, but
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:09.420]   there's now a technology advisory council.
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:10.820]   There it is.
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:12.820]   To transform and monitor his use government.
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:17.500]   Did nobody tell him that Matt cuts is over in the basement with the US digital service
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:18.500]   with that mission?
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:23.380]   Yeah, I don't know if it's the same kind of mission, but maybe it is.
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.460]   I don't know.
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:30.060]   And code for America and well, there's probably the impression the people over in that I
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:32.980]   get the impression people over in that basement are just keeping their heads down hoping no
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:34.540]   one notices it.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:36.380]   Just please continue our funding.
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:37.380]   Yeah.
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:44.580]   Alright, let's talk about Google's, Google's alphabets, I should say results.
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:50.660]   The results are in Google's growth in advertising.
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:55.260]   The ad business was what 18% have to pull it up because I'm doing this from memory,
[01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:57.580]   alphabet, quarterly results.
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:00.580]   But what's interesting is the other businesses.
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:08.740]   So advertising is its primary business, obviously, but other businesses were also doing pretty
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:11.060]   well, including I think the Pixel phone.
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:12.060]   Let me see.
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:13.060]   Here we go.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:14.060]   Alphabet earnings.
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:15.220]   Did the guy in charge a Pixel phone leave?
[01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:16.220]   Yes.
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:17.220]   Did I see that?
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.220]   He was only there six months.
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:19.220]   Okay.
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:20.220]   He said that did happen.
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:21.220]   Job done.
[01:16:21.220 --> 01:16:22.220]   Have fun.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:23.220]   And he left.
[01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:25.220]   I guess it did.
[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:26.860]   It does have a new name.
[01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:27.860]   Pixel?
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:28.860]   Yeah, he changed the name.
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:29.860]   That was it.
[01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:36.380]   Mobile search, big, big, big, ongoing strength, YouTube driving ad sales, higher sales on
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:38.300]   Google Play, hardware and cloud.
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:41.540]   That's the other growing substantially.
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:43.780]   It's a tiring hearing about mobile search at this point.
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:47.940]   It's almost as if we're in like 2001 and they're going, mobile search is web search
[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:48.940]   is big.
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.220]   What the, we know that now.
[01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:51.220]   Like what?
[01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:52.220]   Advertising.
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.220]   Advertising.
[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:59.460]   Advertising revenue up from 18 billion to 21 billion year over year.
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:05.180]   Net income up to, this is in three months kids, 5.43 billion dollars.
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:08.420]   That's up from 4.2 a year ago.
[01:17:08.420 --> 01:17:11.420]   Nice little bit of growth there, 1.2 billion dollars.
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:16.940]   They made an extra 400 million dollars a month.
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:22.740]   And every geography revenues up in the US, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Pacific.
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:26.660]   Alphabet, traffic acquisition costs in the Google network.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:28.060]   Wow, this is interesting.
[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.060]   What is that Danny?
[01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:31.060]   Traffic acquisition costs 4.63 billion.
[01:17:31.060 --> 01:17:36.940]   So you've got the amount of money that they pay to AdSense people.
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:40.140]   So that's their outbound AdSense.
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:41.140]   That's a lot of money.
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:43.140]   That's a lot of money.
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:44.540]   They made more money off of it.
[01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:48.300]   I think the big, one of the big charts I saw was that their percentage of income that
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:54.820]   they're generating off of their network continues to go down.
[01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:57.780]   Whereas the amount of money they're making off of their owned and operated properties
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:59.180]   is going up.
[01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:03.420]   So they're becoming less dependent on that as a whole.
[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:09.580]   Or they're just figuring out ways to make even more money off of their own sites.
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:13.180]   Other bets, that's Google fiber.
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:15.340]   This is all the stuff Ruth Porak cut.
[01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:22.660]   Google fibers, Nest, Waymo, the life sciences division and venture capital investing.
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:25.900]   Now I wish they'd break that out because I'm thinking it's probably venture capital made
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:26.940]   the most money.
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:32.540]   But revenue was up from 165 million a year ago to 244 million profits.
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:34.900]   No revenue.
[01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:36.340]   Yes.
[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:37.340]   Profits didn't.
[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:38.340]   My fiber's expensive.
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:39.340]   It's expensive.
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.460]   I'm not making any money on it, but there's money coming in.
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:44.540]   There's just more money going out.
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:53.540]   Somebody I know, I think it's Alex Wilhelm characterizes that as how much it costs them
[01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:59.100]   to generate the $224 million.
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:04.100]   It costs them a little over a billion dollars to create that $244 million revenue.
[01:19:04.100 --> 01:19:07.340]   Well, that makes sense because they're other bets.
[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:10.060]   Well, not just other bets, but those are physical goods.
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:12.820]   I mean, cost of goods sold is a legitimate thing.
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:16.300]   And then in Telco, your cap X is huge.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:21.900]   I mean, so anyway, I like physical stuff.
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:22.900]   Yes.
[01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:23.900]   I'm like, yay.
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:24.900]   Yes.
[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:25.900]   But it's a crummy business.
[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:30.060]   Alphabet spends the vast majority of its money running its search business, which drives
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:33.340]   99% of the revenue.
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:42.780]   But they also spent last year $4.4 billion on other bets, Google Ventures, Google Fiber
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:49.420]   Calico, which is the, how to live forever company Verily, which is the glucose sensing
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.700]   contact lens company Nest.
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:52.700]   You know, a Nest is.
[01:19:52.700 --> 01:19:58.620]   And then something I hadn't heard of capital G, which is the new name for Google Ventures.
[01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:01.740]   Oh, maybe capital G.
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:05.660]   So does Google have an additional R&D department?
[01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:09.380]   No, no, X is the R&D, right?
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.140]   That's the, the moon shots, right?
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.140]   Isn't it?
[01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:13.140]   Okay.
[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:16.180]   Because if you look at this like R&D expenditures, it's fairly in line.
[01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:20.620]   I mean, I mean, between five and 10% of right.
[01:20:20.620 --> 01:20:24.260]   You see, you see, if I look at this graph, I think this is a previous quarter, but, or
[01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:28.100]   maybe, oh, no, this is last year, you see this graph that the red part, the little tiny
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:30.420]   red parts, that's, that's other bets.
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:38.060]   So it is, it's a fraction of the total revenue and costs, you know.
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:42.420]   What Danny, is there a search engine R&D?
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:43.420]   There must be.
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.420]   They've got to try stuff.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:51.620]   I, you know, yes, but to the degree that it's broken out from other stuff, I don't know.
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:52.620]   Right.
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:53.620]   I really don't know.
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:58.340]   I mean, you get things like they would have ranked brain that came out of their artificial
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:00.780]   intelligence group, and that's all kind of R&D.
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:02.220]   I would think AI is very nice.
[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:03.220]   It seems very nice.
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:06.220]   It was the big R&D expenditure voice.
[01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:09.380]   You know, that might be an investment in product.
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:12.140]   You could look at that as an investment in product development, though, easily.
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:13.140]   Of course you could.
[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:17.900]   Because, I mean, a lot of the techniques they're using, they're not, it's not at the research
[01:21:17.900 --> 01:21:19.500]   level anymore.
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:24.800]   Even, even stuff like computer vision and neural network type stuff, that's actually
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:28.500]   been established for a while, we just didn't have the compute power to actually make it
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:31.500]   widely applicable for a reasonable amount.
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.500]   I don't know.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:37.440]   I mean, I'm not an expert in like R&D and what's classified as that, but those don't
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.080]   feel that feels not crazy.
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.280]   Nice growth, though, overall.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:47.760]   Increasing revenues year over year 22 percent.
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:49.600]   Pretty nice.
[01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:54.540]   Increasing margin 27 percent.
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:55.540]   Get this though.
[01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:56.540]   Effective tax rate.
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:57.540]   It's up.
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:58.540]   It was 18 percent.
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:00.420]   They now pay 20 percent taxes.
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:02.620]   How much do you and I pay in taxes?
[01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:04.380]   A little more than that.
[01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:05.380]   A lot.
[01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:06.380]   A bit more.
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.180]   I would love a 20 percent tax rate.
[01:22:08.180 --> 01:22:10.340]   We've got to hide more of it in Ireland.
[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:15.820]   I think I got to get that Irish subsidiary, that Irish, put Ireland, got to get that going.
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:16.820]   Who's so close?
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:17.820]   I will go.
[01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:18.820]   I volunteered to go set up your studio.
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:19.820]   Okay.
[01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:23.640]   We'll give you the license for all the shows.
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:27.120]   We'll send all the income over to Twitter.
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:29.200]   We could hire people with Irish accents to talk.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.200]   They talk like that.
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.200]   Oh, that's a good wonder.
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:33.280]   Oh, you love that.
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.280]   She likes it too.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.280]   I'll talk.
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:40.400]   I'll be like her in Irish spring country.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:42.400]   Oh, the client.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.680]   I can't wait.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:49.880]   Facebook opens up 360 degree live streaming to everyone.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:55.060]   So the next time you murder somebody, you could do it in 360.
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:58.020]   That was really tasteless.
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.020]   Bad.
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:00.020]   Bad.
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:01.020]   Okay.
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.020]   But you come on a minute.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.020]   You were thinking that.
[01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:04.020]   I actually wasn't.
[01:23:04.020 --> 01:23:05.020]   Okay.
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.020]   But I was thinking now I am.
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:08.020]   You're right.
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:11.180]   Now you're speaking of that.
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:15.080]   Facebook is hiring another 3,000 people to pull down violent and inappropriate content.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.920]   Do you think it's going to work?
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:19.280]   It's one of those things you feel like people can't solve the problem.
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:21.120]   The Facebook is too far, too big.
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:23.440]   And I feel like what a horrible job.
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:24.440]   Oh, it is.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:27.320]   And we know people who do that.
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:30.320]   And you can only do it for a few months.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.320]   It wears on you.
[01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.320]   So.
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:37.440]   And then you have to confess how terrible it is to ours.
[01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:43.140]   And then somebody that you told the article, someone that you told, you told ours, technical
[01:23:43.140 --> 01:23:46.860]   about it, tells Google and then you get fired.
[01:23:46.860 --> 01:23:47.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:48.860]   Exactly.
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:50.300]   You know the story.
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:51.500]   Happens every day.
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:54.300]   Actually, some people enjoy it.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:59.780]   We know somebody who does this and she says, I just get, you know, you get used to it.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:01.500]   It's just another day at the office.
[01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:04.260]   I like surfing Facebook, she says.
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:05.260]   Wow.
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:09.120]   Well, you know, cops get used to seeing all kinds of crazy stuff.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.760]   And it doesn't, it doesn't wear on them psychically.
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.840]   I don't know.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:17.760]   I feel like some cops it does.
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:18.760]   Okay.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.600]   Let's see.
[01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:21.600]   What else do we have?
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:24.680]   Anything else that's super exciting that we want to get to?
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:28.720]   I was looking at the rundown from six weeks ago.
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:32.760]   So let's, oh, let's, let's start over.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:37.900]   I thought those were kind of old stories.
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:42.620]   Hey, Google might start its own job search engine.
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:43.620]   Yeah.
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:44.620]   Mm hmm.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:46.620]   We've had them testing some stuff that's been showing up.
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:47.820]   What do you think of this thing?
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:56.160]   So Twitter did not get the NFL this year, but they are now launching a, a Twitter live
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:25:02.500]   feed that will include lots of stuff, including some sports.
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:09.100]   Some technology and Nili Patel is going to do a weekly gadget show.
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:10.700]   Bloomberg will be there.
[01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:16.260]   They're, Bloomberg has appeared the best on that Twitter live and live nation, BuzzFeed,
[01:25:16.260 --> 01:25:19.820]   the WNBA.
[01:25:19.820 --> 01:25:22.260]   Did you go to, do you go to Twitter.com to watch TV?
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:24.220]   Is that what people are doing these days?
[01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:25.780]   I, I do not.
[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:31.860]   So it's the only thing I, I would go to Twitter maybe to watch TV with commentary on like,
[01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:36.420]   it's Oscars or maybe, but not really.
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:42.020]   I mean, like Twitter is my second screen when I'm watching television, if I want to do TV
[01:25:42.020 --> 01:25:43.020]   in Twitter.
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:44.020]   Yeah.
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:49.660]   And I want to, when I want to watch TV, I go to TV, but I'm really old.
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:56.020]   You are so old fashioned, but the young people today, I think the young, the young people
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:59.300]   today, maybe aren't against, I can't for some reason play video.
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:02.940]   I can see it like, I didn't get the NFL thing, but then I hate football.
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:03.940]   So who cares?
[01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:07.020]   But no, I love football and I still wouldn't watch it on Twitter.
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:08.020]   It's like, I don't get it.
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:12.820]   Like if I've been out and there was a, one of the debates were going on and I'm hitting
[01:26:12.820 --> 01:26:13.820]   Twitter to see what's going on.
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:14.820]   That's maybe different.
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:15.820]   Yes.
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:16.820]   And I get the live feed.
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:21.460]   So, I mean, I guess there's potential there, you know, that's throwing things against the
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:22.460]   wall.
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:23.460]   Oscars.
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:27.300]   I would have paid money actually to see the met, the met costume.
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:28.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:29.300]   So that's the key.
[01:26:29.300 --> 01:26:32.500]   They need to find content that is not on your TV, maybe.
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:33.500]   Oh, yes.
[01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:38.460]   Cause, cause getting my, you know, obviously I could see things happening, but getting
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:41.540]   the commentary in real life and it needs to be bigger.
[01:26:41.540 --> 01:26:47.180]   I mean, like right now I go to Twitter and I'm seeing live, a live soccer game.
[01:26:47.180 --> 01:26:51.740]   It's the concaffe U 17 knockout.
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:54.500]   Hey, I'm really sorry, but I've got to jump off.
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.500]   Oh, that's right.
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:56.500]   Danny, I'm sorry.
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:57.500]   Sorry, Danny.
[01:26:57.500 --> 01:26:58.500]   I'm trying to make sure I.
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:01.980]   You know, before you go, do you have a pick you want to share with us?
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:03.980]   Um, anything you excited about?
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:08.100]   You know, Google's got this new thing where you can get your recipes read to you through
[01:27:08.100 --> 01:27:09.100]   Google home.
[01:27:09.100 --> 01:27:10.180]   Have you tried it yet?
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:12.980]   I tried it and it wasn't working, but it wasn't showing up for me yet.
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:15.140]   So I'm still keeping an eye on it.
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:21.020]   And how does it cause when you, I mean, you'll do a search, say, send this recipe to Google
[01:27:21.020 --> 01:27:25.020]   home and then Google home is supposed to leave the recipes to you and stop.
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:29.140]   So I don't know, I'm going to check it out, but you know, it might be worth checking out
[01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:30.940]   if you're as soon as I can get out.
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:31.940]   How is it rolling out?
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:35.540]   Is it a slowly drilling out or is it just not here yet?
[01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:36.540]   Yeah.
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:38.380]   I mean, my wife cooks a lot and I told her about it.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:40.180]   She says, I don't want Google telling me how to cook.
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:41.140]   Oh, no, I would love it.
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:42.140]   I would love it.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:43.140]   I know.
[01:27:43.140 --> 01:27:47.980]   No, that would be great if it would say, okay, now, use an electric mixer and combine the
[01:27:47.980 --> 01:27:50.300]   cream cheese, honey, milk and lemon zest.
[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:54.660]   If they manage to get dealiest myth message recipes, I think she'll change your mind
[01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:55.660]   on that.
[01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:57.660]   See, see, imagine if it was dealiest voice.
[01:27:57.660 --> 01:28:00.100]   Anyway, I really, I really say it, Annie.
[01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.100]   Thank you.
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:02.100]   Bye, Danny.
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:03.100]   Come in longer for it.
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:04.100]   You guys have a good run to the show.
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.100]   Bye bye.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:06.100]   Okay.
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:07.100]   Bye bye.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:11.740]   We also heard that the Alexa will soon be able to whisper, leap out swear words and change
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:12.740]   its pitch.
[01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:14.620]   Did you play the whisper?
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:16.380]   No, you got to play the whisper.
[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:17.820]   It's on a here it is.
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:18.820]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.820 --> 01:28:19.820]   Ready?
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:20.820]   Alexa whispering a post.
[01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:23.660]   Amazon is trying to make it select the voice assistance.
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:25.660]   Oh my God, it's so awful.
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:33.660]   The female sounding voice may take an even monotone cadence with ever speaking.
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:37.860]   You wouldn't want it for a long time, but a little bit.
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:43.980]   The password is like every head in the room wouldn't turn around when it hurt.
[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:46.820]   I'd be like, Oh my God, it's sitting over there in the corner speaking.
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:47.820]   What's happening?
[01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:52.980]   We've had, I mean, ever since I've seen synthesized voice, there's been markup that you could
[01:28:52.980 --> 01:28:56.780]   add to synthesize voice to make it sound more natural.
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:59.780]   But it's nice that Amazon's allowing developers to do that.
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:05.460]   Well, and bleeping out swear words is nice as someone who has a child who is morally
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:09.220]   inside swear words.
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:10.980]   They pop up.
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:11.980]   What?
[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:16.340]   Like they pop up in like results sometimes like if you're, Oh, that's okay.
[01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:19.300]   So, but I don't, yeah, but see, I don't think that that's what this is.
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:25.020]   This gives you a markup language for the results coming back from your query, whether, you
[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:26.860]   know, like, okay, I played Jeopardy.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:27.860]   Right.
[01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:31.900]   And, but actually that's not a good example because it doesn't use the Echo voice.
[01:29:31.900 --> 01:29:35.900]   It would be something that uses a, you know, 20 questions that uses the Echo voice.
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:42.300]   And then you could simulate a bleep, but it doesn't after the fact bleep content.
[01:29:42.300 --> 01:29:43.300]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:46.500]   It's not like you'd be listening to Wikipedia entries and it would bleep it.
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.100]   It's the developer that has to put the bleeping in.
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:50.100]   Ah, okay.
[01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:57.100]   So, so it's kind of like, you know, it's like, it's like this, the strike through a markup
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:00.540]   in HTML.
[01:30:00.540 --> 01:30:03.580]   You can use it as it for an effect, I guess.
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:04.580]   Got it.
[01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:05.580]   All right.
[01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:06.580]   That's cool.
[01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:07.580]   But that'd be good for recipes.
[01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:11.460]   I'm going to tell you what to do next.
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:14.300]   Or getting, getting that murder advice when you're.
[01:30:14.300 --> 01:30:19.100]   Feel the hot tub up to the highest level.
[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:20.620]   I think I just told it whispers.
[01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:23.620]   I, well, and she was a little bit, that was like a little bit.
[01:30:23.620 --> 01:30:24.620]   That was a creepy whisper.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:25.620]   That's a drill in your ear.
[01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:26.620]   Yeah.
[01:30:26.620 --> 01:30:27.620]   Yeah, it hurt.
[01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:28.620]   Ow.
[01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:29.620]   I'm not used to that.
[01:30:29.620 --> 01:30:30.620]   All right.
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:31.620]   Now it's just you and me.
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:32.620]   So let's talk about Tesla.
[01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:33.620]   Okay.
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:35.420]   I was like Tesla or IOT.
[01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:36.420]   I could do IOT.
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:37.420]   Well, do IOT.
[01:30:37.420 --> 01:30:38.420]   No, no, no.
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:40.260]   Let's do Tesla first.
[01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:41.260]   What's the Tesla stuff?
[01:30:41.260 --> 01:30:42.500]   I didn't scroll down that far.
[01:30:42.500 --> 01:30:44.500]   Tesla trucks coming.
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:45.500]   Okay.
[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:51.340]   Consumer Reports marked Tesla down because in the hardware 2 platform, many of the things
[01:30:51.340 --> 01:30:54.540]   that you and I have, well, you don't have autopilot, but many of the things people with
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:58.900]   hardware 1 platform, the original hardware platform, who had autopilot were used to things
[01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:01.700]   like the car would stop before it hit something automatically.
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:02.700]   Yes.
[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:06.820]   They took that out in hardware 2 because they didn't have confidence in hardware 2,
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:09.220]   which I would be mad if I bought a Tesla.
[01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:10.660]   I think it started in October.
[01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:12.180]   I'd be kind of angry.
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:15.260]   It didn't do a lot of the things that my older Tesla did.
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:20.540]   Anyway, Consumer Reports lowered its rating saying this is dangerous.
[01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:22.540]   Oh, yes.
[01:31:22.540 --> 01:31:24.380]   So Tesla rolled out an update.
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:25.380]   They fixed it.
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:28.580]   Well, I was going to say auto braking is a feature in a lot of luxury cars.
[01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:33.100]   I remember a friend of my test driving my Tesla and he actually was trying to drive it
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:35.860]   into a wall before I was like, hey, hey, it doesn't have that.
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:36.860]   Wow.
[01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:39.140]   Hey, hey, hold on.
[01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:41.700]   You know, it's not just luxury cars now.
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:46.220]   I've been seeing ads for Subaru's or something that does it as well.
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:47.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:48.220]   Yeah, there is a car.
[01:31:48.220 --> 01:31:49.220]   I don't know.
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:50.220]   I thought it was an Audi.
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:52.220]   Well, my Audi had that.
[01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:54.980]   No, actually, though, I don't think it would stop.
[01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:57.340]   The Tesla's actually stopped, right?
[01:31:57.340 --> 01:31:58.340]   I believe so.
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.340]   They try to stop.
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:02.180]   Yeah, they make the attempt.
[01:32:02.180 --> 01:32:06.420]   I was excited about the boring tunnel stuff.
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.420]   Did you see the boring video?
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:09.420]   I was like, yeah.
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:10.420]   This is science fiction.
[01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:12.340]   It's not going to happen.
[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:15.260]   Is it any more science fiction than the Neuralink stuff?
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:18.100]   No, that's pretty science fiction, E2.
[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:22.380]   So the idea is that because Elon got--
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:24.460]   Elon hates traffic.
[01:32:24.460 --> 01:32:30.660]   He was really pissed off because he drives from the Tesla effect headquarters in LA
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:33.780]   to the SpaceX headquarters and the traffic's bad.
[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:34.780]   What a shock.
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:36.300]   So he imagined the idea.
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:38.660]   What if we had tunnels?
[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:44.580]   So the Tesla pulls up to an elevator, which is a parking space, which, by the way--
[01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:46.580]   OK, let me just pause this for a second.
[01:32:46.580 --> 01:32:48.620]   The car goes down in an elevator.
[01:32:48.620 --> 01:32:51.020]   Is there a big hole in the street now where that car was?
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:54.100]   And is somebody going to drive into it and crush me?
[01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:55.340]   Inquiring minds want to know.
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:56.620]   So it goes down in the elevator.
[01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:58.860]   OK, they quickly close the door on the elevator.
[01:32:58.860 --> 01:33:02.500]   But quickly enough, again, inquiring minds want to know.
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:03.500]   It goes down in the elevator.
[01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.860]   And then the elevator continues onto the tunnel.
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:08.100]   You don't get to drive in the tunnel.
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:13.940]   You get to ride in a little carrier that you whizz through the tunnel
[01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:16.740]   and get where you're going at upwards of-- what was it?
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:19.820]   100-- 200 kilometers, 124 miles an hour.
[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:26.820]   But really, are we going to-- oh, and there's a bus.
[01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:27.260]   See that?
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:29.100]   You could get on a bus too.
[01:33:29.100 --> 01:33:32.580]   But seriously, are we really-- is this really-- there's no way we're drilling
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:35.500]   giant holes underneath LA.
[01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.860]   You can only imagine.
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:40.860]   See how they switch away before you see the hole in the ground?
[01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:44.060]   Yeah, well, and it would have to be another platform like sliding in
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:46.700]   for delivery too, because otherwise--
[01:33:46.700 --> 01:33:47.540]   Right.
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:49.420]   We just got a hole in the ground.
[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:52.540]   Anyway, it doesn't matter, because you know what?
[01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:53.220]   Science fiction.
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:54.900]   Science fiction.
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:56.540]   Oh, we're not there yet.
[01:33:56.540 --> 01:34:00.220]   It's just like Robert Heinlein's conveyor belt sidewalks.
[01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:00.940]   Oh, I remember that.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:03.780]   Remember that the roads must roll?
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:04.780]   Sure.
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:05.380]   Make it happen.
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:07.380]   Make it so happen in an airport.
[01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:11.100]   If you were wondering, as you might have listening to this show,
[01:34:11.100 --> 01:34:15.260]   how we feel about the intelligence of our federal government,
[01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:18.100]   and in particular, the Senate--
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:19.980]   Senate staffers ID cards.
[01:34:19.980 --> 01:34:21.700]   Don't have smart chips.
[01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:24.220]   They have pictures of smart chips.
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:27.780]   Actually, I think that's kind of brilliant.
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:30.540]   I'm like, I mean, it's the equivalent of sticking an ADT lawn
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:32.340]   side in your yard.
[01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:33.900]   Without having any security.
[01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:34.380]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:36.220]   It's like, let's take the money.
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:37.220]   Give a little bit.
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:39.980]   I mean, we are all about security theater.
[01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:44.220]   I see that this just falls right in line with that.
[01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:45.780]   So but that's just me.
[01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:49.220]   I'm just cynical as I'll get out.
[01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:52.340]   I created a picture of the chip on it.
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:55.660]   If you're a Senate employee, it's just a picture.
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:34:58.580]   Not a chip, just a--
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:34:59.740]   Really?
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:00.940]   Come on.
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:03.020]   And then, by the way, it's really not great security
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:05.060]   since everybody now knows.
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:05.900]   Well, yes.
[01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:08.660]   Now they're going to have to pay up to Jamalto or whomever
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:11.100]   to get their chips.
[01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:13.700]   What the what?
[01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:15.020]   Crazy talk.
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:18.780]   Hulu has launched his TV service.
[01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:19.260]   Really?
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:21.100]   Live TV service, $40.
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:24.180]   This is-- YouTube has $35, right?
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:27.140]   Yeah, just Hulu has things--
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:28.460]   Hulu has things other, Hulu--
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:32.140]   it has all the other Hulu stuff, like Fargo.
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:32.980]   No.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:33.780]   What did I pay?
[01:35:33.780 --> 01:35:34.460]   Oh, Handmaid's--
[01:35:34.460 --> 01:35:35.300]   Are those on here?
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:37.740]   Handmaid's tail I had to buy Hulu for.
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.740]   That is very good.
[01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:41.660]   It's a little dark.
[01:35:41.660 --> 01:35:42.500]   Well, yeah, it is.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.020]   It is not--
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:43.780]   It is very good.
[01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:44.300]   I agree.
[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:45.180]   It's not fluffy.
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:47.500]   It's not fluffy.
[01:35:47.500 --> 01:35:49.820]   Here's the deal.
[01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:53.420]   Over the top TV packages, I never heard of Fubo TV.
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:55.900]   Maybe not the best name.
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:58.580]   But there's Sling YouTube Direct TV now, which
[01:35:58.580 --> 01:35:59.660]   is the AT&T product.
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:02.540]   Hulu Live, PlayStation View.
[01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:04.540]   It's a little-- Hulu Live is--
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:05.180]   it's up there.
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:07.460]   It's the same cost as PlayStation View,
[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:09.940]   but you get 60 channels.
[01:36:09.940 --> 01:36:12.700]   And I guess you get live locals.
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.300]   It depends where you are, probably.
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:17.140]   You know, if you look at this as the disaggregation of the TV
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:19.860]   bar, the triple play or the--
[01:36:19.860 --> 01:36:22.020]   I guess it's only the triple play.
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:23.980]   I mean, basically, they're taking that revenue
[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:26.940]   from the cable guys, presumably.
[01:36:26.940 --> 01:36:28.380]   I don't think they're actually yet.
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:31.420]   But when we see that, I'm like, I
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:35.980]   keep wondering, do we have, as consumers, between $150
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:40.220]   and $180 a month allocated to broadband and television
[01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:43.620]   in our brains, we've already split out phone
[01:36:43.620 --> 01:36:46.220]   and pay a lot more for wireless.
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:49.940]   So are we going to split out TV and end up paying more for it?
[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:53.740]   And then broadband is like $120 for people?
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:54.180]   Does that mean--
[01:36:54.180 --> 01:36:55.260]   I think that's where you're at.
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:56.300]   It's a serious question.
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:57.380]   Oh, I hope not.
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:59.780]   So Hulu does not have Viacom, which
[01:36:59.780 --> 01:37:03.700]   means it doesn't have AMC, The Walking Dead.
[01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:06.660]   Hulu's owned by Disney, 21st Century Fox, Comcast,
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:08.100]   and Time Warner.
[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:09.900]   So there's lots of sports.
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:14.300]   ESPN is, of course, a Time Warner, Fox Sports.
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:15.540]   And ESPN was Disney.
[01:37:15.540 --> 01:37:16.340]   I'm sorry, Disney.
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:17.540]   You're right, ABC Disney.
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:18.580]   Disney's in there last two.
[01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:19.620]   Yeah, it's Disney.
[01:37:19.620 --> 01:37:21.980]   You're right, absolutely.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:26.100]   But AMC, Viacom, and other programmers
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:26.900]   are apparently talking about they're
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:30.260]   doing their own sports-free version of Hulu.
[01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:31.460]   Well, there you go.
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:34.980]   And as far as local affiliates, they have some,
[01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:36.300]   but not every market.
[01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:42.180]   They say they will have every market in the coming months.
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:45.780]   Most of those deals will get made in the coming months.
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:46.780]   That's--
[01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:47.780]   I'm not--
[01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:49.460]   I feel like there's so much on.
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:53.260]   And I'm, again, this is just me being old and maybe not
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:54.540]   working in an office with people.
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:56.820]   But I'm OK waiting to see the shows.
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:37:59.580]   I'm excited about, or I just buy it.
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:00.500]   That's the truth, though.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:02.420]   You can, for instance, Fargo.
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:04.740]   If you can't watch it on FX Now, you
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:07.820]   know it will be available for purchase soon.
[01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:10.540]   FX actually often does it in the original run.
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:11.300]   Simultaneously.
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:12.700]   Simultaneously.
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:13.220]   So--
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:17.380]   I mean, I'm watching the Americans right now, season five.
[01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:17.980]   I bought it.
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:21.340]   I kind of am willing to pay for it if it's not too expensive.
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:23.820]   Because it's usually $29 for a season,
[01:38:23.820 --> 01:38:25.460]   because there's no ads.
[01:38:25.460 --> 01:38:30.460]   And you can't binge watch it till the season's over.
[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:32.620]   But it would be nice if you could just binge watch it now
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:34.380]   and get it over with.
[01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:36.180]   Yeah, this season is a little slow, actually.
[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:36.680]   It is.
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:38.460]   You've got to wait a week between shows.
[01:38:38.460 --> 01:38:39.580]   What are we talking?
[01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.460]   Is this 1992?
[01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:42.900]   What are we talking about?
[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:45.340]   Like my daughter tells me, I would
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:46.700]   hate to be one of those families who
[01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:49.020]   has to watch TV shows when they're on.
[01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:51.580]   You know, when I was a kid, we had
[01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:55.820]   to wait till Thanksgiving to see the Wizard of Oz.
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:57.540]   You probably don't even remember that.
[01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:58.100]   I don't.
[01:38:58.100 --> 01:38:59.580]   I'm like, OK?
[01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:00.900]   Yeah, everything's--
[01:39:00.900 --> 01:39:02.220]   Your childhood was rough.
[01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:04.620]   I was getting yellow, hung around the campfire.
[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:07.540]   A danny would have to come on every time and say,
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:10.140]   now it's going to start in black and white.
[01:39:10.140 --> 01:39:14.460]   But it's going to be in color every time.
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:15.900]   Actually, I think they recorded that once.
[01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:18.540]   And they just stuck it at the beginning every time.
[01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:19.100]   All right.
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:21.740]   Your chance to talk about the internet of things.
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:26.180]   What's the latest news in the IoT sphere?
[01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:27.620]   So this actually came out--
[01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:30.380]   I think it was last week, maybe Thursday.
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:34.620]   But Cloudflare, which-- is that a sponsor?
[01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.380]   Is that what that says?
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:37.060]   Yes, we love Cloudflare.
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:38.580]   I'm like, is that what that is?
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:41.900]   So they introduced an IoT security product called Orbit.
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:45.060]   And I was kind of keen on this because I'm sitting here
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:47.660]   thinking about how to secure the internet of things.
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:50.620]   And I've liked Cloudflare forever.
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:51.420]   I just--
[01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:51.780]   Yes.
[01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:52.940]   --to get some really interesting--
[01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:53.460]   Yes.
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:54.260]   --there you go.
[01:39:54.260 --> 01:39:54.620]   Yes.
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:56.500]   I was like, I like them before I even worked for you guys.
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:59.980]   So we talked a little bit yesterday on security now about this.
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:02.780]   And Steve was not completely clear what they were planning to do.
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:04.860]   But it sounds like this Cloudflare product
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:08.100]   is for IoT providers, not end users.
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:08.660]   It is.
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:09.020]   OK.
[01:40:09.020 --> 01:40:10.900]   So I talked to Matthew Prince because I was like,
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:12.060]   what the heck is this?
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:14.260]   Because all the coverage was kind of not--
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:15.980]   it didn't tell me anything.
[01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:19.300]   So they're trying to basically--
[01:40:19.300 --> 01:40:20.140]   OK.
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:23.140]   Cloudflare works by you direct your servers to their servers.
[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:25.100]   And then they absorb everything.
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:26.620]   So the idea is you do the same thing
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:29.460]   if you're in it only works for manufacturers.
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:32.180]   And you build this into your product
[01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:34.900]   where your product goes through Cloudflare's servers.
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:38.140]   So what it prevents is things like Matthew Prince over
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:40.220]   at Cloudflare told me that it would prevent something
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:44.620]   like Mariah because basically once it's
[01:40:44.620 --> 01:40:48.100]   detecting malicious activity, it stops things from--
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:50.940]   it stops it from going to your devices.
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:52.780]   So your devices aren't going to be sending stuff out.
[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.900]   They're not going to be downloading malicious stuff.
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:57.740]   So this isn't an end-all-be-all panacea.
[01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:01.140]   This is just one extra layer of security.
[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:04.740]   It's very limited because right now,
[01:41:04.740 --> 01:41:07.460]   if you want a secure device, you have to do it.
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:09.500]   The manufacturer has to do it.
[01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:10.940]   Not the users.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:14.220]   So like you and I who have our crappy network DVR,
[01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:16.460]   we're SOL.
[01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:18.140]   That's that we can't figure that.
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:19.580]   And that's really always been the problem
[01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:23.460]   is that these Chinese companies don't care
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:24.860]   and they don't secure their stuff.
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:27.260]   And they're the last ones that are going to pay for Cloudflare
[01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:28.100]   to protect them.
[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:30.860]   And we as consumers don't care.
[01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:31.380]   And we don't--
[01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:33.180]   And we don't pay for it.
[01:41:33.180 --> 01:41:35.180]   Well, we don't pay for it.
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:38.180]   I mean, security has become an externality in this business.
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:41.700]   And that just like protecting the environment,
[01:41:41.700 --> 01:41:42.820]   that's going to have to change.
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:44.980]   Or it does then, and we're all screwed.
[01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:48.700]   Either way, these are our choices.
[01:41:48.700 --> 01:41:50.340]   Wow, this show got so grim.
[01:41:50.340 --> 01:41:50.700]   Do we have any--
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:51.340]   No, it's not grim.
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:54.180]   That's happy news that they're doing it is fantastic.
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:55.740]   It's fantastic.
[01:41:55.740 --> 01:41:58.340]   I'm so thrilled that we have this.
[01:41:58.340 --> 01:41:59.900]   And I think what's going to happen--
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:02.060]   I believe what's going to happen with IoT.
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:03.380]   And I think you've seen this.
[01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:05.220]   This happens with a lot of things
[01:42:05.220 --> 01:42:07.700]   is that people will get wise to it
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:12.100]   and they will start not buying the cheap Chinese knockoffs
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:13.180]   and don't work with anything else
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:17.100]   and build up buy stuff from responsible companies like Nest.
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:19.060]   Don't you think?
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:23.180]   I never underestimate the lure of the cheap something
[01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:23.420]   or other--
[01:42:23.420 --> 01:42:25.860]   Here's what's going to happen.
[01:42:25.860 --> 01:42:29.780]   At some point, Amazon or Google, maybe it'll be Microsoft.
[01:42:29.780 --> 01:42:32.140]   Maybe it'll be Apple is going to say,
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:34.140]   you're going to be able to control your home.
[01:42:34.140 --> 01:42:35.620]   You're going to be able to do either voice well.
[01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:36.660]   You can already do it with the Echo.
[01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:40.020]   And by the way, we're only going to support secure devices.
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:45.540]   So if you want to use your Echo or your Google home
[01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:47.220]   with your internet of things devices,
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:51.620]   look for the made for Google Home badge.
[01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:54.740]   And Google will have an app store.
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:57.140]   They will say, we've vetted this.
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:42:58.300]   It's secure.
[01:42:58.300 --> 01:43:01.460]   I almost am certain that will happen in the next year
[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:03.580]   as we get more and more IoT problems.
[01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:06.980]   And we've had massive IoT break-ins and issues.
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:08.780]   And we need the kind of--
[01:43:08.780 --> 01:43:09.900]   we're used to app stores.
[01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:11.420]   We're used to that notion.
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:13.300]   And by the way, what a great revenue opportunity
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:16.860]   for somebody to have a Google Home store with all
[01:43:16.860 --> 01:43:19.180]   of the approved devices in it.
[01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:21.540]   Oh, I would hate to have this business model again.
[01:43:21.540 --> 01:43:24.820]   I hate the bifurcation of the mobile OS ecosystem.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:26.100]   I don't really want to see it.
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:27.100]   But it already is.
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.100]   It's already happened.
[01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:31.860]   And in fact, it was almost invented by home automation
[01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:33.460]   with ZigBee and Z-Wave.
[01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:36.820]   And it's endless.
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:38.340]   It's a tower of Babel.
[01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:40.940]   So this would, in fact, maybe help consumers--
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:41.860]   It would help.
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:42.340]   Yeah.
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:43.740]   You are right.
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:48.060]   Maybe I don't want Amazon dictating this.
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:51.060]   I would much rather have it be truly industry-wide
[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:52.300]   with all of them working together.
[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:57.820]   But I also really like clean air and water.
[01:43:57.820 --> 01:43:59.780]   So let's see.
[01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:03.740]   Any other IoT stuff in the news today?
[01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:05.140]   Nothing that--
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:06.620]   That's a big one, I think.
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:08.300]   And that, to me, is the example--
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:11.980]   in a way, a forerunner of what I think is going to happen.
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:14.460]   And you're going to companies like CloudFlare
[01:44:14.460 --> 01:44:16.980]   get involved in this and help make IoT secure.
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:18.940]   Because otherwise, it's a non-starter.
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:20.460]   People aren't going to use these things.
[01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:23.620]   Because they're going to see what a problem it is.
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:24.780]   Oh, wait.
[01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:26.180]   I didn't see this last week.
[01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:27.780]   And I feel like an idiot.
[01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:30.020]   Serious, acquired automatic.
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:31.260]   You didn't see it last week?
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:34.100]   Because it just happened.
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:35.620]   No, it says it happened April 27.
[01:44:35.620 --> 01:44:36.700]   No, but I don't think they announced it,
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:38.820]   because I saw the story yesterday.
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:39.340]   OK.
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:42.380]   We love another sponsor, Automatic.
[01:44:42.380 --> 01:44:44.780]   They make those really great OBD2 dongles
[01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:47.660]   that you plug into your car and pair to your phone.
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:48.860]   You get all sorts of information.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:50.660]   It's an interesting buy for SiriusXM.
[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:52.820]   They spent over $100 million on it.
[01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:55.180]   Well, I'm not sure why they wanted it.
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:58.180]   You know, Sirius has-- maybe they want
[01:44:58.180 --> 01:45:01.980]   to keep their position in the automobile, right?
[01:45:01.980 --> 01:45:02.500]   Oh.
[01:45:02.500 --> 01:45:03.460]   Because that's important to that.
[01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:05.860]   So they're going to start doing telematics.
[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:06.340]   Yeah.
[01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:08.460]   So this data would be crucial to them.
[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:12.460]   And it gives them, I guess, a dongle in the car.
[01:45:12.460 --> 01:45:13.660]   So yeah.
[01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:16.820]   I mean, it is kind of weird, but it's not crazy weird.
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:19.180]   I think I can understand that strategy.
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:20.780]   Sirius got to find something, right?
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:21.780]   Because they're--
[01:45:21.780 --> 01:45:24.380]   I mean, it's not a great business to be in.
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:24.900]   Right.
[01:45:24.900 --> 01:45:26.020]   So do telematics.
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:27.620]   Do like the on-star stuff.
[01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:30.260]   And this would be a way to get that stuff working.
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:32.980]   And you've got all this data that you can then sell to people.
[01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:37.020]   And that's independent data providers that are credible
[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:39.060]   will be useful going forward.
[01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:40.660]   Because the car companies are like,
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:42.700]   I don't want to give all this to Google.
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:44.420]   They're going to just build their own cars.
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:45.020]   There you go.
[01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:45.900]   There's a happy store.
[01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:47.060]   Here's another one.
[01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:47.540]   OK.
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:50.860]   A drunk man arrested for knocking over the Silicon Valley
[01:45:50.860 --> 01:45:53.820]   crime fighting robot.
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:54.340]   OK.
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:56.860]   A. I didn't know there was a Silicon Valley crime fighting
[01:45:56.860 --> 01:45:57.380]   robot.
[01:45:57.380 --> 01:46:00.380]   So I was like, oh, delightful.
[01:46:00.380 --> 01:46:02.820]   So this K5, this is the robot.
[01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:04.260]   It patrols parking lots.
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:05.580]   OK.
[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:06.540]   It wanders around.
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:07.540]   It's got cameras on it.
[01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:09.100]   It doesn't-- can't really do anything.
[01:46:09.100 --> 01:46:13.100]   Along comes 41-year-old Jason Sylvain, allegedly,
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.580]   slightly intoxicated.
[01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:18.940]   And he kicked it over and scratched it, by the way.
[01:46:18.940 --> 01:46:20.340]   So he's OK.
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:20.900]   And I mean, the bot.
[01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:22.180]   How much is the robot?
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:22.620]   Oh, god.
[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:24.460]   Can you imagine?
[01:46:24.460 --> 01:46:25.700]   But anything--
[01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:29.460]   people are expensive, right?
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:30.740]   Yes.
[01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:31.740]   And the good news is--
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:33.340]   just to really sit behind this desk.
[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:33.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:35.860]   I have so many questions about this robot.
[01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:39.540]   I don't know.
[01:46:39.540 --> 01:46:40.820]   I don't know if I have answers.
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:44.340]   This is the same one that rolled over the toddler's foot.
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:46.860]   You may remember a few months ago.
[01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:49.180]   I know I have not seen this.
[01:46:49.180 --> 01:46:51.700]   I remember being struck in the San Jose airport
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:55.420]   when I was walking through that they had robots all around.
[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:58.300]   And then I passed by the little robot childcare center.
[01:46:58.300 --> 01:46:59.500]   And I was just--
[01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:00.060]   That's creepy.
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:00.940]   --in the happy people there.
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:03.860]   But I was like, what is happening?
[01:47:03.860 --> 01:47:05.620]   I felt like such a disconnect.
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:08.740]   Like Silicon Valley was just in this weird, clean--
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:11.740]   In the airport now, many restaurants
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:15.380]   have little humanoid robots about three or four feet tall
[01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:18.740]   with holding menus that you can talk to and make reservations
[01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:20.140]   with.
[01:47:20.140 --> 01:47:22.380]   In the airport?
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:24.260]   Well, SFO, for one.
[01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:24.780]   Really?
[01:47:24.780 --> 01:47:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:27.940]   What's terminal?
[01:47:27.940 --> 01:47:29.260]   I think it was SFO.
[01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:29.860]   Might have been Oakland.
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:31.780]   It was in the Bay Area.
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:32.660]   And it just stands there.
[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:33.420]   Where was that?
[01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:34.540]   Was that in Oakland?
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:36.140]   It was funny because I saw a kid playing with it.
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:37.660]   And the kids-- OK, so this is interesting.
[01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:39.740]   Kids have no respect for robots.
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:41.940]   Apparently, there was an experiment in Japan
[01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:45.540]   where a robot was let loose to wander in a busy shopping mall
[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:48.100]   and asked people to get out of the way.
[01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:48.860]   Excuse me.
[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:50.660]   Excuse me.
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:53.180]   And the adults were very polite in Japan.
[01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:54.420]   They got out of the way.
[01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:55.300]   But the kids--
[01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:57.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:57.620 --> 01:47:59.620]   --would kick it, punch it--
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:00.620]   --with the boss of me.
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:04.900]   They would say, no, they were hurting the robot, which
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:06.780]   loudly protested.
[01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.260]   Apparently.
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:10.460]   I can't remember.
[01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:12.100]   We have no respect for robots.
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:15.660]   Remember that robot that I think was a Canadian centred down
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.180]   just trying to get you to check the product?
[01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:19.180]   Yeah, it didn't make it across the US.
[01:48:19.180 --> 01:48:20.300]   That wasn't really a robot.
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:21.900]   That was just like a--
[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:22.900]   I was a junkie.
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:27.660]   A mop bucket with a hand and some feet.
[01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:29.500]   It didn't do anything.
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:32.140]   And it had siloed and said, please pick me up and take me
[01:48:32.140 --> 01:48:34.100]   to my next destination.
[01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:36.100]   But yeah, it got beat up.
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:37.460]   Yeah.
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:38.700]   Humans are just jerks.
[01:48:38.700 --> 01:48:39.660]   What can we say?
[01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:41.980]   This was a study that was called Escaping
[01:48:41.980 --> 01:48:43.900]   from Children's Abuse of Social Robots.
[01:48:43.900 --> 01:48:49.700]   They would often get violent hitting and kicking
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:52.900]   and engaged in verbal abuse, calling the robot bad words.
[01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:54.700]   They didn't say what the bad words were.
[01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:58.460]   They did mention one kid called the robot idiot eight times.
[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:02.460]   Spending the neck, hitting it with a plastic bottle,
[01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:03.460]   hitting it with a ball.
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:05.460]   You know, children are angry.
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:08.460]   And really, they can't take it out on adults.
[01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:14.460]   So if they've got an animate object, they're just going to hit it.
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:17.460]   Wow.
[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:18.460]   Yeah.
[01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:19.460]   You know what?
[01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:20.460]   I would hit it.
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:21.460]   Maybe I'm childlike.
[01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:22.460]   That's it in that way.
[01:49:22.460 --> 01:49:25.460]   I can't picture my child hitting a robot.
[01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:28.460]   They're blushing.
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:29.460]   You know what?
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:30.460]   It's in a group.
[01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:31.460]   See this?
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:32.460]   This is classic.
[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:34.460]   It's Lord of the Flies bullying behavior.
[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:36.460]   They don't do it when it's a kid by yourself.
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:37.460]   No problem.
[01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:38.460]   I'll get out of the way.
[01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:39.460]   No problem.
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:40.460]   Yep.
[01:49:40.460 --> 01:49:41.460]   Okay.
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:42.460]   No problem.
[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:43.460]   But then you get eight or nine kids together.
[01:49:43.460 --> 01:49:44.460]   Watch what happens.
[01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:47.460]   They, Lord of the Flies, they gang up on the thing.
[01:49:47.460 --> 01:49:48.460]   Okay.
[01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:50.460]   Now watch bullies.
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:51.460]   There's four of them.
[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:53.460]   Now some other kids are coming over saying,
[01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:55.460]   "Oh, we can beat this up?
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:56.460]   Let's kill it.
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:57.460]   Kill the robot.
[01:49:57.460 --> 01:49:58.460]   Kill Piggy."
[01:49:58.460 --> 01:50:01.460]   Look at this.
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:05.460]   The kids are harassing the robot.
[01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:06.460]   Wow.
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:10.460]   Apparently it happens more often with more kids and if no adults are around.
[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:11.460]   And then here's Violet.
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:13.460]   Look at their banging on its head.
[01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:15.460]   That kid kicked it.
[01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:16.460]   Hey.
[01:50:16.460 --> 01:50:18.460]   Kid kicked it.
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:22.460]   Do you think this is just Japanese kids or do you think this would happen in the US?
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:24.460]   No, I imagine this would happen in the US.
[01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:26.460]   Throw things at the road.
[01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:28.460]   Look at the guys dragging them away.
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:31.460]   Anyway, great study.
[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:32.460]   I never saw that before.
[01:50:32.460 --> 01:50:33.460]   That's awesome.
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:39.460]   The tonic to that is that cute little girl that saw the water heater and thought it was a robot.
[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:40.460]   Yeah.
[01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:41.460]   Yeah.
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:42.460]   Do I have that video?
[01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:44.460]   Yeah, just imagine that.
[01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:45.460]   I don't have that video.
[01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:46.460]   That's okay.
[01:50:46.460 --> 01:50:48.460]   Finally, good news.
[01:50:48.460 --> 01:50:49.460]   MP3 is free.
[01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:51.460]   Free at last.
[01:50:51.460 --> 01:51:00.460]   It was 20 years ago on April 23rd that the Fraunhofer company in Germany invented MP3s and trademarked
[01:51:00.460 --> 01:51:01.460]   it.
[01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:02.460]   They owned it.
[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:03.460]   They licensed it.
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:11.460]   But as of April 23rd, 2017, that license is over.
[01:51:11.460 --> 01:51:17.460]   You can use MP3 anywhere, anytime without Pinify, which is kind of news to all the people who
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:19.460]   have been doing that for the last 20 years.
[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:21.460]   I'm like, wait, what?
[01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:23.460]   I got a pay a fee.
[01:51:23.460 --> 01:51:24.460]   Oh, crap.
[01:51:24.460 --> 01:51:25.460]   Yeah, it's over.
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:26.460]   You don't have to pay a fee anymore.
[01:51:26.460 --> 01:51:27.460]   All right.
[01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:28.460]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:29.460]   Will you do a pick?
[01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:30.460]   Do you have a pick?
[01:51:30.460 --> 01:51:32.460]   I have a pick that's really good.
[01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:33.460]   Good.
[01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:34.460]   I don't.
[01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:36.460]   Well, should I come up with another pick?
[01:51:36.460 --> 01:51:37.460]   No, no.
[01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:38.460]   I got one that's okay.
[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:39.460]   All right.
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:40.460]   Show today.
[01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:41.460]   I tell you, I got something good to get ready because you're going to get hungry.
[01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:44.460]   Our show today brought to you by Blue Apron.
[01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:46.460]   We love the Blue Apron.
[01:51:46.460 --> 01:51:49.420]   Imagine, if you will, you're going home at long.
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:50.420]   Hard day.
[01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:51.420]   You're tired.
[01:51:51.420 --> 01:51:55.700]   You're starving and you would love to have a luscious home cooked meal.
[01:51:55.700 --> 01:51:56.700]   But you know what?
[01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:57.700]   You got a planet.
[01:51:57.700 --> 01:51:58.700]   You got a shop for it.
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:51:59.700]   You got to go home and cook it.
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:02.180]   And you just end up going to McDonald's again.
[01:52:02.180 --> 01:52:05.340]   Now alternate universe, you're starving.
[01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:07.620]   You're ready to have a delicious home cooked meal.
[01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:13.380]   You go home and they're sitting on your porch waiting for you, a lovely box from Blue Apron,
[01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:18.100]   containing all the fresh ingredients to make three different home cooked meals plus a recipe
[01:52:18.100 --> 01:52:22.820]   card and instructions, everything you need, pre-portioned ingredients, never more than
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:23.820]   you need.
[01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:25.260]   So there's no waste.
[01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:26.940]   You could prepare it in 40 minutes or less.
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:33.660]   It's healthful, less than $10 a person for the meal, which means, by the way, it's less
[01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:36.380]   expensive than shopping.
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:40.540]   Grocery stores are 60 to 70 percent more expensive because they have all that overhead.
[01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:45.100]   And you're getting delicious high quality ingredients from 150 local farms, fisheries
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:49.340]   and ranchers across the United States.
[01:52:49.340 --> 01:52:52.340]   Sustainable quality, delicious food.
[01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:56.740]   The number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service, they delivered 99 percent
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:58.540]   of the cotton on the United States.
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:52:59.540]   Sorry Hawaii, Alaska.
[01:52:59.540 --> 01:53:00.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:53:00.540 --> 01:53:01.540]   I'm sorry.
[01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:05.180]   But they want to make sure it's fresh.
[01:53:05.180 --> 01:53:06.180]   There's no weekly commitment.
[01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:11.460]   So you only get deliveries when you want them and you choose the items from the website.
[01:53:11.460 --> 01:53:14.100]   But look at all the stuff on the menu.
[01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:18.740]   Make spinach and egg flatbread with sauteed asparagus and lemon aioli.
[01:53:18.740 --> 01:53:21.940]   Beef teriyaki stir fry with sugar snap peas and lime rice.
[01:53:21.940 --> 01:53:25.860]   Lisa and Michael, our 14 year old, cooked the other night.
[01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:28.900]   And I was fasting that day and it was torture.
[01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:32.180]   The house smelled so good.
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:37.660]   Crispy salmon and roast potato salad with pickled mustard seeds and creme fraiche sauce.
[01:53:37.660 --> 01:53:38.660]   Here's a vegetarian one.
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:40.300]   Three cheese and baby broccoli strumballi.
[01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:41.860]   Oh, I love strumballi.
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:44.540]   Tomato and oregano dipping sauce, but I don't have a make it.
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:46.060]   Now you will.
[01:53:46.060 --> 01:53:49.540]   Plans for couples and families with kid friendly ingredients.
[01:53:49.540 --> 01:53:50.900]   Delicious meals.
[01:53:50.900 --> 01:53:52.700]   They don't repeat more than once a year.
[01:53:52.700 --> 01:53:53.700]   Is that the strumballi?
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:55.700]   Oh, it looks so good.
[01:53:55.700 --> 01:53:56.700]   Look at that.
[01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:57.700]   Three cheese and broccoli strumballi.
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:59.060]   Oh my gosh.
[01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:01.900]   Now you and the thing is once you make it, you know how to make it again.
[01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:03.220]   And you know what to shop for.
[01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:06.420]   And so it really is a little mini cooking school among everything else.
[01:54:06.420 --> 01:54:07.420]   Check out this week's menu.
[01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:09.180]   Get three meals free with your first purchase.
[01:54:09.180 --> 01:54:10.180]   Yes.
[01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:17.420]   Three meals free when you go and free shipping when you go to blueapering.com/twig.
[01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:18.660]   You don't have to do it every night.
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:21.020]   We get three meals a week.
[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:26.900]   And often by the way, we'll keep two and we'll give one to Lisa's parents who are older
[01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:28.500]   and who love it.
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:30.820]   They come over and say any blueapering.
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:32.580]   You have any blueapering for us.
[01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:34.380]   So we'll give, you know, because it's all packaged up.
[01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:37.660]   We'll give them the card and the stuff in a little bag and they go home and they make
[01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:39.540]   it and they love it.
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:40.540]   Blueapering.
[01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:45.300]   I was just going to say we just made again, not from the blueapering, but a favorite
[01:54:45.300 --> 01:54:47.100]   recipe that came from there.
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:48.100]   Yeah.
[01:54:48.100 --> 01:54:51.740]   Well, that's the point is you actually give you the confidence to say, oh, I could do
[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:52.740]   this.
[01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:53.740]   It's really not hard.
[01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:55.620]   And then you do it and you have some new ingredients to play with.
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:56.620]   Creme Fresh.
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:58.300]   You know, stuff you may not seen before.
[01:54:58.300 --> 01:54:59.300]   I love it.
[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:00.300]   Blueapering.com/twig.
[01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:06.300]   And yeah, if you have kids, getting them to cook is really great.
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:08.300]   That's part of education, I think.
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:09.780]   Michael really had fun.
[01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:12.180]   He did not enjoy washing the dishes afterwards, however.
[01:55:12.180 --> 01:55:13.180]   Got to work out.
[01:55:13.180 --> 01:55:16.100]   There are a lot of dishes.
[01:55:16.100 --> 01:55:19.860]   He did not, it wasn't bad, but he just, you know, he does not.
[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:21.940]   I don't know why that's the chore he hates the most.
[01:55:21.940 --> 01:55:23.220]   I don't know why.
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:24.580]   I kind of like washing dishes.
[01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:26.500]   I shouldn't have made this in public.
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:28.100]   No, I like washing dishes too.
[01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.260]   I hate drying them though.
[01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:30.260]   No, right.
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:31.260]   Well, I just put them in the rack.
[01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:32.260]   I don't dry.
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:33.620]   Oh, see, I get yelled at when I do that.
[01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:34.620]   Who yells at you?
[01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:35.620]   Andrew yells at you?
[01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:36.620]   I yells at you.
[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:38.580]   Tell him to get off his high horse.
[01:55:38.580 --> 01:55:40.220]   Air drying is the best.
[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:41.500]   I'm like air drying.
[01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:43.260]   Yeah, that's my thought.
[01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:47.420]   You know, but see, I used to go, oh honey, I'll wash them later.
[01:55:47.420 --> 01:55:48.820]   They have to soak.
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:50.380]   Soak, yes.
[01:55:50.380 --> 01:55:51.620]   My dad does that.
[01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:52.620]   These dishes need to soak.
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:56.100]   My mom's like, yeah, as long as they're not soaking tomorrow morning.
[01:55:56.100 --> 01:55:57.100]   Exactly.
[01:55:57.100 --> 01:55:58.940]   So Lisa got broke me then habit.
[01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:02.180]   She said, I don't care as long as they're not here in the morning.
[01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:05.260]   She broke me then habit because I used to soak them for several days sometimes.
[01:56:05.260 --> 01:56:06.580]   Yeah, that's not cool.
[01:56:06.580 --> 01:56:07.580]   That's not cool.
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:08.580]   Not cool.
[01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:10.980]   Your pick of the week stays here.
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:11.980]   Hey, and both of them.
[01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:15.980]   I've been talking Irish for you now for the rest of the show to make you feel happy.
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:16.980]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:18.940]   I know it's a beautiful accent.
[01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:19.940]   It is.
[01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:23.140]   So my choice is a book this week because I've been traveling.
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:26.100]   So I haven't had a chance to test devices, but it's a really good book.
[01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:27.100]   What is it?
[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:28.100]   It's called The Night Ocean.
[01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:29.100]   It's by Paul LaFarge.
[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:32.100]   I bought the book lab that you talked about the last time lab girl.
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:33.500]   Oh, did you enjoy it?
[01:56:33.500 --> 01:56:34.500]   I didn't.
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:37.420]   My daughter who's studying bio.
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:38.420]   You should read it too.
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:39.420]   It's good.
[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:40.420]   I will.
[01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:41.420]   She's loving it.
[01:56:41.420 --> 01:56:42.420]   Oh, good.
[01:56:42.420 --> 01:56:43.420]   Okay.
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:44.420]   This sounds familiar with Paul LaFarge.
[01:56:44.420 --> 01:56:45.420]   Why do I know his name?
[01:56:45.420 --> 01:56:46.420]   He's written other books.
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:50.500]   Let me tell you what other books he has written because right now I'm not looking at that.
[01:56:50.500 --> 01:56:53.180]   It says it's Lovecraftian.
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:58.660]   So okay, this is something I think anything Lovecraftian is hilarious.
[01:56:58.660 --> 01:57:00.860]   Yeah, I think it's spooky.
[01:57:00.860 --> 01:57:04.620]   Well, okay, if you make a clue through, I can never say the name joke.
[01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:06.940]   I am the first person to pop up and laugh.
[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:09.940]   The Thulew is the guy with the octopus face, right?
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:11.580]   Yes, like the knitted cap.
[01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:13.100]   A friend gave me one of the.
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:15.100]   You have a Thulew cap?
[01:57:15.100 --> 01:57:17.020]   Aw, man.
[01:57:17.020 --> 01:57:21.900]   So I just like that's why I got this book, but it's really good.
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:23.380]   It's a mystery story.
[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:27.220]   It's got a lot of knowledge to like horror and science fiction.
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:30.020]   It's kind of inception-esque.
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:34.060]   It's a good, but like I don't want to give you too many things, but it's a really good
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:35.060]   book.
[01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:36.060]   I don't want to spoil anything.
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:37.060]   And it's unaudible.
[01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:38.060]   So there you go.
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:39.060]   It's unaudible.
[01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:40.740]   Oh man, that's my list.
[01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:44.580]   I'm looking at his books and I have not seen any of these other books.
[01:57:44.580 --> 01:57:47.900]   So but he has written other books.
[01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:52.940]   He wrote more of Enye, more of more more of a John more of a John.
[01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:54.580]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:58:01.020]   The houseman, the artist, the artist of the missing luminous airplanes.
[01:58:01.020 --> 01:58:02.020]   Kind of vintage titles.
[01:58:02.020 --> 01:58:06.060]   And apparently he works with others as well.
[01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:08.900]   Apparently he maybe this is a different.
[01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:09.900]   No, it's the same.
[01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:10.900]   This is some dude.
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:11.900]   Paul of Farge, huh?
[01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:14.180]   He's a very interesting fellow.
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:15.980]   Is he French?
[01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:24.420]   Oh, his luminous airplanes book looks like it's about programmers.
[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:26.940]   Oh, it looks fascinating.
[01:58:26.940 --> 01:58:27.940]   All right.
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:29.860]   Maybe this will be my next recommendation.
[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:30.860]   Nice.
[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:31.860]   I know.
[01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:35.460]   Have you ever wanted Mr. T to give you car directions?
[01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:39.860]   Oh, I pity the fool who tried to get it.
[01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:42.180]   So I can't do right and left.
[01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:45.940]   Yeah, do you do if you do ways?
[01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:49.020]   They've added Mr. T to ways.
[01:58:49.020 --> 01:58:54.940]   So you'll have to go in your ways settings and then under advanced settings, there's
[01:58:54.940 --> 01:58:58.380]   sound and voice and you have to change the voice directions.
[01:58:58.380 --> 01:59:01.140]   Now Jane is the default.
[01:59:01.140 --> 01:59:03.900]   Now the nice thing about Jane is she does street names.
[01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:06.100]   She's the only one who has street names.
[01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:08.100]   But let me turn up my sound.
[01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:09.940]   There's also Amy.
[01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:11.300]   Whoops.
[01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:12.700]   And then there I got to go back in.
[01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:13.700]   Darn it.
[01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:14.700]   It didn't give me a sample.
[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:16.980]   I was hoping they would give me a sample.
[01:59:16.980 --> 01:59:22.580]   But the newest sound and voice is Mr. T.
[01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:23.580]   Mr. T.
[01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:24.900]   Let's see if we can hear Mr. T.
[01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:26.420]   Should I get directions?
[01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:27.620]   Let's go somewhere.
[01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:30.140]   I need directions.
[01:59:30.140 --> 01:59:31.140]   Let's see.
[01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:32.500]   Directions to home.
[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:33.500]   How about that?
[01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:35.780]   You want people to know where you live?
[01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:36.780]   D.
[01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:40.660]   Make a little circle.
[01:59:40.660 --> 01:59:44.660]   That sounds actually like everybody who's ever been in the car with me.
[01:59:44.660 --> 01:59:51.780]   How do I get Mr. T to repeat that?
[01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:53.500]   Go back and do it again.
[01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:54.980]   Oh man.
[01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:55.980]   Let's go home.
[01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:57.700]   Make a little circle.
[01:59:57.700 --> 01:59:58.700]   Indeed.
[01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:01.940]   Make a little circle.
[02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:06.660]   I imagine when I get home it's going to say, you have arrived in your destination.
[02:00:06.660 --> 02:00:10.420]   I pitted the fool who lives here.
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:12.740]   Oh, excellent.
[02:00:12.740 --> 02:00:14.100]   Mr. T on your ways.
[02:00:14.100 --> 02:00:15.100]   That's free.
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:17.100]   There's no charge.
[02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:18.100]   All right.
[02:00:18.100 --> 02:00:21.780]   I told you I didn't have a really good pick.
[02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:25.140]   Actually, I had a bunch of picks and I didn't save them anywhere.
[02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:26.140]   Do you do this?
[02:00:26.140 --> 02:00:28.300]   I did this all week long ago.
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:29.300]   I got to pick that.
[02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:30.620]   I didn't save them and I have no idea.
[02:00:30.620 --> 02:00:32.980]   I don't remember a thing.
[02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:34.060]   It's the story of my life.
[02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:36.220]   The challenge for me is doing devices.
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:40.500]   It means I have this pile of gadgets and I'm like, oh, I've got it.
[02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:44.220]   Wearing the show, actually, one of my picks, I guess it'll be next week, arrived.
[02:00:44.220 --> 02:00:46.540]   I heard my dog barking and I saw it on my doorbell.
[02:00:46.540 --> 02:00:48.460]   I'm going to get it.
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:54.260]   Well, do you, do your daughter or her classmates, are they into fidget spinners?
[02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:56.180]   Oh, yes.
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:57.180]   I have seen it.
[02:00:57.180 --> 02:00:58.180]   There's a delay.
[02:00:58.180 --> 02:00:59.180]   Is that what it is?
[02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:00.380]   In the fidget spinner?
[02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:01.380]   The Kickstarter one?
[02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:02.540]   No, well, there's a lot.
[02:01:02.540 --> 02:01:06.460]   Yes, the cube is now delayed, but you can go on Amazon and buy them.
[02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:10.780]   I decided that we talked about this last week.
[02:01:10.780 --> 02:01:11.780]   We did?
[02:01:11.780 --> 02:01:12.780]   Did we know?
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:21.020]   I decided to buy many different fidget spinners to see, did one come?
[02:01:21.020 --> 02:01:24.420]   Oh, this is the one Burke got me.
[02:01:24.420 --> 02:01:28.020]   It's just a cheap 711 fidget spinner.
[02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:32.900]   The idea is kids, apparently, your daughter's age are like going crazy about these in schools
[02:01:32.900 --> 02:01:35.380]   and stuff.
[02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:37.700]   But then now see there's a variety of them.
[02:01:37.700 --> 02:01:41.620]   Didn't you tell me about the one with the moon and the Mars gravity?
[02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:42.620]   No.
[02:01:42.620 --> 02:01:43.620]   Who was that?
[02:01:43.620 --> 02:01:44.620]   That sounds cool.
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:47.740]   It was actually a skefa.
[02:01:47.740 --> 02:01:48.740]   Maybe it was.
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:49.740]   Maybe it was on Twitch.
[02:01:49.740 --> 02:01:53.420]   I've gone out and ordered a number of these to do with some comparisons.
[02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:56.020]   For instance, this one has ceramic bearings.
[02:01:56.020 --> 02:01:58.820]   So it spins very nicely?
[02:01:58.820 --> 02:01:59.820]   Yes.
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:03.180]   They actually rate these via spin times.
[02:02:03.180 --> 02:02:05.780]   Maybe for next week we'll do fidget spinners.
[02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:06.780]   Huh.
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:13.420]   There's a website because you can spend hundreds of dollars on fidget spinners.
[02:02:13.420 --> 02:02:14.500]   Wow.
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:17.380]   This has not made it to my daughter's school.
[02:02:17.380 --> 02:02:19.500]   She's super tactile and touchy.
[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:20.500]   She might like it.
[02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:25.340]   Well, you can get this one with like a few bucks, but you can spend a lot more.
[02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:28.100]   We got our little clicker thingy.
[02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:30.300]   You tap it in its square.
[02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:31.300]   Yeah.
[02:02:31.300 --> 02:02:34.580]   I'm like, my kid is like a cricket.
[02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:35.580]   But I will.
[02:02:35.580 --> 02:02:40.140]   So if it's truly anxiety and autism, this is actually what took the cake for us and really
[02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:42.660]   works.
[02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:45.540]   Bring your hands like this and go start with one finger.
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:46.820]   Here I'll do it this way.
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:49.780]   I am so loved.
[02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:55.580]   Oh, or you do like I can handle this.
[02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:56.580]   Really?
[02:02:56.580 --> 02:02:57.580]   Yeah.
[02:02:57.580 --> 02:02:59.340]   And you take a few moments.
[02:02:59.340 --> 02:03:03.900]   You take deep breaths and you're like, I can handle this.
[02:03:03.900 --> 02:03:04.900]   Are you autistic?
[02:03:04.900 --> 02:03:07.860]   No, but you know, sometimes I get very anxious.
[02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:08.860]   Do you get anxious?
[02:03:08.860 --> 02:03:09.860]   Oh, of course.
[02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:10.860]   Yeah.
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:11.860]   I can't tell.
[02:03:11.860 --> 02:03:13.260]   I can't tell this.
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:16.100]   I think twigs over.
[02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:19.300]   I'm glad you came today.
[02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:20.980]   Please come back next.
[02:03:20.980 --> 02:03:23.580]   I ran out of words.
[02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:27.260]   But don't you feel calmer, even though you don't know?
[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:28.260]   I do.
[02:03:28.260 --> 02:03:29.260]   I'm much calmer.
[02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:30.260]   All right.
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:31.260]   Well, thank you.
[02:03:31.260 --> 02:03:33.020]   Thank you for that.
[02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:34.980]   Thank you for that.
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:38.140]   Stacy, you can buy them.
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:40.580]   It's Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:03:40.580 --> 02:03:45.820]   She also does the IOT podcast at IOTpodcast.com with a great Kevin Tofel.
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:46.980]   And she's an expert on IOT.
[02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:47.980]   But you know what?
[02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:49.500]   The truth is she's expert on a lot of things.
[02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:50.860]   She's one of the best journalists out there.
[02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:53.340]   And we're really glad we could get her each and every week.
[02:03:53.340 --> 02:03:54.540]   Jeff Jarvis had the week off.
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:55.700]   He'll be back next week.
[02:03:55.700 --> 02:03:56.940]   He's traveling, right?
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:57.940]   He's somewhere.
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:03:58.940]   I can never remember where.
[02:03:58.940 --> 02:03:59.940]   He's only somewhere.
[02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:01.780]   He's like Waldo.
[02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:02.780]   Where's Jeff?
[02:04:02.780 --> 02:04:04.460]   So say Carmen San Diego.
[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:05.460]   Yeah.
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:06.460]   Oh, yeah.
[02:04:06.460 --> 02:04:09.500]   Where in the world is Carmen, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:13.180]   Also thanks to Danny Sullivan of Search Engine Land Search Engine Land.com for joining us today.
