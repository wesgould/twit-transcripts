[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.680]   This week in Google to show the covers, Google,
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.800]   and I must underscore the cloud computing in general.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.320]   We don't spend a lot of time talking about that,
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.360]   because Google is swamping the news these days.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.360]   They're just doing so much.
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.600]   Jeff Jarvis is here from his office
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.480]   at the City University of New York in New York.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.120]   Hey, Jeff.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.040]   Hey there.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.560]   Good to see you.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.680]   Buzzmachine.com and the author of the book,
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.720]   What Would Google Do?
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.920]   And also of a review in the Huffington Post
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.040]   that we will talk about just a bit.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.360]   Also with us Gina Trapani from her office
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.000]   in San Diego, California.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.960]   Hi, Gina.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.800]   Hey, how are you?
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.760]   Gina blogs at smartareware.org.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.560]   And also is doing a really nice new series at Fast Company.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.320]   In fact, we have to let Gina go in about an hour
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.400]   so she can go out and do more on her work smart series,
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.800]   fastcompany.com/worksmart.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   And who?
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.400]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.880]   So Gina, you're going to be a little left out
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.720]   of this conversation.
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.560]   I haven't seen the social network yet.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.520]   Everyone's seen it.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.400]   No, everyone is not.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.800]   It doesn't even open until Friday.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.440]   But--
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.160]   It feels like all my peers have seen it.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.800]   Well, I went to a screening that Mashable did in the city,
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.840]   because I felt like I had to see it as soon as possible,
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.440]   because I know everybody's going to be talking about it.
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.280]   And I take it, Jeff, you saw a screening somewhere.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.880]   I used what little cloud I have and went to Sony
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.040]   and said, get me in, please, and they did.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.560]   Why did you feel like you had to see it so early?
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.000]   To talk about it on Twig.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.680]   Thank you, Jeff.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.840]   Me too.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.840]   That's my story.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.320]   And I'm sticking-- no, I was just curious.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.040]   I have to say, I read the book by Ben Mazrich,
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.960]   accidental billionaires.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.080]   We interviewed Ben and Dana Brunetti,
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.360]   who's one of the producers of the movie
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.480]   for "Tigger Street" about a year ago when they started the movie.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.000]   I had read the Aaron Sorkin script that was circulating
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.520]   on the internet.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.960]   It turns out to have actually been the actual script
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.520]   very close to the shooting script.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.560]   So I think I knew too much.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.200]   Jeff, what did you think of the movie?
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.840]   You wrote about it and having it post.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.640]   I think it's the revenge on the revenge of the nerds.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.080]   I was disappointed in it a lot, because what I said in my review
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.320]   is that there was no why there.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.480]   It didn't care about what Facebook is.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.640]   It wanted to look at nitty gritty of one relationship
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.720]   and gave no motive for why Mark Zuckerberg does what he does,
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.240]   which I think matters.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.600]   So if he's so determined and dogged about doing what he does,
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.240]   well, why?
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.920]   Well, all they present really is that he either
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.080]   wants to get laid or wants to get into the exclusive club
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.920]   he couldn't get into.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.880]   And that's as deep as they go, which I think is very, very shallow.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.800]   And Sorkin has been quoted saying that he doesn't even
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.360]   use Facebook, doesn't care about it.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.720]   He doesn't care about the facts.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.840]   He wants to tell a story.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.600]   Well, fine.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.800]   Then recorded at Schmarvard, not Harvard,
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.560]   use somebody else.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.360]   And so I think that it was very, very shallow.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.080]   And I think what it was, in essence,
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.080]   was an attack on geeks and an attack on the explorers.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.800]   And an attack on the people who are changing their world.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   And it's more what I see every day and constantly
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.520]   of people who are being disrupted, who don't like it,
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.000]   who want to lash back.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.120]   So what they want to do is demonize Google or Gates
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.000]   or now Zuckerberg.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.120]   And that's what they, in essence, tried to do, I thought.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.240]   The other characters were often cartoonish.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.360]   The Wekelby, as Zuckerberg calls them,
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.120]   are properly cartoonish, as is Larry Summers, the--
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.560]   Oh, man, is he a cartoon?
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.360]   Yeah, I think that's Sorkin's populism
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.400]   getting away with him wanting to make fun of rich people
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.720]   and intellectuals.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.120]   And Eduardo Saverin is the victim in this.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.680]   But in terms of harsh business terms,
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.400]   I think that maybe he just didn't fit a CEO.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.400]   I've met him once.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.200]   And nice guy.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.800]   But he was trying to put tacky network ads on Facebook.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.560]   And Zuckerberg was trying to do something bigger.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.600]   Sean Parker is presented as a drug out party boy.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.800]   And you'd think that Aaron Sorkin, giving his history,
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.320]   would be a little more empathetic to him.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.320]   And in the end, I think that what disturbed me
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.280]   was that it was trying to just attack us.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.240]   It was trying to take those of us who see value in the internet
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.720]   and try to dismiss that value and dismiss one of its architects.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.240]   And I think it was, in that sense, lazy.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.200]   It didn't try to dig into what Zuckerberg truly is
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.480]   or why he does what he does because it didn't understand
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.120]   what he has done.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.760]   The book was based on basically one person's story, Eduardo's story.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.040]   And Ben Mesrick, who's written other books like this,
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.400]   fictionalizes conversations, fictionalizes action.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.800]   What is left out of the movie is-- and something
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.720]   that, by the way, Mark Zuckerberg was very-- and his publicists
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.680]   were very quick to point out when Mark was on Oprah--
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.360]   is that Mark has a girlfriend, has
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.560]   had the same girlfriend since that time.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.680]   So motive number one to get laid is bogus.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.120]   And in fact, the movie ends.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.480]   I don't think I'm spoiling anything with a very poignant scene
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.480]   about the missed opportunity with a girl that's not only--
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.400]   not only is fictional, it has to be fictional,
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.320]   because it's Mark had a girlfriend.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.000]   So a lot of what the movie says is the premise for Mark doing this
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.240]   is his jilting by this girl and is just full--
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.000]   it's funny.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.320]   It's made up in the discussion on Huffington Post,
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.840]   where I cross-posted the review.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.960]   Most people are saying to me, hey, it's not a documentary.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.440]   Well, not even true.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.000]   That's the problem.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.560]   It's not even true.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.320]   It uses real names.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.360]   The citizen came, changed the name,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.240]   and went with that license there.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.040]   Yes, there's license taken.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.000]   But as you say, it's not even true.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.960]   And it goes so far in, I think, attacking him.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.720]   A few people said that they thought that he came off well,
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.160]   because they were kind of, yo, yeah, the geek wins.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.520]   But I don't think that's Sorkin's attitude at all.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.200]   I did not, in fact--
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.720]   you call it the anti-social movie.
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.960]   I did not, in fact, take it personally, as you seem to have.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.760]   I just thought, to be honest, and David Envy in The New Yorker
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.640]   said not only is this film brilliant,
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.200]   he said it's Aaron Sorkin's best script.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   I thought it was a crappy movie.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.720]   Now, I was kind of puzzled, because everybody's
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.120]   been raving about this movie, including The New Yorker.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.520]   And so what I thought is, oh, well, maybe I know too much.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.720]   Yeah, we know it too much.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.520]   We're too close.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.120]   Maybe somebody coming in here, like my wife, who
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.880]   knows nothing except that there's such a thing as Facebook.
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:21.640]   It's not even on.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.160]   Maybe she'll love the movie.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.840]   But I think there's missing stuff.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.040]   There's some structural things that I have a problem with.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.520]   For instance, it intercuts between depositions and the action.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.680]   Depositions and action.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.280]   And you never get a chance to watch the story build.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.760]   You never get involved in the story,
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.240]   because you keep getting pulled back to a deposition.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.120]   I have to say, I did not think it was as negative about Mark
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.400]   Zuckerberg as everybody's thought.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.440]   Mark is painted as a cipher.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.920]   You don't really know what's going on in his head.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:54.520]   Jesse Eisenberg does a great job of kind of lip twitching.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.040]   Like something's going on.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.160]   There's something in there, but we don't know what.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.280]   Part of that, don't you think that he was--
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.680]   it was a rather--
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.760]   an effort to make him look rather aspergry?
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.160]   I think that if there was anything that you get--
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.880]   negative about Mark in here is that he is antisocial,
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.400]   is that he has knows-- he doesn't understand the rules.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.560]   He can't understand, for instance, why a woman wouldn't
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.480]   like the notion of being compared to a farm animal.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.680]   It's just like--
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.480]   but it was a joke.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.800]   And so as a result, I think it's not negative.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.920]   It just comes off that he's just clueless.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.400]   But again, I think you're right, though.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.640]   It's what it doesn't say about him.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.400]   It doesn't get.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.760]   And I hardly know Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.760]   I've been with him four or five times.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.960]   But in just that alone, he's not that bad.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.800]   No, he has charm.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.560]   He tells jokes.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.160]   He laughs.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.440]   He smiles.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.000]   He acts human.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.360]   And that's the thing about his portrayal here
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.200]   by Sorkin and Nizemberg and the director
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.160]   is that he becomes rather unhuman, kind of a machine man.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.040]   So you think this is an indictment of all geeks
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.560]   that we're all a little bit like that?
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.840]   Yes, I think it's these damned geeks
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.040]   who are taking over the world and they're screwing it up.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.520]   And all they're enabling is for people
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:19.280]   to do trite stuff and get drunk and get laid
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.720]   and look how they're ruining the world.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.400]   And they're fundamentally heartless.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.000]   Yes.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.960]   They have no soul.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:25.880]   They have no soul.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.360]   No soul.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.240]   They don't know how to interact.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.040]   And they're just exploiting us because they think
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.800]   that relationships are something to exploit.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.600]   It seems to be in this movie that Sorkinberg is surrounded
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.240]   by this swirling world of people who
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.160]   don't understand what he's up to, don't understand
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.040]   what he's doing.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.240]   And in many cases, end up getting taken advantage of.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.400]   But almost not by omission, not co-mission.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.600]   It doesn't really seem like Mark's doing anything.
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.440]   It's just happening.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.680]   Like when Eduardo gets fired, it's
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.920]   Sean Parker, who really is the heavy in that scene.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.280]   And then Sean Parker, almost at the same time,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.880]   gets busted for a coke and gets forced out.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.400]   In the story, though, it didn't happen that way.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.400]   That was at the party for the site.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.920]   It was actually somewhere else that had happened.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.400]   It was a party for their millions using--
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:13.880]   In the movie.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.280]   There's also the problem, which is always
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.160]   a problem with computer movies, is that there's
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.680]   nothing inherently dramatic about typing.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.040]   And they do the best they can when he's actually creating
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.440]   Facebook for the first time.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.880]   They interpose it with the blog postings, which is how that
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.160]   happened in the book as well.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.800]   And that would add some drama.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.560]   But there's this moment, which I think
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.600]   is supposed to be a pivotal scene in the movie
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   when they go live.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.800]   Yes.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.440]   And it's like--
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.440]   And that's like, oh, we took the password off.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.640]   Because you press the button.
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.400]   You hit the command and now it's live.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.640]   And so I'm of the opinion that this movie,
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:54.480]   if it were about schmobook.com or Harvard Connection,
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.720]   it would be terrible because it only
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.320]   succeeds because of what you bring to it
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.480]   that you know about the Facebook.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.240]   So the only thrill is, that's the Facebook that just went live.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.880]   Without that, it's like, hmm, boy, that was dramatic.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.380]   Right.
[00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.440]   The funny thing about all the deposition scenes
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.760]   is that only lawyering could make coding look interesting.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.840]   They're horrible.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.960]   I have to say, I do not think this is a good movie.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.120]   The more I think about it, the less I press I am.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.080]   And the only excuse I can think of for why people like David
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.640]   Envy, who I really respect, liked it
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.280]   is because they're seeing it as a work of fiction.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.800]   They don't really know the truth.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.000]   It sounds like I am going to hate this.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.880]   Well, I want you to see it.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.120]   And I really want to hear what you think.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.800]   I hope you won't be in full-time.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.680]   Yeah, no, I do want to see it.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.920]   I mean, what stinks for Mark is that this is the thing.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.280]   This is the story that people are just
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.240]   going to assume is mostly true.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.740]   Right.
[00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.600]   Because he's making this huge PR effort with $100 million
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.280]   to Newark, appearing on Oprah, that puff piece,
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.600]   edited video, which starts with him kissing his real girlfriend.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.640]   And you know, Caris Swisher on "Twit"
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.560]   said something interesting.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.080]   She said, we tried to get Mark to come with us to the premiere.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.520]   She said, it would have been such an opportunity for him
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.400]   to say, well, it's an interesting movie,
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.800]   but it has nothing to do with what really happened.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.720]   And to show himself not to be that person.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.600]   And I guess he just really doesn't want to see it,
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.280]   no matter what.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:17.760]   But--
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.320]   On Oprah, he said, like, hey, it's a movie.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.160]   It's fun.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.320]   I mean, I know that my life--
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.480]   Life isn't that dramatic.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.960]   But it's a good story.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.160]   I mean, he did kind of say that.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.720]   And he made the point to say that he didn't make that announcement
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.520]   on Oprah because the movie was opening.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.560]   Oprah actually said that Mark wanted
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.320]   to make that Newark school's contribution anonymously
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.840]   and that she had to egg him on to do it publicly.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.000]   And I have to tell you, I kind of buy that.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.400]   He's a shy nerd.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.840]   I can kind of buy that he wanted to make that contribution.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.480]   Well, then you're the only one, Gina.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Because I know--
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   It's very possible that he--
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   It's very possible, but nobody in the world believes that
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.760]   or thinks that.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.360]   And that isn't going to stick.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.000]   It's three days before the movie comes out.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Come on.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.600]   And we now know that when I visited Zuckerberg
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.800]   to interview him for the next book,
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.280]   and I said on the show that there was this countdown clock
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:16.520]   and it said 45 days, that was to this Friday.
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.840]   Oh, it's to the movie.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.200]   So they were very aware--
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.200]   They're conscious of it.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.800]   It's getting-- that was the cunt and they didn't tell you it was the--
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.000]   Oh, no, just they're going to release it.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.480]   Maybe they're going to release things for Friday.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.480]   That's fine.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.880]   But it was after I was on the show and I said,
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.000]   I don't know what it is.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.040]   God bless as always.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.800]   Someone in the show will follow up and they
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.720]   count it up on the calendar.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.480]   They said, you know, Dorky, it's--
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.480]   Wow.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.480]   --for one.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:39.760]   Wow.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.160]   That's very interesting.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.680]   Now, maybe they do have a--
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.040]   If they are doing a counter PR initiative, October 1
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.840]   would be a very good day to make a big announcement
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.720]   that maybe could get some headlines.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.920]   Especially if it's a positive thing.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.760]   Yes.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.560]   What could they announce?
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.080]   A phone?
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.080]   I don't know.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:58.920]   What could they announce?
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.880]   They're not buying tech crunch.
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.400]   At this?
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.080]   Yeah, right.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:04.840]   We got a lot to talk.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.800]   There's a lot of news to talk about.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.280]   I did want to lead with this because it is opening on Friday.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.400]   I got one question for you, Leo.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:16.560]   The victims besides-- you know, Eduardo Savar and his co-founder
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.240]   was-- and the view of the movie "Screw Down Us"
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.400]   and "Equity is Job" and his status as co-founder and fine.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.720]   I think that there's some point to that.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.000]   The other ones, of course, are the Winkle Byes,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.120]   the Winkle Boss twins, as Zuckerberg calls them.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.040]   And as you know, everyone knows the story
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.680]   that this was their idea, supposedly, and he took it and ran.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.320]   That's what strikes me as just most
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.720]   species about the movie, because the idea--
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.080]   and it's Genesis is fairly obvious.
[00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:44.480]   There's other things.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.880]   The world is about execution.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.560]   It's not about ideas.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:52.120]   And I think this is kind of an old copyright mentality
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.960]   versus an entrepreneurial mentality.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.600]   And that's part of what the movie also doesn't understand.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.400]   So the Winkle By didn't-- to my mind, get screwed.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.400]   And they got a $65 million settlement report,
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.720]   and Leo, they're now trying to go back for more.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.240]   And in a different world, they would be the villains.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.000]   And they should be the villains.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.560]   There is a moment in the movie where Mark does--
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.200]   there's quite an impassioned speech in one of these depositions.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.880]   It's actually the best speech in the movie,
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:27.000]   where Mark says, you know, these guys--
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.280]   oh, I wish I could remember it.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.440]   But it essentially says, I'm the smartest guy in the room.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.400]   If you think these guys could come up with the Facebook--
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.320]   and he does point to-- he says, "Frenster."
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.320]   There was another--
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.080]   Social networking already existed.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:40.560]   I worked--
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.400]   Yeah, it existed.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.600]   Yeah, I mean, way before 2004.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.680]   I had this argument this week.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.200]   It was like, no, these guys don't--
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   Social networking existed.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.000]   He executed.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.840]   He got the users.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.560]   There are plenty of other sites that do the same thing--
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.040]   profiles, friends.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.480]   And I think it's in the trailer, a piece of that speech,
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.480]   where he says, if they could have invented the Facebook,
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.680]   why didn't they?
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.120]   And that's-- I mean, that's absolutely true.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.320]   So in some sense, maybe there is some defense of Mark
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.840]   against the Winkle By.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:14.680]   They don't come off that good, I got to say.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.360]   Nobody else-- nobody in this movie comes off very well.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.920]   That's the other thing.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.240]   There is no hero.
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.120]   It's all dark.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.920]   It's this whole world of the geek and the entrepreneur
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:30.520]   and the rich is presented as a dark, depressing, inhuman,
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.080]   unpleasant, nasty world.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.280]   And I've always thought Aaron Sarkin was pretty good
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.640]   with his female characters.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.880]   Women in this movie are not treated well.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.880]   Oh, I'm going to hate this movie.
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.480]   But you can definitely hate this movie.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.120]   And the Ivy League, I would like to point out.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.320]   And the Ivy League.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.320]   Oh, the Ivy League is even worse.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.120]   We don't sue.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.320]   We're men of Harvard, says the Minkle Voss at one point.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.040]   And then Larry Summers-- oh, he had some--
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.560]   just despicable lines.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.680]   He comes off as the most pompous buffoon.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.960]   Oh, comedic.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.960]   At one point, he says to his assistant who's sitting in the room,
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.880]   Louise, punch me in the face.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.640]   I'm about to fall asleep.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.880]   Well, but she's practically thirsting hell the third in this movie.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.220]   Oh, yes.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:16.720]   Oh, yes.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.220]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.200]   And that's the most made up scene in a sense of all,
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.560]   except for the girlfriend stuff.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.640]   They had no way in that.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.440]   But, Gina, I'd be curious whether you
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:28.320]   think that the way the women come off badly
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.960]   is because Sorkin has not treated well
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.920]   or because that's part of his indictment of the geeks.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.480]   That they mistreat women.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:34.980]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.560]   The women in this-- there's only-- there's
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.240]   one sympathetic lawyer.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:43.240]   Every other woman in this is a bimbo, a slut, somebody
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:49.880]   who's out to meet a rich Harvard fellow, a groupie.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.400]   It's actually-- I think it's actually a pretty
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.600]   reprehensible movie.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.080]   You're getting madder as we go.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.200]   I am now that I think about it.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.080]   It just lost a star.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:02.160]   Another star off.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.200]   And I love Erin Sorkin.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.640]   I love David Fincher, although Fincher's not exactly kind
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.400]   to women either.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.320]   But I think he's a great filmmaker.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.200]   I think something went badly wrong with this.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.360]   And it may be it is polemic.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.240]   Maybe you're right, Jeff.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.320]   This is anti-geek polemic.
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:18.560]   I don't think-- looking at the comments on "Huppost,"
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.720]   I don't think that's the way--
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.840]   and then, granted, that's people who are online.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.920]   They should be closer to this people.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.400]   I think that this is the way it's going to go.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.800]   I think that there is a hostility to not just Facebook,
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.520]   but also to the change these people have brought us.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.000]   Well, I'm hostile to Facebook.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.720]   So I guess the natural-- but I'm not hostile to geeks.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.080]   I don't know.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.960]   I don't know.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.400]   It's very true to the book, by the way.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.400]   I mean, if you're going to bring the book to life, I guess--
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.840]   It's just not true to life, but that's OK.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.320]   Right.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.360]   Yeah, Ben does not write.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.320]   He writes fictionalized history.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.080]   What's the box office prediction?
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.600]   I think that despite all the great reviews,
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.480]   this is going to tank.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.080]   Because I think fundamentally, most people, even if they're
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.160]   on-- well, the first two weekends will be strong.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.840]   I think it'll die very quickly after.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.680]   Because I think word of mouth will be bad.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.440]   I think people will go because they're on Facebook
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.800]   because there's a half a billion users.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.880]   And the promotion for this has been phenomenal.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.800]   But I think ultimately, it's not a good movie.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.840]   And I think people aren't--
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.200]   And that's terrible.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.160]   Scratching their heads.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.160]   Go ahead, Jada.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.720]   I was going to say, I mean, I think
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.080]   there's so many Facebook users.
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.360]   And then there's some media coverage about Facebook's privacy
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.040]   settings and all the ways that Facebook is potentially
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:27.540]   evil.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:28.800]   So I think there are people who are just like,
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.160]   I want to know more about this.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:30.880]   What really happened?
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:31.880]   How did this happen?
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.680]   And then they're going to believe that the story is mostly.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.160]   It's happening even though.
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.840]   Well, and that's why I think it may have more appeal
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.040]   than it does to me because I know the story.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.280]   If you didn't know the story, it might be very dramatic.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.760]   Oh, they flipped this-- how's it?
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.800]   Oh, you think anybody will use it?
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.560]   Will they make any money?
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:56.160]   They're at Brown University now?
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.640]   Oh, they're spreading.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.640]   You know, just a little bit of self-promotion.
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:08.600]   I launched the Think Up beta this week, the first beta.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.080]   So it's kind of like some level of stability, good installer,
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:11.680]   all this stuff.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.080]   And so I was talking to my mom.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.320]   And she was like, how's it going?
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.560]   And I was like, well, I launched this new product.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.000]   And she was kind of like, what does that mean?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.280]   And I said, well, I write a blog post that says this thing
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.760]   is now available.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.440]   And she's like, and I was like, right.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.320]   And then he just kind of wait and see what happens.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.400]   And I've got this really cool chart that shows you
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.880]   that people looked at it.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.280]   Well, they actually did miss a bet
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.400]   where they could have shown the numbers going up.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   They could have.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.800]   They missed some obvious opportunities.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.840]   But these guys don't know what they're not keeks.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.240]   I mean, Sorkin doesn't use Facebook.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.400]   The lead-- I don't know what his name is.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.800]   The lead guy who plays Zuck says that he doesn't use Facebook.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.600]   I feel like there's a lot of people who just don't use the product
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:57.760]   and don't have a good sense of it.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.520]   Maybe that's a good thing, but I think in a lot of ways
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   it's something like that.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.360]   I can say intellectually dishonest of them.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.360]   I mean, you're going to try to present some vision of this world
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.320]   and its creator.
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.960]   And you purposely choose not to understand what he's done.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.680]   That shows the greatest disrespect of all
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.040]   for the creation of geeks and entrepreneurs
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.600]   and all of Silicon Valley.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.800]   And that's what Mark Harris in New York Magazine,
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.480]   in this profile of Sorkin on this,
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:26.960]   said that this was a well-aimed spitball
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.760]   at New Media by Old Media.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:30.760]   Oh, boy.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.760]   And that's interesting.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.160]   I think he's right to an extent.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.440]   I think there's something to that.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.680]   But I said it wasn't just from New Media.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.760]   It was from Neo-New Media.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.320]   I think we see the creation of what I
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:46.000]   called a young Cormogen's Club, which is now Sorkin, Nick Carr.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.880]   I think that Chris Anderson from Wired now
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.520]   deserves membership for Killeen the Web.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.360]   I love this.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.520]   Gladwell.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.880]   Rug, Gladwell.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.520]   Do you want to talk about his New Yorker article?
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.320]   Yep.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.600]   Rowan, the editor of Wired UK, who talked about proudly
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:04.920]   why he never uses Facebook in his position is just absurd.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.160]   You have getting more of.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.200]   I mean, the list goes on and on and on of these people who
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.720]   I think aren't so much.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.640]   Old media, I think, resist the change brought on.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.360]   The young Cormogen's Club doesn't want to give the internet
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.040]   credit for the change.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.840]   My daughter says that there's a hipster anti-internet movement
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:27.480]   going on, that people, even her age, these hipsters,
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.720]   it's cool to be, oh, I don't do that.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:33.160]   Did Miley Cyrus kind of start that there for a while?
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.320]   She did, didn't she?
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.200]   I don't know if I'd call her a hipster.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.160]   Yeah, I wouldn't call her a hipster either.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.880]   But I definitely-- right, there's this kind of group
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.640]   of young people who say, oh, I'm not
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.760]   going to waste my time like that.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.480]   I'm going to go out.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.480]   Go out.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:46.600]   And it's really true.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.840]   I mean, a lot of times the movies
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:49.640]   made to make money, that's what they're saying in the chat room.
[00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:50.920]   Aaron, Sorkin, and David Fincher
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.000]   are almost always write movies that are political,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.800]   that make a strong political point.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:55.200]   Yes.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.000]   And so I think that it's completely fair for you
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.920]   to ascribe a motive to them.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.720]   That is anti-Facebook and anti-geek.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   I think that's completely fair.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:05.920]   It's very interesting.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.200]   As I said, it's the revenge on the revenge of the nerds.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.520]   Wow.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.320]   We're going to take--
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:11.760]   I want to go on a bet.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.720]   By Friday, we're going to have people, our listeners,
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.760]   who are going to be coming in and screaming at least.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.280]   I mean, I'll say--
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.120]   I didn't put it in writing.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.280]   I'm going to wait.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.480]   But I think I should write a review of it.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:29.880]   Because I hate to write a review before the movie comes out,
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.640]   because I don't want to poison people's point of view.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.680]   I'd like to hear what you think.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.880]   Yeah, I was the same way except that--
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:36.480]   You're a real journalist.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.200]   I was open in the New York Film Festival on Friday.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.480]   So the reviews were at all the major press,
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.080]   and I hit the left that far behind.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.440]   And I wanted to get it up before this show.
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.240]   So that's why I did it.
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.080]   No, no, it's appropriate for you to do it.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.840]   You come from an actual reviewer background.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.160]   I'm just some schlub.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.320]   Somebody at the top of the info said, oh, well,
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.920]   this from a TV critic.
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.680]   What do you know about film?
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.720]   Sorkin' was there.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.320]   I love air.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.440]   I mean, I got to say, I love Fight Club.
[00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.320]   I love West Wing.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.840]   I was prepared to love this movie.
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:10.840]   Studio 60?
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.360]   Studio 60 was my favorite show of all time.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:13.920]   Really?
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:14.920]   Wow.
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.720]   But I'm in TV, remember?
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.320]   See, that was a love letter.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.920]   There's a really interesting-- that was a love letter to TV.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.320]   To media.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:21.820]   To media.
[00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.040]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:23.720]   Old media.
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.240]   Old media.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.360]   That's why I liked it.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.000]   It was a total love letter to old media.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.400]   I looked up Sorkin' at the time.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.440]   Bloggers went after the show like Crazy,
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.120]   and I looked up and Sorkin' at the time
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.200]   smashed bloggers in the Chicago Tribune
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:40.120]   and said that all voices oughtn't to be equal.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:40.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:44.520]   In Studio 60, there's a very big moment
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:48.400]   where one of the actors is very influenced by a blogger.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:48.880]   That's right.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:52.240]   And the script-- oh, that's some jerk in a pajamas effect.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.920]   It's a big plot point in one of the episodes.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:54.680]   Come to see it.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.640]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.240]   OK.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.040]   His true colors coming out.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:25:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:04.840]   So this is-- he's got the archive here
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.680]   of the disdain for this technology created world.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.120]   Very interesting.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.880]   You're watching this week in Google.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.160]   Jeff Jarvis is here from Buzzmachine.com, which I think
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.400]   is down a little bit right now.
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.320]   I think it's up again now.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:17.840]   I was just panicking over that.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.520]   I was going to ask--
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.000]   It's probably our part we probably sent.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:21.640]   Oh, it's up.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.840]   A few people there to read your review.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.320]   Gina Trapani is also here.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.320]   Her site never goes down.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.320]   Smarterwear.org, not for lack of interest,
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.320]   because it's a struggle.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.680]   But actually, I think we brought it down once, didn't we?
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.680]   You did really well.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.680]   We did.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.560]   We're good at that.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.760]   The Twin Army is powerful.
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.000]   It is.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.440]   But I don't want the Twin Army to say,
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.680]   oh, we're not going to go see that movie,
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.080]   because we want to know what you think of that.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.320]   Oh, no, we definitely want to hear what you think.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.560]   Absolutely.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.680]   I don't want to scare people away from this.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.480]   Hey, it's time to talk a little bit about our friends
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.200]   at Citrix and the great product that I use to help friends
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:52.800]   and family.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.440]   It's called GoToAssist.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.560]   And I have the wrong one up here.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.720]   So let me put the right one up here.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.200]   If you go to gotoassist.com, right there, slash twig.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.080]   You could try this free for 30 days.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.360]   In fact, this would be a good time if you've collected
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:13.480]   support tickets from grandma, aunt Jean, uncle Fred,
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.120]   brother Phil, and you've got a lot of support to do.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.280]   GoToAssist.com, get the 30-day trial.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.880]   Just go support them all.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.120]   No question, nothing.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.000]   GoToAssist is based on the great remote access
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.680]   capabilities that Citrix is so famous for with GoToMeeting
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.960]   and GoToMyPC.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.120]   But it's designed for the support professional.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.320]   The truth is somebody who needs to fix people's computers
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.440]   without walking down the hall or traveling across the country
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.600]   to do so and certainly doesn't want to spend time on the phone
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.720]   with phone support.
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:44.160]   If you have people calling you up and you want to fix some
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.000]   systems, if you're an IT or if you're a software support,
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.680]   this is such a great solution.
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.600]   First of all, Mac or PC, so it's completely cross-platforming,
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.560]   can support a Mac from a PC and vice versa.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.760]   It allows you to drag and drop files from your computer
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:01.520]   to their supported computer so you can bring patches or fixes
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.200]   or malware bites over.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.480]   It allows you to see what's going on in that system,
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.400]   what operating system, what background software, what
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.120]   security software is running.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:12.720]   It even allows you to do unattended support up to eight
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.160]   sessions at once.
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.840]   So you can start and install, start a scan,
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.640]   start a fix, and move on.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.760]   Makes you much more efficient, makes you a support hero.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.360]   Recently named the Worldwide Market Leader in Remote Support
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.320]   by Frost and Sullivan, which is an analyst group that
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.600]   specializes in this category.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.680]   It's the number one remote support solution worldwide,
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.640]   easy to use, affordable, secure, and yours free for the next 30
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:41.560]   days, go to go to assist.com/twig and try it today.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:45.800]   Thank you so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:51.120]   All right, enough movie reviews.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.880]   I don't want to bore our lovely audience.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:55.080]   They haven't seen the movie yet.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:59.240]   But I do think it's germane because of this anti-geek bias,
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.560]   which I really frankly did not pick up on initially.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.280]   Maybe I'm just more sensitively ill.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:08.200]   No, I think you're absolutely right now that I think about it.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.560]   There was something bug me about it.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.480]   I knew I didn't like the movie.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.360]   And now I realize it's because it was
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.000]   a trashing my people.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.200]   Don't trash my people, man.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.880]   So the federal government-- we talked about this on security
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.400]   now today.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.920]   I'd like to get your opinions on this one.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.160]   The federal government is back.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:31.760]   The FBI once again wants internet encryption providers.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.960]   People like Skype.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.160]   People like Google.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.280]   People who provide encryption solutions
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.240]   to have a government available backdoor so that should they
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.360]   get a subpoena, they can tell the government what
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.680]   really happened.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.240]   The Obama administration asked for this law.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.000]   They say they will pursue it next year.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.880]   And already, the EFF and many groups
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.640]   who are promoting freedom on the net
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.720]   are up in arms over this one.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.160]   Any thought?
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.080]   That's a terrible idea.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.800]   It's a thank you very much.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.960]   We've seen it before.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.640]   And the courts have ruled against it.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.360]   They say it violates First Amendment rights
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.560]   and it violates our ability to pursue privacy.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:12.060]   Yeah.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.640]   It's like we're going to encrypt this thing,
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.120]   but we have this backdoor for someone
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.720]   who has the right to see it, just the government, just in case.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.560]   Just in case.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.400]   Don't worry.
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.480]   You could trust us.
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.720]   Yeah, you could trust us.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:24.400]   That's just a little backdoor.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.360]   Don't worry about it.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:25.800]   We're good.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.680]   I understand the FBI's frustration
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.000]   because they used to be able to tap any phone.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.200]   And now, if you're a bad guy, Gary Kasparov,
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.520]   who was former chess champion of the world,
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.680]   told Amber this in an interview.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.960]   He said when he's dealing with the Russian--
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.600]   because he was kind of a dissident.
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.440]   He ran for president in Russia.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.260]   And he said, I use Skype because I
[00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.140]   know that my calls cannot be monitored
[00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:47.940]   by the Russian government.
[00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.020]   You know, I think what happened is the US government
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.940]   looked at Dubai saying, hey, BlackBerry,
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:52.700]   you got to unencrypted.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.260]   And BlackBerry said, OK.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:54.820]   Looked at India.
[00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.580]   I said, BlackBerry, yeah.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.620]   We can't read these messages.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.660]   You've got to give us the keys.
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:59.180]   And BlackBerry said, OK.
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:01.940]   And they said, hey, we want that too.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.180]   We don't want just want it from rim.
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.260]   We want it from everybody.
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:10.980]   I'll get in trouble for this.
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:13.140]   But I'm conflicted here.
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.220]   I agree with you.
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.900]   And let me say, Nick, let's go to the bottom line.
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:16.900]   I think it's a bad idea.
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:18.060]   I think it's the wrong thing.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:23.500]   But I also go back to my post-9/11 victim war
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.180]   blogging days.
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:29.660]   And I want government enabled, indeed,
[00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.860]   to catch and stop terrorists.
[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:34.500]   So I believe in that.
[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.420]   But then I find this scary and abhorrent.
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.960]   And so my problem is I don't know where the line properly is.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.540]   I can't draw that line.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.260]   I'll give you some ammunition, Jeff.
[00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.540]   All of this encryption already exists and cannot be pulled back.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.840]   So if a bad guy wishes to use encryption that's
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.780]   strong that the government hasn't
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.660]   ever backed or too, they can.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.820]   If you are writing products outside the US,
[00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:05.460]   you make them strong.
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:09.140]   So the bad guys aren't thwarted by this.
[00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:13.480]   What really happens is you and me don't have secure conversations
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.120]   anymore.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.480]   If you're a terrorist, either you're not using encryption at all,
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.560]   or if you're sophisticated enough to be using encryption,
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.080]   you just take the extra trouble to use PGP or something
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.080]   that's going to work that the government can't break.
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.080]   Period.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.120]   And there'll be ways around.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:28.880]   I think you're right.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.240]   So it's already there anyway.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.440]   So a force has left the barn.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.840]   Have mainstream services used by mainstream people.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.760]   You open up, thank you.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.520]   Oh, I needed that.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.520]   I know you need some ammunition.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.680]   I just thought I'd give you two.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.760]   The other part of my thickness piece of legislation
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.720]   is the notion of a blacklist, too, which scares me even more,
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.880]   that for government to be able to shut down--
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.160]   Can't blame that.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.640]   This is actually--
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.160]   I love it.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.280]   This is a second one.
[00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:58.080]   This is an anti-piracy thing where the DNS
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:01.200]   would be modified.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:06.640]   Blacklist sites that are violating copyright.
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.960]   And this one is really reprehensible.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.320]   That's truly disgusting.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.280]   It would put us--
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:14.800]   Make us a second class citizen instantly
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.600]   in the internet world.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.760]   It would again be ineffective.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.720]   It's basically censorship.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.200]   It's website blacklist or essentially censorship.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:29.400]   And somebody pointed out, if this law had been
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:32.160]   in effect at the turn of the century,
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.440]   piano rolls would not have been invented.
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.760]   VCR would not have been invented.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.880]   So many technologies that have changed the world
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:42.400]   for the good wouldn't be here because current copyright
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.760]   holders would use tools like this to prevent them
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.360]   from succeeding.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:50.960]   It's the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act,
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.200]   which is actually not a good acronym.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.000]   Kawika.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.240]   It would allow the Attorney General and the Department
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.640]   of Justice to break the internet, according to the EFF,
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.120]   one domain at a time by requiring internet service providers
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.920]   domain registrars, DNS providers, and others
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.960]   to block internet users from reaching certain websites.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.720]   Chillingly, the law also allows the Justice Department
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.640]   to create a blacklist of sites, quote,
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.000]   "dedicated to infringing activities
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.080]   that ISPs and others would be encouraged to block."
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:26.480]   So somebody comes along and says, you know this twig show?
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:30.320]   They keep putting clips from the daily show in.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.040]   We really would like to encourage you
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.120]   to keep your users from seeing it.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.560]   And it's done.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:40.080]   You can't get to us.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:44.440]   We'd have to hand out the IP address on street corners.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.520]   Enter this number.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.040]   We're still here.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.320]   You just can't find us.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.280]   All right.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.120]   Just thought I'd bring up those two exciting things.
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:56.920]   Let's see.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.000]   Did any of you get the Google China warning?
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.960]   We talked about this on Twitter this week.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.520]   I think it was Veronica Belmont who buzzed.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.360]   I didn't.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.680]   This red warning from Google to Gmail users--
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.560]   not everybody-- warning, we believe your account was recently
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.920]   accessed from China.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.560]   The idea being, I guess, to let you
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.360]   know that Chinese hackers had been trying to get into your account
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.560]   or getting into your account?
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.680]   The way that's one of the--
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.400]   Not so good, but also, I mean, you have a cousin there.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:27.760]   Right.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.000]   In fact, yeah.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:29.520]   Right.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.320]   This is a Gmail feature where it lets you know if two people--
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.680]   so you know at the bottom of your Gmail,
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.680]   it tells you if you're logged in someplace else
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.120]   and what the IP address is.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.000]   They check to see where that other location is.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.880]   And if you're logged in from two very different locations
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:43.880]   or from very far away--
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.380]   Right.
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.040]   --there's a great feature.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:48.360]   --it alerts you, which is a fantastic feature.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.480]   So that's what it seems like this red message is about.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.600]   I mean, this is a specific to Chinese hackers, right?
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.640]   This is just the Gmail feature in action.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.360]   But why did this get triggered?
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.360]   Well, that's what's weird.
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.640]   It is that feature, but it's particularly highlighting China.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.840]   So several people have had this from China recently.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:09.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.840]   And only China.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.480]   And in a big red banner, not a thing at the bottom of the page,
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:17.160]   and I guess you would get a alert, don't you,
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.200]   if somebody's been doing that.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:18.640]   I think I got the--
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.240]   So I don't know if this is related to that,
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.920]   or this is something special that Google's doing just
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.960]   because they don't like China.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.120]   I don't know.
[00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:29.520]   So Veronica got this?
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.080]   What did she do?
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.680]   Did she instantly change her?
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.480]   I don't think she got it.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.720]   I think somebody emailed her saying I got it.
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:35.200]   Oh, I see.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.040]   And a number of people have tweeted it.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.760]   That's wacky.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.600]   I would change all of my passwords.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.200]   It's instantaneous.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:43.700]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.120]   And that's what Google's advice is.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.400]   I think that's actually not a bad thing,
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.960]   but I don't know if they should just focus on China.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:50.800]   Pick some--
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:54.400]   although most hacking does seem to come from China.
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.480]   When I look at my logs and there are people
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.520]   trying to break SSH, it's almost always
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.840]   brute force attacks from Chinese IP addresses.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.480]   Whether that's a hacker finds it easy
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.400]   to compromise a Chinese machine to use it as a route,
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.800]   and maybe the guy's sitting next door, I don't know.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.560]   Oh.
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.960]   I mean, right?
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.120]   Right.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.040]   It's true.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.080]   You don't trust the IP address.
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.520]   That's meaningless.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.800]   Unless it's some guy to Chinese university
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.120]   who couldn't care less if you know what's in.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.120]   Right.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:29.280]   All right, AOL buys not one, not two, but three new properties.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:33.480]   They buy five men, which is a video property that
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.200]   has five minute clips.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.960]   They say hundreds of thousands of them.
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.720]   They buy Brisley.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.600]   Actually, they buy the parent company, Brisley.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.200]   Which is-- isn't it ex-Googlers?
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.320]   I think it is.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.240]   Yeah, it's Jason Shelland's Ving Labs.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.120]   Jason Shelland worked on Blogger.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.120]   Blogger, right?
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.400]   Good guy.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.240]   Yeah, very good guy.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.240]   Jason's great.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.080]   Well, good for him because frankly, with a new Twitter,
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.800]   I think it was a bad time to sell, isn't it?
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.840]   Because I remember Jason was going
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.680]   to go to some other company and then something kind of win a
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.520]   ri, and then he started this.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.560]   And God bless him.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.360]   It worked.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.000]   He also worked on Reader, right?
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.360]   It says--
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:11.720]   Oh, yes.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.240]   Yes, he did.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.320]   Reader.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.440]   Google Reader.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.240]   I think it was at Supernova.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.400]   Jeff, you and I were at this.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.560]   I think that one of the kind of head guys at AOL
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:22.040]   was on stage and said, you know, I
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.520]   notice most of you are using TweetDeck.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.240]   Yeah, I could tell that he was looking to see what people
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.520]   were using and definitely interested in sort of a tweet
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.240]   stream or a post social media kind of client.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.480]   So the Brisbane acquisition doesn't surprise me.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:38.760]   Bruce Lee is kind of interesting because it is web-based.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.960]   It's a client, but it's not a standalone client.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.680]   It's just a web page.
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.880]   And I have to say with the new--
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:46.000]   I mean, I added four square.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:46.920]   It has Facebook.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.600]   It has other things besides just your single Twitter account.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.240]   So I guess it has some utility beyond what the new Twitter
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:52.960]   page does.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.040]   But to me, it looked like the new Twitter page kind
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.880]   of made Brisley a little less attractive.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:57.960]   I use Brisley.
[00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.720]   And I stopped because I like the new Twitter page.
[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.400]   Well, the irony to me is it also goes back to the ICQ
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.240]   roots that--
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.760]   I like saying about AOL.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.880]   And it's not Tim Armstrong's fault.
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.480]   He's trying to fix this now.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.920]   But AOL asked what business they were in
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:12.880]   and came up with the wrong answer.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.200]   They said, we're in showbiz.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.320]   We're in Georgia Time Warner.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.360]   And the truth is that they were Facebook and Twitter
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.760]   while Mark Zuckerberg was still learning to eat.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.320]   They had all the tools necessary to enable this kind
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.160]   of communication.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.240]   And they understood chat.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:29.200]   They understood people coming together to communicate.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.720]   They understood content creation.
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.960]   And they ignored all of that and thought they were in the
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.360]   dial-up business.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:38.040]   They blew it, for sure.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.400]   According to Read, Write web, the team--
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.400]   Brisley will not survive, or isn't--
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.600]   particularly the reason they bought it.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.320]   They wanted the team, the engineers, the brains to work
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.440]   on AOL's social stream product, LifeStream.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.880]   Have you used LifeStream?
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.880]   No.
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:56.400]   No.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.760]   Apparently nobody else says.
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.080]   Yeah, I do remember that AOL person mentioning
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.120]   LifeStream, and everyone was kind of like, what?
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.120]   Huh?
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.600]   Huh?
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:08.920]   So iPhone, Android, Mac, and PC, all your social network
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.000]   updates in one place.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.120]   It's been around for over a year.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.480]   About 5 million people use it, which is nothing.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.480]   But I might use it now.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.680]   I'm going to tell you, it looks like it combines all these
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.200]   things.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.720]   I'm going to look at it.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.640]   How many of these are there now?
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.880]   I'm sorry, Gina, what you said?
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.280]   No, I was saying, how many of these--
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.840]   I said this Tweet deck and Cismix.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:31.080]   I mean, the all-in-one kind of social media client seems to
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:31.760]   be--
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.360]   Who tweets they got an enterprise focus.
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.360]   We're going to start using it for multiple tweeters on one
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.320]   account, which is actually--
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.920]   that's a good business.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.440]   Well, I think it's good at that, too.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:47.120]   Yes, there are a couple of these.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:47.600]   Yep.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   But the big acquisition is TechCrunch.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.000]   When Giga Olm published this story, I thought, oh, this is
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.400]   just wishful thinking from Omolik.
[00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.840]   I thought that can't possibly--
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.640]   And it happened.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:05.240]   Mike Harrington invited an AOL executive on stage at
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.520]   Disrupt and said, so--
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:10.880]   In fact, do you think he signed the papers?
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.320]   Yes.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:13.600]   Didn't he give the audience the opportunity
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.240]   to do it?
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.920]   But to boo the deal?
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:21.360]   I think it was a $40 million deal that Mike was not going
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.600]   to scotch no matter what the audience had to say.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.200]   That's the rumor anywhere from $25 million to $40 million
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.240]   for TechCrunch.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.760]   And I presume it all going--
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:32.400]   mostly going to the pocket of Mike Harrington.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.000]   You got to wonder, though, there was a great joy of Tech
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.120]   geek culture cartoon, which an executive at AOL is going
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.560]   to be in my house soon before I can get rid of this guy.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.120]   He's driving me crazy.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:52.960]   Mike said, this will affect our coverage of AOL.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.680]   We won't be able to write any positive AOL stories anymore.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.800]   It's a nice spin on it.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.400]   Well, I mean, AOL inquired--
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.800]   WebLogs Inc and Engadget.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:03.800]   That's right.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.120]   They're running good.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.880]   And Engadget is still really good.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.800]   You barely know.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.400]   It's an AOL property.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.600]   Jason sold out way too soon, huh?
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.160]   Jason.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.720]   Jason is not happy.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.280]   We're talking about Jason Calicanis,
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:22.120]   who's been tweeting basically death threats ever since this
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:22.960]   happened.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.640]   I've never seen anybody quite--
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.640]   Because they split up their event business,
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.640]   I think so that Harrington could sell this cleanly.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.800]   And so he tweeted to Harrington, you want my bank transfer
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   numbers.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.640]   Sorry, Jason.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:39.360]   It's business.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.160]   Hey, Mr. Saveran, it's business.
[00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.920]   Boy, that is one reason to see this movie.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:49.160]   The way they get a Eduardo Saveran out of Facebook,
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:50.560]   it kind of rang true for me.
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.320]   I could see that happening.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:53.600]   That part.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.880]   Yeah, I mean, I guess Mike and Calicanis
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:01.440]   used to do TechCrunch 50, TC50.
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.040]   They had a kind of public blow up.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.520]   In fact, I talked to Jason shortly after that.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.880]   He said, Mike just disappeared.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.040]   I had to finish the--
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:11.480]   Mike just disappeared.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.960]   And he's been calling Mike--
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.440]   That's what I think, though.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:17.640]   Leo, it's so redundant to use those two names and say blow up.
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:18.120]   Of course.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:18.640]   I know.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.120]   I mean, these two were just like--
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.400]   I thought they had a blow up there.
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.720]   He even made me the nicest person on the internet blow up.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.200]   I did.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.200]   He found Leo's shoes.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:29.880]   He lit my shoes.
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.240]   In fact, both of them have kind of pissed me off.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.320]   And I decided I'm not working with people
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.480]   who make me angry anymore.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.240]   It's just bad for my blood pressure.
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.960]   And the two of them are peas and a pot in that respect.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.120]   They both can get you going.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:43.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:45.200]   And I have-- here's the funny thing.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.800]   I have a lot of respect for both of them.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:48.600]   They're smart.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.920]   I'm very glad for Arrington.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.280]   I think that he--
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.280]   I was talking to my students this week.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.120]   Raffid Ali was coming into my class.
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.200]   And I said he was the journalist who
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.160]   became the accidental entrepreneur.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.960]   And Arrington was the entrepreneur
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.280]   who became the accidental journalist.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.960]   And he went through his rough periods
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.800]   and was very Arrington.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.040]   But by God, he built an amazing thing.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.320]   Everybody reads it.
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.880]   Everybody reads it.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.040]   You have to read it.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.040]   You bet.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.120]   And his event that I went to was really good.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.400]   And yeah, he can be difficult.
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.000]   But that's probably why he is where he is.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.240]   And he did good for you, Mike.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.200]   Big stars always have big egos.
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.840]   I mean, it's just the way it is sometimes.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:25.960]   And I'm sure--
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.040]   But Sorkin makes the movie about TechCrunch.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.880]   No, now, see, that's a movie and go see.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.360]   Yes.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.040]   But, you know, I don't know Perez Hilton.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:37.320]   But I can imagine he might have a little bit of an emotional,
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.960]   you know, temperature.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.800]   I think the Perez movie would be great.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:41.960]   That I'd see.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:43.640]   Anyway--
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.760]   Perez is the character, though.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.240]   I mean--
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:49.480]   Does this change how TechCrunch covers the news?
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.680]   I don't think it has to.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.440]   I mean, I think-- you know, in gadget, like I said,
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.000]   it's still good.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.080]   I think that-- I don't know.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:56.200]   I think Arrington will go so far out his way
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.320]   to prove that it won't.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.280]   Yeah, maybe as long as Mike's there,
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.760]   he's going to be throwing spitbods at AOL.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.760]   I think so.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:05.360]   And I give him that.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.560]   I give him credit for that.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.720]   He has to, though, at this point.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.000]   He can't not.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.480]   We have another big story, a couple of big stories
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.200]   that we're going to get to.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.640]   Amazon's kind of going--
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.400]   going for Android and the marketplace.
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.800]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.000]   We are talking about Google and the Cloud.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.560]   And then this week in Google with Gina and Jeff and me
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.640]   and Carbonite.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.320]   Carbonite is my favorite backup solution.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.920]   Everybody ought to know about Carbonite.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.680]   It is online backup done right.
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.600]   And why do you need online off-site backup?
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:41.880]   Well, it's absolutely critical to any backup solution.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.680]   Is the ability to back up away from where the originals are.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.160]   So that if the worst happens-- fire, flood, tornado,
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:51.320]   earthquake, or just bad guys breaking in--
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.880]   that your data is somewhere else safe off-site.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.240]   You've got to have it.
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:57.720]   I think any good backup also should be automatic.
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:00.760]   Because who remembers-- oh, I got a backup on Sunday.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:02.480]   No, you should happen all the time.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.640]   So that's what happens.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.880]   Carbonite runs on a PC or Mac, runs in the background.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.040]   It's, by the way, very transparent
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.280]   for the new Carbonite 4 on Windows.
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:12.360]   It's so lightweight.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.480]   You don't know it's there.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:16.080]   But whenever you're online and not doing anything,
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.080]   it's going here some more data, here some more data,
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:22.480]   uses your broadband connection to upload using 128-bit SSL
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.720]   so you can even do it at an open access spot
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.360]   to the Carbonite servers where it is, of course,
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.480]   multiple backups there as well.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.240]   You can also encrypt it, AES-256,
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.400]   which the government has no backdoor to, by the way.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:37.560]   And you, in fact, are the only person with the key.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.880]   That's also possible.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.200]   So you can have absolute privacy of your data.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.280]   But whenever you need it back, whether it's
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.600]   for fire, flood, or human error--
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:48.640]   oops, I trashed that file-- you just go online.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.920]   And this is the neatest thing about the Carbonite.
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:56.160]   You can go online on any computer, and there's your data.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.200]   So you don't have to install Carbonite on that machine.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:59.240]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.000]   That data is there.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.600]   It's always available on any computer.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.800]   Even they even have a free iPhone app and a BlackBerry app.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:05.640]   Same thing.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:07.800]   You always get your data check it to make sure it's there.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.720]   This is what you should have for backup.
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:11.160]   I want you to try it free for two weeks.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.600]   You don't even need a credit card.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:17.000]   Just go to carbonite.com and enter the offer code Twig--
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.840]   T-W-I-G. Please use Twig.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.120]   I know people a lot of times forget and they use Twit.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.320]   Because we're all Twit.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.200]   No.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.640]   Please use Twig.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.960]   Because otherwise, Carbonite's going to say,
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:31.440]   well, nobody listens to that Twig show.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.240]   Carbonite.com offer code Twig--
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:34.840]   two weeks free.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.520]   And by the way, if you do like it,
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.200]   and you say, I think I'm going to buy this,
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:42.480]   use Twig when you check out, and you'll get two months free.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.200]   It's less than $55 a year for every bit of data,
[00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.920]   all that personal stuff on your internal drive.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.960]   That's a good deal.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:50.920]   Carbonite.com, it's backup done.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.040]   Right.
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:56.360]   Amazon says, we are going to launch our own app store
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.640]   from Android.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:01.120]   It's a story from TechCrunch this week.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.200]   Pretty interesting.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.680]   It's like they're going to launch the Apple--
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.960]   the curated version of the Android market.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.520]   It's something we've been asking for, isn't it?
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:13.960]   Yeah, I think it's a great thing for Android, isn't it?
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.160]   I guess.
[00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:16.160]   Yeah, I mean, I think so.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.920]   There are some extra restrictions on developers,
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.520]   but developers have a choice of where they want to list their app.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.520]   So hey, if it does well, I guess my question
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:31.520]   is, why is a consumer going to use the Amazon market
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.520]   over the Android market?
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.400]   I mean, I guess if they're on Amazon already or--
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.280]   Well, I'll use it if I feel like it's vetted.
[00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:41.240]   We all complain about the fact that there's 1,800 wallpaper
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:41.720]   apps.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:44.320]   You do a search on the Android marketplace.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.840]   It's hard to find what you're looking for,
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.200]   because there's so much crap.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:50.800]   And a lot of the developers use popular names.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.560]   Like if you search for Angry Birds,
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.480]   you'll find 20 things that aren't Angry Birds.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.360]   Yes, yeah.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.040]   And the other thing that Amazon-- the problem
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.880]   that Amazon can solve is the payment problem.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:01.840]   There are certain-- the Android marketplace
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.280]   doesn't take certain credit cards.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.320]   It doesn't take Amics.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.520]   If you're buying an international app,
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.720]   there's restrictions.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:10.640]   So I wonder if Amazon will be able to let you buy apps, maybe,
[00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.880]   that are more difficult to buy.
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.520]   I tried to buy something recently.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:14.840]   I forget.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.160]   And I think Tasker, and I had my AMX set up,
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.400]   and it doesn't take American Express.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.680]   I had to set up another credit card, and I said, oh, screw it.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.400]   I'm not going to go through all this right now.
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.600]   Although the Google payment, which is the normal means
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.960]   in the marketplace, works fine if you have a Google account.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:27.440]   Right?
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:28.640]   I don't know.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:29.880]   I got to figure out why that's not set up,
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.240]   because I definitely have one of those Google checkouts.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:31.760]   It might be international.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.520]   You know, it's not international.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:35.320]   Yeah, it's an international app.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.160]   OK, that's why.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.160]   So that was it.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:43.440]   For each-- now, and this, I think, and TechCrunch mentions,
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.160]   is I think it does kind of imply that Amazon's
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.000]   going to do an Android-based tablet.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.320]   So it would make a lot of sense.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.680]   If you're making the hardware-- that's
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.120]   why Verizon is doing the VCast Android store,
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.120]   because they're selling the hardware.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:56.320]   So it makes sense to have a kind of--
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:02.400]   it's on this Droid X. You go to the standard market
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.920]   application, and there is a Verizon tab of vetted--
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:07.240]   Oh, so it's an Icy.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.080]   So it's a separate tab in the regular--
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:11.560]   Well, in this case, it's a separate tab.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:15.480]   So in fact, it takes the place on a stock Android install
[00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:17.640]   of the downloads tab, which is kind of annoying.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.840]   That's hidden in the menu.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:22.280]   You hit the Verizon tab, it's not just Verizon apps.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.120]   Skype's in there.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.080]   I mean, it's approved apps, right?
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.200]   Bing is in there.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.440]   So a lot-- most of them are Verizon, but not bust a move,
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.080]   not Rhapsody.
[00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.720]   So these are things that Verizon has presumably vetted.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.880]   Here's Kindle for Android.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.280]   This is--
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:43.000]   Who would you trust more to curate quality apps,
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.320]   Verizon or Amazon?
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.840]   Amazon, right?
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:48.480]   Now, according to TechCrunch, Amazon
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.680]   is going to take a chunk.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:55.120]   They will pay a royalty equal to the greater of 70%
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.720]   of the purchase price, or 20% of the list price
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.200]   of the purchase date.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.960]   I guess the list price is you could have a list price
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:08.360]   on other app stores and then have a discounted price on Amazon.
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.480]   I guess that's the point.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.320]   There's a $99 developer fee.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.000]   So I don't know why you would pay that.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.680]   I guess because you want to be in the store, right?
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.160]   I just want to be in the store.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.720]   So that puts up that just that little barrier that's
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.240]   like you've got to be serious about buying it.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.000]   That's true.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.400]   That eliminates the wallpapers.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.720]   It eliminates the wallpapers, exactly.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.400]   It says-- and this is, I hope, not true--
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.520]   that there's going to be DRM on it.
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:35.680]   Oh.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.360]   Well, yes.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:40.680]   The only work on devices they approve.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.160]   I hope that's not the case.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:43.360]   Yeah, that's not the case, too.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.680]   That's crappy.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.920]   And there's this other caveat that if your app is available
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.200]   on other platforms, you have to make sure to update it
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.160]   at the same time on Amazon Store that you do in another store.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.000]   It's fair.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.920]   I just don't know how easy that will be for--
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.320]   if there's an approval process-- oh, I guess
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.040]   if there's an approval process on Amazon side.
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:00.320]   But if everyone's got a store and you've
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.840]   got to submit your app to all the different places
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.760]   and wait for approval--
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.520]   Oh, that's to encourage you to use maybe just the marketplace
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.600]   in Amazon, not do a VCAST marketplace Amazon.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.680]   That's probably what that is.
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.600]   Maybe.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.880]   Free apps are allowed.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.080]   That's interesting.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.960]   And it's US-only.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.400]   Amazon says, we quote, "We have the sole discretion
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.480]   to determine all features and operations of this program
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:28.840]   and to set the retail price and other terms on which we sell
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:29.520]   apps."
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.560]   So this is like books.
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.800]   They're saying, we'll tell you what to charge.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.520]   Oh.
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:34.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.240]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:39.440]   Well, the other rumor TechCrunch had was of an Amazon tablet.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.720]   So that makes sense, right?
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.760]   Tablet and store should go together.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:43.280]   Right.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.960]   That does make sense.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:45.960]   Why?
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:46.720]   I guess it does.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.160]   I guess Amazon's emboldened by the success of the Kindle.
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:50.520]   I just-- I never could understand why they wanted
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.000]   to be in the hardware business.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:52.520]   You got to--
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:56.000]   I mean, you sell an Android tablet with the Kindle app
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.520]   installed on it, where you can purchase books.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.760]   It's just way more tricked out Kindle.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.640]   You want the Kindle with the touchscreen and the color?
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.440]   You don't get the Android tablet, you know?
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:07.360]   Have we talked about that great Kindle ad with the guy
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.200]   sits next to the beautiful woman?
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:10.600]   I love that ad.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:13.600]   I love-- I feel like they nailed the two things
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:15.600]   that the Kindle does better so well.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:18.240]   The E-ink and the price so well.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:21.680]   Yes, I can read it in the sun, and it's $130.
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.080]   And you're never getting to date me, big boy.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.520]   So away with your shiny iPad.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.640]   I paid more for my sunglasses.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.200]   I just love that line.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.040]   It's so perfectly done.
[00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.760]   It kind of says it all, doesn't it?
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   Yep.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:41.800]   Well, you know, Schmidt, when you talk to TechCrunch this week,
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:47.960]   I think positioned the war in a new way as edge versus edge.
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:50.280]   That's to say that he said, oh, the device doesn't matter.
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.280]   The device is dumb.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:52.400]   The device is meaningless.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.320]   It's the cloud that matters.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.760]   And of course, Apple says, oh, the cloud, big deal.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.760]   Everybody has a cloud.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:53:59.800]   We have the devices.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:01.200]   Right.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:03.880]   And Amazon is in an interesting position
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.560]   where they're kind of trying to play both now.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:06.040]   Right.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.520]   We are the cloud.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.160]   And we make the hardware.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.040]   Right.
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:14.040]   Hmm.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:18.400]   Google TV makes an early public appearance.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.040]   This is the Sony TV.
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:22.080]   They're going to make an announcement in a couple of days.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.600]   But apparently, according to--
[00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.760]   Is this in gadget?
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:26.120]   Yep.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.240]   In gadget, it showed up at a Best Buy,
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.880]   at the press event at the Best Buy in New York.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:36.960]   It's an NSX 46 GT1 model.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.480]   And it has-- I'll show you.
[00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:41.480]   It has little apps at the bottom of it.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:47.120]   I see TNT, YouTube, and Farmville.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.200]   Just what I want.
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:50.400]   Farmville on my TV.
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:50.880]   America's--
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:51.400]   Pac-man.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.920]   --portivity goes right down.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:58.600]   Farmville, really?
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.600]   Really?
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.520]   Oh, dear.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:02.000]   Well, I guess you can't stop.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.960]   I just want to see that chair.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.320]   Yeah, well, here's CNN, TBS.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:11.840]   So I thought it was very interesting that Hulu Plus
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:16.800]   is going to show up on the new Roku box.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.300]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:20.160]   I think these boxes are--
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.240]   this is going to give Google TV and Apple TV
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.520]   a run for its money now.
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:25.760]   Yeah, nothing's a heat.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.280]   Not for sure.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:26.720]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:28.240]   Competition, good thing.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.840]   Yeah, Apple TV is in Alaska.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.720]   What?
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.400]   I Apple TV is in Alaska.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:33.920]   Why?
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:34.920]   You ordered one.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.640]   Oh, it's in Alaska coming to you.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.480]   It didn't go to Alaska.
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:40.480]   It's on its way.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.680]   Yeah, I ordered one too, although I ordered it later,
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:43.840]   so I don't get it for a while.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:44.680]   I'll be very curious.
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:47.280]   I don't like the idea of a streaming only device,
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   although I use the Roku like crazy.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.240]   So there, I guess I do like that idea.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:56.680]   All right, we're going to take another break
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.880]   and come back with our--
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.520]   because we've got to let you go to work, Gina.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   She's going to work smart.
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.160]   I don't know more of this hanging out.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.080]   No more hanging out.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.680]   We're going to get Gina's tip.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:08.440]   We're going to get Jeff's number,
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:11.080]   and I have a tool of the week, which I tried and was not
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.440]   impressed by, but I'm going to tell you about it anyway.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.840]   It's overpriced and it didn't work.
[00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:18.120]   But other than that, it's great.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:21.120]   Just like the movie.
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.600]   And don't go see that sucky anti-social movie.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:26.000]   The anti-social network.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.440]   Let's talk a little bit.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:30.080]   This actually is a new sponsor,
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:32.120]   and it's kind of a little different thing for us.
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.880]   This guy's a friend of mine.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:35.720]   His name is Tom Johnson.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:41.840]   I met him six years ago, and he wrote what eventually
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:45.240]   became Microsoft's hosted exchange services.
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:46.800]   It was a company called Frontbridge,
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:48.080]   sold it to Microsoft.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:48.560]   Got it.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:52.160]   You know, I'm going to relax a little bit now.
[00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:54.400]   But he said, but spam is such a nasty thing.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.120]   I'm going to write the ultimate spam solution.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:00.080]   And now, this is not a client-side solution.
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:00.880]   This is not an application.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.320]   This is really not for an individual.
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.640]   Most of us are using Gmail.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.440]   Gmail does a very credible job at spam.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:11.920]   This is for either a company that wants to host its own mail,
[00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:15.480]   doesn't want to trust its mail to Gmail or some outside service,
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.360]   wants to run its own mail servers.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.520]   Or-- and I think that a lot of us are in this category.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:20.440]   I am.
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:21.440]   People who have their own servers.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:22.600]   I use leoville.com.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:23.920]   I know, Gina, you have your own servers.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.880]   K-Chep has his own servers.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:29.960]   I've been using mail route on my leoville.com for six years.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.680]   And Tom, every once in a while, send me my stats.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.760]   In the last 12 months--
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.200]   now, this is what's cool about mail route.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.760]   If you go to mail route.info, by the way,
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:41.040]   you can sign up 10% discount for life.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.880]   If you just-- you don't even have to use our name or anything.
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:45.440]   Just go to mail route.info.
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.440]   That's a special page for Twit listeners, Twig listeners.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:51.400]   And I got it.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.200]   But again, you have to be able to change your MX record.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:53.880]   That's how it works.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:56.320]   But the nice thing is it takes three seconds.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:57.760]   So if you were running your own server,
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.040]   or you're an IT department, or whatever,
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.280]   you change your MX record.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.320]   So instead of coming to your server first,
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:06.120]   it goes to your leoville.com.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:08.040]   The MX record says, no, send that to mail route.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.720]   Goes to mail route.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.000]   I think of it as sewage treatment plant.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.120]   It gets rid of all the garbage, and then comes back to my server.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:18.880]   Let me tell you how many messages did not
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.600]   go through my server because of this.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:28.120]   Last 12 months, I was sent 3,793,738 messages in one year.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:34.080]   Of the 3.7 million messages I was sent, 3.6 million were spam.
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:37.960]   96.5% of the traffic that went to leoville.com
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:40.200]   never arrived because of mail route.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.840]   And by the way, zero false positives.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:45.680]   Tom is a stickler for this.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.160]   You don't miss any critical mail.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.560]   You just don't get the junk.
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:51.360]   Last month, out of 342,000 messages
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:56.400]   sent to my leoville account, 96.8% were spam.
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:57.960]   And I never saw it.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.360]   I want you to try mail route right now.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:03.400]   Just go to mail route.info to find out more.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.360]   If you sign up there, you'll get 10% off for life.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:10.800]   99.999% uptime for message processing.
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:13.000]   And that's nice because even if your server goes down,
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.120]   leoville goes down all the time, I crash it.
[00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.200]   Man, I don't lose any mail because they do something
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.240]   called mail bagging.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:18.960]   They spool it out.
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:19.760]   They hold on to it.
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:22.640]   And when my server comes back, they slowly send them--
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.360]   send the mail on so I never miss any mail.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.760]   It's really easy to set up.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:28.160]   As long as you could change the MX record,
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.000]   you could be running within minutes.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.280]   You could sign up right on the website.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:34.320]   And no long-term contract.
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:37.080]   Prices start as low as $2 per user per month.
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:40.400]   The more users, more seats, the more boxes you have,
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:41.840]   the cheaper it gets.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.400]   Outbound services can be added for an additional $0.50
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:45.640]   per user per month.
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:49.280]   So you'd have to worry about your own mail getting black hold.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.640]   And it's month to month.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.720]   There's no long-term contract.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.360]   Tom says, we don't lock you in because we know you're
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:57.240]   going to want to stay here for life.
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.760]   I've been with them for six years.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.600]   And I am just so happy with mail route.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.360]   If you need to run your own mail servers,
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:07.760]   if you want privacy, if you run servers for family and friends,
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.320]   that's what I do, mail route.info.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.680]   Do you run your own mail servers, Gina?
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.720]   You use Gmail for everything.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:15.160]   I don't.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:16.240]   You use Gmail for everything.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.320]   This is not for you.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.520]   Because if you use Gmail, you're very happy with the spam
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.160]   filtering.
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.000]   I think mail route's better.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.280]   But actually, what happens for my mail
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.840]   is it ends up at Gmail.
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.000]   Now, I used to use Fastmail.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.240]   Goes to Gmail now.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.080]   So I really don't see spam.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:35.760]   Because everything is double filtered.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:36.520]   That's amazing.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:38.080]   Those numbers are astounding.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:39.280]   Can you believe that?
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:42.000]   98% of my-- 96.8% of my email is spam.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:42.960]   It's crazy.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.920]   I mean, real spam.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.280]   I mean, if you look at my--
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.000]   I should show you my mail store.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.280]   And never a false positive.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.320]   Mail route.info.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.320]   Tom Johnson is the nicest guy in the world.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320]   I love him.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.880]   Old friend, he'll treat you right.
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.800]   Mail route.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.120]   I'm getting nostalgia for John.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.520]   I get no spam to worry.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.280]   I know.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:05.880]   Every time he said that, I just--
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.560]   because I actually had a good solution.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.240]   I should have been telling you about this for years.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:12.120]   I apologize for not telling you about this before.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.920]   Mail route.info.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.480]   All right, time for Jeff's--
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:19.440]   I'm sorry, Gina's tip of the week, Gina.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.120]   This is actually for Gmail users.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.240]   One of the things that defines Gmail
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.680]   is that it automatically groups all your mail
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.040]   into conversation view.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:28.920]   Everything's a thread.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.840]   You don't see an individual message for each reply.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:35.000]   And for years, I mean, since Gmail launched, people have said,
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.320]   is there any way to turn that off?
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:36.320]   I hate it.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.200]   I don't want that.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.680]   I hate it.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:41.400]   They finally are launching away.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.920]   They're adding a setting where you can turn off conversation
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.120]   view.
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.120]   I was shocked by this because I felt like they just
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.080]   were so adamant about the fact that this was the way
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:49.720]   that you did email.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.360]   But I feel like now they feel like five years has passed.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:54.640]   And people know, and now you have the choice.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.160]   They've framed me.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.720]   This is one message, and now they're all stacked up.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.800]   I can't figure it out.
[01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.200]   I don't understand it.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.320]   It's too complicated.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.480]   So how do I turn it off, Gina?
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:03.880]   Tell me.
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.640]   So in your Gmail settings, this is a brand new setting.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.640]   They're rolling this out over the next few days.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.640]   So you might not have it yet.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.560]   I actually don't have it yet.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.480]   But in your settings, there is a conversation view,
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.000]   a brand new conversation view section,
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.600]   where you can say you can turn conversation view off.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.120]   I don't know how to do that.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.680]   What you mean is that when you look at your inbox,
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.960]   if you have a message with 12 replies,
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:25.200]   that will show up as 12 entries in your inbox.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.480]   It won't be all grouped into one conversation.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.440]   So it'll mean a lot of re-re-re or forward, forward,
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.360]   forward down your box.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.840]   But some people, some people, before that--
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.720]   That's how most mail clients work.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.240]   That's how most mail clients work.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.880]   And at this point, I'm totally acclimated
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:38.720]   to the conversation view.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.080]   They really kind of convince me.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.080]   It's so much.
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:41.800]   It brings one point.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.160]   And then it's amazing that people are still
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.600]   real vocal about the fact that they don't want things grouped,
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.760]   and now you have the choice.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.360]   Just watch, because I'll turn it off, and I'll go, oh.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:52.640]   Now I understand.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.560]   For new Gmail switchers, like you Leo,
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.640]   you do have the choice.
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:56.000]   Exactly.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.080]   I'm the one that's going, I can't--
[01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:58.480]   Where?
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:02:59.640]   Huh?
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:01.520]   It confuses me.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.640]   I'm easily confused, obviously.
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:07.480]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:09.240]   I've got a number-- I mentioned one thing first,
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.800]   if I just made real quickly, that a pioneering blogger named
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.200]   Hussein Diracian, otherwise known as Hodor, who
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.640]   variously was credited or not credited for helping
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.520]   start the incredible Iranian blogosphere,
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.840]   was sentenced to 19 and 1/2 years in Iranian prison
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.760]   this week for things that he has said on his blog.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:35.320]   And so it's one of us folks.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.000]   If you go to Ethan Zuckerman as suggesting
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.640]   that we pressure the Canadian government to pressure Iran,
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.520]   so I just wanted to mention that Hodor is an odd duck.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.360]   He changes opinions a lot.
[01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.000]   He had some very strange opinions toward the end,
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.320]   but he's still a blogger who lack of free speeches in prison,
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:56.200]   so I just wanted to mention that.
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.080]   Now, the number-- one million is the number,
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.640]   and I'll use it twice.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.480]   One is that Google just announced
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:04.600]   that they are funding a company called
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:10.200]   Schwib to the tune of $1 million for suspended plastic
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.160]   cycling pods on a monorail.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.040]   That's useful, Bo-Chafe.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.240]   Schwib!
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.600]   Schwib!
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.960]   Oh, there's-- the adolescent Leo comes out there.
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.720]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:25.800]   Oh, come on, tell me.
[01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.080]   That's not the first thing.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:27.600]   It is.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.600]   It is.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.320]   And so it's the damnedest thing.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:35.840]   I can't imagine there'll be bicycle-powered tracks that
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:43.280]   may be safer than the-- what's the thing the guy died on this week?
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.040]   The trolley-- oh, it was Jesus, I'm being an idiot.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.360]   Oh, the guy who drove his segue off the cliff.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.120]   The segue off, yeah.
[01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.720]   So maybe this is safer than the segue.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.280]   But now that must have been a suicide, right?
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.120]   No, he brought the company.
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:55.960]   It was an accident.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.320]   It was an accident?
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.280]   Yeah, he got a couple of--
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.520]   Not good for segue sales.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.880]   I don't know why he was testing the new one.
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.280]   Yeah, he got a couple of clips.
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:04.200]   Yeah, oops.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.680]   I feel terrible laughing.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.760]   No, I shouldn't have either.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.840]   But boy, I didn't read it closely.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.600]   And I thought, oh, well, he must have driven off the--
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.520]   it was an accident.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.440]   It was an accident.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.240]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:15.400]   Happy, nice guy who just bought the company.
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.200]   And then--
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.400]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:19.000]   Oh, that's terrible.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.960]   Well, I'm just full of joy at the end of the show, aren't I?
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.560]   How do you drive a segue off a cliff?
[01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:26.760]   I could do it.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.320]   I guess it's--
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.000]   I could probably do it.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:28.640]   I'm clumsy enough.
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.640]   I'd do it.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:30.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:30.640]   Don't go near--
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:31.600]   Yeah, I guess if you just--
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:32.840]   stand up too fast or--
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:35.600]   Don't go near cliffs on your segue, OK?
[01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:36.100]   No.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:37.920]   Have you driven one, Gina?
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.040]   I have not.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:39.760]   I have not.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.280]   I've actually managed to--
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:42.720]   I could fall off a segue.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.120]   I'm like-- I'm like--
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.120]   George Costanza--
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.200]   I love the segue.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:46.560]   I think so much--
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.240]   You would be able to do a layout.
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:49.120]   Why has taught me how?
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.520]   So that's-- I got to--
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.560]   Oh, I'm less than from the master.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.720]   So the other use of "1 Million" real quick
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.800]   is that the node coach was at TechCrunch Disrupt
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.080]   and told Australia it's been around,
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:05.160]   but he confirmed it that excites George Bell
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:08.600]   rejected buying Google for $1 million.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.560]   Coach LaTalked Larian Sergey down to $750,
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:13.840]   and excites still rejected that.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:17.040]   Current market cap $167 billion.
[01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.160]   Excite debt.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:24.360]   And where's Krause these days?
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.040]   You don't know--
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:27.240]   I think the aliens got him.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:28.600]   Oh, that's right.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:29.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:31.680]   He was the one who said something about aliens, right?
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.000]   Joe Krause, the guy started exciting.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.320]   How much money?
[01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:38.840]   $1 million and then talked out--
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.920]   I can't believe the coach LaL was going to talk him down,
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.600]   but talking to the $750,000 and excites still rejected it.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:44.240]   Too expensive.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.400]   Talked him down.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.480]   I'll give you $49.95 and a hot dog.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.680]   So my pick is something that Adam--
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:54.400]   is it Dashes?
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.280]   How do you say Adam's name?
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:57.760]   Docus in "Life Hacker"?
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.160]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:06:59.840]   I think I think it is--
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:00.340]   Dachos.
[01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:03.440]   Dachos wrote about and promptly brought the site
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.640]   to its knees.
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.400]   But it's a great idea.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.360]   It's called Rainmaker, and they have an announcement
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:09.920]   on their site.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:12.280]   I went there immediately after I read the "Life Hacker" article
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.960]   to sign up, and all I got was an Apache error message
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.200]   every time I tried.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.720]   Thank you for your interest in Rainmaker.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.800]   We're experiencing very high traffic at the moment
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.720]   that is slowing our sinks.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.160]   Trust that we are working around the clock to fix the issue.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:28.000]   Well, if it gets fixed, this is a great idea.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.800]   It ties all of your social networks
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:32.440]   into your Google contacts.
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:36.200]   So you can sign in-- let me just see if it's working now.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:39.120]   I just sign in with my Gmail here.
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:42.080]   It is not cheap in the long run.
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.080]   Grant access.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:48.080]   Now what I'll do is I'll give my Facebook and Twitter--
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:48.600]   yeah.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:49.920]   Oh, that's--
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.080]   that's what I thought.
[01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.280]   It's the price of fame.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:55.520]   It's the price of getting life hacked.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.280]   That's what it is.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280]   But it's a really great idea.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:01.040]   Pulls your data, contact data from Facebook, LinkedIn,
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.400]   and Twitter.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:05.160]   My phone does a little bit of that,
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:09.320]   but this is a little bit smarter than the phone for doing this.
[01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:11.080]   And I'm very impressed.
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:15.840]   However, I got to tell you, it is not without a price.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.440]   If you look at the pricing, there is a free version.
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:20.960]   They call it Drizzle.
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.920]   That you get $10 per raindrop.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.160]   25 to start.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:25.520]   Now, a--
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:27.280]   Lock that metaphor.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.480]   Yeah, it's going-- well, it gets worse.
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:32.840]   If you pay $9, you get the sprinkle.
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:34.680]   And you get 100 raindrops a month.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:37.520]   A shower is $250 a month for $20 a month.
[01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.720]   So it's a little pricey.
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.760]   But if you are-- basically, they call it CRM for Google
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:42.200]   contacts.
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.400]   And I have to agree.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:46.920]   If you are-- if your contact list is really important to you,
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:50.240]   this is a very nice way of combining
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.240]   contacts from all of the social networks, not updating them,
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.960]   automatically updating the phone numbers,
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:00.480]   updating birthdays, all the stuff that you need.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.880]   Who's connected to who?
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.400]   I think it's kind of a neat idea.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.440]   And I look forward to it working someday.
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.840]   I'm probably now put another nail in the coffin of Raindrop.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:13.640]   Don't try it now.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.360]   Don't try it yet.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:18.840]   Yeah, the Rainmaker says, "Admins" just like, oh, God.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.640]   Oh, they're crying.
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:22.960]   That was, by the way, one of the great moments
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:25.920]   from the Facebook movie when Zuckerberg said,
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.680]   we never go down.
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:30.040]   And of course, last week, as I watched it, they went down.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:30.640]   Go down.
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.680]   Yeah, he was mad at Eduardo because Eduardo closed the--
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.520]   I know I shouldn't.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.960]   Spoiler alert, but doesn't everybody know this?
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.200]   Maybe not.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.280]   Anyway, I won't say it.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.000]   The other thing that is a great moment for geeks
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.280]   is when they bring the Harvard network down.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:45.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:46.880]   And that's actually pretty neat.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.320]   There's a couple of moments that you will like, Gina,
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:50.360]   like geek moments.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:51.160]   OK.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:56.000]   When his buddy comes in and he's creating face smash,
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.600]   which predated Facebook, and was it Eduardo?
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:09:59.400]   Maybe it was Eduardo.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.640]   He says, Eduardo, what is the ELO rating algorithm
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.600]   that you were telling me about?
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.160]   And he writes it in marker on the window,
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:09.920]   and then Zuck implements it into his system.
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:11.920]   And it's kind of cool.
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:15.320]   There's some geek coding moments that I liked.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.440]   All right, all right.
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.160]   I'm going to see you.
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:17.760]   I'm going to see you.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:18.800]   I'm going to let you know what I mean.
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:20.880]   Tell us how wrong we were, Gina.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.360]   All right.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.960]   Say how great a movie it is.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.920]   You know, this is nice.
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:26.600]   Jeff, to review a movie before it comes out,
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.800]   because nobody can gain, say, anything.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.360]   You know, they don't--
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.760]   Oh, they have been.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:32.120]   They have.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:32.480]   Really?
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.920]   Even without saying it.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:39.320]   It's not a documentary, man.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.520]   No, that's true.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.560]   It isn't.
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.040]   Not even close.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.200]   We're going to let Gina and Jeff go,
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:53.040]   because Gina has a date with a fast company, fastcompany.com/worksmart
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.200]   for Gina's great new video feature on getting things done.
[01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.200]   I do.
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.960]   I'm off to do a shoot.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:01.440]   But I'll be back for the full 90 minutes next year.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.200]   Next year.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:02.920]   Next year.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:04.960]   Next year for my next week.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.040]   That's the 40 and slip if I ever heard one.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.280]   Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:12.800]   And of course, as I said, fastcompany.com/worksmart.
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.720]   Jeff Jarvis, the author of What Would Google Do?
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.800]   He also blogs at buzzmachine.com, which is now backup.
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.280]   So you can read his pan of your Facebook movie.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.480]   And we will end today.
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.680]   I'll let you guys go with--
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.240]   I don't think we'll play all 10 minutes.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.280]   But the weirdest Google ad--
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.880]   or what I don't know ever.
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:32.880]   Pizza.
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.280]   It's--
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.520]   It's Google Mobile.
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.520]   I don't even know why.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.320]   I don't even know why.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.400]   I don't even know why.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.000]   Thanks, everybody.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:39.880]   We'll see you next time.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.560]   You're looking for--
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.000]   On Twitter.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.200]   Say you're in Chicago, and you're really hungry.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:44.700]   Pizza.
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:48.400]   See?
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.080]   I just got all the pizza places nearby.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.800]   Your phone knows where you are.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:56.440]   Pizza.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:59.160]   Pizza.
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.920]   Pizza.
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:01.840]   For 10 minutes.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.600]   Pizza.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.720]   I don't understand what's happening here.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:08.200]   Pizza.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.720]   Why is he doing this?
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:12.320]   Pizza.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:12.680]   Pizza.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:17.760]   For 10 minutes.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.160]   Pizza.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:20.680]   Pizza.
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.280]   I actually feel sorry for the guy.
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.240]   Pizza.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.280]   Pizza.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:29.160]   Is this their response to the Bing ad?
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.360]   Baby, that's what it is.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.200]   Pizza today, the big worries, that maybe this is--
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:33.200]   maybe that's what it is.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.160]   Pizza.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:36.120]   Pizza.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:37.280]   I missed the dog before I said I was right.
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.200]   I like that.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.160]   Pizza.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:40.600]   Pizza.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.880]   But I don't understand--
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.680]   I don't--
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:45.200]   Pizza.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.160]   Pizza.
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.760]   They're saying this is a loop.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.600]   Pizza.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.280]   Maybe it is.
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.800]   Pizza.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.240]   Pizza.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:56.080]   Pizza.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:56.880]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.720]   We'll see you next time on this week in--
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:00.280]   Pizza.
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.280]   Pizza.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:02.960]   Pizza.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.560]   Pizza.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:05.160]   Thanks, Jeff.
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:05.920]   Thanks, Gina.
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:06.400]   Take care.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.400]   Thank you.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:07.960]   See you next week.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:08.960]   Pizza.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.340]   (upbeat music)
