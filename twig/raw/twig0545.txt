[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. @pruit is here. Stacey Higginbotham, Jeff Jarvis, the DOJ's investigating Google.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.120]   We'll talk about why. Google had some pretty good earnings, but how well did YouTube do?
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.080]   We know for the first time Clearview AI face recognition. YouTube says, "Ah, ah."
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.280]   And how the coronavirus is shutting down Google and the Mobile World Congress.
[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.840]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.840]   This week at Google comes to you from Twig's LastPass Studios.

[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.200]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   The show we talk about the latest from the verse, the Google verse, the Facebook verse,
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.280]   the Twitter verse, the verse of verse, the media verse.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.800]   That's Jeff Jarvis's job. He is the townite.
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:25.120]   Lottie-da guy. He's a professor of journalism at CUNY, but it's more than that.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.880]   There it is. The Leonard Tap Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Neumark
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.400]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.280]   And the director of the 10-night Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism with
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.080]   Craig Neumark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.040]   I think we should refactor that. It seems like there's some repetition in there.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.160]   Hello, Jeff. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello, my friend.
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.120]   All right. Any word from Iowa? It's up to 85% now.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.560]   Oh my God. It just went up to 85% of the latest numbers are.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.200]   Yes. Buttigieg, 26.7. Is that the Sanger's? Is that 24.3?
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.400]   Is that the after realignment? Yes. I can't believe we have to use it.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.320]   Buttigieg, 26.7. Sanders, 24.3. Warren, 17.4.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.760]   Biden, 15.9. Klobuchar, 12.1.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.840]   Okay, I'm going to realign myself right now.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.240]   It's so weird. We have to go. Okay, but is it before after realignment?
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.600]   This is Ant Pruitt. He is a lined. He is fully aligned. He is always in a full alignment.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.680]   Yes. He is. Host of HOP, hands-on photography.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.440]   And is, of course, a regular on this week in Google. Great to have you, Ant.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.360]   Thank you, sir. And your dad, Gum T-shirt.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:41.120]   Sponsored. Sponsored. We have to do, apparently the FTC says we have to do #sponsored
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.080]   when you wear that T-shirt. #sponsored. I don't mind.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.240]   And Stacy's gig in both of them is also here. Hello, Stacy from Stacy and IOT.com.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.520]   Good to see you. Hello. Hello.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.560]   And we can get you a #sponsored sticker and you can stick it on your shirt.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.520]   That's a good idea. That's a great idea. You got a little button.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.560]   Yeah. I didn't know. My wife told me that in the Australian Open,
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.960]   what's her name or what? The woman.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.640]   There's one cosmetics manufacturer. They always go up to the lower people knowing they're going
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.520]   to play higher people. And then if they happen to come up great, then they're fine. But they've
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.240]   been in everything because they're going for the lower end and a lower person won the Open.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.240]   So there they were. And it's a temporary kind of sticker they put on the outfit.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.280]   Oh, nice. It's so fast. Oh, isn't that funny? That's hysterical.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.200]   Sophia Kennan? Yes. Thank you, Sophia Kennan. Sophia Kennan.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.080]   It was in Melbourne. You guys should know. And of course, the men, singles champion,
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.680]   Novak Dad jokes. Dad jokes.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:57.520]   Justice Department ramps up Google probe. That sounds painful with heavy focus on ad tools.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.880]   This is a Wall Street Journal exclusive. The Justice Department has reached out to more
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.280]   than a dozen companies, including all of the hereditary enemies of the Google publishers,
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.560]   advertising technology firms, advertising agencies. Apparently, according to the journal,
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.520]   Google's online ad tools are a major focus now of the Justice Department's
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.440]   kind of trust any Justice Department probe ever again.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:31.280]   That's, you know, see, this is a problem because maybe there maybe there should be enforcement,
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.920]   right? But maybe there should. Maybe there shouldn't. We can't tell.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.720]   Tell the difference.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:43.120]   Could be Rupert Murdoch is, you know, putting a little bug in the William bars here. We don't know.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.480]   In a couple thousand handshakes. Yeah. Many of the questions, according to W.S.J.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.440]   set around two moves that Google's made in recent years that publishers and rivals.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:06:00.080]   Should you be if you're going to investigate a company for antitrust or whatever, should you be
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.600]   talking to competitors and rivals? Yes. Of course. That's what you're talking to.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:12.480]   Yes. Because our current antitrust framework is built around competition and the
[00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.160]   consumer harm. But yes. Yeah. Consumer harm.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.200]   Well, is it consumer harm or is it business harm?
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:25.600]   Well, if it's unfair use of a market position or monopoly, that obviously does affect your
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.320]   competitors. Yes. I think the vendors have the evidence. And they would know they have the
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.200]   evidence. Yeah. See what? Here's the great thing about this. Here's the great thing about this
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.960]   timing, right? The same time this story comes out, right? Google's finances come out and everybody's
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.920]   going after Google because the ad business is slipping. It's just like Microsoft. Just like that,
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.320]   right? Just at the time when your fight in yesterday's war, and it literally was yesterday.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:54.080]   The first of the two moves Google's made in recent years that people are worried about was
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:07:01.200]   Google's integration of its ad server, AdWords and AdSense, with Ad Exchange, the industry's
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:07.120]   largest digital ad marketplace. Secondly, was Google's decision to require advertisers to use
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.200]   the Google tools to buy ad space on YouTube? I don't understand anyway. How else you would do
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.280]   that? How else would you do it? Not on the first, on the first, you know, I've always said that
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.840]   Google's vulnerability in its power is the ad side. They do have the power of God. I don't
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:29.040]   think that they were as clever as they should have been in being more open about the processes,
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.040]   in having appeals for places that are taken down. Google had too much power in advertising. I will
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.040]   acknowledge that. And I think it's just a nature of their size, but there could be stuff in the
[00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:46.720]   closet there that's going to hurt them. Were you surprised at how little money YouTube makes for
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:52.080]   Google? Wow, I thought that was a lot. Was it a lot of money? It's like, it's a... It's 15 billion,
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.160]   but people... It was a 15 billion. So 18 billion total.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   Right. Sorry. I actually... I thought it should be more. Only because of Instagram.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.480]   You're talking about... Yeah, compared to Facebook. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Compared to Facebook,
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.960]   Instagram is what was it? Some huge portion of Facebook's overall revenue. I have it the
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.000]   bond of a million, I think was 23 billion. It's down there under my stuff.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:28.960]   20 billion. 20 billion. So Instagram was a $1715 million purchase, now revenue of 20 billion.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:37.200]   YouTube was a $1.65 billion purchase, now $18.1 billion revenue, 15 at, as Stacy said, plus three
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   billion for social revenue. Although, was YouTube purchased in 2006?
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.720]   Something like that. Earlier, yes. Okay. Well, it's been in 2006.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.880]   I mean, let's give them a high value of money. Yeah, how long?
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:57.600]   2006, they paid 1.65 billion. Instagram was a better investment, yes.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:05.680]   Yes. So... Quick returns, cost more. YouTube. So I'm confused. Oh, I guess 15 billion a year,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:11.680]   because it had a $5 billion quarter in revenue. That's not profit, that's revenue.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.960]   Revenue. It's all revenue. That's ad revenue, again,
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.720]   not including subscription revenue. Right.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.800]   Why has Google never revealed this before and why are they revealing it now?
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:29.440]   Sundar, I guess, now that he's running Alphabet. Or maybe it's regulatory pressure. Maybe they
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.720]   wanted to, if people thought YouTube was all this, maybe they were like, "Well, let's show."
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.240]   Although, at that pricing, it's been material for a while, so I don't understand how they could
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.480]   not have broken it out, if that makes sense. Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.520]   Oh, so the other thing is... Although, you know, Apple doesn't say,
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.480]   well, I guess they do, they don't break out.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.480]   tablets make this much, phones make that much, no.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.840]   The other thing about Google is that, to the earlier point about advertising,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.320]   as advertising is suffering, because it is an abundant market with no end of inventory,
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.600]   and the prices are going to go down, the Wall Street has been on Google's case to say,
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.920]   show us you are not 100% vulnerable to an advertising only. So they've got to show that
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:16.000]   there are cloud stuff and YouTube, though it's advertising still, but a different kind.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.560]   Show us you're not completely vulnerable to search advertising.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.160]   The search advertising has been vulnerable, as we talked about in the show many times.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.280]   All right. It does feel like Google and Facebook have become dominant in that tech.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.280]   You'd have to add Amazon in on that.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.120]   Now...
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.280]   But the three of them probably have, what, 80% or 90% of the digital ad market.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.400]   I mean, it's a huge percentage.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.840]   They don't throw it all in it.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.640]   It's easy to...
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.600]   I mean...
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.400]   Yeah. How would...
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.280]   I mean, like...
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.320]   But there's competition.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:49.360]   It's not like Google has a monopoly. They might have a triopoly, if there's such a word.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.080]   I'm looking for oligopoly.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.880]   Oligopoly.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.520]   Oligopy.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.240]   Is that crazy?
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.040]   Or oligarchy.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.960]   By the way, that's Google's defense.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.880]   They say the ad tech industry is competitive.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.480]   Google's market share contracted for the first...
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.720]   contracted for the first time in 2016.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.960]   Because you have...
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.480]   The likes of Facebook.
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.320]   Here is...
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.560]   50 Google share e-marketer.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.400]   This is as of June 2019.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:25.280]   The combined US market share of the two giants will fall for the first time in 2018,
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.360]   shrinking to 56.8%.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.560]   So, no, it's not that time.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.240]   Well, and then throw in Amazon, though.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.600]   It's going to end up being...
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.760]   Amazon is late to the party.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.200]   It's going to grow like crazy, yes.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.920]   It's advertising business.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.040]   How much is it?
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.920]   We...
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.800]   It's trying to...
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.600]   It's got to be trillions, right?
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.800]   It's not trillions.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.280]   It's not trillions.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.000]   That's a lot of money.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.200]   I don't know.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.880]   It's a lot of...
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.560]   A billion here, a billion there.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.360]   It's zero.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.160]   It's zero.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:50.720]   It's zero.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.080]   I was talking in rubles.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.720]   Excuse me.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:53.040]   Okay.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.000]   So, Amazon's ad resistance grew by 40% in 2019.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.440]   It's ad revenue surpassed...
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.320]   This is quarterly.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.400]   So, surpassed 4 billion for the first time in the fourth quarter.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.800]   So, if you just click 16 billion a year.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.400]   So, it's YouTube's up.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.400]   It's heading toward YouTube sized.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.480]   The global...
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.760]   It's a force, but it's not.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:18.320]   Worldwide, global digital ads spend 333 billion.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.680]   A third of a trillion.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.760]   Doesn't get you there.
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.480]   That doesn't work.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.200]   Nope.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:23.760]   You're not awful.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.920]   Stacey, you're gonna get the box.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:26.800]   It's a lot.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.480]   Okay.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.760]   333 billion though.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.200]   It's a significant amount of money.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.920]   It is.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.280]   But 56% of that.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.400]   Mm, not bad.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:34.960]   I'd take it.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.600]   But it's not dominant.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.040]   That's not monopoly size.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:40.320]   That's two of them.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.600]   So, yeah.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.160]   Slow.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:44.720]   Don't you...
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.240]   You also have to look though at its market power.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:48.480]   So...
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:49.920]   That's a lot.
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:50.960]   Like, in terms of reach...
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:51.680]   That's the issue.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.160]   That's the right.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.160]   Right.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.120]   And I don't know like how they want to do this.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.000]   I mean, there's...
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.240]   I'm familiar with like the cellular carrier rubrics that they use,
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.920]   but I have no idea for digital advertising because boring.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.640]   So boring.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.720]   Here's the argument the Wall Street Journal puts forward.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:17.840]   Google's ad tech business consists of software used to buy and sell ads on sites across the web.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.160]   The company owns the dominant tool.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:26.240]   Dominant's an interesting word here if they don't have more than half of the market.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.520]   The dominant tool at every link in the complex chain
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.760]   between online publishers and advertisers giving it unique power
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.920]   over the monetization of digital content.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.280]   Is that fair, Jeff?
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.720]   Is that a fair characteristic?
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.400]   I think that they have...
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.120]   They have...
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:46.000]   Well, the word dominant has a very specific legal language.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.240]   I know from having worked for newspaper companies where we were
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.400]   struck to never use that word.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.360]   Oh, interesting.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.080]   Never, never, never, never in any context.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.920]   You can't say that this team dominated that team.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.200]   No, don't say dominant!
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.240]   Because we used to be, right?
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.680]   Long, long back in the past.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.480]   So yeah, dominant has a very specific legal meaning.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.040]   So I don't know what that legal meaning is and whether it meets that.
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:09.600]   Is it huge?
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.720]   No, I was just about to ask.
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.440]   If it's only a third, it doesn't sound like it would be dominant.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.320]   No.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.120]   Well, maybe you can be dominant just by being the number one in the market, right?
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.800]   Well, remember that one of the classic antitrust prosecutions was
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.240]   motion picture companies who owned the theaters.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.160]   They owned both the production and the distribution.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:30.880]   Distribution.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.160]   And whether they had 100% of that or not,
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.320]   that was considered a monopolistic combination.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.640]   They were forced to divest the movie theaters.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.280]   Because if you own all the distribution,
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.840]   if you own both sides of the equation,
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.160]   it's pretty hard to get a foot in there.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.000]   And so in a way, I mean,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.880]   it sounds like what the DOJ is most concerned about is the fact that
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.480]   Google owns both sides of the both buying and buying.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.520]   I'll read you what Google search gave me from the site I'd never heard on.
[00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.720]   But it's in their little box.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.440]   So I think it's supposed to be a villain called "get in the deal through."
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.320]   Definition of dominance.
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.080]   It can be proven either through direct evidence of actual price increases,
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.760]   or the exclusion of competitors,
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.560]   or more typically through indirect evidence of high market shares,
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.920]   plus barriers to entry.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.960]   A share of below 50% generally is not enough to support the inference of monopoly power.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.280]   Okay.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:19.840]   There you go.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.800]   Well, that's not.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.680]   So they're below 50%.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.760]   Well, well, yeah.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.200]   And going down.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.320]   Plus, you have to separate because let's look at the pieces of the business, right?
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.560]   There's search advertising on Google.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.600]   There's Google advertising on the sites.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.240]   There's double click and other ad-serving things.
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.680]   There's YouTube advertising.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.200]   Those are separate lines of business with different competitors in each.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.240]   So it's not enough to be dominant.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.880]   You have to abuse your dominant position.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.280]   So it's okay to be dominant as long as you are not messing with pricing.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.200]   Actually,
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:57.600]   Right.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.640]   But Stacy, here's the question.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.520]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.160]   You're not dominant.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.520]   If you're not dominant, can you abuse?
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.720]   The abuse isn't the abuse getting into new markets?
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.120]   No, the abuse is in setting prices in the markets.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.520]   And keeping players out.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.160]   And right.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.520]   And keeping competitors.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.160]   Stacy, Stacy, can you abuse without being dominant?
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.920]   Is dominance the...
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.280]   The preferred...
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.480]   Maybe that's when the...
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.200]   Maybe that's when the...
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.920]   Maybe if you can exclude,
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.840]   even if you're not dominant,
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.000]   but you can exclude competitors,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.520]   yes, you can be.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.400]   That's what's interesting here.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.680]   So that might be what you have is,
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.920]   what's that damn site I hate that...
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:39.520]   Like restaurant reviews and all that.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.360]   And the guy whines all the time about Google.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.080]   Yelp.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.760]   Yelp is one of the worst sites there is.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.560]   Yelp constantly complains that Google keeps melting.
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.800]   Now Google includes Yelp,
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.680]   but then they don't want to be included.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.880]   And they go back and forth.
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.960]   But Yelp is the one who's yelping about this all the time.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.040]   Well, that's why at the very beginning, I said,
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.480]   there are...
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.400]   Of course, you do ask the competitors,
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.760]   because that's where the evidence comes from.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.920]   At the same time, you also have a lot of companies
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.920]   who just love to be in Google's position.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.480]   And the...
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.200]   You know, these...
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.840]   The journal is quoting these tiny little companies
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.880]   I've never heard of that do ad sales saying...
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.720]   Well, plus the journal itself.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.920]   And the journal is a competitor.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.200]   Just keep in mind,
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.440]   the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.600]   have essentially given up on the ad business.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.480]   What?
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:25.680]   They're milking it for what they can.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.760]   And they've got advertising revenue.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.560]   Subscription.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.440]   Subscription revenue.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.880]   Subscription is their primary business now.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.000]   They've basically given up.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.080]   And that's been that one for a while though, right?
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.840]   Yeah, but they're blaming Google.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.720]   Well, Google offered a better deal,
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.040]   different situation.
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.560]   So now it's just now our best.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.600]   Aside from...
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.360]   Anti-trust,
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.680]   aside from financial markets.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.400]   You guys...
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:50.720]   What?
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.960]   I am reading the Sherman Trust Act,
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.840]   the Sherman Antifust Act.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.400]   Good for you.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.200]   It's about time.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.840]   Because you are dominant in the time.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.640]   In the US,
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.240]   this is a legal site discussing.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.520]   It's got the law and then the discussion of the law.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.560]   The US law does not recognize the concept
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.160]   of relative dominance.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.600]   So we are not interested in who's dominant or not,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.880]   apparently according to this.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.560]   So...
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.440]   That's shocking.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.960]   And I know I was just on the European...
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.640]   The Purpose of the Sherman Act
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.120]   is not to protect competitors from harm
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.360]   from legitimately the successful businesses,
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.400]   nor to prevent businesses from gaining honest profits
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.440]   from consumers,
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.680]   but rather to preserve a competitive marketplace
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.800]   to protect some of these...
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.360]   Supertective consumers.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.160]   Which is different from Europe.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.800]   But it does say that attempted monopolization
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.120]   and conspiracy to monopolize claims
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.080]   do not require a showing of monopoly power.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.200]   Well, conspiracy too.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.600]   That is true anti-trust where you set up new fixed prices...
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.640]   Right, that's like car sales.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.600]   With your competitors.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.640]   That's true.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.360]   I did always...
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.200]   Yeah, this is always enjoy this show
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.640]   because this is where we try to figure out
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.560]   what's going on in real time.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.040]   This is where we get our law degrees in real time.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:05.920]   In real time.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.400]   We probably should get Denise Howell on here.
[00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.120]   The purpose of the Sherman Supreme Court, 1993,
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.160]   the purpose of the Sherman Act
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.880]   is not to protect businesses from the working of the market.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.240]   It is to protect the public from the failure of the market.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:20.880]   Right, right.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:21.840]   That's well said, yes.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.440]   Unlike Europe.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.040]   Where they are protecting other companies, size alone,
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:29.840]   gets you in trouble.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.200]   Here it has to be your impact.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.120]   It's against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:35.120]   Right.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:35.680]   It's sell.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.480]   Right.
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:36.880]   There you go.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.320]   So...
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:41.520]   So Yelp will Yelp about being Yelp out of the helping
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.760]   by Big Bad Monster Google.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.200]   But...
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.280]   I don't think so.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.920]   Okay, so really then this hinges on...
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.200]   Do you have your monopoly or dominance,
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.240]   but mostly monopoly,
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.560]   through anti-competitive means?
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.040]   Right.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:01.920]   That's bad.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.280]   How did you get it?
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:03.920]   How did you use it?
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.040]   Right.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:05.440]   So...
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.240]   This is awesome.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.200]   It's confusing.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.600]   There's such a thing as an innocent monopoly.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.960]   It's also...
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.640]   You're just so good.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.600]   Everyone buys you.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.760]   Which really has been Google.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.600]   The monopoly with a heart of gold.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.440]   That's a Google.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.880]   That could be like a Walmart.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.360]   That could be a couple of different things, right?
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.720]   Well, Walmart...
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.560]   I mean, there's a lot of mom and pop shops.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.000]   So I'm going to argue that Walmart,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.560]   I'm fairly...
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:28.800]   Right.
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.760]   And Hope Depot,
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.240]   kicked them out of the market.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.760]   This is why it's hard though, because...
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.800]   It is hard.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.600]   They kicked them out by beating them at their own game.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.720]   I mean, they did a better job.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.920]   Two consumers benefit.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.040]   Right.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.840]   So I guess it would be more like,
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.360]   and this may have also happened,
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.480]   Walmart saying to...
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.480]   You know, peanut companies,
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.960]   well, don't sell peanuts to anybody but me in this town,
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.160]   or I'm not going to do business with you.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.520]   And if they're so big,
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.240]   that they can then...
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:54.880]   Control the market that way.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.680]   Well, that's obvious.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.160]   That's wrong.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:56.560]   And Missy said...
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.760]   Well, here's the argument, Tom,
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.080]   is that eBay and Amazon,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.280]   once they get into that position,
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.160]   are going to raise prices.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.520]   Well, yeah, exactly.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.280]   But Benedict Evans,
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.800]   he has this argument all the time,
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.320]   people trying to say that Amazon's
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.200]   monopoly, and he says,
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.640]   "By any number, no way."
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.960]   But this is the concept of
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.360]   monopsony, which is hot right now.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.640]   The idea that you are a monopoly buyer,
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.880]   that by...
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:21.760]   And that's...
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.600]   Apple's right now in front of the Supreme Court,
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.840]   over this exact thing in the App Store.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.800]   If Apple has a monopsony in the App Store,
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.720]   that hurts everybody.
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.560]   So it is complicated.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.040]   You know what?
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.080]   You can't...
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.280]   The temptation is say,
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.720]   "Well, Google's just too big."
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.120]   And I think a lot of the complaint about big tech is just that
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.400]   they're, well, they're too successful.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.200]   They're just too big.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.040]   I would say no.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:45.600]   I would say...
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.960]   I think we need a demonstrate harm
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.560]   to really make that case.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.080]   There is a challenge,
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.920]   I think right now in demonstrating
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.840]   some of the harms inherent in this,
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.920]   because big tech...
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.920]   I think people say it's too big,
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.760]   because it's really complicated to explain.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:00.480]   If you're a journalist,
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.000]   you're like, "Ah, it's just too big."
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.960]   But there are potential harms of these companies
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.160]   having all of this data on someone, for example.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.280]   But that's pre-crime.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:13.840]   You can't...
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:17.040]   You can't prosecute a potential harm.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.160]   We can see that coming,
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.080]   and we can even see things happening today in terms of bias.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.960]   But a lot of that is so opaque.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.160]   We don't have the information.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:30.160]   Like, is Google selling my data to my health insurance company
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.040]   so they can make decisions on pricing?
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:36.080]   That's not something that I can see.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.080]   That's not something the market can see yet.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.560]   And we don't even know if it's happening, right?
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.680]   So this is where the government's looking at this and saying,
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.880]   "There is a risk..."
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.080]   And I think there's a legitimate risk in things being too big.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.560]   And in companies being too opaque.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.800]   But Stacey, that can come from small companies too.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.280]   There was a...
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:53.920]   It can!
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.360]   Clear view AI.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:55.920]   It just...
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.720]   Is it on the list?
[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:01.920]   There was a company that did security stuff that was selling people's data.
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.880]   Yes.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.280]   A vast...
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:03.840]   Is that a stock right?
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.800]   A vast...
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.600]   Yeah, a vast...
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.160]   A vast...
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.120]   A vast.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:07.280]   Right?
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:07.600]   A vast...
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:07.760]   A vast...
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:07.760]   A vast...
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:07.760]   A vast...
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:07.760]   A vast...
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.120]   A tiny company by comparison.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.560]   Pirates, they are.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.400]   Interesting name for a...
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.480]   Yeah, any piracy company, any virus company.
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.240]   But...
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.720]   So you don't have to be big to do that.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.360]   Right.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.080]   That is true.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.080]   And you can still be stopped from doing it because it's wrong in other ways.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.960]   So you don't need antitrust to protect.
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.320]   Bigness alone.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.840]   It's the weird thing about America.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.280]   We're up for the little guy.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.880]   We're up for growing, we're up for winning.
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.000]   Oh no, no, you won.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:36.560]   Now you're too big.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.440]   We're gonna catch you down to size.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.200]   No.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:39.680]   It's...
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.040]   Well, and we do that.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:41.520]   I mean, that's...
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.000]   Human nature.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.400]   We do it with Hollywood celebrities too.
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.920]   It's human nature.
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.680]   Look at regulation and deregulation.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.120]   Boop, boop, boop, boop.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:49.920]   And then...
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.680]   Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.160]   Thank you.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.040]   To...
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.160]   To quote Shakira.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.760]   Let's...
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:00.640]   Yeah, that's exactly how she sounded.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:04.320]   Let's take a little break.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.920]   I do want to talk about Clearview AI.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:08.880]   I want you to explain to me what's going on with that one.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:14.320]   And then, uh, Alphabet's jigsaw has an interesting new program
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.000]   that I think would be very useful if they let others use it.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.640]   But first a word from our sponsor.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.920]   Here's something very useful.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.440]   I use and I encourage you all to use Zapier.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.480]   Do you know about Zapier?
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.040]   Oh man.
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:30.880]   In IOT, you know, we know this whole idea of,
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.360]   boy, I would like my hue lights to come on
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.000]   when my...
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.800]   when weather.com says it's sunset in the city.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.800]   You need a little script to do that.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.720]   And really, the way those scripts work is by connecting services, right?
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.840]   That's what Zapier does.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.520]   In fact, Zapier connects 1500 plus apps,
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.000]   business apps, home automation apps,
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:59.360]   all the services I use make it so cool by automating your life.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.440]   Doing things you couldn't otherwise do.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.560]   And you don't have to be a developer.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.680]   You don't have to be a programmer.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.480]   It's really easy to do.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.920]   I should show you some of my Zapier.
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.880]   Even I can figure it out.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.000]   Do you use Zapier?
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:10.880]   I do use Zapier.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:14.240]   I want to, in effect, increasingly I'm looking for things
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:18.880]   that integrate with Zapier because I realize the value of the automations.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:22.320]   One of the things that makes Zapier unique is they do multi-step zaps.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.000]   So as an example, I use my news reader as an in-o reader.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.240]   That's got an integration on Zapier.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.240]   When I favorite an article in my news reader,
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:30.880]   that's all I have to do.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.000]   I put a star in it.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.640]   It automatically books marks the article on pinboarding.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.680]   And then, because it's a multi-step zap, I'm not done,
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.240]   it then posts it to Twitter.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.240]   I have a links for Twitter account.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.520]   So it tweets it out.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.320]   It then, because I'm not done, it has multi-step zaps.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:52.080]   It then puts it in a Google Drive spreadsheet for Carsten.
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.960]   So he can put the shows together and it formats it just right.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.160]   It works perfectly.
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.520]   I could choose which fields.
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.280]   It's just an amazing tool.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.880]   That's Zapier at work.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.560]   If you're in sales, imagine.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.760]   You make a deal.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.920]   You can engage your leads instantly.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.080]   You can automatically import new customers.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:11.840]   You can notify your team about opportunities
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.640]   and because Zapier integrates with all the CRM programs.
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.200]   We started using it because we use Salesforce.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.560]   Boom, it's a real reason to use Salesforce.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.200]   That's what I was saying.
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.320]   I mean, I look and I say, "Oh, good.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:23.200]   It works with Instagram.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:23.920]   Okay, good.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.400]   Oh, good.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.360]   It works with Google Sheets.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.000]   Okay, good.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.120]   WordPress, good."
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.680]   When you look at all the things it works with, it's huge.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.640]   It's huge.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.120]   It's huge.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:35.120]   You realize this is what I've been looking for.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.760]   Build the solution you need in minutes.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.000]   And the thing is, if you know it can be automated,
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.600]   take a couple of seconds.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.440]   You see any do that's my to-do list.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.040]   I love it that that integrates in.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:45.760]   It's so cool.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.040]   I don't have to manually add something to the to-do list.
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.040]   I can add it in a variety of different ways using Zapier.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.120]   No more doing things over and over again,
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.600]   just because I asked too much trouble to figure it out.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.600]   Zapier makes it easy.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.840]   If you go to Zapier, z-a-p-i-e-r.com/tweg,
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.360]   connect the apps you use the most.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.240]   Let Zapier take it from there.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.120]   No need for developers, no coding.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.080]   You can do it.
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   Four and a half million people use Zapier.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.040]   That's a huge number.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.960]   And I love this stat.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:24.560]   On average, each one of them saves 40 hours a month.
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:29.200]   An entire work week, 40 hours a month that Zapier's doing it,
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.160]   and you don't have to.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:34.640]   Make more time to grow your business, to have more fun,
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.800]   to turn your lights off and on at sunset.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.440]   Right now through the end of the month, try Zapier free.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.280]   For two whole weeks, go to zapier.com/tweg,
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:48.800]   z-a-p-i-e-r.com/tweg, free 14-day trial.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.760]   Such a great tool.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:53.040]   I'm really grateful Zapier exists.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.040]   Honestly, I am.
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.320]   There's a free forever plan.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.200]   There's a premium plan.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.680]   I have the, I think they call it the starter plan.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.720]   That gives me enough zaps, although I have to say,
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.520]   you should see the list of zaps.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.640]   It's getting longer all the time.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.800]   zapier.com/tweg.
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.480]   So tell me about this.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.400]   This story keeps getting thicker and scarier all the time.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.040]   Clearview.ai.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.640]   It's a Peter Thiel company.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:25.120]   Cells face recognition.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.640]   Yeah, right there, right?
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.360]   That's all I have to say.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:32.400]   It sells face recognition data to a lot of people,
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.600]   including law enforcement.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:41.040]   And it's a big story because they've been scraping data.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.920]   In fact, YouTube just said, "Knock it off, Clearview."
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.880]   They've been scraping data from Facebook, from Instagram,
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.040]   from Clearview, his "Kajmir Hills" article.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.280]   This kind of broke the story open,
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.320]   and it's just, it's been getting deeper and deeper and deeper.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:03.600]   They, they claim they're--
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:04.480]   What do you mean?
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.320]   They're databases three billion images,
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.680]   scraped from Facebook, YouTube, Venmo,
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:12.160]   millions of other websites.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.920]   It is bigger than anything the government has.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.320]   Isn't this what the LinkedIn decision enables?
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.720]   Yeah, that's interesting, isn't it?
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.800]   Did we talk about--
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.280]   Be careful.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.720]   We mentioned that.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.520]   Okay.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.520]   In the New York Times story about this kind of scraping.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.880]   But there's a lot of scraping going on and scraping,
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.840]   you know, from as a journal.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.960]   It could be so good.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.600]   Yes, as a journal--
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.800]   Our love is scraping.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.680]   We want scraping.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.280]   Take data, figure out what it means, add it all up.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.480]   It's good stuff.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.840]   Well, this is okay.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.480]   So here's where Jeff, you and I are about to diverge.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.280]   Yay, scraping.
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:45.680]   Oh, no.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.720]   Yay, taking data.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.120]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.320]   Stacy, Stacy, don't lose this magical moment.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.160]   Stacy.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.560]   Right now in America, we need to come together more,
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.440]   not diverge.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.600]   We need to make fun.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.200]   Come and grow, Stacy.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.800]   We're preventing you from doing crazy things with that data.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:08.880]   So a good law would be to prevent the police
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.040]   from using widespread non- like fishing expeditions,
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.000]   using facial recognition.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:14.640]   I have a suggestion.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.680]   We've talked about.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.120]   Wait, that's--
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.520]   No, that is something that Jeff is for.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.800]   Jeff is for--
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.480]   He's pulling an anti-poloist.
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.560]   I just had a job for the sake of doing it.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.400]   I had the paper here ready for this Stacy.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.360]   Yeah, this is for things that punish people who do things with technical--
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.320]   I agree, but--
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.560]   But I'm saying that facial--
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.520]   Don't stop it.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.080]   Here's a record of different.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:38.960]   --those around stopping facial recognition would be good here.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.320]   Stacy's going to stop police from doing any facial recognition.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.560]   I'm going to stop them from doing a bad facial recognition.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.120]   I'm going to stop them from doing without a warrant.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.560]   Oh, OK, we agree then.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.360]   How do you get a warrant if you search this so disquare?
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:51.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.160]   If I put a camera up and I'm searching for a felon walking down
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.840]   the street, when I'm going to serve a warrant
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.480]   and everybody walk down the street, you're in the public.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.120]   You have a right to privacy.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.640]   I'm-- the data is sitting there,
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.760]   but you can't access the data unless you have a warrant to get to it.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.320]   You can't just--
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.120]   And--
[00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:11.680]   --and the data.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.560]   That's what Stacy's saying.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.120]   You can--
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.800]   Yes, don't fish the data and want you to warrant.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.720]   --with a warrant without their permission.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.640]   So you say it'll be OK to turn--
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.400]   like the Metropolitan Police are doing in London,
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.280]   to turn on face recognition on the cameras.
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.120]   If you went to a judge and say, judge,
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.760]   we expect a criminal to walk through this intersection.
[00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.720]   Or we know one did.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:33.520]   We weren't trying to find it.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:33.760]   OK.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:34.320]   We're trying to find it.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.120]   You need to-- yeah, you need to define a time frame.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.040]   You need to define a locale.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:39.520]   And a goal.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:41.200]   And you need to get it-- yes, and the goal.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.920]   And you need to get a judge to say, yeah, that's cool.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.480]   The car--
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.760]   So to get a warrant, too, you have to show probable cause.
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.560]   So what you don't like is the fishing engine where you just--
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:51.120]   Right.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:53.280]   --let's watch everybody going up and down the street
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.840]   and see if we can find anything-- you know, get a bad guy.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.320]   Right.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:56.480]   Right.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.200]   You have to watch that.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:57.840]   They see scene.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.480]   But wait a minute.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.160]   Doesn't a police officer who's standing on the corner do that?
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.440]   I agree.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.520]   But the argument is that police officer,
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.920]   she doesn't scale the way they did do that.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.880]   Right.
[00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.480]   So the way-- no, let me get this straight,
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:11.920]   because I want to get your logic straight.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.720]   So the crime here is not the act.
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.160]   It's the fact that you scaled?
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.280]   Does the fear people have?
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.880]   Well, fear is different than the crime.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.080]   The fear that people have is if you have--
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.400]   well, in facial recognition is different than--
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.040]   are you talking about recognizing someone digitally
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.160]   who's committing a crime?
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:34.800]   Well, if a police officer is on a corner and happens to know,
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.440]   maybe she's read the mug book this in the morning--
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.160]   For sure.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.000]   --and she knows-- and she's keeping an eye out,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.680]   she recognizes you walking down the street,
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:42.960]   she said, hey, you, stop.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.760]   Right.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.800]   And arrest you, because you have a warrant--
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.360]   Well, OK.
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:48.240]   If you're someone who's an outstanding warrant,
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.760]   you are a person of interest, you have--
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.520]   But she didn't get a warrant first.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:54.080]   She didn't get a--
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.840]   She didn't get a warrant to search a database.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.240]   You're right.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.520]   No, she's just looking around the street,
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.800]   because you're in public.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.360]   So a chair--
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:32:59.600]   You're in public.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.160]   --are doing it.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:00.640]   That's the--
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:00.640]   That's the--
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.000]   --same thing.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.840]   So Leo, you're trying to get discord here.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.000]   I will agree with you, and I do agree with you,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.880]   that the doctrine of what is public is public
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.320]   would stop the Stacey doctrine.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.120]   But Stacey's been trying to get kind of a temporary
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   until we know what we're doing argument here.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.000]   And what I've objected to is this idea
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   you turn off all facial recognition
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.600]   and don't allow it from police.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.400]   I think that would be wrong.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.960]   You put strictures on their use of it.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.680]   I think that's--
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.720]   You can do that with any belief.
[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.960]   Turn it on with under training, but also limit the power
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.080]   of people that don't necessarily need all of that power.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:34.880]   You know?
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.440]   There's a--
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:35.840]   So there's a--
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.320]   There's a function.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:37.040]   --on the line there.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.000]   I think because it scales so much,
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.440]   and because our justice system is not exactly just,
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.600]   I think there's a big and important interest in saying,
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.400]   let's make police work a little harder
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.800]   and pick crimes that really matter
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.040]   to find these people.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.120]   Because it could be that, you know,
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.880]   I saw somebody shoplifting or like--
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.920]   somebody with shoplifting,
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.520]   and I have a good image of them.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.000]   I might go after that person simply because the image is
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.680]   higher quality.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:13.520]   I might go after them because I think that they look like
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.080]   they're not capable of defending themselves,
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.440]   so they'd be an easy grab.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:24.000]   There's a lot of decisions when you can apply things at scale that you can--
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.040]   So what about--
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.480]   What do you think of the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act?
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:36.880]   Facebook this couple of weeks ago got a half billion dollar fine
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:41.360]   for tagging suggestions on Facebook?
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.000]   You know, when you take a picture of Facebook,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.560]   this one you could say, this looks like this is--
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.040]   and in Illinois, that is apparently illegal.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.680]   And it's a public place.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.320]   You know, again, you don't put up things on Facebook to hide them.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:56.240]   That would be the worst thing on earth to do.
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.960]   Right, but people take pictures of you without your consent
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:02.400]   in private places, put them on Facebook, and then they're tagged.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.960]   Then the person you have a problem with
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.000]   is the one to put the photo up there,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.760]   not necessarily on Facebook under 230.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.720]   No, but this doesn't--
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.000]   This--
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.040]   I actually agree with this settlement.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.960]   I think the way that this is playing out--
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.200]   And I think these are important debates we need to have.
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.760]   I just think we should talk about them
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.080]   as opposed to having Facebook unilaterally decide for us.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:27.040]   I may have a problem with a person who took the picture
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.640]   and post-intagged it, but I also have a problem with Facebook
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.360]   that makes it visible and findable in a way that hasn't been--
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.800]   Okay, but let me give you another one.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.640]   I'm not well versed on Facebook,
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.480]   but it seems like if you were to tag me in an image,
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.840]   I would get a notification.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:46.320]   Should I have the ability to hit approve or not approve
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.760]   before it goes out?
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:48.480]   Now you do.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.040]   At beginnings, you didn't.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:51.280]   Okay.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:53.520]   And here's an opportunity to see it now.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.480]   So Ant is on a photo assignment for the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.200]   He takes pictures of people in crowds,
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.520]   puts the photos up for all the world to see.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.520]   We as journalists would not want anything to stop that.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:05.840]   Just do a job.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.680]   Right.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.600]   NBC, though, used to in their--
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.240]   standards and practices binder that they handed out to all of us.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.200]   Say--
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.880]   Sure, you studied religiously.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.240]   I did, because I was very fascinated by what they wouldn't allow us to do.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.520]   They said, "You got to get a release for every--
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.920]   even in public, for everybody you show in video."
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.240]   And by the way--
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:28.960]   It's--
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.960]   Well, that's the funny thing.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.880]   They said, "Well, what if his back is turned?"
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.360]   They said, "If his mother would recognize him,
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.240]   you have to get a release."
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.880]   Is that because you were entertainment?
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.680]   Not news?
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.720]   No, it's the news division.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.240]   No, even for news--
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.840]   Like, in the video, you can't show videos of people without a release form.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:46.320]   When you're--
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.200]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.000]   You can just very nervous lawyers at other companies--
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.480]   At legal, right.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.280]   Stop you from doing it.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:51.760]   But 20--
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:52.160]   For a few weeks--
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.240]   Even 20 years ago, this is 20 years ago,
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:56.960]   they didn't want you to do that.
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.240]   That's nervous corporate lawyers.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.280]   But I also--
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.320]   I also think that the--
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.040]   Again, we're going to--
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.160]   I'm going to go back to scale.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.800]   I think it's a lot more problematic to have facial recognition,
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.520]   saying that this photo of someone in this crowd,
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.600]   that's Stacey in annotating that for everyone to see,
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.480]   is very different than someone happening across that photo
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.560]   in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.040]   That's different.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:21.040]   That's different.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:21.520]   And seeing it.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.560]   This sounds so clinical.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:23.120]   I would also say that--
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.200]   A huge audience one day, not more.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.240]   I know.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.160]   But it doesn't have a global audience,
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.200]   and that audience isn't going to have access to that picture for the next two years.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.120]   So make it to New York Times or Life magazine.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.760]   So New York Times or Life, I would say,
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.640]   still not going to have searchable access to that for the next 50 years.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.040]   If you're looking for--
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.840]   Much larger audience than anything on Facebook.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:44.320]   It does.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:48.640]   But you can't find that by looking for me specifically.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.440]   Someone might happen across it.
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.280]   You're into an entirely new area here.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.320]   The law--
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.280]   I don't think addresses.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.120]   Now, this is your point that we don't discuss this.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:57.840]   But it's not--
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:58.320]   But it's not--
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.360]   It's not there now.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.560]   Right.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.200]   And I think there's--
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.320]   Stacey's address is what she's saying.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:08.080]   The big implications of having these searchable over the entire world forever,
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:19.360]   that Facebook is taking advantage in lots of companies are taking advantage of the fact that the current society doesn't really understand the implications.
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.160]   We're just starting to understand the implications of this.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.080]   But you can never escape.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.960]   I mean, in some ways, that's what do not track.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.720]   But that's a very clumsy way of doing it.
[00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:33.840]   And I think if we talked about it and figured this out for facial recognition,
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:41.520]   we have a better chance of crafting rules that would not force us to do something clumsy like do not track.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:45.840]   So Illinois is the only state.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.240]   Or do not search whatever you know what I'm talking about, right, Jeff?
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.760]   I think so.
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.480]   Yes.
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.440]   Texas has a biometric flaw, too.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:53.920]   Oh, OK.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.800]   Oh, Illinois is the only law that allows you to sue.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.320]   Oh, there you go.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:02.880]   So that's what this was.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:07.280]   This was a class action based on the Illinois law.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:13.200]   That release you're talking about from your former NBC days reminds me a lot of the stock
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:17.840]   photography sites that pretty much say the same thing when you're trying to approve.
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.080]   Not legally required, just prudent.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:23.360]   It's also like a polite thing to do.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:23.600]   Why?
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.200]   It's a polite thing.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:30.320]   I mean, as a journalist, I will say that sometimes, you know, you have to say, screw it.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.920]   I'm going to be a rude jerk because I am a journalist and I have a higher, you know,
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.000]   I have a duty, a higher duty, right?
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:43.360]   But for normal people and in cases where it's not a public interest, I think you should not be a jerk.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.480]   No, I agree.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.360]   Full stop.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:45.760]   Is it crazy?
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.640]   And also what about children?
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:48.880]   What about the children?
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.360]   No, sorry.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.880]   I'm like, do we have rules?
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.000]   And I don't know, protecting like imagery of...
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.040]   Miners?
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:55.520]   Miners?
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.920]   I've always seen...
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:58.400]   With...
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.520]   Well, if you're...
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.440]   I don't think there's rules.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.560]   If you're in a school, you know, as you said, you don't sign the releases,
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:05.920]   but that's because...
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.280]   That's a different purpose.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.160]   That's marketing purpose.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.320]   The school was to take pictures and put them out there on the website.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.680]   That is a marketing purpose.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.480]   Whatever image, if it's marketing, you may not use my image unless you have my permission.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.520]   Right.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.640]   That's different from news.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.880]   That my daughter was in the news.
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.000]   That's what my boys former school did.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.120]   And that's also, again, what the stock photography sites will tell you is,
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:37.760]   once you have people that are under 18, we urge you to get a form signed by their,
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.360]   you know, guardian or what have you, because this is still marketing material
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.520]   that you're trying to produce for whatever content created out there with your art.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.000]   As I wrote in public parts,
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.520]   book, no one bought because it was optimistic.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.360]   Because I gave it to you.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.960]   Oh, but that is true.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.920]   I would have bought it.
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:58.880]   I didn't buy it.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.760]   I gave it to you.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.640]   You said it could have given him away, Jeff.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.280]   That's rule one, two, three and four.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:14.400]   It started with a case of a woman's face being on the side of a flower barrel
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.640]   as an advertisement, and she did not give her permission for that.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:25.040]   And so this, this doctrine of privacy starts from the marketing use of the right you have to your image.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:30.800]   But that's superseded by the right to report on what's public.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.240]   And that's different.
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.200]   Depends upon the use.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:38.800]   And correct me if I'm wrong, but it is absolutely the case in the United States.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:41.520]   You do not have any expectation of privacy in public.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.200]   Somebody can take your picture.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:43.840]   No, you don't.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:50.960]   That's why upskirt photos were legal in so many places and still the laws.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:57.040]   Well, I do note that it says within legal community standards, you can't.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.920]   There are some restrictions on how far you can go with that.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.040]   But anyway, that may vary per by.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.480]   Sure.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.800]   Can I ask a weird question?
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.360]   Oh, please.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:15.920]   Oh, boy.
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:16.320]   Can't wait.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.360]   Well, I was in the bookstore today.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.400]   No, it's not that we were doing it.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.360]   Don't worry.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:24.400]   I was in the bookstore today, and I saw a book called the mysterious affair at Olivetti.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:29.920]   IBM, the CIA and the Cold War conspiracy to shut down production of the world's first desktop computer.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.560]   I remember that, Olivetti.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:32.960]   That was a.
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.720]   Do you remember that that was a case though?
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.320]   I don't remember the case.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.560]   More than a decade before the Osborne one Apple one,
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:47.360]   Olivetti had a personal computer who says this New Yorker author named Merrill Seacrest.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.520]   I had never heard of this.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.000]   This is.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.640]   Were they up against the Selectrix?
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.520]   This is amazing.
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.120]   Well, it's a boycott Amazon.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.040]   I don't know if this is the one they're talking about.
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:01.520]   I guess.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.040]   No, this is a desktop computer.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:03.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:04.800]   So, apparently, Olivetti was.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.840]   We know it was a typewriter company, but they actually.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.800]   Yeah, they actually were in computers.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.600]   Never heard of them.
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.840]   Oh, I always wanted an Olivetti manual typewriter.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.120]   They were gorgeous.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.320]   It's the only move to Underwood.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.480]   Somebody was killed in a suspicious crash.
[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.320]   It's I just I thought this is good.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:24.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.440]   Say no more.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.040]   Let's make a podcast out of it.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:30.720]   The mysterious case of the Olivetti computer.
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.360]   I think we.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:32.720]   Next.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.000]   I got to read the book now, but yeah.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.320]   People are complaining in the Amazon reviews that no,
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.280]   I don't know the Amazon had the 6100 up to 5100.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.400]   It's all the I don't know.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.480]   The mysterious affair.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.880]   You know, I just I just thought maybe you'd know this grandpa.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:45.760]   No, grandpa.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.040]   Remember then.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.800]   Oh, wow.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.000]   The Corbusier Corbusier.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.440]   Yeah, they had beautiful designs.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.400]   Yeah, offices.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.680]   Yeah, design their offices.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:56.160]   Wow.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.240]   It's Italian, of course.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.320]   Yeah, it's going to be beautiful.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.720]   Merrill Seacrest wrote this the mysterious affair at Olivetti.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.920]   I just got back from the bookstore and I thought that was fascinating.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.200]   I did you buy the book?
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.960]   No, I'm going to buy it on.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:11.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.040]   Call Merrill and get it to give it to him for free.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:16.640]   Hello, I'm a fellow author.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.480]   Nobody buys my book, so I don't want to buy yours.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:21.680]   Mind.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.120]   Just give it to me.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.680]   They made laptops, you guys.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.040]   No, no, I remember the early, the early, the Olivetti laptops.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.440]   They were they were elegant.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.720]   I don't know anybody who had one.
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.160]   No.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:34.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.080]   Well, because of the conspiracy.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.680]   Yeah, they could spear see against them.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:47.360]   So this jig, jigsaw, which is alphabet, that's one of their moonshots.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.800]   That's their, that's a do good.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.520]   No, no, no, it's not.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:50.560]   Oh, it's the do good or one.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.920]   Instead, it's a do good or one.
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.920]   This is we have to worry about the state of the information.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.840]   I interviewed the director of it on the late limited triangulation.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.160]   Right.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.960]   The company owned by Google's parent has introduced a free tool.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:07.200]   It calls assembler that can detect, you might be interested in this.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:10.720]   And whether an image has been manipulated.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:17.920]   A doctored phony image of President Obama shaking hands with President Hassan Rouhani of Iran.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.120]   Remember that?
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.640]   President tweeted that out.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:24.160]   A real photograph of a Muslim girl at a desktop doing her homework
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.680]   with Donald J. Trump looming in the background, which is real.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.400]   Well, apparently this, this program assembler
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:40.800]   it jig saw tested it with more than a dozen news and facts checking organizations around the world.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.920]   Including on the model, Politico in Mexico,
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:48.960]   Raplere in the Philippines, Rappler and Asians, France, press.
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.120]   It does not plan to offer the tool to the public.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:53.760]   I wonder what it is.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.160]   Adobe is also working on the same technology.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:56.960]   Yeah, good point.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.040]   So we were talking about this the other day.
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:06.240]   You said that you can kind of tell because pixels be distorted or stretching out the pixels.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:10.000]   Or things just don't match up, right?
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.160]   If you look at if you pickle people, you can kind of tell.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:17.200]   And this can also be used for deep fakes.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:21.280]   I assume that's what it's built for, right?
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.400]   Well, there's deep fakes and then there's shallow fakes.
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:24.880]   I don't know.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.720]   Deep fakes.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.640]   I always think of deep fakes as video.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.800]   But there's plenty of modified still images as well.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.480]   If we figured out Photoshop, I mean, Photoshop,
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:41.360]   I remember scaring editors to death at the Daily News when I was doing crude Photoshop.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.360]   It's saying, this is what you can do.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.240]   Here's a question.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:55.040]   So there was a picture of Ben Carson sitting on a plane, I guess, back from somewhere, Iowa.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.680]   Everybody with their red mega hats on.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.520]   And I'll put it on the one.
[00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:02.320]   Was that a fake?
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:03.120]   I saw that picture.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:03.840]   That's the question.
[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.360]   People were asking, is this a fake?
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:05.920]   It's got to be.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:10.160]   People were shocked if it doesn't make sense that they would have been wearing those hats.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.520]   No, no, no, it wasn't.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:14.320]   But someone could easily craft that.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.280]   That's more of a house.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.480]   Because someone could easily craft it.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.440]   It's like that.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.800]   Where's the you put the link where?
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.360]   Where did you put it?
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.280]   I put it in the in the rundown chat.
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.360]   The rundown chat.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:26.320]   So he looks like he's photoshopped in there.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.520]   So people were guessing that he was photoshopped,
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.440]   just like we put an African-American on this plane.
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:35.840]   See, that already sits.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.200]   Totally phony looking.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.800]   That totally looks phony.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   I don't know, he could just be sitting on someone's lap.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.720]   He was sitting in first class.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:46.320]   Oh, yeah, he was in first class, of course.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:51.120]   But again, all of this stuff, you have to look at it really, really close.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:55.840]   And not just jump on the bandwagon with whatever everybody's saying.
[00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.720]   Because in our Christmas card, we photoshopped two people in.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.880]   And everybody says I was photoshopped in.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:01.600]   You were there.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.000]   Did you get photoshopped in?
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.640]   No.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.240]   Literally, the people who were photoshopped look real.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:09.600]   And the people who weren't didn't.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:09.920]   All right.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.640]   So you can't always just look at it.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.600]   This guy's neck doesn't match his collar.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.200]   The whole thing's made up.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.160]   It's beautiful.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.160]   Deezing.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.040]   It's just joking.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.120]   I'm joking with you.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:25.680]   What?
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:26.240]   What?
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.200]   No, this guy right here.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:28.000]   Does that look normal?
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.520]   Which one?
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.080]   Which one?
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.520]   This guy, I don't know how to zoom.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.080]   I need a photoshopped zoom.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:34.880]   Let's look.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.600]   Control plus.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:38.240]   There we go.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.040]   That guy.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:39.920]   It's not his head.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:41.680]   That's his head.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.120]   Somebody else's head on a body.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.720]   I'm just making it up.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.200]   I don't know.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:45.680]   I don't know.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:46.880]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:47.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.240]   And this guy's hat.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.440]   That's clearly the wrong thing.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.800]   He's got the D-side and three shirts though.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.160]   The wrong size hat.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.120]   It's a wrong size hat.
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.040]   That's a sticker on his head.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.160]   It's a sticker.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.000]   That is the wrong size hat.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.680]   He does have a large head.
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.520]   The girl behind him is wearing his hat.
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:02.560]   Oh, they just swap.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:03.920]   Oh, she swapped his.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.560]   She swapped.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.600]   That was clearly a bad shot.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.840]   I don't think Ben Carson is in this photo.
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:10.720]   I mean, I really don't.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:12.720]   That does look very phony.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.680]   But that's what we're doing.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:15.440]   It looks like a bad photo shot.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.120]   People are asking this question now.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:17.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:18.240]   Now you do.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:18.720]   That's OK.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:19.760]   It's all right.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.400]   I'm going to wait a minute.
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.840]   Let me pull up the Christmas card.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.920]   The Christmas card is pretty funny.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.240]   I don't know how many times I got asked about that.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.920]   They thought they thought you weren't.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.680]   Yeah, it was like, did you get photoshopped in?
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:31.120]   I was like, no.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:31.920]   I was there.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.080]   You're hanging.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.440]   I mean, I got the Christmas card.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:36.480]   I didn't think I noticed you.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.720]   Your hand is as big as everybody's head.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.640]   I'm like, well, I'm sorry.
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.880]   I know you look like you were there.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.440]   But this guy here, he doesn't look real.
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.120]   He's real.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:49.360]   Who was photoshopped in?
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:50.320]   Can you figure it out?
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.560]   On the left side.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.320]   Right there.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:54.640]   Yes.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.440]   Who?
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:56.160]   Right there.
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.600]   This girl in the elf hat?
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.400]   No, to the left.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:58.880]   Masaka.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:49:59.360]   Masaka.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.640]   Yeah, she was photoshopped in your right.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.440]   She was photoshopped in.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:01.600]   Yes.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.360]   You're good.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.560]   Oh.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:05.840]   There you go.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.720]   Patrick was definitely photoshopped in.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.240]   I don't think that counts as photoshopping.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.840]   He's not a tablet or a computer scruggling.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.800]   Was I going to take the photo?
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:15.760]   Was that why she had to be a photo?
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.200]   Yeah, there were two people who weren't here.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:19.120]   I think my son wasn't here either.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.400]   I think he's photoshopped as well.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.520]   And Hank was photoshopped in.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.280]   That was-- did you do this, Jerry?
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.640]   You did it.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.200]   He runs.
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:27.760]   He runs.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.240]   He's running.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.120]   He did a good job.
[00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:29.520]   He's the studio.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:30.800]   But I swear to God, Bill,
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.200]   it definitely looks like he was photoshopped in,
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:33.920]   and he was not.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:37.440]   So anyway, it's a good card.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:38.160]   It was a great card.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.520]   You looked like you belong there.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.840]   I thought so, but the only--
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.520]   Yeah, more people started looking at it
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:44.560]   and mentioning it to me.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:47.200]   I'm like, well, maybe I do look giant size in this.
[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:47.680]   I don't know why.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.800]   Well, that's how big you are.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.440]   You are.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:50.720]   You are that big.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.760]   That's how big you are.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.640]   All right.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.360]   So funny.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.600]   Let's say, what do you want to do next?
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.960]   You want to talk about something?
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:01.840]   You want to do a break?
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.360]   What do you want to do next?
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.600]   Let's do a break.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.080]   Break.
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:07.040]   Say it's Mr. Bundy.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.800]   Bondi.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.840]   Stay your director.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:10.800]   Bondi wants to do a break.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:11.840]   We'll also do a break.
[00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:12.320]   Yeah, we can have a--
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.360]   We'll also do a few more stories,
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.240]   and we'll do a break.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.360]   I want to hear what you understand.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.400]   We were going to listen to Carson.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.360]   We were going to listen to Carson.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.320]   Casey, go ahead.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:20.000]   No, we're never going to listen to Carson.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.000]   He's photoshopped in.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.200]   He doesn't even-- he's not even here.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.200]   He's not even looking at the camera.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.680]   How about this guy who put 99 Android phones
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.600]   in a little red wagon?
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.480]   He's not so much.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:34.800]   And pulled it around the street.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.120]   I'm so proud of him.
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:39.760]   To make Google Maps say there's a traffic jam here,
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.760]   even though there's nobody there.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.360]   And in fact--
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:43.920]   That's awesome.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:44.000]   That's awesome.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.480]   I've already started collecting phones.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:48.320]   You're going to do it?
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.760]   My sons want to.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:50.800]   It's a great idea.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.640]   These phones are all running Google Maps.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.280]   That's awesome.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.120]   Came in the system.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.240]   He's a performance artist.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.200]   It's not-- it wasn't--
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.920]   Google said, well, we haven't--
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.560]   We have figured out how to tell a car from bicyclists,
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.240]   but not yet a little red wagon.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:07.760]   It was a clever idea.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.480]   It was very clever.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.160]   I know those streets too.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.280]   Those are busy--
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:12.080]   I know those streets well.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:12.880]   I walk--
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:13.920]   Well, so that's the question.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.360]   There's nobody on these streets.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.720]   Is it because people are avoiding them?
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:17.440]   Because they have a traffic jam.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:18.880]   Well, what were the upper left of that picture?
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:19.840]   That one right there?
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:21.440]   That's not a very busy street oddly.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.800]   It's behind--
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.520]   Ordered and Lended.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.840]   But I think--
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:28.720]   But yeah, the one on the right is busy.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.920]   One of the things that if a car went by
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:35.760]   while he was pulling the wagon at normal speed,
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:38.000]   the map would instantly revert to green saying,
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.360]   oh, there's no traffic jam here.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:39.840]   Of course.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.400]   So they really were trying to figure out
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.080]   whether this--
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.280]   So basically, he can bring--
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.240]   Effort.
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.880]   I appreciate the thinking behind it.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:52.960]   I mean, basically, artists and hackers
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.400]   are the people you should look to
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.320]   to figure out how things can be gained.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.360]   To break stuff.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:00.640]   And it's very fun.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.520]   It's smart.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.280]   And if you did this in a car,
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.640]   would it make much of a difference?
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.320]   That'd be kind of the next fun thing to do.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:08.800]   Oh.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.000]   Now we'll try it because of Mount Bower versus walking.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:12.560]   It's--
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.440]   He said--
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.080]   That's interesting.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:17.120]   Then you give yourself a good commute.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:19.440]   Possibly.
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:19.920]   I don't know.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:21.200]   That's the question.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:22.160]   Oh.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:22.560]   So--
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:23.360]   So--
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.720]   Waze Cheaters.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:25.280]   Oh.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.160]   But you would have to--
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.800]   No, because it would actually limit you to exactly how fast
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.440]   you're driving.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.000]   You'd have to take--
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   All right.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.080]   So you'd need to hire somebody ahead--
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:35.200]   If you're really rich, if you're Michael Bloomberg,
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.040]   you hire someone five minutes ahead of you.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.360]   Maybe two minutes.
[00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:40.160]   But they wouldn't stay--
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:41.040]   Well, but then you catch up.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.240]   --by the head of the--
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.320]   Yeah, this is-- this is--
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:45.840]   This is like one of those math problems.
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:46.880]   If you're both--
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.480]   Well, the other problem I've wondered about is--
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.040]   So let's say that--
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:49.440]   --it's extremely--
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.640]   --even Pennsylvania.
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.440]   Exactly.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.320]   At the same time.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.280]   Like, everyone uses Waze.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:57.600]   Let's say we reach that-- that Nirvana.
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.280]   Everybody uses Waze.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:02.240]   Then Waze can't direct everybody the same place
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.240]   because Waze will create traffic jams.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.680]   I just read a paper on this--
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:08.560]   On mathematician solving traffic jams.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.920]   In one of the things--
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:10.400]   Yeah, I know.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.360]   This is so hard.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.560]   One of the things they recommend,
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.120]   they actually say that if everyone gets on the same--
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.720]   --platform, then traffic--
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.360]   --the transportation engineers in cities
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:25.200]   can actually help people by directing them
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:27.920]   properly in real time.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:30.400]   Don't you-- I would assume Google's smart
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.720]   that Waze and Google Maps are already doing this.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.120]   They don't take 5,000 people say,
[00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:37.360]   "Oh, all of you go down that side street."
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.040]   They must distribute--
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:39.520]   I thought--
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:40.960]   If they were an evil company,
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:42.320]   they would sell priority.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.920]   But I thought in the Googleverse,
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.440]   there were siloed.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.840]   Waze is one thing and Google Maps is another thing.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.320]   Oh, no.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.120]   I think Waze did.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:51.760]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.960]   I thought Waze--
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.960]   Google Maps uses Waze data now.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:55.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.720]   I thought there was still siloed.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.400]   I presume that they share that to Waze.
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:01.040]   You can report stuff now on Google Maps.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.640]   I like Google Maps.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:03.600]   I like Google Maps.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.480]   I like Google Maps.
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:06.400]   I've never been on the Waze.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.600]   Talk about a snake who--
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:12.880]   Google Photos sent strangers' videos to other people in--
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.080]   Oh, it's a man.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:14.880]   It's so bad.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.440]   If you're doing a takeout of your data,
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.040]   then the only reason we know is Google actually sent out emails.
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:24.960]   Saying, "We're notifying people about a bug that may have affected users
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.800]   who used Google Takeout to import-- export their Google Photos
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.360]   between November 21st and 25th.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.560]   These users may have received either an incomplete archive
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:35.760]   or videos--
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:36.240]   What's the name?
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.920]   --not photos that were not theirs.
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.560]   We recommend--
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.360]   My bad.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:43.680]   You delete the prior export at this time.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:46.880]   Yeah, that's not a good thing.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:47.920]   It's a bug.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.800]   It sounds like the streams got crossed.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:55.760]   Somebody-- you got somebody, somebody got yours.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.440]   When I'm thinking about it, from a relational database standpoint--
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.120]   Yeah, you could see how that would happen.
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.200]   But not a good thing.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.400]   Right.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.760]   When you realize the data behind it could be really anything.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:11.440]   But you know what?
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.240]   This is a little wake-up call for people who are putting
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.400]   compromising photos on the internet.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:16.800]   That's right.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:17.280]   Yes, who wants--
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.680]   Who puts compromising photos in the cloud?
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.320]   No comments.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.520]   No, nobody anymore.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:22.000]   No comment.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.400]   I stopped.
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:28.160]   No, it's foolish thing to do.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:28.560]   Anything.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:32.320]   Nice work, Mr. Kim.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:35.840]   Anything you post on the internet, you should--
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:37.840]   What was the rule that I used to say?
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.760]   You should post anything on the internet.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.320]   Well, or you wouldn't want your grandma to see.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:42.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:45.360]   Of course, I have a pretty happy grandma.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:49.760]   But no, I mean, that could always happen.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.760]   That's a-- you know, it's happened in other cases.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:56.080]   Remember, private photos on Facebook were made public by accident,
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.080]   including those of Mr. Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:00.160]   The boss.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:00.800]   The boss.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:06.160]   I wonder what Mobile World Congress is going to be like this year.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:09.360]   Already, LG has said we're not going because of the coronavirus.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:12.560]   ZTE is going.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.960]   They're going, but we won't have a press conference, right?
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:15.920]   Right.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:21.360]   And the steps they're taking, they actually are quarantining anyone who plans to go.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:24.720]   They're quarantining for two weeks before the event,
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.160]   so they know they're not sick.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.200]   Well, good for them.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:29.520]   They're trying to protect attendees.
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:33.040]   You know, I was thinking, Ant, there but for the grace of God,
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:37.040]   if the coronavirus had started spreading two weeks, three weeks earlier,
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:39.840]   CES was full of--
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:40.640]   It could have been a mess.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:41.680]   --Chinese companies.
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:42.240]   Oh, right.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.120]   It could have been a mess.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:45.040]   I mean, I noticed it myself.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:47.040]   I said, boy, you know, we're going to have a hard time
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:50.560]   if we shut China out of the US economy,
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:53.760]   because half the stuff at CES was from Chinese companies.
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:53.920]   China.
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.360]   And suppliers for all the rest.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:56.320]   Yep.
[00:57:56.320 --> 00:58:02.400]   And imagine if it could have been a disaster, 180,000, 200,000 people.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.680]   200,000 minimum.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:08.320]   In a small, tight space, all shaking hands and coronavirus.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.600]   So we're lucky it didn't break out.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:11.840]   I've got a conference coming up in Singapore.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.360]   I asked my doctor, would you go?
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.480]   He said, ooh, ooh.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.120]   Oh, really?
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.960]   He said, no.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.760]   I have a--
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.680]   He said, you know, it's overblown versus the flu,
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.440]   but he said, my fear is you won't get back in.
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.320]   Oh.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:23.280]   OK.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:25.040]   Especially being stuck on a cruise ship for two weeks.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:27.040]   He's not worried about you getting sick.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.240]   He's worried-- yeah, I don't mind.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:28.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.840]   I'd be bored here.
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.240]   There we go.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:30.960]   He said, win.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:31.920]   It's a C-day.
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:32.880]   I love it.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.600]   He said, win.
[00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.840]   In this case, he stands for coronavirus.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:44.160]   I have a conference in San Jose in a couple of weeks.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:47.120]   And they actually sent out an email saying, hey, look,
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   it's a tiny machine learning conference,
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.280]   so tiny ML conference.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:50.760]   Thanks.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:53.240]   They said, I don't have things saying, hey,
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:56.480]   if you've been in mainland China, just don't come.
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:57.000]   Wow.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.320]   And they'll give you a full refund,
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.160]   but they--
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.160]   Wow.
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.040]   That's interesting.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.240]   Good on them.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.240]   Well, it feels like it's overblown.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:05.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:06.520]   I mean, I don't--
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.520]   It is.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.720]   But who wants to be--
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:10.920]   I know, yeah.
[00:59:10.920 --> 00:59:17.240]   14-day incubation and not necessarily with symptoms.
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:19.280]   Well, it is overblown in the sense
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:21.840]   like the death rates aren't incredibly high,
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.120]   but apparently so far--
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.640]   and there's a lot we don't know,
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:28.440]   but the hospitalization rates are pretty high.
[00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:31.760]   So even if you don't die, the fact
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.840]   that you're ill enough to have to go to the hospital,
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:36.560]   I think they're looking at a quarter of the patients
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.960]   have need critical care.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:44.600]   So if you imagine 25% of everyone who gets this disease
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:48.080]   having to have care in a hospital, that's pretty big.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.040]   That's serious.
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.600]   We had a case in San Jose, just down the road a piece.
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.440]   Really?
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:59.000]   Yeah, but again, the flu is much more fatal.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.920]   Well, why number is because it's lighter spread.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.360]   Oh.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.280]   And we also don't know.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.120]   We don't know.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:08.440]   I understand that the mystery is part of it.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.520]   And also the threat that it could mutate and become
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:11.920]   more--
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:12.800]   Something deadly.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.040]   --or easier.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.920]   I don't-- I mean, I'm not running around shaking people's
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.360]   hands.
[01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.040]   Fist bump.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.080]   That's just because you're mean.
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.520]   That's what we do.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.120]   Well, fist bumps just--
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:25.560]   You got it.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:25.720]   Elbow bump.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.480]   That's what the doctor did to me.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:28.480]   No, doctor, you should go ask.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:28.960]   You should go ask.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.360]   You should fix my hand.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.120]   No, doctor did fist bump.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.200]   I think that's OK.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.000]   Your knuckles aren't contaminated.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   Are they contaminated?
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.280]   My knuckles aren't contaminated.
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.800]   I use them to touch everything.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.640]   I'm like, Elbows?
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:41.680]   So Henry's in Asia.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.360]   My son's in Asia right now.
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.360]   And his mother and I went back and forth, sending him text
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:47.680]   messages and saying, wash your hands.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.880]   Don't touch any surfaces.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:50.240]   The masks aren't that useful.
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.680]   But definitely don't go on a train.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.520]   And if you do, make sure you wipe everything down first.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.840]   And I finally said, and whatever you do,
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.800]   don't go on any live animal markets.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:00.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.520]   Stay away from birds.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.320]   That would be the one thing.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:07.080]   If you were a podcast network with revenue of $16 million
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:15.040]   and 90 employees, would Spotify buy you?
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.000]   They bought the ringer.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:16.440]   Sounds like it.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.400]   Bill Simmons.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:17.960]   Nice job.
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.080]   Bill's a very nice, talented, extraordinarily
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:23.320]   successful podcaster.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.400]   Spotify just bought him.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.280]   The fourth podcast deal in the past year.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:28.840]   The ringer.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.120]   We don't know what the amount is.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:34.480]   But given that he spent $230 million on Gimlet,
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.000]   it's going to be a big deal.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:36.480]   It's going to be a--
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.280]   Hey, Spotify, you want geeks?
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.120]   Go through smart.
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:39.600]   They've got--
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.040]   No, you know what?
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.040]   Waste money on things.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:41.960]   No, waste money.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:42.720]   You know what?
[01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:43.840]   They don't want us.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.160]   They don't want us.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.160]   Too smart?
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:47.560]   I don't know.
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:51.280]   And Bill Simmons' company is dependent upon him.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.600]   I called Daniel Eck and said, Daniel, dude.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.120]   He said no.
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.560]   You're Leo, you are I don't like you.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:01:59.640]   I don't mind you.
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.160]   We were one of the first podcast networks to be on Spotify.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.800]   We were part of the big launch.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.520]   That's right.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.720]   I was too.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.080]   I forgot about that.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.360]   They didn't buy you either, huh?
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.240]   They didn't buy me either.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.800]   That's OK.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:14.920]   I haven't been for sale, technically.
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:15.840]   I feel like I need--
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.000]   I feel like I feel all for sale very--
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.360]   Well, no, I feel like the ringer, they have people
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:24.440]   who talk to other people who put lots in people's ears.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.600]   Yeah, no, they were out there, I'm sure.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.600]   And they do-- they branch out from sports.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.760]   They do more culture stuff.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.720]   I think they're very good.
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.520]   They have 30 titles, NBA chat show.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.640]   They do one where they rewatch all movies together,
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.760]   which is pretty funny.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.200]   Daniel Eck said, we're basically with ringer,
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:44.240]   we're basically getting the new ESPN, which I think
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:47.400]   is a very good and smart take on that.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.520]   In the future, is ESPN going to be on cable?
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.000]   No.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:50.520]   No.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.720]   It's going to be on the internet, right?
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.240]   That's it.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.800]   Just available wherever you can get it.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.280]   Next ESPN is not going to be on cable television.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.520]   All right, so good for you, Bill.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:03.400]   Nice job.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.800]   Damn it.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:06.040]   He's sensitive.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.040]   Damn it.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:08.400]   I want to be law.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.480]   I just want 100 million.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:13.080]   No, no, I don't want to love 100 million.
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.080]   You can hate me, I don't care.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.400]   Google is shutting down all its China offices
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.480]   due to the coronavirus.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.920]   Apple's already shut down a few of its stores.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.080]   There's a real concern about products made in China.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.320]   There was already a slowdown.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.320]   In our world.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.320]   Which is everything.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.560]   There was already a slowdown because of the Lunar New Year.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.280]   And now that's been extended.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.440]   Yeah, I'm trying to find some Kickstarter people who are--
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.080]   because I guarantee you, those people
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.240]   are going to have the--
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.120]   they'll feel it first, right?
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:43.040]   They feel it when the Lunar New Year happens.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:47.960]   Oh, man.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.120]   Well, I just stay well, everybody.
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.600]   You can't get a shot.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.200]   All right, so apparently it's--
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.200]   You had your flu shots, though, for the real flu?
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:55.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.920]   I always get my flu shot.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.600]   But apparently this time it's not as good as shot.
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.760]   It's not that great, no.
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:00.760]   I never done them.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.640]   What?
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.640]   What?
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:03.680]   You don't want the flu.
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.480]   Ask me.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:04.840]   Really?
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:05.440]   You don't want it.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.440]   You want it to get shot.
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.640]   I've gotten the flu in the past.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.840]   You think you've gotten the flu.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.240]   I think you haven't done this.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:13.560]   You've had gastroenteritis.
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:14.200]   Seriously.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.440]   That's the problem.
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.120]   People call that the flu.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.000]   The stomach flu.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.720]   You're throwing up.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:20.280]   That's a--
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.640]   An adad.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:22.840]   Oh, you didn't have that?
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.400]   Yeah, it was a congestion in the lungs.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.720]   You couldn't breathe.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.520]   And I've had sun years.
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.760]   You didn't want to get up out of this.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.000]   Everyone I'm just different, Ant.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.640]   I can only remember having a flu maybe twice.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.360]   I don't think I've ever had the flu.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:33.840]   That's the same.
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:34.880]   I've had the flu.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.440]   You've had the flu.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:39.280]   The flu, I got it at CES in 2015?
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.360]   Yeah, it's CES.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.280]   And that's when I got it.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.000]   And CES.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.080]   You had the same flu.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:45.600]   Well, Leo, I think you're my age, right?
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:46.480]   Yep.
[01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:49.480]   So you and I have to get the Mondo shot.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:50.880]   Mondo?
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.800]   Yeah, we get to the old folks get the double shot.
[01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:53.800]   Oh, man.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.300]   Oh.
[01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:54.800]   Really?
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.240]   I don't think-- well, I got mine in October.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.880]   When did the double shot start?
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.880]   No, it's been as soon as you turned 16 November.
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.640]   Oh, I'm not 65 yet.
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.140]   OK.
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:03.160]   Oh.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.160]   I have a couple of years left.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.720]   I thought you were going to say something like,
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.560]   we had to get the polio vaccine.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.560]   We did.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.520]   Got it right here, baby.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.400]   Did.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.000]   I remember vividly in grade school getting the polio.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.840]   I got it in sugar cube.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:16.860]   Wow.
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:17.360]   That's right.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:18.760]   I just like it the polio vaccine.
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:19.200]   Oh, that's right.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.760]   This was the smallpox one.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.260]   Yeah.
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:22.680]   One of your shoulder smallpox.
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:23.180]   Yeah.
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.840]   I didn't get that either.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.240]   Yeah, we got sugar cubes.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:26.760]   That was fun.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:27.760]   We all went down to the gym.
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:28.280]   You line up.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.400]   They give you a little--
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:30.000]   They see cub--
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.520]   There are still people in iron lungs.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.040]   Oh, it's so sad and soft.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:39.160]   Wait, is polio part of some of the childhood vaccines?
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.160]   MMR?
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:40.680]   Do you--
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:40.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.800]   It's been irradiated.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.800]   It has been irradicated.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.360]   There is no--
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:45.840]   Oh, I know it.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:46.840]   --the part of it.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.720]   There's a chickenpox vaccine.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.840]   And I wish I had gotten that.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:51.360]   So I would never get chickenpox.
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:54.720]   And then later, shingles, because shingles are awful.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:57.640]   I got into chickenpox, but I also had shingles once.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:58.640]   Oh, I hear it, sir.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.560]   It was the worst.
[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:01.080]   You both had shingles?
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:01.840]   I've never had shingles.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:02.760]   No, I mean either.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.120]   I still suffer from it.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:08.120]   There's an issue with one of the nerves in my pecs.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.040]   In real now.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.760]   Every now and then, you'll notice I'll just--
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.280]   Do that thing where you make it out.
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.120]   I'll just sort it out.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.720]   I was like, does it twitch?
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.560]   Do that thing.
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.040]   You just make it jump.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.320]   You go back and forth.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:20.280]   Do that.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:20.800]   Come on.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.800]   You know you can.
[01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:22.800]   There we go.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:24.240]   Oh my god, he can.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.680]   Oh my god.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.680]   Ooh.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.680]   What is this?
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.680]   What is this?
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:29.680]   Let's take a break.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.680]   All right, please.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.680]   I put off Carson long enough.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:33.680]   Thank you.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.320]   You're going to give a chance for the ladies in the audience
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:36.600]   to take a couple of them.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.800]   I'm getting the vapors.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.080]   My goodness.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.800]   I had no idea.
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.800]   Just take a break.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:46.640]   You were so dead, go.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.440]   Our show today brought to you.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.800]   Carson's yelling at me now.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:54.120]   He's yelling at me.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:57.560]   Ant is the reason we have this advertising.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:00.920]   Because if ant goes to get life insurance, it's happened to you.
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:04.400]   They say what's your BMI, your body mass index.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.400]   And you'd say whatever it is, 30, 32.
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.400]   It's always way higher.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:08.400]   Hire not.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.400]   It's up there.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:10.920]   And they go, my god, you must be morbidly obese.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.920]   Is ant morbidly obese?
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.960]   No, he can make his best pants.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.600]   He is buff.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.320]   My BMI is like 40 something.
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:20.320]   Is it really?
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.240]   Wow.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:25.880]   So that's the problem, is that you are to many insurance, life insurance companies,
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:26.880]   just a number.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.360]   And if they don't understand the context of that number,
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.840]   they're not going to give you great life insurance.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:37.680]   Health IQ is the life insurance agency, the concierge life insurance agency for you.
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.120]   If you are healthy, if you're doing everything right for your health today,
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.880]   you're exercising-- you exercise more than four times a week?
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.400]   Yes, sir.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.480]   So do I.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.240]   You get a minimum of eight hours of sleep.
[01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.120]   No, that's another story.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.120]   On average.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.000]   Tell that on average.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   If you eat right, if you take care of yourself, if you're doing what everyone knows is the
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.840]   right thing to do to ensure a longer life, you need to go to Health IQ for your life
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:03.840]   insurance.
[01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:09.720]   Health IQ is a life insurance agency that uses science, that uses data to get lower life
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:11.840]   insurance rates for people like you.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:18.680]   You can get a million dollars of life insurance, $36 a month, in many cases.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:21.760]   The reason is that it's-- well, it's science.
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:22.760]   It's statistics.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:25.560]   It's actuarial science.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.320]   Healthy people effectively subsidize unhealthy people.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.160]   The key is to let your insurance company know that you're healthy.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.640]   So here's what Health IQ has done.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.520]   They've got white glove concierge service.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.440]   They walk you through the process.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.600]   They're not underwriting it.
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:45.240]   They work with the 30 top insurance companies in America.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:48.520]   And they get you prices no one else can get you.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.000]   They're exclusive to Health IQ.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.520]   But you got to qualify to get the special rate.
[01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.960]   And that's when the Health IQ quiz kicks in.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:00.240]   It's a scientific way to assess not your health, but your knowledge.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:03.720]   It's a knowledge assessment, not a self-insessment assessment.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.560]   How health literate are you?
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:10.840]   It puts together this quiz with the nation's leading medical health and fitness experts,
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.480]   depending on your score and other qualifying factors.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:19.000]   For instance, you can give them the information from your Fitbit or your Apple Watch.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.520]   You could save up to 41% on your life insurance premiums compared to other providers.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:29.560]   You could just send them a video of this show and just the peck thing.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:30.680]   There's no commitment.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:34.000]   You'll learn even more about the potential opportunities to be rewarded for your commitment
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   to living healthy.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.080]   If you're living healthy, get the best rate possible.
[01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:44.080]   Let Health IQ's concierge service guide you to the life insurance you deserve.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.520]   Now, you're ready to take the quiz.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.520]   It's fun.

[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.960]   the process.
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:56.960]   That's how it works.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.640]   They're going to be your insurance agency.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.920]   And they're going to help you get and you will be blown away.

[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.040]   I fired a primary care physician many years ago because he said I was overweight.
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.040]   I suck at you.
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.880]   I just like to do it really.
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:31.480]   But and I asked him.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:34.160]   I said, where do you get where do you get your britches?
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.160]   I he said britches.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.160]   Yes, I did.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.160]   I said britches.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.680]   I said, you go to the big and tall store?
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:40.160]   He said, no, that's for fat people.
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.520]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:49.200]   It was always my greatest humiliation as a kid.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:53.360]   We go to the department store to buy pants and my mom would always take me to the husky.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.600]   The husky side.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:57.240]   The husky aisle.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.840]   I've seen those I was.
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:10:59.840]   Yeah, that's where.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.840]   If I go to the big and tall, it's normally the waste is way too big, but they fit my legs.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:05.840]   So that's the thing.
[01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.840]   So go there.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.000]   So he's he's literally his.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.800]   So come into his size and larger than this.
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.200]   The government's of his waist.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.000]   I don't know how that's possible.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   Google.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.160]   Go call you, man.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:19.160]   6'2", sir.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.600]   He's intimidating.
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.600]   That's why we think that's even though he's naughty.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.600]   He's friendly.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.680]   Oh, I know he's the sweetest guy ever.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:31.400]   But you know what I think I've noticed that the big, strong guys are very confident and
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:33.520]   often very sweet.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.480]   It's the little guys that are scrappy.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.040]   Yeah, nothing to prove.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.360]   They have nothing to prove.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.360]   They got it.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.440]   I'm going to say I've met.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.360]   I've met all kinds.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.360]   I know you.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.360]   Are you?
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:48.720]   And you do exude a relaxing vibe.
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:54.720]   Like the first time I met you, I was like at CES super stressed and I just was like,
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.080]   oh, I feel so.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.080]   Like I could take a breath.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.080]   What's happening?
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.560]   It was you, yeah.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.200]   I was so starstruck.
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.040]   He's the Bob Ross of tech.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.040]   It is.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:06.040]   It's 6'2".
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.040]   6'2".
[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:10.040]   Oh, that's, I like that 6'2".
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.600]   See, he looks photoshopped into this shot.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.600]   He doesn't, it's like what happened?
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.600]   Everybody, either everybody else got a shot.
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:18.600]   There's doughy people.
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:20.600]   Yeah, we're these doughy people.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.600]   Hey.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.600]   Not you.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.600]   No, no, I'm just talking about that.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.600]   The left hand side.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.600]   I'm not doughy.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.600]   No, you're not.
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.600]   No, you're most certainly not.
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:35.080]   You can just punch him over our heads.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.360]   And please punch Leo for me.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.360]   Me, I don't say doughy.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.360]   I won't do it.
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.360]   I said doughy.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.360]   I won't do it on camera.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.960]   I want to do it on camera.
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:46.960]   Punch me, guys.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:47.960]   All right, you want some zen?
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.800]   I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you my zen.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.800]   My zen.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.600]   If you go down into my numbers, the catarbaric tail.
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.600]   Yes.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.600]   In 14th century English.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.600]   Oh, you want to read it?
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:12:59.600]   It's a wonder.
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:00.600]   This is great audio.
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:01.600]   Oh, it's audio.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.400]   Oh, I love the can.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.640]   Now, is this the dirty part of the Canterbury tail?
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.640]   I don't know.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.640]   I don't know.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.640]   I don't know.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.640]   Somewhere in there it is.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:10.640]   It's the whole thing.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.640]   Because you can't think.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.640]   It's in the original Old English.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:13.640]   It's going to be hard.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.640]   All right.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:19.280]   So watch, we are looking at a game line by line with, with here, the game of the, the
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.280]   tale of the tale.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.480]   I have a beginning at the bulk of the Talas of Canterbury.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:23.480]   Talas of Canterbury.
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:31.880]   One that avaria, the shore sorter, the draught of march at pierce it to the rotor and baw that
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:38.520]   every vine in speechly core of which bear to engender it to floor.
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:44.600]   One's a fear of sacred sweat, a breath, in spirit heart and every halt and hay, the tender
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:50.120]   croppess and the young summa have in the lines half the closer who now.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.120]   A couple of joints.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.120]   You can't even understand Joe.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.240]   He's just like, nope.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:59.680]   That actually is quite beautiful.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.080]   This guy is good.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.400]   So where did this come from?
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.920]   This is nice because it's the story.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.360]   The link below describes it.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.920]   It's the manuscript, a photo of the manuscript.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.600]   And then, but what's nice is it highlights it.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.680]   So you can actually see and read.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.680]   It's pretty awesome.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.200]   This, this is Old English.
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:17.200]   Is that right?
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.000]   Or is it Middle English?
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.440]   Let me ask the Harvard man.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:24.560]   Middle, Middle, Middle, Middle, Middle, Middle, Middle, Middle, English.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:27.040]   And it's from the University of Saskatchewan because it's cold.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:28.880]   They have nothing better to do than this.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:29.880]   That's a joke.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:30.880]   I would love to be there.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.320]   I please have me in for a guest.
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.800]   I love Saskatchewan when the wind logs you.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.960]   Look across the plane.
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.960]   That's really cool.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.440]   Isn't that neat?
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.160]   Here begin the book of the tales of Canterbury.
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:44.000]   Wow, that's really neat.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:50.680]   So for those of you on audio, the app, line by line, shows you--
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:52.280]   because it's in script as well.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.320]   It's in a scribal script.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:58.400]   So it shows you the words transliterated into text
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:01.840]   and then also transliterated into the English we can understand.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.520]   So you can read along and figure it out.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.240]   But you hear it.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.000]   Just the malifficlessness of the voice is wonderful.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.400]   We lost the rolling hours.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.920]   We lost all of that in our language.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:13.640]   We have a very dull tongue.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.640]   Not if you have no--
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.640]   [SIGHS]
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:16.640]   No.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:19.200]   So Metal Floss is calling this an app.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:22.080]   Is there an actual app I could download or--
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:23.040]   I think they're because of their--
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:23.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:24.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:24.640]   No, no, no.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:25.160]   There is.
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:26.040]   All you can.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.640]   Yes, it's on Google Play.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.560]   That's the desktop version.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.520]   Yes, you can.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.600]   Look at that.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.440]   Awesome.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.920]   General prologue.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.920]   Play that on the subway.
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.960]   Oh, it's just the prologue.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:38.160]   It's not the whole Canterbury too.
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:38.720]   No, it's not.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:39.440]   It's 45 minutes.
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:41.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.680]   But I think by the time you're 45 minutes
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:46.400]   or over you back enough, I want to learn Middle English.
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.480]   That's what I want to learn.
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:48.800]   This is really cool.
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.840]   And that's the Android version.
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.720]   I think Metal Floss says--
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.760]   I do.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.400]   Yeah, there's an Apple.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.840]   I'll just see if Mr. Ian Thompson will let me follow him
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.320]   around close enough.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.840]   It sounds close enough.
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.960]   I don't understand when anything Ian says either.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:07.440]   I'm going to make this my pick of the week
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:08.680]   and I was today.
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:09.240]   That's great.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:09.760]   Boom.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:10.280]   Oh.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.200]   Yeah, I really like that.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.200]   You're the cold?
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:14.640]   So that's great.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.960]   After a Stacy Sow division, I wanted
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.240]   to bring peace and wonderment.
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.160]   So the interesting--
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.120]   I saw divisions.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:23.760]   Are you calling me doing int divisive?
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.560]   So you're trying to get ready for this.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:26.760]   Here's--
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.640]   Here's grief.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.480]   I saw divisions.
[01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:32.840]   You should have a little pillow that says I saw
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:34.480]   SEW divisions.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.920]   Yes.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.080]   Long weekly, oh?
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.080]   Dead jokes.
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.200]   Final loss to the S dad.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.360]   No, that's dad jokes.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:42.360]   That's a dad jokes.
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:45.360]   That's a dad jokes.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:48.640]   This is an interesting little side note on this.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:53.400]   The translation of this is by Terry Jones of Monty Python fame.
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:54.400]   Wow.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.400]   And this is actually--
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.400]   He was.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.400]   He was from Old English scholar.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.400]   He was from Old English scholar.
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:04.080]   So this was actually released in celebration of Terry Jones who passed away last month.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.080]   Right.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:06.080]   Oh, wow.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.080]   Oh, geez.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.080]   I didn't even know that.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:10.400]   I saw the name Terry Jones and I didn't know, but that's his translation.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.400]   So isn't that awesome?
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:12.400]   That's awesome.
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.400]   Wow.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.400]   It is not like Monty Python.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:18.560]   Although it does mean that Monty Python, the Holy Grail, has actually has some roots
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.560]   in history.
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.560]   I mean, the guy who was a scholar.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.040]   Well, all of those guys were really smart.
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.040]   Really smart.
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.040]   Really smart.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.240]   Just happened to be funny.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:29.520]   Sometimes they go together.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.400]   Doey and divisive.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:33.960]   That's the name of our new law firm.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:37.760]   Jeff, I'm never agreeing with you again.
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:38.760]   Ever.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:39.760]   I know you're not.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.760]   I've always been out about shadow.
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.480]   No, we could talk about it.
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.160]   We talked about it yesterday at the Great Weekly.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:49.000]   It's an interesting conundrum.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.120]   It's a little bit of politics, but it's really more about kind of an interesting conjunction
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:57.040]   of technology and politics.
[01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:03.840]   In this case, the Iowa Democratic Party, which simultaneously celebrated technology
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.960]   and said, "This is the greatest thing we're going to use in app to count the caucus this
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:13.160]   year," which means we can make it even more complicated and have multiple numbers, but
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.240]   it'll be faster, more reliable.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:21.800]   And then also a fear of technology, which caused them to say, "But we aren't going to
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:24.040]   show anybody this app ahead of time.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.400]   We're not going to vet it.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:27.680]   We don't want anybody to hack it."
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:30.360]   So they released it effectively.
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:35.120]   Gates showed it to people only a few weeks before it was to be used and didn't give training
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:39.240]   to the precinct captains until a few days, and it never before the election...
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.360]   It didn't hard test it with data.
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.360]   Never tested it.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.320]   It never worked.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:49.600]   And at the same time, they had such faith in technology that they shut down the manual
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:50.600]   reporting system.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.920]   They said, "We can use that phone number for something else."
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:54.920]   The whole thing...
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.720]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:59.320]   Well, with the kids in your backup people...
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:03.840]   They used the same phone number for app tech support and reporting.
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:08.080]   And because the app didn't really work...
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:13.560]   There were people calling from both ends, and not nearly enough people to answer.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.400]   It was chaotic.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:20.000]   And here we are two days later, or at least two days later, still counting the votes.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   86% but...
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.960]   I missed a lot of this because of my Twitter.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:27.400]   It has a ton of mute and block words in there.
[01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:28.400]   Including election.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:30.160]   I didn't see any of this.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.360]   I've seen Iowa in my timeline, but it had nothing to do with its song.
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.360]   It was all about recruiting in football.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.360]   And there's...
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.840]   You're probably smart.
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.080]   You're probably smart.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.880]   Certainly that's why he's so mellow.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:42.440]   Butter statues.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:49.280]   There's a lot of evidence that it wasn't so much the app as I think the Iowa Democratic
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:56.520]   Committee that didn't, because of their fears and misunderstandings, and also techno-optimism,
[01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.720]   didn't really do the right...
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.160]   Anybody who was putting out something like this would have in the normal course of events
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:03.160]   and testing and...
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:09.400]   Well, there was also data when they got the data into the main... into the back end, as
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:12.800]   I heard, something that was anomalous there.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:14.400]   So that's what freaked them out.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:16.040]   They didn't know what the data was going to be.
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.200]   I will also add this.
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:25.280]   And Ed Felton, who is a brilliant cryptographer and expert on election systems at Princeton,
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.880]   he has done a lot to...
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:31.120]   He was one of the first people to break the die-bolt systems.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.840]   He said, "But they did do something right.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:36.200]   They had a paper trail.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:40.200]   Every single vote in the Iowa caucus was recorded on paper."
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:43.000]   Why don't they faxed it in by now?
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:48.120]   Well, but when you deal with paper, especially in such a whacked out...
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.680]   Well, there were 1600 plus precincts.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.800]   You got to count all of that.
[01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:54.800]   And double-counted.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.080]   But the numbers we're getting, I think, come from the paper.
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.080]   And that's good.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.680]   That is an important lesson also.
[01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:03.240]   If you are going to use electronic voting systems of any kind, you always have to make
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:06.880]   sure there's a paper backup to validate and in case they fail to...
[01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:10.240]   It's probably a good thing that's happened because I think people who are ignoring this
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:11.240]   and I used to ignore it.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.840]   I used to say, "Oh, come on.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.840]   It's fine.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.840]   We can figure this out."
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.600]   I've long since gotten it.
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:20.480]   But I think this will scare people enough to think, "Yeah, paper back out backups."
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:21.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:24.600]   New York Times, Charlie Wartzel.
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:30.320]   That's desperately needed to win the internet to beat Trump, their first big test, a massive
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.520]   failure.
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:36.240]   This paper backup, this isn't necessarily right until a log file or anything right.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:37.240]   This is just...
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.240]   No, no, no, no.
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.240]   It's literally an outlet.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:43.400]   You didn't watch it on TV, but everybody at the caucus has had a giant piece of paper
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:47.560]   that they held that they were told, "Don't fill this in yet.
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:49.840]   Fill it in after you realign."
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:50.840]   That's the other thing.
[01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:51.840]   Oh, man.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:52.840]   The caucus is nutty.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.840]   Oh, man.
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:54.840]   Which...
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.880]   Well, it's sort of a very primitive form of ranked voting.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:58.880]   It's maybe not.
[01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.880]   Except that there's no anonymity.
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:01.880]   You're talking about privacy.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:02.880]   Well, there is no anonymity.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:03.880]   Everybody knows it.
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:06.360]   And you go into the intimidation section you want.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:09.000]   And then people browbeat you into getting into this section.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   Yeah, it's not a great...
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.200]   It's a system from an earlier, more innocent.
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.000]   I'm going to give you up another number.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.840]   I'm going to say it's a system from the white male property owner area.
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.840]   Yeah.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:20.840]   It's the up to top.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.400]   It's the tough-quest system.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:29.760]   So NPR, two years ago, looked at what is the perfect state to go first in primary voting?
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.760]   Texas.
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:31.760]   Based on...
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:32.760]   Nope.
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:33.760]   No, because of voting.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:34.760]   Because they stop people from voting there.
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:35.760]   I know.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:38.560]   Difference from US racial makeup.
[01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.560]   Share with bachelor degree.
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:42.840]   Does it match the US median age, median household income?
[01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:45.000]   Share who call religion very important.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.480]   For this test, number one clearly is Illinois.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.960]   Huh.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:52.880]   Illinois is the first primary, it would make a lot of sense to me.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.440]   Well, I have a feeling, I don't know.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:56.440]   But I have a feeling...
[01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:57.440]   I lost that chance.
[01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.880]   I won't be first again in four years.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:00.880]   Yep.
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:01.880]   I just have that feeling.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:02.880]   It's not the first snafu.
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:05.480]   And I remember last time in the Republican caucus.
[01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:07.680]   Is it snafu or stafu?
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:08.680]   Snafu.
[01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:09.680]   It's Leo Lippmann.
[01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.400]   It's a Iowa all-girls image.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:17.640]   Speaking of acronyms, that was the name of the shadowy company that funded and then later
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:21.280]   denied that they had anything to do with the app, Shadow.
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.200]   They said, "Oh no, we're just investors."
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.480]   Although, it's an interesting...
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:26.480]   In shots.
[01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:27.480]   There's receipts.
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.480]   There's receipts.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.480]   It's an interesting...
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.480]   What a name for a company.
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:32.480]   I know that's a shadow.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:36.920]   If you're going to buy an app for voting, don't buy it from Shadow.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.760]   It's an evil genius.
[01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:43.400]   It's an evil, you know, genius name.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.880]   That's the name of my...
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:48.200]   Company headquartered in a volcanic island.
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.080]   Volcanic or volcanic?
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.080]   Volcanic, sorry.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:58.080]   I was going to say headquartered in a volcano, but then I was like, "No, it's really an island."
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:59.080]   Stacey, we're Leo one.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:00.080]   Speaking of...
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.080]   I was a little dangerous.
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:06.520]   I was really asking because you said it twice and I was like, "Maybe I have to say this all right."
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:07.520]   It's an acronym.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:09.320]   There's no correct pronunciation.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:13.160]   It stands for situation normal, all fudged up.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.280]   It does not stand for that.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.280]   It absolutely stands for that.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.480]   The fudging is wrong.
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:20.480]   Oh, okay.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:22.280]   The fudge is a fudge.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:23.280]   So you know what?
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:26.720]   Speaking of which, I was thinking today, I was in that bookstore and as all these book
[01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:30.560]   titles to be cute have the F word with an asterisk in them, right?
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.560]   I know, yeah.
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:34.840]   So I think the F word is now completely devalued.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:37.880]   So it's going to piss off some of your viewers, but pardon me.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:40.000]   So I think we need a new curse word.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   Okay.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000]   I think it's...
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000]   Trump you.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   Trump you.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.680]   Hey, go Trump yourself.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.640]   I can't say that one.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:51.320]   That word is muted in Twitter, so I'd never see it.
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.320]   Oh, really?
[01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.320]   That's a good idea.
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.520]   I didn't even have to try that.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:56.040]   What else do you mute in this?
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.520]   It's a long list.
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.520]   It's a long list.
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:01.080]   We need to publish Ants Mute List.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:04.560]   Last week I had the filter stuff.
[01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:09.040]   Just clean stuff up and you're a lot happier when you scroll through Twitter.
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:10.040]   At least I am.
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.040]   It's awesome.
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:13.200]   And you still do your job?
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:19.520]   Apparently not today since I didn't know about Shadow when this snafu...
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:21.520]   There was a great snafu.
[01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:25.160]   Yes, I can do my job except for the absolute lack of...
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.160]   It's a snafu.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.160]   Snafu.
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.160]   I'm going to call it a snafu.
[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:30.160]   Snafu.
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.160]   Snafu.
[01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:32.160]   Snafu.
[01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:33.160]   Oh, yes.
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:38.280]   Under the volcano I had a snafu.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.400]   I have to take a five minute thing and just...
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:42.400]   I have to...
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.400]   Go ahead.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.400]   I have to go.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.400]   Whatever it is.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.400]   Go in.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.400]   Go in.
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.400]   She's got a...
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:50.400]   I know what it is because I'm a baker myself.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:51.400]   Oh, that's what it is?
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.400]   She's got to get the buttons out of the oven.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.680]   Oh, okay.
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:57.680]   Should we...
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.680]   What should we do?
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:59.680]   You know what I'll do?
[01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:01.520]   This is a good time to talk about LastPass.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.240]   And then when Stacey's buns get back?
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:06.160]   From the LastPass Studios.
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.520]   From the beautiful.
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:08.520]   Yes.
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:09.720]   LastPass Studios.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:10.720]   Yes.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:11.720]   And beautiful downtown.
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:12.720]   Downtown?
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:17.080]   Actually, we're really now kind of out of town.
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:20.880]   We're out by the railroad tracks.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:25.240]   We're next to the railroad tracks.
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:31.800]   LastPass is a must have utility, not just for individuals but for businesses as well.
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:32.800]   Did you know?
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:34.880]   Oh, man.
[01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:42.720]   This just came out in a study, the Global Password Security Report, that on average
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:48.040]   employees reuse passwords 13 times.
[01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.040]   That's the average.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.040]   Not surprised.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.520]   And of course, you know it's a terrible password.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.520]   When you're reusing it, it's terrible.
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:57.920]   It's going to be your mother's maiden name, your dog's initials and your birthday or something.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:58.920]   A color.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:26:59.920]   A color.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.920]   Monkey123.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.400]   And then to add insult to injury, you reuse it.
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.160]   I don't have to tell you it's not a good idea to do that, right?
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:10.920]   When you use a password more than once, that makes you vulnerable.
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:15.720]   If one of those 13 sites gets breached, all of them will end up getting hacked because
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.680]   now the password is known.
[01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:21.240]   So 47,000 businesses use LastPass.
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:25.080]   One of the reasons I really love LastPass, it has a little security score.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:26.680]   You can run it on your password vault.
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:31.160]   One of the things that looks at is password reuse, weak passwords, things like that.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:38.240]   The average score of businesses using LastPass, 49%, which is not good, not good.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.320]   And that mostly is because of password reuse.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.960]   LastPass is the solution.
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:46.240]   I think we can get that number up to 80 or 90%.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:51.200]   I know I have simply by running it and then saying, okay, let me fix the bad passwords.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.560]   And LastPass actually walks you through that process.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:55.440]   It helps you do it.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:28:00.160]   And the reason it works is because it generates long, strong, completely unmemorable passwords.
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:01.600]   You don't expect it to remember it.
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:05.400]   You remember one password, the password that gets you into your LastPass vault.
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:11.520]   And by the way, if you're in business, you have over 100 different customizable policies.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.440]   One of the policies you know, the same when you got, took a job here, you get access to
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:17.400]   the vault, but you have to use second to factor.
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:18.600]   We have a required that.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.840]   We also have minimum requirements for your password.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.320]   So it's a strong password.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:23.680]   You still have to memorize that.
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:26.240]   But after that, everything else is stored in LastPass.
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.320]   It's so secure.
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:31.480]   It's not unencrypted anywhere except on your device, LastPass doesn't have access to it.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.680]   I don't have access to it.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:33.680]   No one does.
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:34.680]   Just you.
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:38.280]   Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, I use it on Linux too.
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.200]   It has plugins for every browser.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:41.200]   >> They're on extension.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.200]   >> A lot of extension.
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.200]   >> Yep.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:48.840]   And those policies mean that you can, as the IT guy or gal at your company, you can make
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:51.720]   sure that people keep it secure.
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:57.400]   I use a Yubiki, so you can have the two factor be authenticator.
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.640]   It supports Duo security.
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:28:59.640]   It supports Yubiki.
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:01.280]   It supports a lot of different two factors.
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:02.680]   I love having the Yubiki.
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:06.240]   And LastPass Enterprise now has even more factors.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:11.360]   They call it multi-factor, MFA, using things like your IP address and geolocation to make
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:17.440]   sure that that employee using that database, your business accounts, your websites, that's
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.720]   really the person they say they are.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.760]   And this is what it's all about.
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.480]   And yet, they also make it easy.
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:28.920]   This is something that's normally very hard to do to be both secure and convenient.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:29.920]   Single sign on.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:35.760]   They have over 1,200 SSO, SAML apps, and a single sign on portal, which means it's for
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:39.360]   your employees, it's as easy as tapping a button on the phone and they're in.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:42.400]   No password at all, but it's more secure for you.
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:46.480]   And that is kind of the holy grail of passwords.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:47.800]   I love LastPass.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:48.800]   It's so secure.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:53.880]   And I say, if I keep my passport in there, my driver's license, my social security numbers,
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:58.200]   everything's, that's in my whole life, I have a variety of different solutions, some
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:03.360]   encrypted, some not, but where I, the one I trust the most where I put my most valuable
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.720]   data, like my passport is in my LastPass vault.
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:10.120]   That's my secure enclave everywhere I go.
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:15.200]   And just to make sure you feel comfortable with this, they continuously engage trusted
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:18.960]   world-class third-party security firms for routine audits.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:23.040]   They're constantly being audited, testing the service, testing the infrastructure.
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.240]   Steve Gibson even did that.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:28.000]   He got access to everything thanks to the creator of LastPass Joe Seagris.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000]   He did his own audit.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000]   He was satisfied.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   He uses LastPass.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.440]   That's good enough for me, but these third parties are making sure that LastPass is the
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:38.760]   gold standard for security.
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:40.400]   So many great features of LastPass.
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.400]   Here's what you need to do.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:45.160]   Both in business at home, go to lastpass.com/twit.
[01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:47.040]   That's the first thing I put on any new device.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:51.840]   If you look at my system setup scripts, first thing, LastPass goes on there because that's
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:54.880]   how I get my stuff, that's how I secure my stuff, that's how you should secure your
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:55.880]   business.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:57.720]   So easy, even your kids can use it.
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:59.400]   Do you have your kids using LastPass?
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:00.400]   They use LastPass.
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.120]   Wow, that is good.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:04.080]   I set my mom up with LastPass.
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:07.240]   She's in her 80s, so I was pretty impressed by that.
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:09.440]   LastPass.com/twit.
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:12.120]   We thank so much for their support of the show.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:14.120]   And for naming our studio.
[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:16.720]   We didn't have a name until they came along.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:18.360]   We were just the studio.
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.880]   Now, just the studio, you know.
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.120]   They put you on the map, huh?
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:27.360]   We're on the map now with the LastPass studios.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.280]   We're actually planning another event with LastPass.
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:36.000]   I think we're going to do this one out here for the West Coasters, so we'll see.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.120]   Good news, well, just this is a follow up on a story we did a few months ago.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:47.640]   You remember that I can change the rules on the .org domain.
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:53.040]   They said, "We're going to remove price caps," and then sold it to a...
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:54.400]   Like a week later.
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:55.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:56.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.400]   In a completely unrelated service.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.400]   Unrelated.
[01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:00.800]   That sale is now being held up.
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:04.080]   They sold it to Ethos Capital.
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:09.160]   The California Attorney General is demanding extensive documentation from ICANN.
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:15.040]   The AG in California supervises charitable organizations.
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:18.200]   That's where ICANN is based.
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:22.440]   So that's good news.
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:26.520]   It was actually the public interest registry.
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:29.600]   Now the PIR is trying to fight this, of course.
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:30.600]   They're pushing back.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:32.600]   What a mess.
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:36.520]   That number, 1.135 billion dollars.
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:41.240]   Wow.
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:43.320]   So that is good news.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:46.280]   Thank you, California AG, for looking into that.
[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:47.280]   Because that was a little...
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:49.680]   What does ICANN do with its money?
[01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:50.680]   We're on the internet.
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:53.440]   Re-invest it in domains, right?
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:55.280]   There is some cost to doing ICANN.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.280]   SSL certs.
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:33:00.240]   The internet corporation for assigned names and numbers.
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:05.160]   They maintain the 13 canonical name servers all over the world.
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:07.400]   The ICANN has a very...
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:11.320]   If you think it's electing a pope is complicated.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:17.600]   They routinely, I can't remember how often I think it's once a year, do the key exchange.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.320]   And it's a very arcane...
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.320]   I should see if I can...
[01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:22.040]   Oh, I remember learning about...
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:25.800]   I talked to someone who was one of the nine or nine.
[01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:26.800]   Yeah, the nine.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.120]   The VIN surf, or the seven, I think.
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.960]   The VIN surf does this.
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:35.200]   The seven people who control the keys to the internet.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:39.520]   Wow, seven people, VIN surf is one of them.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:40.520]   I trust VIN.
[01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:42.320]   Of course.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:45.280]   And there's this whole kind of wonderful process.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:50.000]   It's very ritualistic.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000]   The key...
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:52.480]   Let me see if I can find the keys.
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.120]   Root key ceremonies.
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:55.120]   So the last one...
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:58.520]   Oh no, there's one coming up February 12th.
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:01.320]   Get excited, everybody.
[01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:03.160]   It's KSK ceremony for you.
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:05.080]   Before we go on, let's all go.
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.440]   Do you have to wear a hood?
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:09.440]   Is this at conferences?
[01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:10.440]   Where is that?
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:11.440]   I want to know where it is.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.440]   You want to know where it is?
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:16.320]   All right, let's see.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.280]   This will be in El Segundo.
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:20.680]   The ceremony begins at nine...
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:24.360]   I'm sorry, 21-hand of UTC Wednesday.
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:25.720]   That's 1 p.m. local time.
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.840]   They'll be signing the ZS key for 2020 Q2
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:33.000]   and destroying HSM3.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.160]   El Segundo.
[01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:35.080]   Where is El Segundo?
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.320]   In there below Ela.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.880]   My husband is at those things.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:39.880]   What?
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:40.880]   Yes, this is...
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:41.880]   Andrew goes to the...
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:42.880]   He goes to the DNS.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:43.880]   Really?
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:44.880]   He is so cool.
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:45.880]   So DNS is the key signing ceremonies?
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.120]   I don't know if he goes to the events
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:49.080]   where those are also happening.
[01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:51.880]   It will be broadcast online if you'd like to watch them.
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:52.880]   Oh, well.
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:53.880]   I've...
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:54.880]   It's kind of like...
[01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:55.880]   I've been to these shows before.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:58.440]   I was eyes wide shut with Tom Cruise
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.680]   and they have the hoods and the whole thing.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:00.680]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:01.680]   Yeah, so this is...
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:02.680]   Okay, so this is where...
[01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:03.680]   No, I've spent this.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:04.680]   I spent this.
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:06.680]   Did he go to this really?
[01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:07.680]   Yeah, he does.
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:09.600]   I mean, he's a domain name person.
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:10.600]   They do know...
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:11.840]   He's an expert.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:14.800]   The volunteer external witnesses.
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:17.200]   Due to the limited size of the ceremony rooms,
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:18.520]   we only have a small number of seats
[01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:22.440]   for the discretionary rolls.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:25.360]   But you can submit on a first come first served basis
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:26.360]   in application.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:30.360]   Well, next time it's in a cool place and I decide to go with him,
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:31.680]   maybe I'll submit to be a witness.
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:32.680]   How cool would that be?
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:34.680]   I want you to go.
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.680]   I want you to go.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:36.680]   I think that's something...
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:40.200]   I want you to go to that and I want you to go to an emoji meeting.
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:41.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.200]   Dude at...
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.200]   Dude at...
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:44.200]   Dude at...
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:45.200]   They have real emoji meetings.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.200]   Jeremy Bruj is a regular on the show.
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.200]   He's been...
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.200]   He was here a couple weeks ago, right?
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:51.640]   Yep, 'cause they have the new emojis who are here.
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:52.640]   Jenny Eatley.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:53.640]   Including this.
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:55.840]   Jenny Eatley got dumplings, right?
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.320]   She got dumplings at you.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:59.880]   You know, Jam review is celebrating in the background.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:02.640]   This is the new emoji is the finger pinch.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.760]   I think the peck bump.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.760]   Next time.
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:06.760]   Next time.
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:07.760]   You need animated emojis.
[01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:08.760]   You understand the finger pinch.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:09.760]   What is this?
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:10.760]   Is it like Chef Kiss?
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:11.760]   Um, it is...
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:12.760]   Capiche.
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:13.760]   Capiche.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:14.760]   Do you understand?
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:15.760]   I can't see.
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:16.760]   You want to see it?
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:17.760]   You want to see it here?
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:18.760]   I got it right here.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:19.760]   This is from emoji Pg.
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:25.320]   By the way, now we can have brides with mustaches, non-gendered sannas and...
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:26.320]   Mullet.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.320]   Mullet's.
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:28.320]   There it is.
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:30.600]   Hey, that's what it looks like.
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:33.400]   Yeah, it looks like a mullet.
[01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:35.880]   That's technically woman in tuxedo.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:39.520]   I'm very happy about the fondue.
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.440]   With a little Swiss cross on it.
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:42.440]   What does fondue?
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.880]   Is that a dodo bird?
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:44.880]   Yep, and a mammoth...
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:45.880]   They're extinct.
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:46.880]   No, and the mammoth is...
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:47.880]   Not on the internet.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:48.880]   Not on the internet.
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:51.960]   Doodles are back.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.200]   Is that like Red Cross fondue?
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:54.200]   An Amerastrite-Gott doll.
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:56.400]   Oh, I love a Peñata.
[01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:57.400]   A Matroshka.
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.200]   Matroshka, that's it.
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:02.560]   Is that a peanut butter cookie next to the olive?
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:03.560]   What is that?
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:05.040]   No, I think...
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.320]   I asked the same question.
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:11.200]   I'm thinking it's some sort of roti waffily thing.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:13.880]   Oh, I thought it was a peanut butter cookie too.
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:14.880]   Maybe it is.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.040]   I think a lot of cookies always have the forkmarks.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.840]   They have the fork time marks.
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:19.840]   Why do they do that?
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.400]   Is that so you'll know it's a peanut butter cookie?
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:22.400]   I have no idea.
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:23.400]   It's totally pointless.
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:24.400]   If you can spread the dough out a little bit.
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:25.400]   Oh, it's a little bit...
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:26.400]   It's totally pointless.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:29.320]   I think there should be a law that every place is so spooky you should have peanut butter
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:30.320]   cookies.
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.320]   Agreed.
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:32.320]   Cosine.
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.520]   So these will be in the next version of iOS.
[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:39.000]   They won't look like this because of course these are the Emojipedia versions, every version.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.240]   And I love the crying with joy.
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:47.360]   That's a smiling face with a tear.
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:50.080]   So it's crying for joy instead of just crying crying.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.080]   I've done that.
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:52.400]   Won't you use that a lot?
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:53.400]   I do.
[01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:54.400]   A lot of Clemson victories.
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.400]   100.
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:58.880]   Wait, don't we have the big happy face with the tears coming out of your eyes?
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.560]   Cos you're like super happy joy?
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:01.560]   Oh, maybe.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:03.520]   Smoothies is just mild joy.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:04.520]   Mild.
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:05.520]   Mild crying joy?
[01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:07.320]   Yeah, there is one with the...
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:09.560]   It's smiling face with tear.
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:10.560]   Face with...
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:11.560]   They just...
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:12.560]   They name all of them.
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:13.560]   You can't see my screen, sorry.
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:17.320]   You can point out all you want.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.760]   Stop making it on the air.
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:21.720]   I love the disguise, the graphia marks face.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:23.480]   So this is just called pinched fingers.
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:25.000]   We don't know.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:26.000]   This is what the...
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.000]   There was a story that...
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000]   BBC had a story.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.640]   Was that the one with the rundown?
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:31.600]   That it has different meanings in different countries.
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:33.960]   That's right.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:37.400]   Fingers, hand gesture, interrogation, pinched sarcastic.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:38.400]   Interesting.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:45.560]   For some reason, Google does not have the heart emoji or the lung emoji.
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:47.960]   Maybe they just haven't submitted theirs yet.
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.320]   There are ninjas.
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.760]   There be ninjas.
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:56.320]   Santa Claus of a variety of genders, including non-gender specific.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:02.360]   I call these gummy bear hugs, but they call them people hugging.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.920]   Black cats.
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:04.920]   So it's unlucky, right?
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:05.920]   Black cat.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:10.560]   Bison, Mammoth, Beaver, Polar Bear, Dodo, Feather.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:12.040]   Ooh, behind you.
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:13.800]   All the things the internet is made of.
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:15.680]   Hey, Google, there's a lot of blanks.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:19.080]   Why pot and plant?
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:20.080]   Millennials love plants.
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:21.080]   Oh, do they?
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:25.760]   Notice that one of the descriptions is boring.
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.560]   Pot and plant boring.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:31.240]   Boring grow house nurturing plant pot and plant.
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:33.120]   By the way, it is not a peanut butter cookie.
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:38.240]   It is a flatbread, also known as lavash, naan or kita.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.240]   Well, then I want a peanut butter cookie.
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.600]   And I was wondering, what is this?
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.600]   It is a tamale.
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:46.560]   Fondue does not have to have the Swiss flag.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.920]   In fact, Google is not going to-- they're doing a 50s fondue, apparently.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:51.920]   Yes.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:52.920]   Oh.
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:57.760]   No, I'm looking for the one you were talking about with the tears.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:58.760]   It exists.
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.520]   I use it all the time.
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:01.520]   How many--
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:02.520]   There are way too many emojis.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:03.520]   There's thousands of them.
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:04.520]   There's thousands of them.
[01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:07.080]   You can't even-- that's why I usually--
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:10.800]   If I end up using it at emojis, it's only like two or three, ever.
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:12.800]   That's the--
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:16.680]   I probably have about 25 in regular rotation.
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:17.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:18.680]   Oh, there's a bubble tea now.
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:19.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:20.680]   Maybe they'll always--
[01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:21.680]   Maybe they'll always--
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:22.680]   No, no, that's new.
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:23.680]   But your bubble tea's new.
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:24.680]   Miss Stacy.
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:25.680]   No, I have a 13-year-old daughter.
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:26.680]   Oh, man.
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:29.080]   There's a boulder, wood and hut.
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:35.000]   Pick up truck roller skate, magic wand pinata, nesting dolls, sewing needle.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000]   Oh, Google use.
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.760]   Well, the one I like to use is the red.
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:40.520]   Yeah, that's a terrible one, isn't it?
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:43.600]   No, their pinata is not a llama.
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:46.200]   Their pinata is like just a-- oh, I keep clicking.
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:47.200]   Oh, yeah, you're right.
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:51.800]   Your pinata is definitely whack.
[01:40:51.800 --> 01:40:52.960]   For radio people.
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:53.880]   I know, radio people.
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:54.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.080]   Let's go back to the news.
[01:40:57.080 --> 01:40:58.240]   Let's go back to the news.
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:40:59.240]   Um.
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:01.320]   Still no queso.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:04.080]   Hey, should we do the change?
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:07.080]   Yeah, you're right, Aunt.
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:08.560]   You need to get the case off.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:10.480]   Oh, chat room is always noted.
[01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:12.080]   Google change log.
[01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:14.080]   Here it is.
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:22.360]   There is now a Google notification to give you a daily overview of the stocks you follow.
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:25.360]   Evidently, it wasn't working very well before.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.880]   It was sort of off and on.
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.880]   It worked for me.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:28.880]   It was terrible.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:29.880]   But it was off and on.
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:32.280]   I still had-- yeah, I still had to use Yahoo Finance.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:33.280]   It was like the '90s.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:35.280]   You guys are all rich.
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:37.280]   Follow you.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.280]   So it's a good reporting tool.
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:41.280]   That's all it is.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.280]   Stocks.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:44.400]   Uh, what else is there?
[01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:47.800]   There is a new thing on Google Photos, which I really said, because I will buy this.
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:48.800]   I couldn't get it.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:49.800]   I don't have it yet.
[01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:56.720]   For $8 a month, Google will send you 10 prints every month from your Google Photos.
[01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:57.720]   No.
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:58.720]   You can pick them or not.
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:41:59.720]   No, wait boards.
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:00.720]   I'll get eight white boards.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:01.720]   Yeah.
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:04.560]   Let's go and let Google.
[01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:06.360]   Here's your receipt for the month.
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:07.360]   Yay.
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:13.160]   You can tailor this selection because you can choose from themes.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:14.160]   Three out of DPI, crispy.
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:20.160]   You can choose people and pets, landscapes, or a little bit of everything.
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:25.240]   Four by six shots with a 1/8 inch border printed on matte white card stock.
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:28.520]   Currently, it's in the US only on trial.
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:30.320]   You don't get to edit the photos?
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:31.320]   Yeah, you can.
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:32.320]   I think--
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.320]   You can't.
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:34.320]   Oh.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.320]   I thought you could--
[01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:36.320]   You could choose the current DPI-S one.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:37.320]   No.
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:39.320]   Well, you can't choose pets or--
[01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:40.320]   I don't know.
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:44.120]   I'm going to guess that before they do it, you can cancel.
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:46.160]   This is competitive, though.
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:48.760]   You have that service called Freeprints.
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:52.560]   And they'll let you print up to 10 images or so.
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:56.120]   You just pay for the shipment and it comes up to being a little under 10 bucks.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:57.120]   Oh.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.120]   So this is competitive.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.120]   That's basically what they're doing.
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:00.120]   Oh, shit.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:01.120]   And it's all--
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:02.120]   It's a whole new resource.
[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:03.120]   You know what?
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:04.120]   I will do it.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.120]   I will let Google--
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:06.120]   I will not.
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:09.760]   I will let them choose what they put in my packet.
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.080]   And we can make that part of the change.
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:12.280]   Oh, this will be fun.
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:15.680]   I'll open up my photos live on the show.
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:18.520]   Since you're not social, you're anti-social otherwise.
[01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:22.120]   I'm much out of the month.
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:25.720]   Google Glass Enterprise or Edition 2 is now for sale.
[01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:26.720]   No.
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:27.720]   No.
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:28.720]   Run out there and buy it.
[01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.720]   No.
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:30.720]   Come on, you know you want to--
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:31.720]   No.
[01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:32.720]   Why are you so anti-this?
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:33.720]   It's for enterprise.
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:34.720]   Because he bought the last one.
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:37.560]   We wasted $2,000 on the last time.
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:40.320]   It's only $1199 before tax.
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:42.480]   Yeah, now it's cheaper.
[01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:46.760]   And it'll have functionality if you're not a normal producer.
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:49.400]   It is meant for developers, they say.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:53.720]   And notice they call it the enterprise edition, which means it's meant for business developers.
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:56.120]   Yeah, this time here, you're bossed by it for you.
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:00.760]   Miss Stacy, I'm curious about use case for this.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:02.560]   What do you see as a use case?
[01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:09.280]   I've tried a couple AR headsets in manufacturing spaces or in workspaces.
[01:44:09.280 --> 01:44:17.720]   And they're usually used for AR training, teaching me how to do something, connect this
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:20.680]   wire here, this in here.
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:29.160]   The other thing that's really-- it can be used for is getting data off of machines.
[01:44:29.160 --> 01:44:32.920]   And also as a way of communicating with machines.
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:37.720]   So you'll have it pick up your voice from right here in an environment that's a little
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:40.200]   louder than normal.
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:41.760]   So those are some of the use cases.
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:51.760]   I've also seen it in hospital settings for where things are located in the body.
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:54.160]   Wayfinding is kind of a fun one.
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:57.400]   Adatibi, thank you.
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.400]   So what I went, y'all.
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:44:59.400]   Just how--
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.400]   That thing when you say, where's the kidney?
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:01.400]   I can't find the kidney.
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:02.400]   Where's the kidney?
[01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:03.400]   I don't know where the kidney is.
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:04.400]   I opened this guy up.
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:05.400]   I don't know where his heart is.
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:06.400]   Come on, it's in here somewhere.
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.400]   Oh, come here.
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:12.400]   You can superimpose relevant patient data over the person.
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:14.400]   I was going to tell you.
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:15.400]   There's the kidney.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.400]   That's not the kidney.
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:19.400]   That's a uterus.
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:25.080]   I was just playing devil's advocate though, but because I agree with you on most of those,
[01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:29.520]   I can remember being in a manufacturing booth or something like that.
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:34.240]   And it was just beautiful because you have different parts and you have a go and you
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:35.320]   have a no-go part.
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:40.080]   Far as the manufacturing chain, it was just easy for that overlay to let them differ.
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:41.080]   Yeah, well, it's all right.
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.080]   You know.
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:45.440]   So Stacy, just so you understand, because this is a joke that goes way back, there was
[01:45:45.440 --> 01:45:48.840]   much hilarity about Jeff stupidly buying this thing.
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:50.120]   As did I.
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:51.120]   I was stupider than you.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:52.120]   Kevin Bottom.
[01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:53.360]   You bought him in the description.
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:54.920]   I bought him for Jason Howell.
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:58.000]   Yeah, Howell has it back there in the back somewhere.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000]   I bought him.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:04.120]   No, I'm stupider than you because I bought him and got a prescription, expensive prescription
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:06.120]   lenses that is pretty stupid.
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.320]   Oh, Kevin did that too.
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:09.640]   So you and Kevin are both that level of you.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.640]   I'm stupider than you can do.
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:12.640]   I'll tell you dedicated.
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:14.640]   Because I bought Snapchat spectacles.
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:15.640]   Oh, that's okay.
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:16.640]   You win.
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:17.640]   You win.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:18.800]   Those were way cheaper, weren't they?
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:21.640]   Yeah, they were expensive.
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:28.240]   You can now Chrome update is rolling out the can block cross site scripting.
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:30.240]   Hey, tracking.
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:33.760]   Oh, that's ridiculous.
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:35.680]   This is something every other browsers had forever.
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:37.480]   It's about time, right?
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:41.720]   Chrome 80 changes the default setting for browser cookies.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:47.400]   No longer are the defaults on for third party cookies, but don't worry because Google still
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:51.120]   can track you using your unique Chrome ID.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:55.200]   So that's why that's why they don't care.
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:04.600]   They don't care using the Google Pixel repair tool as a faster way to get Android updates.
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:05.600]   I don't know.
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:06.600]   I put this up there.
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:07.600]   I didn't understand it fully.
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:11.480]   It sounds like it's a little bit different from sideloading things.
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:15.080]   Oh, but I didn't quite get it.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:16.760]   So apparently you put this on your computer.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:17.760]   Or the heck out of Leo.
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:19.760]   You put this on your computer.
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:25.560]   And you hook up the thing and then you install Android software development.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:26.560]   I wouldn't do this.
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:27.560]   Oh, really?
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:28.560]   So you have to do ADB?
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:29.560]   Yeah, don't do this.
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:30.560]   Don't do this.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:32.400]   This is like the whole rootin and ramen.
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:35.640]   How much of a hurry are you in to get the update?
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:36.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:39.400]   Well, remember the days when we used to be?
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:40.400]   Used to get all excited.
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:42.720]   Ooh, there's a new phone book in town.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:44.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:49.520]   And if you are a Google Fibre subscriber, no more TV for you.
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:52.640]   They're going to just do a high speed internet service.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:56.120]   But they already were offering YouTube TV on this.
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:58.040]   Now they're going to also offer Fubo.
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:00.760]   I wonder if this is antitrust people.
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:03.120]   Maybe we're all fun.
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:05.640]   Since we have a lucky fiber customers.
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:10.800]   Yeah, I was about to say for the tiny percentage of the population that has fiber.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:11.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:14.160]   You're stuck with YouTube now.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:20.200]   The biggest impediment to Google Fibre's wider rollout was the cost of acquiring this video
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:21.200]   content.
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:23.680]   Does that mean they're going to roll it out more?
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:24.680]   No.
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:25.680]   It was 2014.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:29.040]   Google was paying twice as much for video rights.
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:34.000]   So this is one way to make fiber more profitable is stop buying content.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.520]   That makes sense.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:38.800]   I mean, you don't really need to offer video content.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:41.800]   I mean, the people who are buying fiber are probably not like--
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:44.200]   Don't bundle my stuff, man.
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:46.840]   No, I had both with files.
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:48.560]   I'm very happy having both.
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:49.560]   It's good.
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:53.760]   You don't mind buying your TV from Google, your TV content?
[01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:57.040]   Yeah, but Google wasn't going up against Verizon.
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:48:59.040]   So they were going up against cable, right?
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.040]   So--
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:01.040]   Right.
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:06.480]   That's the Google change log.
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:09.280]   Slow on the up kick of your camera.
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:10.800]   Kevin, we need to hydrate.
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:12.420]   Some
[01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:14.360]   You got to hydrate the Kevin.
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:15.360]   He's gone all flat.
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:16.360]   Hey, sad news.
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.360]   Apparently, Kirk Douglas just passed away.
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:19.360]   Oh, no.
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:22.600]   He's 103, but one of the great Hollywood movie stars.
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:24.600]   He was a centenarian.
[01:49:24.600 --> 01:49:28.800]   Not Michael his son, who is really old, too.
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:29.800]   Kirk Douglas.
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:30.800]   Outstanding.
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:31.800]   The guy with the dimple.
[01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:33.800]   Rest easy, Mr. Douglas.
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:34.800]   Was it a cleft?
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:38.640]   He had a cleft in his chin.
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:45.320]   Speaking of transitions, New York Times says that police in New York City are going to
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:49.840]   put down the notebook and pick up the iPhone.
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:50:01.200]   I think this is kind of-- since the 1870s, police officers have been carrying these notebooks.
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:02.200]   We've all seen that.
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:03.360]   The cop pulls out the notebook.
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:09.400]   Lix's thumb takes a pencil stuff from behind his ear, starts making notes, writing this
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:10.400]   down.
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:13.400]   This is actually a picture in the New York Times from 9/11.
[01:50:13.400 --> 01:50:15.600]   First police officer to arrive at the scene.
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:16.600]   Sean McGill.
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:17.600]   This is memo book.
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:18.600]   Wow.
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:19.600]   Wow.
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:24.560]   They've been doing it for more than a century.
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:28.800]   And starting February 17th, the department is retiring.
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:31.440]   The handwritten memo books.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:36.720]   And they're going to put an app on the officer's department issued iPhones.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:41.520]   I'm not so sure that's-- I think that's about like Iowa and shadow.
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:42.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:43.520]   I don't know.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:44.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:48.800]   I will say, you know, when I'm at press conferences, there are dozens of really young reporters
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:51.160]   typing into their phones.
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:53.520]   And I've got my like, reporter's notebook.
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:54.520]   And I'm like--
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:55.520]   I'm always going to say--
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:56.520]   Is it faster?
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:57.520]   Don't you think it's faster?
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:58.520]   It's faster than white.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.520]   To hand write it.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.520]   Plus--
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:05.120]   I've been getting the Flexion with the Rocket notebook.
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:06.120]   You have that?
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:07.120]   I know what it is.
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:08.120]   I don't have that.
[01:51:08.120 --> 01:51:10.760]   Flexion is an erasable ink.
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:12.760]   Even on paper.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:13.760]   But in the notebook--
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:15.760]   Why would you want erasable ink?
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:21.000]   Well, because you can reuse this notebook and then you take a picture of it and then
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000]   you save that.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000]   Oh, and it transgribes.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000]   It's just a much more expensive notebook.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:26.000]   It's just a much more expensive notebook.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.480]   Well, not if you buy as many reporters' notebooks.
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:31.480]   Bullscinds as I do.
[01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:33.640]   Oh, you're a moleskine kind of guy.
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:34.640]   Oh, wow.
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:36.640]   You're using fancy notebook books.
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:37.640]   You're using fancy notebook books.
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:41.320]   I like the old Manila reporter's notebooks.
[01:51:41.320 --> 01:51:42.320]   I do use the--
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:44.320]   Oh, this isn't my uniball.
[01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:45.320]   I was going to say I use--
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:46.320]   Nicolson Baker.
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:47.760]   Remember the novelist Nicolson Baker?
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:48.760]   There it is.
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:52.080]   There's his Rocketbook Wave.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:54.280]   Remember Nicolson Baker, the novelist?
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:59.600]   He was on a campaign because libraries all over the country-- this is all over by now.
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:04.720]   We're replacing their old paper card catalogs with digital catalogs and it's basically throwing
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:06.800]   the old paper out.
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:11.920]   But Baker was pointing out that there is a wealth of information on these cards.
[01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:18.120]   Notes by successive generations of librarians about a book, just the way it's written, the
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:19.120]   style.
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:23.640]   There's so much information in these cards that isn't captured in a digital card catalog.
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:29.840]   I think it's probably the same as-- look at the police officer's vlog from 9/11.
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:32.480]   I mean, there's something about that.
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:33.840]   There's a speed to it.
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:35.120]   Well, then, as your speed--
[01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:36.320]   There's no other correct.
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:38.040]   There's a presence to it.
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:39.040]   There's a--
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:41.080]   It was there, right?
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:42.480]   It was in his hands.
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:44.240]   It was there.
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:49.520]   And I just-- I mean, I look, it's a tough job and whatever they need and want to make
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:52.640]   their job easier and to do a better job, that's fine with me.
[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:54.640]   It's not my job to write in these notebooks.
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:53:00.720]   How much is being saved for having this at the routine traffic stop for you speeding
[01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:02.880]   or something versus having an iPhone?
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:04.440]   How much is being saved?
[01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:08.720]   You can tell the officer's emotional state from how he's writing.
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:10.280]   There's a stuff that you can tell.
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:16.160]   And by the way, can anybody type on an iPhone at a decent speed without look staring at
[01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:17.160]   it?
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:19.600]   There's no touch typing on an iPhone, right?
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:21.600]   So he's looking at a lot of the point of view.
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:22.600]   He's looking at a speed off.
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:23.600]   I think Michael Sars will be seeing everyone.
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:26.040]   Well, when you're interviewing somebody, you want to keep eye contact.
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:27.040]   Yes.
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:29.040]   Right?
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:32.520]   That's what I do.
[01:53:32.520 --> 01:53:34.960]   And when did you leave the scene of the crime?
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:35.960]   Mm-hmm.
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:36.960]   Oh, that's--
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:38.520]   Watch Colombo, you know?
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:39.520]   That's--
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:40.520]   Yeah.
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:41.520]   Well, he remembered everything.
[01:53:41.520 --> 01:53:43.720]   He was always pulling it.
[01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:44.720]   I don't know.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:46.720]   I feel like he was writing it down, but maybe not.
[01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:47.720]   I don't know.
[01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:48.720]   I don't know.
[01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:49.720]   That's good.
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:50.720]   I haven't seen Colombo in a long time.
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:54.400]   The Hummers coming back this time as an electric vehicle.
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:55.840]   Big Super Bowl ad.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:57.840]   All they showed was this, the grill.
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:53:59.240]   I never saw it.
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:00.240]   No.
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:01.240]   You're not getting that, are you, Leo?
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:02.240]   No.
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:03.240]   You're not getting that.
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:07.640]   Somebody actually said, even though it's still electric, it's still a massive waste
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.480]   of resources.
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:13.160]   It's electric, but you're not using gas, but you're using a lot of other stuff.
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:15.920]   I think private car ownership probably has to die.
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:17.320]   It probably does.
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:18.840]   It's just not a good use.
[01:54:18.840 --> 01:54:21.680]   Well, all you got to do is have some wagons going down the street.
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:23.240]   Nobody can do it anymore.
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:27.360]   Oh, a little red wagon with 99 phones in it.
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:29.360]   Good call.
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:34.960]   Did you see Stacey, the Phillips Hue, flaw that they thought they fixed, but turns out
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:35.960]   they didn't?
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:38.680]   Oh, I thought they still fixed it.
[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:39.680]   Well they fixed it again.
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:42.080]   Okay, I was like, it's now fixed.
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:43.080]   But--
[01:54:43.080 --> 01:54:46.740]   So what I didn't know is you could get over the air updates from here for your Phillips
[01:54:46.740 --> 01:54:48.340]   Hue lights.
[01:54:48.340 --> 01:54:49.340]   How do I check?
[01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:50.880]   No, how do I check the firmware?
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:52.280]   Am I you?
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:54.480]   You go to the app and--
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:55:02.920]   It'll say, so you want to make sure you got firmware 1 935 144040.
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:03.920]   Understood.
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:04.920]   No, it is.
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:05.920]   Show notes.
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:06.920]   You want to do it this way.
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:11.320]   So you go to Settings and then under-- there's a section in their app and under that it says
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:12.320]   software update.
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:15.880]   I wonder if I can do that off site.
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:19.300]   You should be able to remotely do it if the remote setup is enabled.
[01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:21.100]   Out of home control is enabled.
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:23.820]   And when you hit software update, it will check for an update.
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:27.940]   If it finds it, it says it will take forever to update your stuff, but it usually doesn't
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:28.940]   take that long.
[01:55:28.940 --> 01:55:32.580]   Was the security flaw just allowing remote access outside?
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:38.420]   It actually let you access the hub and then inject malware onto the light bulbs itself
[01:55:38.420 --> 01:55:43.860]   and let them into your home-- let malware into your home network and control your devices.
[01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:44.860]   That's--
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:47.920]   But you just discussed we've had months now where I'm--
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:48.920]   I know.
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:51.920]   I really want it to be geekier.
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:52.920]   You want it to be geekier?
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:53.920]   Carry on.
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:55.920]   Would you like to show it to be geekier?
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:05.920]   Kevin would like us to know that Google is hosting Pokemon of the year voting.
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:06.920]   That's pretty geeky.
[01:56:06.920 --> 01:56:08.920]   What's going to be my pick?
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:12.160]   That's geeky in a different way.
[01:56:12.160 --> 01:56:13.520]   That's pretty geeky there.
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:15.260]   That's nerdy, not geeky.
[01:56:15.260 --> 01:56:16.260]   Yeah, right, right.
[01:56:16.260 --> 01:56:17.260]   Correct.
[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:18.260]   Okay, fair.
[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:19.260]   It's okay.
[01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:23.980]   I just injected myself with Sumitripton, so I'm going to fall over soon, but y'all keep
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:24.980]   going.
[01:56:24.980 --> 01:56:25.980]   What happens?
[01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:26.980]   What's that for?
[01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:29.460]   Is that-- if you can't eat turkey, you just use that instead?
[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:31.140]   No, it's for a migraine.
[01:56:31.140 --> 01:56:32.940]   Oh, you can see it again.
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:34.420]   I know I had one.
[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:37.100]   Did the Botox for a week?
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:38.580]   We got to fix you up.
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:39.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:40.940]   This is terrible.
[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:43.760]   I think you can see the bruise on my forehead from the Botox.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:46.360]   I got it a week ago, but it still hasn't finished.
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:47.360]   Oh, man.
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:48.360]   I had a brutal--
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:49.760]   I had a brutal doctor.
[01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:51.640]   I get one little headache.
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:53.520]   I just want to kill myself.
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:56.080]   I go in a-- I curl up in a ball in the closet.
[01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:57.440]   I eat him in the dark.
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:56:58.440]   I hate headaches.
[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:00.280]   I don't know how you do it.
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:01.280]   I guess you don't have a choice.
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:02.680]   You have a much choice, yeah.
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:03.680]   I was a--
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:04.680]   Hi.
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:06.840]   All right, I'm going to let you go then.
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.840]   I think we should wrap this up because I feel bad.
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:09.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:10.840]   I didn't know you.
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:12.100]   I know I have one last week.
[01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:13.900]   I feel bad because I've just been having--
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:16.180]   It's not your fault, man.
[01:57:16.180 --> 01:57:18.780]   But I'm just warning you that in 10 minutes or so--
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:20.220]   No, no, we're done.
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:21.060]   We're done.
[01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:22.300]   We're done here.
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:23.780]   Stacy, what's your--
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:26.060]   Have we talked about Yuba Key?
[01:57:26.060 --> 01:57:26.900]   What happened to Yuba Key?
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:28.220]   Please talk about it.
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:30.300]   The open sourcing of the Yuba Key.
[01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:32.100]   Oh, finally.
[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:32.600]   That's obvious.
[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:33.820]   I thought that was big for companies.
[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:34.820]   It's huge.
[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:35.820]   That's a big one.
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:37.500]   We're big fans of Yuba Key.
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:41.400]   And I actually went out and bought-- there's a German company
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:43.620]   sells an open source security key.
[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:45.500]   It's not nearly as good as Yuba Key.
[01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:46.900]   It was like clunky.
[01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:47.900]   I don't like it.
[01:57:47.900 --> 01:57:49.260]   So I went back to my Yuba Key.
[01:57:49.260 --> 01:57:51.820]   But that was always one of the complaints about Yuba Key is,
[01:57:51.820 --> 01:57:52.900]   well, what are they really doing?
[01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:54.720]   We don't know because they're not open source.
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:55.720]   So they're going to open source.
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:56.940]   That's great.
[01:57:56.940 --> 01:57:58.180]   And you can buy them at both.
[01:57:58.180 --> 01:58:00.760]   I thought it was Google was going to open source.
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:02.620]   Google is opening source.
[01:58:02.620 --> 01:58:03.420]   It's stuff.
[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:04.420]   And Yuba Key is going--
[01:58:04.420 --> 01:58:05.900]   Oh, you're using this in there.
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:06.900]   Yes.
[01:58:06.900 --> 01:58:10.700]   And Yuba Key is going to put it on their stuff--
[01:58:10.700 --> 01:58:11.940]   or on the Yuba Keys.
[01:58:11.940 --> 01:58:14.780]   And then you can buy them in bulk.
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:16.500]   There's several things that have to be--
[01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:18.740]   30 pounds of Yuba Keys.
[01:58:18.740 --> 01:58:20.420]   Well, no, if you're a big company--
[01:58:20.420 --> 01:58:23.900]   So this is the Google launches an open source security key
[01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:27.340]   project, OpenSK.
[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:29.580]   This is absolutely something that needs to be done.
[01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:31.340]   Oh, maybe there's two different stories.
[01:58:31.340 --> 01:58:32.340]   You're already, right?
[01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:34.900]   Yeah, this is Fido and UTF.
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:37.220]   And absolutely, it is--
[01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:40.060]   I think maybe not a massive cause for concern,
[01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:41.340]   but it's certainly something to be aware of.
[01:58:41.340 --> 01:58:44.020]   I don't like using closed source security software.
[01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:48.060]   I strongly recommend it against using closed source crypto.
[01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:50.740]   And so I would like-- but absolutely Yuba Key
[01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:51.660]   is to be open source.
[01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:54.820]   This does not open source Yuba Key,
[01:58:54.820 --> 01:59:01.060]   but maybe if there is a standard Yuba Key might adopt it.
[01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:03.180]   It looks like Google has designed
[01:59:03.180 --> 01:59:06.220]   this to work on a Nordic dongle.
[01:59:06.220 --> 01:59:08.220]   I know many guys with a Nordic dongle,
[01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:12.540]   but I don't know if this will work on an existing Nordic dongle
[01:59:12.540 --> 01:59:14.460]   if you'll have to get a new dongle.
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:22.140]   So apparently, a Nordic dongle is a small uncased board
[01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:23.740]   with a USB connector on it.
[01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:29.340]   I'm baffled by all of this.
[01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:30.460]   So--
[01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:31.820]   Sorry, it was two stories.
[01:59:31.820 --> 01:59:32.740]   It's two separate stories.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:34.340]   What's the Yuba Key story?
[01:59:34.340 --> 01:59:38.060]   So Yuba Co, the company behind Yuba Key,
[01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:40.940]   is doing a subscription service that lets you buy and manage
[01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:41.580]   them in bulk.
[01:59:41.580 --> 01:59:47.340]   So it puts it in competition with RSA's things.
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:51.180]   I'm a big fan of Yuba Keys, and that's what I use.
[01:59:51.180 --> 01:59:52.620]   I'm not knocking the Yuba Key.
[01:59:52.620 --> 01:59:54.940]   In fact, there's an ask the tech guy where we talked about Yuba Key.
[01:59:54.940 --> 01:59:57.900]   And of course, I carry a Yuba Key on my key chain,
[01:59:57.900 --> 02:00:01.260]   and I have one of the nice things about using a hardware
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:03.620]   dongle like this is you can use multiple ones.
[02:00:03.620 --> 02:00:05.420]   I have three authenticated.
[02:00:05.420 --> 02:00:07.900]   One I keep on my key chain, the other two
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:11.980]   I keep in a secure location, a secure, unrevealed location.
[02:00:11.980 --> 02:00:12.420]   Where is it?
[02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:14.300]   My island under the--
[02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:15.860]   Where the Vice President of the volcano.
[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:16.860]   The volcano.
[02:00:16.860 --> 02:00:19.860]   The volcano island.
[02:00:19.860 --> 02:00:21.900]   Where there are no snafus.
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:26.180]   If you don't have a Nordic dongle, this is the way to go.
[02:00:26.180 --> 02:00:26.940]   OK, there.
[02:00:26.940 --> 02:00:27.900]   We did both stories.
[02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:31.140]   You could buy Yuba Key in bulk.
[02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:32.740]   Which, you know what?
[02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:33.860]   Let's do that.
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:36.940]   Let's get everybody in this building at Yuba Key.
[02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:38.420]   I think that would be a good idea.
[02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:41.620]   I think hardware keys are better.
[02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:42.620]   They're better.
[02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:43.620]   Yeah.
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:46.620]   And the phone as key?
[02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:47.820]   Yeah, that's all right.
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:49.300]   Nothing wrong with that.
[02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:52.660]   It's better than nothing, but it's not the best.
[02:00:52.660 --> 02:00:58.860]   Stacey Higginbotham, your thing of the week.
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:00:59.740]   I have two.
[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:01.700]   Two fans.
[02:01:01.700 --> 02:01:02.380]   I'm crazy.
[02:01:02.380 --> 02:01:04.180]   One is Cammec.
[02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:05.020]   I wrote about it.
[02:01:05.020 --> 02:01:06.820]   It's C-A-M-E-C-T.
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:12.660]   That's my favorite ancient Egyptian grain.
[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:14.140]   No.
[02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:14.900]   Distoo.
[02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:15.820]   Distoo.
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:17.020]   Isn't it?
[02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:19.380]   I don't know.
[02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:22.300]   This is a hub for connecting--
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:25.140]   bringing in all of your old IP video cameras.
[02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:27.860]   Yeah, I said-- oh, you're thinking, OK, yeah.
[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:30.220]   No, it's C, not OK.
[02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:30.980]   Oh, there you go.
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:32.220]   Cammec.
[02:01:32.220 --> 02:01:37.060]   So it works with all of your existing old IP video cameras.
[02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:38.700]   So like all the--
[02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:39.460]   I can never even know--
[02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:41.380]   All of the boss cams and stuff that are going on.
[02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:44.020]   Boss cams, dawwas or whatever.
[02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:44.860]   All of those.
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:48.060]   It also works with Nest Arlo-Wise.
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:52.180]   And it pulls everything into one device.
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:54.300]   The idea is it gives you remote access
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:56.020]   without punching a hole in your firewall.
[02:01:56.020 --> 02:01:58.140]   So for the older cameras, that's important.
[02:01:58.140 --> 02:02:00.300]   It brings them all the feeds into one place.
[02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:02.500]   And then it's all stored locally.
[02:02:02.500 --> 02:02:05.340]   There is-- I think they can recognize
[02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:08.420]   20 different things right now, an AI that
[02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:11.940]   can detect motion for-- it detects people,
[02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:14.420]   it detects vehicles, it detects bicycles.
[02:02:14.420 --> 02:02:17.460]   And then it's injured the notifications based on that.
[02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:20.220]   So this is actually a really compelling product.
[02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:21.740]   So it's a hub.
[02:02:21.740 --> 02:02:22.780]   It's a hub.
[02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:24.900]   But it'll bring these old school cameras
[02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:28.580]   that are a pain to work with and kind of insecure.
[02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:30.420]   It'll put them-- you could bring them online
[02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:32.980]   and add intelligence to those.
[02:02:32.980 --> 02:02:33.740]   And they--
[02:02:33.740 --> 02:02:36.460]   How do you use an audio version of this for your Sonos?
[02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:37.220]   Yeah.
[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:40.780]   How do you connect these cameras to the Kinect?
[02:02:40.780 --> 02:02:42.740]   I think if they're IP cameras.
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:46.460]   So it's using RT-- I can never move.
[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:47.180]   RTs--
[02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:50.740]   I like this because you could hook it up to a hard drive at home.
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:52.420]   It comes with a terabyte.
[02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:53.540]   Yeah, it's got a terabyte.
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:55.700]   And I think you can even extend it to another terabyte
[02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:56.180]   if you need it.
[02:02:56.180 --> 02:02:58.940]   So instead of putting your stuff on the Nest Cloud
[02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:00.700]   or the WISE Cloud or the Arlo Cloud,
[02:03:00.700 --> 02:03:01.540]   you can put it right on it.
[02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:02.220]   You keep it level.
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:04.580]   And the AI is really compelling.
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:07.540]   It can recognize-- I was looking at somebody's copy of it
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:10.980]   and it recognized a UPS truck versus a FedEx truck.
[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:12.500]   Oh, that's good.
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:14.260]   Which is kind of a fun notification
[02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:16.020]   if you're like a business and you're like, oh,
[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:17.620]   the FedEx guy is here today.
[02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:19.100]   I like this.
[02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:21.900]   So this is-- that's my actual techie thing.
[02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:23.820]   The other thing in honor of Valentine's Day,
[02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:26.420]   because my family just did this--
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:28.060]   have you heard of Ruby Chocolate?
[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:29.380]   No.
[02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:32.620]   This is marketed as the fourth kind of chocolate.
[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:35.380]   It was invented two years ago.
[02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:37.580]   They worked on it for several years prior to this.
[02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:38.140]   Wait a minute.
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:40.020]   Fourth kind of chocolate?
[02:03:40.020 --> 02:03:41.700]   Fourth kind of chocolate.
[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:43.220]   Dark milk.
[02:03:43.220 --> 02:03:43.740]   Milk.
[02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:44.220]   White.
[02:03:44.220 --> 02:03:44.860]   White's not chocolate.
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:45.700]   Ruby.
[02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:46.260]   OK.
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:46.860]   Now--
[02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:48.340]   Why it's not chocolate.
[02:03:48.340 --> 02:03:48.900]   Oh, it's--
[02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:51.180]   So Ruby Chocolate is made with fermented cocoa beans.
[02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:52.540]   It's from Cayaboe.
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:53.540]   I love their stuff.
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:56.740]   Cau-- Cau-- Cau-- Cau-- Cau-- Cau-- Cau-- Cau-- Cau--
[02:03:56.740 --> 02:03:58.300]   Sorry.
[02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:03.780]   And the idea is that it tastes-- it has a fruity taste to it.
[02:04:03.780 --> 02:04:07.740]   So we tested it because we have been intrigued by Ruby Chocolate.
[02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:10.700]   And I'm going to tell you, it tastes a lot like white chocolate
[02:04:10.700 --> 02:04:12.940]   with a slightly tangy taste.
[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:13.340]   So--
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:16.740]   I like white chocolate, but it doesn't have a chocolate in it, so--
[02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:19.940]   This does actually have 34% cacao in it.
[02:04:19.940 --> 02:04:22.380]   You really can't taste it.
[02:04:22.380 --> 02:04:26.140]   But I'm telling you about this because I love chocolate,
[02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:28.740]   or chocolate XOXO has a version of this.
[02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:32.740]   So for Valentine's Day, this is a fun gift for any of your sweeties,
[02:04:32.740 --> 02:04:34.180]   as long as they like chocolate.
[02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:35.780]   Pick up one of these.
[02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:38.300]   It's the brand new hottest chocolate on the block.
[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:40.420]   You can create a little chocolate taster for under,
[02:04:40.420 --> 02:04:43.820]   like, I'm going to say, 12 bucks if you want to get all four kinds.
[02:04:43.820 --> 02:04:47.100]   And how fun would that be?
[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:48.180]   You can get it on Amazon.
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:52.180]   Although buying chocolate on Amazon is always hit a whistle.
[02:04:52.180 --> 02:04:53.580]   I just went to a candy store.
[02:04:53.580 --> 02:04:53.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:54.780]   I mean--
[02:04:54.780 --> 02:04:56.260]   Huh.
[02:04:56.260 --> 02:04:56.780]   Yeah.
[02:04:56.780 --> 02:04:58.260]   Oh, Ruby Chocolate chips.
[02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:00.500]   Oh, food says it.
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:01.020]   OK.
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:03.620]   Because I would like to make a Ruby Chocolate chip cookie.
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:08.620]   What makes Ruby Chocolate Ruby?
[02:05:08.620 --> 02:05:11.260]   It is the process that these beans go.
[02:05:11.260 --> 02:05:12.260]   It's highly secretive.
[02:05:12.260 --> 02:05:16.060]   If you look up the Wikipedia page, actually show them for Ruby Chocolate.
[02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:19.660]   It's kind of crazy and weird.
[02:05:19.660 --> 02:05:21.460]   There's controversy about it.
[02:05:21.460 --> 02:05:22.020]   And we should need it.
[02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:24.140]   But it is cacao, at least.
[02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:25.380]   There is some cacao in there.
[02:05:25.380 --> 02:05:27.020]   You really can't taste it, though.
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:28.460]   I was a little disappointed up the end.
[02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:28.980]   Thank you.
[02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:29.980]   Oh.
[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:31.220]   You know, chocolate's so good.
[02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:33.540]   Do we really need to have a different kind?
[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:34.140]   Yes.
[02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:34.780]   Well, yeah.
[02:05:34.780 --> 02:05:35.380]   We do.
[02:05:35.380 --> 02:05:37.380]   OK.
[02:05:37.380 --> 02:05:37.700]   OK.
[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:38.220]   Yes.
[02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:39.540]   You can never have too much.
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:40.420]   Thank you, Stacey.

[02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:45.020]   Don't forget our fun podcast with Kevin Tofel,
[02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:48.100]   a very informative the IOT podcast.

[02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:55.820]   Follow her on Gigastacey on the Twitter.
[02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:58.740]   And now she's going to go to bed.
[02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:00.260]   Goodnight Stacey.
[02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:01.060]   I am following us.
[02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:02.900]   I'm like, eh.
[02:06:02.900 --> 02:06:03.580]   Goodnight Stacey.
[02:06:03.580 --> 02:06:04.900]   Screen dims.
[02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:06.340]   What do you call that?
[02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:09.180]   That is a ASMR.
[02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:11.100]   That's a ASMR.
[02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:12.540]   We could do the whole show.
[02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:13.220]   Sure.
[02:06:13.220 --> 02:06:14.340]   It would probably kill me.
[02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:16.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:06:16.100 --> 02:06:18.380]   Yeah, I think Jeff should do the whole show.
[02:06:18.380 --> 02:06:20.660]   I don't think I can do it.
[02:06:20.660 --> 02:06:22.100]   Can you say moral panic?
[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:23.580]   No, no, say, take no panic.
[02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:25.500]   I don't-- it's a moral panic.
[02:06:25.500 --> 02:06:27.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:06:27.500 --> 02:06:28.700]   Woke everybody up.
[02:06:28.700 --> 02:06:30.060]   It's back.
[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:32.140]   Actually, a sleepy podcast bet.
[02:06:32.140 --> 02:06:34.220]   I'd be a lot of our listeners are in the car.
[02:06:34.220 --> 02:06:37.700]   Aunt Pruitt, what is your thing?
[02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:39.980]   My thing of the week--
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:44.980]   I'm going to do two different things.
[02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:46.660]   One now, I wanted a later date.
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:50.380]   But I want to recognize Black History Month being started.
[02:06:50.380 --> 02:06:53.820]   And this one is a little personal because it made me think
[02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:59.460]   about my beloved, great, late uncle.
[02:06:59.460 --> 02:07:01.420]   He was a volunteer.
[02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:06.140]   I went into the Navy and was in World War II.
[02:07:06.140 --> 02:07:08.100]   All of the good stuff there, you know,
[02:07:08.100 --> 02:07:10.620]   far as serving the country, comes back,
[02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:14.140]   was able to go to college and get a college degree,
[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:18.300]   at Benedict College, and later became a principal,
[02:07:18.300 --> 02:07:20.900]   high school principal at the all-black high school.
[02:07:20.900 --> 02:07:22.540]   I want to pull up this picture, but it's--
[02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:23.060]   I can't.
[02:07:23.060 --> 02:07:24.820]   Oh, it's-- oh, I need to--
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:25.980]   You have to protect it.
[02:07:25.980 --> 02:07:27.180]   You should protect it.
[02:07:27.180 --> 02:07:27.820]   I'm sorry.
[02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:29.580]   No, I just want to show it because he's--
[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:31.300]   so he looks like Aunt.
[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:32.660]   There you go.
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:34.540]   Zoom in a little bit on that.
[02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:35.900]   Oh, so he's your great uncle?
[02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:37.980]   He's my-- was great, great uncle.
[02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:38.780]   Great uncle.
[02:07:38.780 --> 02:07:42.900]   And he was-- and he was a hoot, but he was a principal
[02:07:42.900 --> 02:07:45.460]   at an all-black school, all-black high school
[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:49.380]   back in the '60s because of the segregation.
[02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:51.100]   And then when the integration happened,
[02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:55.620]   he was able to be the assistant principal at the high school
[02:07:55.620 --> 02:07:56.700]   I later went to.
[02:07:56.700 --> 02:07:57.660]   You know, it makes me cry.
[02:07:57.660 --> 02:07:59.940]   Here's this guy serving his country.
[02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:02.100]   And the armed forces-- he's wearing the uniform of the armed
[02:08:02.100 --> 02:08:05.380]   forces, but he can't accept white folk.
[02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:06.820]   All right, but then he separated.
[02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:08.740]   It's so, yeah.
[02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:11.980]   He's able to get at the high school that I attended.
[02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:15.340]   And he's an assistant principal over a discipline,
[02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:16.580]   which makes a ton of sense.
[02:08:16.580 --> 02:08:17.460]   Oh, God.
[02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:18.860]   Was he there when you were there?
[02:08:18.860 --> 02:08:19.500]   He was it.
[02:08:19.500 --> 02:08:20.500]   He was it.
[02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:23.500]   But he later became principal, OK?
[02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:27.340]   And I just thought how big that was for him to be--
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:27.820]   Yeah.
[02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:29.580]   --a black man there in the south.
[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:30.140]   Nice.
[02:08:30.140 --> 02:08:32.940]   Being able to be the principal in this little tiny town.
[02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:34.660]   Was this after desegregation?
[02:08:34.660 --> 02:08:35.020]   Yeah.
[02:08:35.020 --> 02:08:36.020]   Yes, this was when everything became--
[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:37.940]   So late 60s or early 70s.
[02:08:37.940 --> 02:08:38.940]   Mm-hmm.
[02:08:38.940 --> 02:08:39.460]   And--
[02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:41.780]   Lovely.
[02:08:41.780 --> 02:08:44.380]   The funny story about it is I went to that school,
[02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:48.220]   and when I got to that school, every teacher and assistant
[02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:50.980]   or whatever, they said, huh, prove it.
[02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:53.500]   OK, so I know your mom and your dad,
[02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:55.460]   because my mom and dad went there.
[02:08:55.460 --> 02:08:58.580]   And then they said, OK, so that means you also
[02:08:58.580 --> 02:08:59.740]   know Mr. Creighton.
[02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:03.220]   And they all talked about how much they love Mr. Creighton
[02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:03.740]   back then.
[02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:07.380]   And they said that whenever something went nuts in school
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:08.980]   with the students just being crazy,
[02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:13.380]   he would get on the PA and say, now here this.
[02:09:13.380 --> 02:09:15.740]   We are not going to act this way.
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:19.380]   I mean, you couldn't get away with stuff like that now.
[02:09:19.380 --> 02:09:20.780]   Yes, sir.
[02:09:20.780 --> 02:09:22.180]   You know, but everybody--
[02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:23.940]   That's command right there.
[02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:26.460]   They said he would get on the PA and announce.
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:28.180]   Now here this here is like that.
[02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:29.660]   And people will stop.
[02:09:29.660 --> 02:09:30.660]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:30.660 --> 02:09:32.180]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:32.180 --> 02:09:34.420]   But it was a lot of good stories about him.
[02:09:34.420 --> 02:09:39.420]   And I just remember I played in a college football game
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:41.060]   against Benedict College.
[02:09:41.060 --> 02:09:43.460]   And it just-- he was just so pumped up,
[02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:46.540]   because it was just me getting an opportunity
[02:09:46.540 --> 02:09:48.460]   to go to college and play ball.
[02:09:48.460 --> 02:09:51.020]   And it was against him that just--
[02:09:51.020 --> 02:09:52.020]   He was good people.
[02:09:52.020 --> 02:09:53.100]   He was good people.
[02:09:53.100 --> 02:09:55.060]   Uncle-- Uncle-- Uncle Mac.
[02:09:55.060 --> 02:09:57.260]   His name is Matthew Creighton.
[02:09:57.260 --> 02:09:58.580]   But we called him Uncle Mac.
[02:09:58.580 --> 02:10:01.260]   And he was a big man.
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:02.940]   Big, big man.
[02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:05.580]   And that comes from a book written by Miss Ashley.
[02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:10.820]   It's called "Beltin', a little tiny town in South Kecki Lackey,
[02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:12.620]   where I grew up."
[02:10:12.620 --> 02:10:13.620]   Wow.
[02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:16.340]   When did Mac-- Uncle Mac pass?
[02:10:16.340 --> 02:10:18.500]   It's been probably 15 years now.
[02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:19.780]   It's been a while.
[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:20.380]   It's been a while.
[02:10:20.380 --> 02:10:22.100]   Thank you for sharing them with us.
[02:10:22.100 --> 02:10:26.780]   And this book is the history of the small, tiny, tiny, tiny town.
[02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:29.740]   Probably, I think, Petaluma Dwarf's belt on.
[02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:31.940]   Petaluma Shrimp does.
[02:10:31.940 --> 02:10:34.140]   It's a railroad town at the junction of the Columbia
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:36.620]   and Greenville Railroad.
[02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:39.820]   And Jeff, this means you should go down there.
[02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:42.500]   The home of the South Carolina Tennis Hall of Fame.
[02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:43.420]   Yes.
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:44.300]   Damn.
[02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:46.540]   The Palmetto Championships.
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:49.100]   And I think they still have the Palmetto Championship.
[02:10:49.100 --> 02:10:50.460]   And that was really big.
[02:10:50.460 --> 02:10:53.580]   It was always a ton of traffic in that tiny town for tennis.
[02:10:53.580 --> 02:10:53.580]   Nice.
[02:10:53.580 --> 02:10:54.660]   Blue in my mind.
[02:10:54.660 --> 02:10:56.460]   You always think in South Carolina,
[02:10:56.460 --> 02:10:58.140]   you always think college football, but tennis.
[02:10:58.140 --> 02:10:59.140]   But tennis was pretty big.
[02:10:59.140 --> 02:10:59.640]   Tennis.
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:00.700]   Nice.
[02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:02.980]   Jeff, number please.
[02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:04.580]   Very simple one.
[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:10.460]   Amazon Prime now has 150 million numbers worldwide.
[02:11:10.460 --> 02:11:11.460]   Yeah.
[02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:13.900]   I don't remember Bezos revealing this ever.
[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:14.860]   What is that picture?
[02:11:14.860 --> 02:11:16.780]   What is he doing?
[02:11:16.780 --> 02:11:17.220]   It's something.
[02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:18.180]   This is an odd story.
[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:18.940]   That's from India.
[02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:22.940]   And then if you look at the lead, the lead is just a bad lead.
[02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:25.220]   Just as they're facing government investigations,
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:26.780]   now they're having success.
[02:11:26.780 --> 02:11:28.620]   It's where we see everywhere now.
[02:11:28.620 --> 02:11:31.160]   We just do that zing thing.
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:32.760]   Is there more link bait than ever before?
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:36.720]   Because in order to do the job, we have a nice scan.
[02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:38.280]   I do a beat check.
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:39.360]   I go through Tech meme.
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:41.920]   I go through Hacker News, Reddit, and so forth.
[02:11:41.920 --> 02:11:44.840]   And it just strikes me, headlines nowadays
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:46.200]   are much more of the--
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:46.520]   Yes.
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:50.120]   --you'll never believe what happened next than ever before.
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:51.960]   I had a conversation day with a reporter
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:54.960]   about trying to look at Facebook and their political stuff
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:55.480]   and all that.
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:58.080]   And I said, there's a lot of Lord knows,
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:11:58.880]   legitimate criticism.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:01.160]   But I said, remember the media ecosystem
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:04.220]   they have to deal with and what we've created?
[02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:06.580]   Well, I just don't like it when I have to click an article
[02:12:06.580 --> 02:12:08.260]   to see what it's about.
[02:12:08.260 --> 02:12:10.020]   Part of it's just society, though.
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:14.900]   We are so finicky about our attention.
[02:12:14.900 --> 02:12:16.540]   You got to draw us in.
[02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:19.060]   You got to get us some kind of way you got to draw us in.
[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:20.460]   And then when you get us in there,
[02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:21.820]   you better hold us.
[02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:22.700]   Hold our attention.
[02:12:22.700 --> 02:12:24.300]   It says, we're going to be right out of the political--
[02:12:24.300 --> 02:12:25.920]   This course in this country, it's
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:29.160]   all about showmanship.
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:29.660]   You're right.
[02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:32.560]   It's attention of inflation.
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:33.800]   It's always going to be bigger.
[02:12:33.800 --> 02:12:36.560]   It's always going to be bigger.
[02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:37.880]   All right, everybody.
[02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:39.400]   All right, everybody.
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:40.440]   I thank you so much.
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:41.880]   Stacy, you feel better soon.
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:42.960]   I'm sorry.
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:44.080]   I'm sorry, you guys.
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:45.280]   No, go to sleep.
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:46.280]   Go to bed.
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:47.120]   Go to bed.
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:48.120]   I hope you feel better.
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:50.400]   All the best to you, Stacy.
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:51.520]   Always a pleasure to have you.
[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:53.240]   Jeff Jarvis, of course, we love you.
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:55.880]   Jeff, somebody said we should just have a podcast
[02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:57.040]   called Jeff's Library.
[02:12:57.040 --> 02:12:58.280]   One day, I think we should.
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:12:58.800]   Wow.
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:00.160]   Just a tour of your books.
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:01.720]   I got a new one.
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:03.480]   What are you reading these days?
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:06.760]   I love that Canterbury Tales thing.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:10.160]   Ezekiel Princeps, a history of the Gutenberg Bible,
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:11.400]   a very thick, big one.
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:11.920]   Nice.
[02:13:11.920 --> 02:13:15.640]   That has a story of every Gutenberg Bible in existence.
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:16.440]   Wow.
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:17.200]   It's very well written.
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:19.040]   It's very good.
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:21.400]   How many Gutenberg Bibles are there?
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:22.760]   It's out there.
[02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:24.680]   We had one at Yale at the Bineke, I remember.
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:25.680]   I used to go look at it.
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:27.480]   We had one at UT.
[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:29.440]   Yeah.
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:31.800]   I have this whole folder now.
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:34.560]   It is nothing but the controversy.
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:37.480]   Paper is written about the controversy
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:40.320]   about whether Gutenberg printed and how
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:45.600]   the Catholic one, which was a dictionary in Wikipedia.
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:48.880]   And it's all two academics going after each other
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:53.080]   with theories about who printed it where based on--
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:55.160]   this one had this watermark and that one
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:57.120]   had these pinholes and this one had--
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:13:58.480]   it's just unbelievable.
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:13:59.880]   It's talking about nerdy.
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:04.400]   It's just magnificently nerdy.
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:05.480]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:14:05.480 --> 02:14:06.400]   Always a pleasure.
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:07.120]   Thank you.
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:08.600]   Thank you, Aunt Pruitt.
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:13.480]   Hands-on photography, a must-watch-twit.tv/hop,
[02:14:13.480 --> 02:14:17.640]   whether you're using a camera phone or a multi-thousand-dollar
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:18.480]   DSLR.
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:21.520]   This is such a fun show all about taking
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:25.440]   photography, the art of photography, editing your photos,
[02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:28.720]   twit.tv/hop.
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:29.360]   That's right.
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:30.280]   Love this show.
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:31.000]   Lots of fun.
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:31.640]   Lots of fun.
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:32.440]   Check us out.
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:32.880]   And of course--
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:36.080]   Oh, Aunt, you look so approachable and friendly in that.
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:38.120]   You're like, here's a camera for you.
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:39.000]   I'm like--
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:39.840]   That's him.
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:40.840]   That is him.
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:41.840]   That is him.
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:42.840]   That's him.
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:44.960]   That's the photo conveys you so well.
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:45.760]   Yeah.
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:47.880]   And then he said, now hear this.
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:49.760]   Now hear this.
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:53.640]   You will properly expose your images.
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:57.720]   Oh, my strawberries.
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:01.240]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 130 Pacific,
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:04.160]   430 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:06.760]   We had a lovely couple in the studio from Melbourne, Australia.
[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:07.800]   It was great to have you.
[02:15:07.800 --> 02:15:08.560]   Thanks for visiting.
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:10.240]   If you want to join us in the studio,
[02:15:10.240 --> 02:15:11.800]   we do have an open studio when I'm here.
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:14.600]   All you have to do is email tickets at twit.tv.
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:17.360]   And we'll make sure we got a seat out for you.
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:19.400]   You can, in a way, you can visit the studio virtually.

[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:29.600]   also watching live.
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:33.720]   And they're in the chat room at irc.twits.tv.
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:35.160]   Another great place to go.
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:38.440]   Once the shows are produced, edited, cleaned up.
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:40.400]   We put them out on the internet.
