[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   Coming up next on This Week in Google, it's me, Jason Howell, filling in for Leo LaPorte,
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.320]   who is somewhere on a cruise.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.320]   Have fun, Leo.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.720]   I'm also joined by Jeff Jarvis, Stacey Higabotham, and Ant Pruitt.
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.720]   And what do you know?
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.520]   We've got a bunch of Google News to actually talk about this week.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.200]   We've got AR glasses being beta tested.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.200]   We've got Google with a hiring freeze in effect.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.480]   Pixelbooks, apparently on the horizon, and then Chrome OS flex for converting computers
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.640]   that aren't running Chrome OS into Chrome OS devices.
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.480]   And then of course, yes, we've got non-Google news like the opening of AI, open AI to the
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.320]   public, Netflix's second bad quarter, and a video game with cats that's making real
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.680]   cats very happy.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.160]   All that more coming up next on This Week in Google.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:58.320]   This is Twig.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.120]   This Week in Google, Episode 673, recorded Wednesday, July 20, 2022.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.280]   Swipe right for Schmuck.
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.000]   This episode of This Week in Google is brought to you by HPE GreenLake, orchestrated by the
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.800]   experts at CDW, who can help you consolidate and manage all your data in one flexible

[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.520]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.480]   I'm like envisioning like the title cards going, "Biz, week in Google," coming towards
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.480]   the camera.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.120]   We need to make that happen with the new logo art that you've surely already seen in your
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.520]   podcatcher of choice.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.320]   I'm Jason Howell, filling in for Leo Laport, who is hopefully not getting seasick on a
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.640]   cruise with a bunch of other Twit fans and Lisa, and Paul Thorett is there as well.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640]   There we go.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.800]   So they're having a great time.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.840]   I'm planning on having a great time here with the Twig fans.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.400]   Starting with Jeff Jarvis, he is the Leonard Tao Professor for journalistic innovation at
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.400]   the...
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.840]   There we go.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.600]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   Welcome Jeff.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   Good to see you.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   Okay.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.600]   Given the new logo, I think we should start off like this.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.760]   Yes, right.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.520]   Hands up everybody.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   Hands up.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.520]   Yes, I love it.
[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.520]   Talk to the hand.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.640]   Of course, good call.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.280]   But doing that smart ass, I pulled my ear.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.880]   That's what you get.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.880]   That's what you get.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.280]   Good to see you, Jeff.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.800]   Also joining us, it's Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   On IOT.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   Welcome Stacey.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   Welcome back Stacey.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   Hey.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.400]   So good to be back.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.880]   Oh, that's right.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.320]   I've got you in the doc last week, but that's right.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.520]   You weren't in the doc last week because you were...
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.160]   Sorry, that was a bit of unpleasant surprise.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.080]   No, no, no, no.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.160]   It was just the page from last week, but I had obviously not updated it.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.160]   That's right.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.320]   You were out and it's great to have you back.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.160]   You were gone two weeks in a row, in fact, right?
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.160]   Yep.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.160]   I was.
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.160]   I was excited to talk Google.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   Welcome back.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.160]   So happy.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.000]   I was so excited about Google this week.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.640]   There's so much news.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.640]   There really is.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.640]   Yes.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.640]   So we're going to talk all about it.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.920]   We actually have a good amount of Google news so we can keep true to the name of this
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.840]   show for a change.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.880]   Also joining us, it's and Pruitt Hands on photography and, you know, maintainer of club
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.440]   twit and all other things.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   Welcome, man.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.440]   Hello, sir.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   How you be, Mr. Howe?
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.200]   I'm doing all right.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.320]   I had a little bit of a bumpy start with my audio interface, not working, but I think
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.040]   I've smootened that out and good to go.
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.560]   And it's good to see your face, not in the office though this week, but that's okay.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.560]   Likewise, sir.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.560]   Likewise.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.440]   You know, this is, if you, you're supposed to have everybody be virtual.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.320]   If one person is virtual, that's like the way your school run virtual meetings.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.600]   So this is perfect.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   So it works out.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.600]   All right.
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.600]   It works out.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.800]   We're finally learning the etiquette of Zoom.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.240]   I'm doing this online.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.480]   None of us are learning etiquette.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.680]   Not on your show.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.480]   We're rude on this show.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.880]   We're on a set of makes did of ceiling.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.320]   Well, it's good to see you all and it's good to be able to join you on such a Google
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.320]   heavy week.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.480]   Where do you all want to start?
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.040]   Because I see at the top is Netflix, but if we've got a lot of Google, why don't we
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.280]   start with Google Glass because there's not a whole lot to this story other than the
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:46.000]   fact that at Google IO, if you remember, if you recall Google IO, they were talking,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.880]   Google was talking about kind of the next iteration of AR glasses that Google is working
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.640]   on going to put out at some point.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.520]   I feel like when Google, you know, when Google I was, was happening and they were showing
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.960]   off the glasses, I felt like this was like maybe a couple of years out, but apparently
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.200]   they're going to start beta testing these suckers.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.520]   I think next month starting in August, you might encounter someone wearing the new iteration
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.520]   of the air glasses.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.520]   I have a little clothes on air glasses.
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.520]   Yes.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.840]   You want to be able to trade in my Google Glass on this.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.480]   I think that would be nice.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.480]   I would do that.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.480]   Yes.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.480]   You know, heartbeat.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.480]   Yes.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.480]   There's $1,500 glasses.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.320]   I think it's probably going to cost you more to send it to them versus what those things
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.320]   actually worth.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.320]   It's not worth that.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   $1,500.
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.320]   Rub it in.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   Rub it in.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.440]   I bought the lenses for them.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.040]   I bought real lenses for them so I could wear them all the time.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.040]   I'm that much of a schmuck.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.840]   Am I going to buy these?
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.840]   Probably because I'm a schmuck.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.680]   No, you're not a schmuck.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.160]   You just, you go all in.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.920]   You dedicate yourself to the bit.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.920]   That's what it's all about.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.920]   Well, the show, I do it for the show.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.920]   You're dedicated to the bit.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.920]   You're right.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.360]   Kevin, Kevin did the same thing.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.760]   So you know, you're in good company, Jeff.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.760]   I am.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.760]   He's there with you.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.920]   But these, I mean, so, so, y'all, these are, these are not going to be tested broadly.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.360]   It's just like some of their employees and these glasses are different.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.800]   They've got there for AR understanding like the environment around you.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.120]   They can take, they can't take pictures and video except algorithmically.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.640]   So, so basically they're pulling in data, but it's not data that you can like post on
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.920]   the Instagram or something like that.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.560]   And they will have a red light for when they collecting that information.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.800]   Oh, I don't know why I had it in my head that there was no camera on here, but that
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.400]   makes sense if it's an AR, you know, glass that it would have some cameras.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.400]   Just you can't use it to take pictures.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.640]   It's like LIDAR, you know.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.200]   It's not LIDAR, but it's like time of flight.
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   Image sensing.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.840]   I don't, yeah, I have a hard time under.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:02.200]   Like we need a new word for taking imagery for computers and not for people's vision.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.200]   Right.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:11.400]   But is this basically a play for Google to take this particular product or propose product
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.480]   out of the regular consumers hand and just saying, you know what?
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.040]   We're really focusing more so on enterprise and manufacturing.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:24.320]   Do you see some type of fun consumer product coming out of this?
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:30.440]   Oh, you know, with all of the Pokemon stuff that people still play, I even heard somebody
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.640]   still plays ingress, you know, nuts.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.640]   That's a last game.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.880]   Last game I played was missed.
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.240]   So good job.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.240]   Congratulations.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.520]   It's about time.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.720]   I don't know if I mean, so from a consumer perspective, Google is talking about things
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.720]   like translation.
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.600]   What else do they talk about?
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.400]   I'm trying to remember what all they said, but I remember translation probably probably
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.600]   directions and that kind of stuff.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:10.040]   Now, I think given how Google historically, like you do actually need some sort of image
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.120]   sensing if you want to do like, you know, how Google has their AR directions now?
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.960]   I don't know if you've played with their directions.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.960]   Yes.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.640]   Where you hit it and it'll put that up.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.920]   So I'm investigating something, being able to do something like this on a heads up display
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.200]   would actually be really good.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.560]   So you would need to get some sort of image data from it for that.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.760]   For translation, as someone who just spent time in a foreign country trying to read menus
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.880]   using my phone, you know, having it again, a heads up display that shows they can see
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.880]   the world.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.560]   Yeah, that sounds so nice.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.760]   So to sit in a point and edit with your phone kind of thing.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.680]   Yeah, which was fine.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.680]   It worked.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.680]   Some sure, right?
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.520]   It's fine, but this would be truly transformative, right?
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:59.440]   Like if you were already wearing glasses anyway, anyways, it would be less of a, I need
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.600]   to pull out my phone in order to do this thing and more.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.360]   This is just a new superpower that I have when I wear these things.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.240]   It just automatically happens.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.240]   That's like, that's awesome.
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.000]   That's a good way to put it, I think.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.880]   But I think it's really interesting question now because they learned the lesson with
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.240]   glass that if you give it to just everyday ordinary schmucks like me, we're going to
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.480]   end up making fun of it and it's not like it works.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:28.360]   So they realized that the real use of it was for tradespeople and doctors and so on
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   and so forth.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   So I think if they learned that lesson, you never know with Google, but it would say
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:40.960]   to me that their reflex should be to start with those kinds of uses and prove it.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.760]   I think the job is as someone that has their own theme song, you're not an everyday person,
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.760]   my man.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.160]   Well, I wasn't.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.760]   Definitely not a schmuck.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.320]   You are not a schmuck.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:01.720]   That the use cases, I think consumers would want this if they had the right kind of gear.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:09.440]   So I think they found the use cases in enterprise because A, they were expensive, but B, because
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.360]   they weren't comfortable to wear.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.240]   So you had to have a really good incentive and your employer saying, hey, this is-
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   Yeah, okay.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:23.600]   So I think, and we're seeing, if you think about snap spectacles, you think about the
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.480]   Ray Bands sunglasses, Amazon made the echo frames.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.720]   They weren't that great.
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:35.000]   But you see that we're trying to, it's very clear that we're trying to figure out how
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.400]   to cram as much tech into a truly wearable device.
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:45.240]   And we're still not sure what the use cases to drive people to actually purchase it.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.960]   So stay on that stage for a second.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   Go ahead.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.200]   I was going to say, so I think that's Google's attempt to throw something out there, start
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:59.280]   playing around with it and see what that, I hate to say a killer app, but at least a
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.640]   viable app for a glass might be.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:09.520]   So, with the old glass, I don't think it was anticipated that taking photos was going to
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.200]   be a primary use.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.280]   You know, Robert Skow will in the shower and all that.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.440]   And I think that what Google wished for was the heads up display giving you information
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.440]   because it's an information company.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:27.720]   So it's interesting to this case, if they disable photo taking for any purpose other
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.920]   than data and knowing where it is and that kind of stuff and being able to present an
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:39.320]   augmented reality, the design decisions will drive the usage.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.560]   I guess what I'm trying to say.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.560]   Yes.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.840]   And we're so much.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:50.160]   And we're also so much further in terms of what these are capable of.
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:55.560]   Now we have, you know, I can't remember, it was glass back in like 2013.
[00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.720]   I mean, it was almost it was 10 years ago.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   If I'm not.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.240]   So now we have real time translate, right?
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:10.280]   We have always on wake were detection that can actually like playback music or do like
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:16.200]   we have so much more available to us that isn't taking pictures that still feels both
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.040]   useful and a little bit familiar.
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:24.160]   So I do think you're right, Jeff, that we have these things available to us now that
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.600]   and that'll be kind of exciting.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.600]   So what do you think the killer app should be?
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.600]   Could be?
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.480]   What would you with this capability with the superpower?
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.080]   What would you most want to be able to do with it?
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:40.680]   My issue is I need it to be almost as good as my current classes and like maybe not as
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.000]   stylish because these are my most stylish pair of glasses.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   They are very stylish.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.080]   Rocking and very.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.840]   But have it like, I feel like music playback that's compelling is good, right?
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.520]   I feel like when I'm walking around a city having directions, like you have to think
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.320]   like translate sounds awesome, but how often am I in my own right?
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.320]   Right.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.320]   Right.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.320]   So like what are the words from Paris?
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.320]   Could you imagine using it?
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.040]   I thought I would have loved it.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.440]   I would have loved it, but it wouldn't have been something I would have purchased for
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.440]   that.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.440]   Like that's like a yeah.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.840]   So I'm like, what is my like almost everyday use case where this becomes compelling?
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.000]   Maybe it's playing an AR game and that gets us like a lot like gets us penetration.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.600]   I think directions is really interesting.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.800]   I actually don't think notifications is a good one simply because like I don't want
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.400]   to be reading while I'm trying to drive, right?
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.400]   Right.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.840]   And I don't know that everybody is still kind of pining to get that notification triage,
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.200]   you know, always, you know, always being completely up to date on those notifications that come
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   in.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.360]   I feel like we've kind of shifted a little bit.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.840]   I know I have away from let me know every single little thing that happens as it happens,
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.760]   you know, immediately on my phone.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.640]   But in front of my face, like that's too noisy for me.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.440]   The thing that I do every day that I could see this being useful for would be the navigation,
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:06.000]   even though the navigation that I use right now is is handy already.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.320]   But that's like an immediate like when I think of translation, you're right.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:13.520]   I'm rarely ever in a situation where translation is necessary.
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.620]   So that's not going to be the killer app for for someone to get this in my view, but I navigate
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.620]   all the time.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.960]   So that would be very helpful, but but you don't ever get rid of killer apps.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.520]   I don't know, but you're never going to screen, right?
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:33.200]   Yeah, but like, like I'm just thinking about like how my Tesla handles, they have two forms
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.480]   of navigation on the big screen.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.520]   I have like the traditional map that you're probably used to, right?
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.800]   But then in front of me on the little dash in front of me, I get like, like basically
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.800]   like just a little turn left here kind of thing.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.480]   So I think those are what you would see on the glass.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.040]   You wouldn't see the map style.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:57.640]   And then as a woman, like I never take out my phone when I'm walking places, right?
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.480]   Because I don't want someone to come and whack me over the head situation.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.480]   All awareness.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.440]   Yeah, I got to be aware.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.800]   So I'm thinking about like there's also like, I really think things like music playback might
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:16.640]   be good or the ability to start a voice call could be compelling emergency.
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:24.520]   Like I would love to have like, hey, G call 911, you know, in your location or something.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.600]   Like that could be useful.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.600]   So I'm just trying to think of like places where I have my screen.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:39.320]   And then also, what if you could see things like, I don't know, like, you know how you
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:44.280]   Google a restaurant and it says like, Oh, I'm super busy or I'm not super busy right
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.280]   now.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.480]   But you could just like as you're walking by a place, see like, Oh, holy cow, that's
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.480]   crowded.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   I mean, no, there you can see it.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.000]   The annotated world that starts to make a lot more sense to me, Stacy.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   That makes a lot more sense.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   That is context.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Yep.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.400]   Well, wait, it also makes me listen to you guys.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.800]   Makes me think it should be disabled when you drive.
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.440]   And I'm trying to drive it.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.240]   You know, plenty of two more driving mode that's simplified.
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.880]   They're only gives you what you actually need for that very specific.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:18.040]   First focus comes off the distance and on to the lens, doesn't it?
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.480]   It might like, have you used the AR navigation?
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.320]   The Google AR navigation, like while you're walking.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.040]   Walking doesn't work well for me.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.040]   It's always confused.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.520]   I'm always going like this.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.000]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.360]   Do the figure eight thing.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.360]   You got a calibrator.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.360]   First, yeah.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.360]   I'm like an idiot on the street.
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.360]   Oh, no.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.360]   So instead of it.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.840]   So has it asked you, because Google will ask you instead of calibrating it.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.400]   It's like, hey, hold up your camera and let us see where you are.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.400]   Have you done that yet?
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.400]   Yes.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.960]   It works for three steps so that it gets confused again.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.520]   I have it doesn't work well in fairness, but it was so bad.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.880]   You can hear that.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.360]   You're magnetic.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:04.160]   But when you enter into that mode, it does an overlay on top of the real world.
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:09.320]   So I could see something like that being.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:13.720]   It's not there yet, but that I feel like could be where it's going.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.120]   You can see that on your windshield.
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.120]   Yes.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.120]   That'd be cool.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.120]   Okay.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.680]   No, we can't bring a car in.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:25.320]   That's a whole other system of like manufacturers of like API calls and like design and then
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.320]   I'd have to have a Google car versus an app.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.320]   No, no, yes.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.480]   Which of course is what I would do.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.560]   I would get a Google car.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.920]   I'm not getting an Apple car.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:42.440]   Being able to throw on a pair of glasses and immediately go outside and get this new contextual
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:48.000]   awareness of the world around you talking about superpowers like that right there is
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.520]   the killer app as far as I'm concerned based on what were all the different possibilities
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:53.880]   that we're talking about here.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.160]   If I knew that when I threw these glasses on and I went for a walk down town, I was
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:03.040]   going to immediately understand, oh, that place has a really great sale going on right
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.040]   now.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.160]   I would check it out or that place is as dead.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.160]   That awesome restaurant is as dead as it ever gets this moment.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.040]   Maybe I should go in there and get lunch.
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.960]   Things like that that actually impact your immediate life.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:22.880]   And actually beyond that, it's almost like you get a window into a world that doesn't
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.800]   exist without those glasses.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.280]   It's kind of like the first time we were square as dream was to do that.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.280]   Right.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.280]   Yes.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.280]   You don't have your phone in your pocket.
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.280]   Sorry, Stacy.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:35.280]   Well, one thing.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.720]   Well, I was just going to tell Jeff or Jeff, Jason, that he will have to still have his
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.160]   phone in his pocket because we don't have the computing power for this yet.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.160]   But okay.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.920]   And what is the killer app they'll never do?
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.200]   They'll never do is who the hell is that?
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   Oh my God.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.200]   Don't want those.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.200]   That privacy implications.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.200]   I would say terrible names.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.440]   Oh, I would love what if what if they did it so late?
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.040]   Here's here's what if they did this.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:10.480]   What if I opted into sharing my face data with my contacts and then Google's like, this
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.280]   is a contact of yours.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.240]   Would that be okay for you?
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.120]   You could put in your enemies as contacts.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.920]   I mean, if I'm busy, I'm busy.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:25.600]   Well, no, I would have to opt in to be like, Oh, you would have to as a subject.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.760]   Oh, but then yeah, things cool.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:33.480]   Yeah, and then also I would probably want some sort of like creep mode in that where
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.960]   I would be like, even though they're my contact, I don't want them.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:41.400]   So I might have to proactively go in and delete, you know, and I could always opt in
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.480]   to or opt out of it completely for everyone.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.160]   What about if they did it that way?
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.160]   I like that.
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:51.920]   Some sort of like quick disable or invisibility mode or something like that.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:52.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.400]   I still think like I think invisibility mode like so Google says in their they're talking
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.400]   about this.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.040]   They're not going to share data from sensitive areas like government buildings, hospitals,
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.400]   places like that.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:09.920]   I actually think Google has the power to shut that down on the device.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.800]   They're just saying they won't keep that data, but I actually think Google has the
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.760]   power to create an invisibility mode for people.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.560]   So yeah.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:20.960]   Yeah, y'all.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.320]   How do you think these?
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.520]   How is Amazon doing with Echo Frames?
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.880]   I know that they have a second generation, so they didn't totally kill it.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.040]   And I realize that it's definitely, you know, in comparison with what we're talking about,
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:41.440]   it's definitely a lot less than, you know, by comparison, but has Amazon been been at
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:48.160]   all successful with kind of bringing a kind of connected glasses to the market?
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:52.360]   I hear nothing about them, I feel like I haven't Kevin hated them.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:57.320]   I haven't ever encountered someone in the wild with them.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:04.320]   But I have encountered people with the Ray bands sunglasses that Ricky love them.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.480]   Like I've encountered four people in the wild wearing this, which isn't a lot, but you
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.800]   know, it's more than the Echo.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.680]   It's enough for New York Times Transfer-y.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.680]   That's a lot.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.840]   I feel like that is a lot.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.480]   Where are these people?
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:21.120]   Um, where are they people that would be panelists on this show or was it a real?
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.120]   So, yeah.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.120]   So hard and yeah.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.600]   And with the money at Tech conferences.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:36.120]   It ain't a lot of people with them then, if that's the case.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.120]   But still, I can't imagine many of those have been sold in the grand scheme of things.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.280]   So that's still the best buy.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.680]   There's lots of, there's three or four brands of listen to music classes.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.680]   Mm-hmm.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.680]   Right.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:54.520]   So, it's starting to be a better known interface.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.680]   And those are like one conduction sort of thing.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.680]   And I've tested pairs of those.
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.680]   They're actually quite nice.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.680]   Like, because you can hear the world around you.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:07.520]   Like, I would probably wear something like that if I didn't have glasses glasses.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.120]   I would pick up a pair of those for like, by ging or something like that.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.960]   But I can't see without my glasses.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.320]   Either can I or with contacts.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.320]   Either.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.320]   By the way, if you still have those classic Google Glass and they're not going to take
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.480]   them as trade in for these new things, which I'm really surprised if they did, but hey,
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.480]   you never know.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.400]   You could, I mean, I'm seeing them on eBay for like $450.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.640]   You could just sell.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:33.640]   Really?
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:34.640]   I want to buy them.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.640]   Apparently.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.640]   Google Glassics.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.640]   Buy and collect those items.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.640]   Yes.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.640]   Incidentally.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.640]   Exactly.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.640]   That's what you're doing there.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:50.360]   Well, I contributed my Osborne 1 to the museum of printing and Heyver Hill mass.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:55.160]   Maybe I can contribute to my Google Glass.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.160]   Maybe.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.840]   You got a tax deduction.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.200]   Nice try.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.760]   I think you should just take the cash myself.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.120]   Dordated from a schmuck.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.120]   On loan.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.120]   The collection.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.120]   You're not a schmuck.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.960]   It's so title.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.840]   You want to know if their Jarvis is a schmuck.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:16.840]   Well, Jarvis is not a schmuck.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.080]   Well, it will do with internet poll schmuck.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.080]   Not schmuck.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.880]   It's right left for not schmuck.
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:28.320]   It's right for schmuck.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.320]   Let's see here.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.320]   Should we talk a little bit about?
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.080]   I don't know how much there is to talk about this, but Google has officially announced
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.400]   that they are freezing their hiring process.
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:42.080]   They did say that if there's any hiring happening like in the, they're in the midst of hiring
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.480]   someone, they're not going to like totally shut that down.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:51.720]   But I guess new people that aren't already in the process of being hired by Google, you're
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.480]   going to have to wait your turn.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.120]   Who knows when that's going to be done?
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.120]   It's two weeks.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.120]   Oh, they say for two weeks.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:58.120]   Okay.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.120]   I think it was interesting considering the amount of time.
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.920]   It's a very short amount of time, but I think it's a signal.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.560]   I think it says, "Hold on, everybody.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.560]   We've got a plan.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.200]   Come and don't do anything."
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:13.000]   Otherwise, people are going to rush in and hire 20 people.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Right.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   Right.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   What is that plan?
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.200]   Is this all based on the downward turn of ad revenues or what?
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.960]   That's what I couldn't quite understand because they just talked about this last week of the
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.320]   season sort of slowing down or what have you.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.080]   Then now we got this report.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.520]   It's basically COVID-Turkey stopping it for two weeks.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.520]   What's the timing on that?
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.720]   This is July, the quarter is not over for another two months, right?
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.200]   Yeah, but we're in a bear market right now.
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.840]   So once you hit, it's like a magical time when everyone freaks out.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.760]   And everybody is freaking out.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.720]   All the big tech companies seem to be announcing something similar to this right now.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:25:01.480]   Microsoft Apple I think is Facebook certainly has.
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.080]   They're either announcing hiring freezes or announcing layoffs.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.080]   But a freak out has begun.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.080]   I see a lot of news.
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.080]   I see a lot of news.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.720]   One of my friends just got laid off.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.360]   Oh no.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.000]   Tick-tock has started laying off.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Even tick-tock.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Even the beloved tick-tock.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   That's right.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.720]   It's a excuse too to answer point.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:27.720]   And the Stacey's, when you hit a downturn, you could start doing things that you otherwise
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:29.280]   wouldn't do and use this as an excuse.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.680]   So you're not evil and nasty.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.680]   You're just, "Oh, sorry.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.680]   It's a down turn."
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.680]   This is business.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   I don't think it's that.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.960]   I just think it's like, "Okay, guys.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:43.000]   We're about to enter into, we're potentially about to enter into turbulent economic times."
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.440]   We had a plan in place, but seeing these signs, basically you're just putting on the breaks
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.760]   because you're like, "There is a windy road ahead."
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.320]   And what they'll do, like a two-week pause makes total sense.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:59.200]   So let's say you had open headcount, your 50-person division, you're basically like,
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.400]   you can't feel that yet.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:05.840]   Now, in two weeks after these are the priorities we're going to have, then you can pitch your
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.200]   open positions again.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.720]   I mean, it's just tapping the breaks a little bit.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.720]   You sound like you usually don't.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.720]   That's what is fascinating.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.160]   That is just a two-week window.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.480]   That's, I guess, because I don't quite get that.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.360]   No, that's what they can play in.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:26.240]   They're like, "Don't hire someone right now until we figure out how we want to handle
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.240]   this.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.240]   That's all this is."
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   Okay.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.240]   That makes more sense.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:36.400]   I don't know about you, but if you're looking at the market right now or like, we're self-employed,
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.680]   but like, if I had a job, I might be like, "Oh, dude, let's not make any big purchases
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:46.000]   for a second just to make sure, you know, we still want to see where things are going."
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.640]   It's the same thing because hiring someone's like making a big purchase.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.640]   Okay.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.680]   So now my next question is, "Why is this news?"
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:57.600]   And I don't think that's not working.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.680]   I just Google, "Why is this news?"
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:06.680]   Well, it's an indication that the market is freaking people out.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.680]   Okay.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:16.400]   And based on this, we should expect, like, maybe they'll extend the hiring freeze.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.880]   If they extend the hiring freeze and we find out about it, then we know that Google thinks
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:24.320]   this is going to be actually more severe than they originally have.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.240]   Or maybe they'll be like, "We're not going to hire anybody in our ad division."
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.240]   And that means they're not confident about ads.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:35.120]   Like, you'll get an indication of their priorities going forward, like where they think they're
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.320]   growth and what they need to maintain.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   Okay.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:42.120]   Or say hire a hundred people in their Chromebook division that I celebrate.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.120]   Oh, Jeff.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.920]   I bear a message.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:51.000]   Oh, I'll bear my message in a minute.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Your dog bears a message, apparently.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.880]   The message is the FedEx person is here.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.560]   Oh, goody.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.400]   What does the FedEx person bring?
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.480]   Not a Pixelbook.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.400]   The figure of the week now.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.200]   So oh, that's maybe I should keep this as my thing.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.200]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.200]   The dog.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.200]   Okay.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.880]   Kevin says, "Jeff, the dragon, is it the Lenovo Dragonfly?"
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:22.360]   Whatever his current Dragonfly Chromebook, that is the Chromebook for you.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.360]   So read that.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.240]   It was a big, like a big record.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:31.320]   This is the Chromebook that Pixel would have, this should have been the Pixel Chromebook
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.320]   were his words.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.880]   Oh, HP, LE Dragonfly.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:40.320]   You know, I saw it in Best Buy and I said, "Oh, this is HP, really?"
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.920]   I do read Kevin every week.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.680]   I just hadn't gotten to it today yet.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.160]   Oh, oh, Kevin.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.160]   There is actually Chromebook news too.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.160]   Oh, good.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.640]   Oh, there's a three to two aspect ratio on that.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.360]   Does that bother you, sir?
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.160]   I would assume not as a writer.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.160]   That's what I've got now.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.720]   What I had last time.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:02.720]   My father, Melito.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.360]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.800]   So there's a story in the rundown that says, "Osterlo did say that Google plans to make
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.320]   more Pixelbooks, by the way."
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.800]   He wouldn't say, "When?"
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.800]   That was an I/O.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   So.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   So, so.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.000]   So, if you need something for your--
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.920]   They're going to make more two years from now or three years from now or what?
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:25.920]   That's not--
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.920]   First by Bubble Land.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:27.920]   First thing.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.560]   I'm going to keep it straight with you, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.280]   Oh, no, this is a new one.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.840]   I had to get the go because my old one died.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.840]   So my battery just died.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.840]   This is the go.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.840]   Which is fine.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.040]   Kevin wouldn't have-- well, Kevin wouldn't-- he didn't have the courage to recommend anything
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.040]   explicitly.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.000]   He didn't want to be playing for anything.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.160]   Didn't Kevin Tofol like the Pixelbook go?
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.480]   If I remember correctly?
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.480]   Yeah, he did.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.480]   He did.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.480]   He did.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:59.240]   The other one I was going to get is one of those that folds back, but then the screen
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.440]   digs into your knees.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.000]   And it's kind of weird.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.760]   And I wasn't that happy about it.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:06.360]   And so I like this one.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:09.800]   It's not as bright outside as I want, but it's a good machine.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.800]   Not enough knits.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   Well, then--
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:20.880]   I'm going to have to wait a little bit longer for your Pixelbook.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.120]   I doubt that it's going to be-- have the mobile internet support for it, but--
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.280]   I don't care about it.
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.840]   I was going to ask, yeah.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.040]   What's that got rid of?
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:37.320]   Well what's that got rid of my grandfather AT&T plan that wouldn't do tethering?
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.120]   And finally just surrender.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.120]   Okay, AT&T.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.120]   I see.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.120]   I see.
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.440]   Now tethers immediately, and I should have done it years before, and I was just being stubborn.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.440]   Uh, but--
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.440]   You?
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.440]   I am.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.440]   And so I don't care about having LTE anymore.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.240]   You can just tether in space, basically.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.240]   Off the list.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.240]   Okay.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.240]   Well, that's good that that's off your list, because apparently they don't really do that
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.240]   much.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   It's not going to be on any point.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.600]   It's not their jam.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.360]   It's not their jam anymore.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:18.880]   On the Chrome OS tip, apparently there is a story in here on ZDNet about taking old Linux
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.480]   desktops and transforming them into Chrome OS, I guess.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.720]   Google has-- does Google have a kind of a service now or a way of--
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:31.000]   Well, they have a version of Chrome.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.560]   You can take to all Windows machines.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.680]   I don't know if you can do with Macs or not.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.680]   Okay.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.320]   But yeah, you can have the sense now to finally have a Chromebook.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:44.640]   The red don't know is what updating they will do of those, because Chromebooks do go
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.240]   out of update at some point.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.760]   So if a old machine but a new build of Chrome, I don't know how that operates.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.760]   I have no idea.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.320]   Yeah, good question.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.320]   Good question.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.840]   Chrome OS Flex is what that is called.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:07.640]   One of our listeners up in the Pacific Northwest, Ryan Lonsberry, mentioned doing this and hasn't
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:12.480]   had any issues with putting it on an old machine and seemed quite happy, because I was complaining
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.840]   about my computer over the weekend acting up.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:20.760]   And he was like, "Huh, well, I just tried this new Chrome and works just totally fine.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:21.960]   Getting work done with it too."
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:22.960]   So nice.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.960]   It's not--
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.320]   Speaking of getting new things, Ant, we missed the big story of the week.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.320]   We forgot.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.320]   I forgot.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.320]   I read this on Twitter.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:30.320]   They're important.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.520]   Are you getting a new Pixel 6?
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.240]   They finally admitted that it's broken?
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.120]   Well, sir.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.680]   It just got here.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.680]   Oh, big zoos.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:49.440]   Yeah, so I'm going to have to wipe the other one and get everything transferred.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.880]   But it just-- it made me mad because I said something nice about the dad gum phone last
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.880]   week on the show.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.560]   And then the weekend, it just totally went to crap.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.160]   I mean, everything-- it just-- I don't know what happened.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.440]   Two inches away from my Wi-Fi.
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.440]   I had to-- well, we'll do anything.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.440]   And it was just--
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.440]   And it was just--
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.440]   --day.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.360]   And I'm sitting here looking at the router and it was no Wi-Fi.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.000]   Phone calls stopped working.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.720]   Or the phone would ring and I would answer it and no one would hear me.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.200]   But yeah, I'd call back.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.200]   Oh, I mean--
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   They could hear me.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.200]   I mean, it just totally went to crap.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.080]   And I'm like, I just bragged about this dad gum phone.
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.080]   So--
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.360]   How hard was it to convince Google that it was dead?
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:31.560]   Not very hard because I can write quite sternly if I need to.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.560]   And that's--
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.400]   The email was full of capitalization.
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.120]   That's basically all that I want.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.240]   So that seemed to work because I used to be in tech support.
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.680]   So I know about all of the scripts and stuff and that they need to do.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:44.720]   So I've already had all of that stuff ready to go.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:47.120]   And I literally just pasted it here.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.120]   All right.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.120]   Oh, you showed the volume.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.560]   All the-- that's just-- you've already done.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:52.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.560]   And I was like, so look.
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.280]   So don't even start your little tree-eye stuff with me.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:58.200]   I don't even bother with that.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.720]   And I usually say that in there.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.680]   And they're like, well, OK, Mr. Pruitt,
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.040]   and here's your order for the replacement.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:07.160]   Like, like, no back and forth at all.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.200]   That was it.
[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:08.720]   Oh, no.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.160]   It took about 15 minutes total.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.240]   That's awesome.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:12.760]   That's awesome.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.640]   And you've got to-- you've got to rent yourself out for this.
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:17.200]   Yeah, I'm kidding.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.080]   It's all about stern writing.
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:22.560]   That's all it is.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.000]   You didn't even have to hop on the phone.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:24.760]   That's what's amazing.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.160]   I'm not even-- I didn't call anybody.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.800]   I did it all over the little chat thing.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.920]   Because they have-- you know, they have a little pixel help
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.880]   stuff in no way.
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:37.000]   And you just hit the little chat button and literally just
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:37.520]   hit paste.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.880]   Because I had already started a little note.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.640]   And I just copied paste and waited.
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.720]   And it was about 15 minutes.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.240]   Totally.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.240]   And the tricky thing about that, though,
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:51.040]   is like, I have definitely heard from people
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.280]   who have had that experience when it comes
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.720]   to support from Google.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.200]   And then I have also heard from people
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.680]   who have had the exact opposite of that experience
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:00.600]   when it comes to support from Google.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.080]   It's never like a 100%.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.640]   All you got to do is hit them up on chat.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.880]   And tell them exactly what it is.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.360]   And it's going to result in this sort of outcome.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.440]   Sometimes it's hit or miss.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:15.120]   Sometimes is it dependent on the CSR
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:17.560]   that you are actually communicating with?
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.560]   Probably.
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:18.920]   Possibly.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.760]   To some degree.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.960]   But you just don't really know.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.040]   Possibly.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.880]   But this person, they did attempt to go into their script.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.560]   And I shut it down.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.160]   No, you're not doing this.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.360]   Just already gone through that.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.360]   Let's just go ahead and move this along.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:39.200]   And the other thing they mentioned was repairs.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.800]   And I remember saying, no, you're not--
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.120]   I'm not going to send you this phone to repair it.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.120]   This phone costs way too much to have
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.200]   to be repaired in under a year.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.000]   Send me another phone.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   That's good.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.520]   Good work.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.880]   Good work.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.920]   So that's where we get a report.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.160]   No, there was not a please in there at all.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:57.680]   It's stern.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.160]   OK, that's where I fall down.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.600]   I'm always like, I would like a phone, please.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:02.120]   Please?
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:02.640]   No.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:02.800]   OK.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.720]   It's stern.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.360]   Well, I could be stern and still say please.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:08.920]   Oh, I bet you-- no, no.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.760]   I can't put please in there if I'm going to be stern.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.440]   I have a mom voice.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.680]   That'd be scared of you.
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.320]   Nah.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.840]   Are you hopeful or optimistic that this new device will
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.960]   solve all your problems?
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.520]   And you'll suddenly be like, oh, maybe I have a lemon all along.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.640]   Like, maybe this is--
[00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:35.240]   I'm optimistic because the phone did get better with those last two
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.000]   or three updates.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.320]   It did get better.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.240]   But like I said, I don't know what happened last weekend.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.920]   Just totally random.
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.680]   Trying to talk to my mother and just weird.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:49.640]   And anywhere I'd go in the house-- and I know the house
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.240]   has some dead spots or whatever.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.920]   This was everywhere I went.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:55.560]   And then you try to call over Wi-Fi.
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.840]   And none of that was working, even standing next to the dad
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.520]   gum router.
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.600]   So yeah, something.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.280]   So it's really good.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.760]   It's on.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.200]   Are you maybe going through all this
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.160]   to avoid talking to your mother and having a good excuse for it?
[00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.320]   I will not say such a thing on air because remember,
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:14.240]   I've told you before, my mother trolls
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.440]   mean when I bring up stuff like this on air.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.160]   So I don't know what else you're such a thing.
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:21.160]   You've got some explaining to do.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.360]   It's coming.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.360]   Love you, moms.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.960]   Hope you had a good trip to Cleveland.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:32.000]   All right, let's take a pause.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.760]   That was a lot of Google and one block.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:34.720]   Didn't that feel good?
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.720]   Wasn't that a good rating?
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.720]   Look at that.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.040]   Yeah, we delayed it.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.640]   Don't tell the most about what we did this.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.920]   Hey, I'm cool if we don't talk about you a lot of times.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.680]   That's just how I feel.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:49.120]   I think a victory for Twitter is worth at least no doubt.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.040]   That's true.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.680]   OK, fair enough.
[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:56.160]   That's someone's good story, but we don't need a whole cluster.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:56.920]   All right.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.400]   All right, so how about this?
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.000]   We'll give you the victory lap for Twitter.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.480]   Although it's maybe it's too early for a victory lap.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.240]   But it's-- yeah, it is.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.760]   But a victory clap.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.240]   But it's a golf clap for Twitter.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.320]   We'll give the victory clap to Twitter.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.120]   After we thank the sponsor of this episode of This Week
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:18.480]   in Google, this episode is brought to you by HPE GreenLake.
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.440]   That's orchestrated by the experts at CDW.
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.360]   The helpful people actually at CDW,
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.360]   they're going to understand and they do,
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.080]   that your organization needs simple management
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.600]   over its big data.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:34.160]   But with some needing to keep their workloads on-prem
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.840]   due to organizational requirements,
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.960]   it can feel challenging to organize and then optimize
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.480]   your data.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:44.640]   And that's where CDW can help your organization by consolidating
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:48.200]   and managing all your data in one flexible, unified

[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.800]   and streamlined management.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:10.200]   And well, let's be honest, we could all use more streamlined
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:11.800]   things, so that's good.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.240]   Not only that HPE GreenLake creates a seamless cloud
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.440]   experience among multiple data environments
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.400]   thanks to the as-a-service model that actually

[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.600]   business growth so your team can tackle bigger priorities,
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.640]   like, I don't know, innovation, right?
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.600]   When you need to get more out of your technology,
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.800]   HPE makes data transformation possible.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.080]   CDW makes it powerful.

[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:54.000]   And we thank CDW for their support of this week in Google.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.320]   All right, so OK, so let's give Twitter a little victory
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.200]   clap here.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.160]   And what are we talking about?
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:06.040]   Well, they were-- well, OK, so Musk-- Elon Musk
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.400]   was trying to get this trial, I think, delayed
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:14.440]   into next year for reasons, I'm sure.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.960]   Twitter wanted this soon.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.160]   They wanted it fast.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:18.400]   And that's what they got.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.760]   It begins in October.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.440]   The trial will be expedited.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.160]   So five-day trial, which is definitely
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.120]   a point for Twitter worthy of a golf clap.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.520]   And it's about all I have to say about that.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.040]   I'm curious what y'all think about this.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:34.960]   So I must exhausted at this point.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:38.480]   -Maznik listened to the beginning of it, at least,
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:39.640]   and had a good report.
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.840]   And part of what was happening here was that Twitter
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.160]   was smashing through Musk right and left.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:50.160]   And the judge didn't question Twitter at all.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.880]   Musk's arguments were kind of dismissed.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:57.080]   So the mood of it was--
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:58.480]   you can't read too much into it.
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.920]   It was just about the only issue was the timing.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:02.640]   But the judge made clear that there
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.280]   was damage to the company here if this went on longer.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.600]   So Musk won in February, Twitter won in September.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.000]   They got October.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:17.640]   And so I think it's a first good sign here on the Twitter case.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:21.000]   -Sure. -Yeah.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.360]   I mean, yeah.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.520]   He's just got to put up or shut up.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.440]   You can't be in limbo this long as a corporate entity.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:29.760]   So that makes sense.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:32.200]   I mean, imagine if you worked for Twitter right now.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.760]   It'd be awesome. -Oh, God.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.600]   Yeah, I have to.
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.600]   Yeah, and I know no one directly that works at Twitter.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:41.120]   But I have to imagine that this has been really, really
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.840]   challenging for anyone that works there.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:47.240]   You're really questioning your choices, you know,
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:48.960]   and wondering, do I stay?
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.040]   Do I go?
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.480]   Am I confident in the vision of Twitter
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:57.120]   that was versus where it's headed right now?
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:00.440]   Like, everything is one giant question mark.
[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.080]   And yeah, how unfortunate.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.560]   Like, it's unfortunate that something like this comes along.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.760]   And completely shakes the foundation.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.120]   I mean, it's underperforming and on Wall Street.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:13.120]   It's just, it's just for a company that I appreciate
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.800]   and use regularly, it's sad.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.720]   -Mm-hmm. -Yep.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.920]   Well, even with a company that, like Twitter, well,
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.880]   even if Musk was not even in the picture,
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.600]   someone to come in to want to buy them out,
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.960]   how was Twitter's future looking anyway?
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:32.560]   Because again, you just mentioned that there are sort of
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.480]   a decline as far as revenues go.
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.640]   What do they have in place to sort of write the ship?
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.080]   We don't know.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.200]   They had, what was it?
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.280]   Blue, blue sky?
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.280]   I mean, blue, the $3,000 is not the best.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.160]   The four of us that only people are using,
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.920]   that's not going to save them, you know?
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.520]   Well, if they got $20 billion in the bank from Musk,
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.960]   just to pick a number out of the thin air
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:58.360]   that gives a lot of runway to the wall development.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.240]   Blue sky...
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.880]   You don't have the...
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.480]   Yeah, go on.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.120]   I was going to say there's no articulate vision
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.800]   for what Twitter, like,
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.960]   is it Agraball?
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:12.480]   Agraball. -I can't say his name.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.560]   Agraball?
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.520]   Yeah, there's no... -Agraball.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.880]   There's no vision yet. -That's what you're talking about.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.720]   No, it's not Agraball.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.640]   What you're about to say, I think,
[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:22.520]   Jeff, about Big Sky is interesting,
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.840]   but like, is that the future?
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.680]   We don't know.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:25.280]   Could they invest in that?
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.320]   Sure, but you don't give $20 billion to someone
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.400]   in who doesn't know what they're going to do with it
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:31.640]   from a company perspective.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.480]   Well, so that's the question of the board and the CEO,
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.160]   what's about the leadership?
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.160]   There's also a different owners' structure now,
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.680]   because there was another hedgy
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.840]   who is betting long on Twitter and short on Musk,
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:48.000]   and he's now one of the top five shareholders.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.200]   We had another one last week called Hindenburg
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.600]   that is also helping shareholders.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:54.960]   That's right. -That's right.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.800]   So...
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.440]   The humanity, oh, the humanity!
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:03.280]   And so the shareholders, the large shareholders,
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.600]   I think we'll have things to say about where Twitter goes,
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:08.160]   who runs it to one end.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:11.440]   As you know, I've talked about,
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.440]   I don't know how to say it on the show,
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:15.720]   I'm enthusiastic about the model of Blue Sky,
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.800]   discussion as a protocol,
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.760]   building value-added layers on top of that.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.280]   I think if Twitter basically is basically the way
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.280]   to reopen the excitement of the API days
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.400]   when it started and people were doing neat things with it,
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   and if you could make that part of the company,
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.160]   I think good things could happen.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.760]   We'll see, but I don't want it to get all messed up.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.280]   I think people also go crazy online about it.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.600]   What do you...
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.040]   You don't want Musk to buy it.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.800]   And I said, "Teveray, it's negotiation."
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:52.480]   Unless they get so obvious they're gonna win in court,
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.520]   that's when Musk's backing is against the wall,
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.480]   that's when you negotiate with him,
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.080]   and that's when you try to get a lot more
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.560]   than a billion dollars out of him
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.400]   and get rid of him at the same time, then it's a win-win.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:07.680]   Yeah, that'd be a smart-
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.000]   - There should be a German name for that.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.120]   Is there a German name for that?
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.800]   That type of-
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.640]   - Like she's win-win.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:14.640]   - See, see.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.360]   I guess I don't know what it is, yeah.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.200]   Twitter, see.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.560]   There you go.
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:23.880]   Okay.
[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:24.720]   Twitter, crazy.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.560]   Is that enough Musk?
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.760]   - That's plenty of us. - That's for me.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.000]   Are we wearing enough Musk right now?
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.320]   Can move on.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.160]   - It does. - Hey, you know what?
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.480]   Yeah, how cute.
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:39.320]   Hey, you know what?
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.040]   Dolly too.
[00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.640]   They're opening up their wait list.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.800]   Apparently they're looking for 1 million users.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.720]   They plan to do that within the next two weeks.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.480]   You can get on their wait list if you haven't already.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.960]   You can go to the site and sign up for Dolly too,
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.000]   and start making some imagery.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.480]   That's pretty cool.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.480]   I wanna make some images, see what it can come up with.
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:45:59.880]   Oh, the form is great.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.360]   First name and the fill in the blank name
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.800]   that's just the whole root space there,
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.600]   a Salvador, last name, Dolly.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:11.000]   Nice.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.480]   Clever.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.240]   I've signed up.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.400]   I don't know what I'm gonna put in there
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.040]   when it comes through eventually.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.480]   Hopefully I get picked off the wait list,
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.840]   but I'll hold my breath.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:22.160]   - Dude.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.960]   - You could be, like you could do.
[00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:27.960]   I'm looking forward to building images for my stories
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.120]   'cause there's no way to talk for IoT, right?
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.400]   So I'm like, oh, what kind of crazy images
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.520]   can I build for spectral efficiency?
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:38.520]   - I mean, seriously though,
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:43.200]   I'm gonna be really curious to see how this does
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.560]   in that direction,
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.000]   because that seems what this is really ripe for.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.800]   And actually with this new kind of transition
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:55.560]   into essentially being a paid for service,
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.520]   50 free for the first month, 15,
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.720]   and it's a credit based system by the way.
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.960]   So 50 free credits the first month,
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.880]   15 free every month after,
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.480]   and then you can purchase additional credits,
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.960]   $15 for 115 credits.
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.600]   I don't think that 115 credits means 115 images.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.040]   I think it breaks down less than that.
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.960]   But what this grants you for the first time
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:16.200]   is full usage rights.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.520]   So commercialization, reprinting, selling,
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.720]   merchandise rights, all that stuff.
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.680]   So these images become really useful
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.800]   and perhaps very valuable for really low costs.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:26.640]   It's kind of crazy.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.320]   Like usually you would need to hire a digital artist
[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.320]   to do a lot of this stuff.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:33.600]   And I have to imagine certain people in that realm
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.920]   are have to be worried at least a little bit
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.280]   about losing some business to this.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:43.200]   - Yeah, you basically created an AI graphic designer,
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.040]   which is probably a little bit.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:45.120]   - Yes. - But yeah,
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.520]   AI artist, AI mechanic, like yeah.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.680]   - Graphical artists, yeah, something like that.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:51.880]   - Illustrator. - Yeah.
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:52.720]   - Maybe illustrator?
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.280]   - I don't think that it will be a problem
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.600]   for that particular industry
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.480]   because that industry has relationships
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.720]   and they tend to get their business
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.240]   based on their relationships and skills,
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.200]   not just their skills, you know.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:12.680]   - Well, your field destroyed the business of illustrators
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.320]   before photography and half-tones
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.360]   came along to publications.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.920]   When Lincoln was killed,
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.960]   Harper's sent illustrators down on train to Washington
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.280]   to draw, to get back as quick as possible
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.880]   to draw them and etch them.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.600]   And all this kind of stuff went on.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.880]   And then photography came along and boom,
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.640]   tons of illustrators were out of work
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:37.160]   because you and your photography folk,
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.480]   you're welcome. - You're welcome.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.400]   So,
[00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:43.400]   - The only place they live is in court reporting
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.800]   and in fashion, 'cause they're still, I'm serious.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.480]   - Those are the two areas where you still have
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.000]   actual illustrators working.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.680]   - Addy. - Your fault, Aunt.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:59.080]   But I mean, from like graphic designers,
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.840]   I'm sitting here thinking that one of the--
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.640]   - That wasn't the right-- - Illustrators.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.920]   Illustrators. - Yeah, I'm thinking
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.240]   more of an illustrator. - Illustrators, I mean like--
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.320]   - Okay.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.160]   - I mean, imagine all that silly art you have
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.080]   every time that, you know,
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.280]   the Atlantic does another hot take.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.480]   - All right. - Do that.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:15.480]   - Right. - I think it was a--
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.760]   - An analogy, I got it. - Somebody was doing,
[00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:19.400]   I'm getting logos made with it.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:21.320]   And it was pretty deep, what I could do.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.160]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:26.800]   - Yeah, I mean, is it gonna absolutely replace,
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.960]   you know, any human whatsoever out there doing this sort of stuff?
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.360]   No, but there's probably a lot of people
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.160]   who would much rather pay the low, low cost of this
[00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:37.680]   and just accept what it churns out
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.920]   as opposed to hire someone, I hate to say,
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.440]   but that's probably true, right?
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.440]   Like I just need this to be fast.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:43.440]   - There's gonna be people doing it.
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:44.760]   - And I hate it now. - Yeah.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:46.200]   - There'll definitely be people doing it.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.800]   - Yeah, but if you take the likes of a,
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.200]   and this may be a bad example,
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.600]   take the likes of a big brand like Nike,
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.120]   they're probably not gonna do that.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.960]   They're probably gonna-- - Yeah, Nike's not gonna do it.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.760]   - No, no, you're right. - No.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:58.880]   - Right. - Yeah, I would do it.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:00.400]   Yeah, totally.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.720]   - Like a little blog or even not a super little blog
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:07.920]   might do it just because it's fast,
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.480]   it's easy, you don't have to deal with a person.
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.840]   - Yeah, right.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:14.920]   - The people who are turning to a service like Fiverr
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:18.160]   to get a quick turnaround kind of digital thing made.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.720]   - Exactly.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:24.080]   - Oh, not his daughter. - But her soap business.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.200]   - Right. - Right.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.400]   - Yeah, something along those lines.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.840]   - Yeah, yeah, I guess something pretty cool.
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:34.600]   - And I won, oh sorry, did I cut you off?
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:38.560]   Well, I was wondering if as this type of thing
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.720]   gets built out, like we're at a point right now
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.720]   where we can say, Robert Redford's head
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.840]   as an ice cream cone.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.280]   I don't know what the random thing is
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.000]   that you want an image as.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.360]   But you say a short sentence
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.360]   and it gives you something and you either like it
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:56.200]   or you don't.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.760]   It's either close to what you were thinking
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.600]   or hoping to see or maybe you didn't even know
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.440]   what you were hoping to see,
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.160]   but it's something along the lines of what you said and great.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.880]   If this system gets built out to a point to where
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:08.360]   you can give it multiple layers of instructions
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:11.240]   similar to what you could do with a real digital artist
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.240]   or a designer and say, all right,
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.800]   what I'm looking for is I need a logo,
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.160]   it's gotta be green, it kind of looks like a baseball,
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.320]   but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.160]   - To the style of. - You know,
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.400]   with all this detail, to the style of doot doot doot.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.200]   And you can go into that kind of level of detail
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.360]   and then get something back.
[00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.440]   Then I think digital artists and designers,
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:32.880]   you know, they probably would have to worry
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:34.080]   about something like that, right?
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.120]   'Cause then it does get into the realm
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.360]   of replacing potentially.
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:42.360]   I still disagree because a lot of digital artists
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.760]   that are creating things for brands,
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.680]   that communication, that face to face communication
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:52.040]   is really, really critical because, yeah, okay,
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.880]   the proposed client is gonna have a particular vision in mind.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:00.160]   And sometimes it is the responsibility of the artist
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.640]   to say, you know what, that is a great idea,
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.280]   let's shake that up or you know what,
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.160]   maybe we should fine tune this a little bit
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:09.560]   because you're gonna be able to get a little bit more reach
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.680]   and that kind of thing.
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:14.000]   You know, and that tends to happen way more
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.400]   than one would realize, you know,
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:18.480]   just because you could see a great logo in your head
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.920]   that doesn't necessarily mean it's the right logo for you.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:21.760]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.880]   - And that's when those artists come in.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.720]   Here's what I thought.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.960]   - There's gonna be no like thing in Dolly that's like,
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.640]   by the way, that's really insensitive
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.960]   to the following group of people.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.640]   - There you go, exactly.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.000]   You know, and I think about,
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.080]   this sort of makes me think back to the handful of years ago
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.800]   when Adobe Sensei, it's AI,
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:43.440]   started to pick up a lot of traction
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.680]   and putting tools inside a Photoshop in Lightroom.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.720]   And a lot of the tech media was saying,
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:53.520]   oh boy, this is just gonna make it to where photographers
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.680]   or the thing of the past,
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:57.880]   because you know, their Photoshop skills
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:00.360]   are just gonna be accessible by anybody.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.920]   And that's not even the case.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.400]   What that did was made it easier
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.040]   for people like me to do those repeated tasks a lot faster
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.800]   because of that AI that's in there.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:13.160]   And I think this is just sort of gonna play hand in hand.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.080]   - And you also though, you could get things
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.640]   that inspire the illustrator to work.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.200]   I put on something in the chat.
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:23.720]   And now for Stacy mainly, I think,
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:27.280]   Waldo Jekwith, who has access to Dolly,
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.640]   put in a prompt of product photograph
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:34.120]   of the Univac risk computer made by Spary Rand in 1967.
[00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:37.120]   It's in the Twitch chat, if you want the link.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:41.800]   - Oh, that great example.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.440]   - Okay, I see it.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.760]   I'm just moving it over to the doc, if that's helpful.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.240]   Sorry, I should--
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.580]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:51.840]   I'm unable to view this tweet
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.440]   because this account owner limits you.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:55.200]   They protected a tweet.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:59.320]   - Yeah. - Oh, wow, I'm honored.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.640]   - They protected a tweet.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:01.480]   (laughing)
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:03.800]   - Privilege, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:04.640]   (laughing)
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.120]   - Wow, it's so special.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.280]   - Tell us how awesome it is, Jeff.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:11.040]   - Well, you'll just have to keep your magic.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.360]   - You know, he's sitting there again,
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.600]   at the beginning of the show, talking about
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.760]   he's just so everyday yet he's got a theme song
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.120]   and he's got privileged tweets right here.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:19.960]   - Ah!
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.360]   - Yeah, that's a theme song.
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.920]   - Yeah, that was a theme song.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:23.760]   - Bad.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.600]   (laughing)
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:27.560]   - You already got a laminated card, Aunt.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.400]   Wasn't that enough?
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.240]   - Laminated card.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.400]   - Wasn't that enough.
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.960]   (laughing)
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:32.800]   - Jeez.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:37.520]   - Well, I'm excited to use Dolly.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.240]   Who knows how far and wide it's going to go
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.520]   and make impact.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:44.000]   - I don't think it's gonna hurt anything myself.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.360]   It's just to be clear.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.800]   I don't think it's gonna hurt anything.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.360]   It's definitely gonna help a lot of people out
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.560]   and it can even enhance some of the stuff
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:53.000]   that we already have in place
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.920]   in that particular industry, in my opinion.
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.480]   - I think you'll see more illustration
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.280]   where you otherwise wouldn't have seen it.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.880]   Where people are now putting up photos,
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.120]   they don't have the rights to.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.440]   I wanna illustrate my little blog post
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.000]   and this would be a wonderful way to do it.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   What I don't want to see is a bunch of board ape stuff.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:13.920]   - Oh, worry.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.760]   - No computer would make that.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.760]   Only stupid males would make that.
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.560]   (laughing)
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:21.120]   In the style of board apes.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:21.960]   - Actually, too.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:22.800]   - That's your idea.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:23.640]   - Yeah, there's an ape.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:24.480]   - Any query.
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.480]   (laughing)
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.960]   - They were all these little ape bit,
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.240]   it was kind of funny, all over Paris on the buildings,
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.040]   there were just like random little ape bit
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:34.040]   kind of drawings of different things.
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.840]   And I was like, I wonder what those are about.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.720]   And my child who, you know, at 15,
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:42.560]   is like, ugh, it's a bunch of tech bros in their NFTs.
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.400]   (laughing)
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:45.240]   - That was awesome.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:49.200]   So that whole thing, it is destroyed.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.600]   It is destroyed ape bit illustration for this person
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.960]   and possibly this generation.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:54.800]   I was like, take it.
[00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:55.640]   - Right, right.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.480]   (laughing)
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.320]   - That's a little bit more.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:01.560]   - That's great, that's great.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:04.720]   Hey Stacey, tell us about Matt,
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.760]   what's the matter with Matt or probably nothing's
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:09.160]   the matter with Matt or but there's at least some matter news
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.400]   and you wrote about it.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.720]   So tell us a little bit about a Matt M.A.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:15.080]   and how it's getting ready for Matt or.
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:18.720]   - Yeah, so today, Amazon did their big developer event
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.840]   for developers.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:24.440]   Sorry for those doing and I'm gonna say the name.
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:26.320]   So if you have an Amazon Echo,
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:27.760]   this is a good time to mute it
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:31.160]   or to just be prepared for things to happen.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:34.880]   It's called the Live and they,
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:39.160]   all this basically matter is set to come out
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.880]   at the sometime in the fall.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.800]   So we're seeing all these companies talk about like,
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.680]   hey, we're launching this ahead of matter.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:50.040]   So the big news for people who like smart homes
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:52.520]   are that Amazon is doing,
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:56.200]   it's setting up Alexa for what's called multi-admin.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.360]   So one of the big things people are excited about with matter
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.080]   is this feature called multi-epin
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:04.360]   and that means you could have a Google and an Echo
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:07.040]   and a Siri and the app from the manufacturer
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.640]   and you do things once in one of those places
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.560]   and they'll propagate to all of them
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:13.280]   and then you'll be able to control your stuff
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.120]   from all of those places, right?
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.120]   Which is exciting.
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:20.480]   So Amazon said, if you name a device,
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:24.200]   whatever that name is, it will propagate everywhere
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.440]   and your group names will propagate everywhere
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:29.160]   and they released an API for that.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.400]   They also announced something called the ambient,
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:35.840]   it's like the ambient home dev kit.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.640]   I think it's the ambient home dev kit.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:41.640]   And that is really cool because they're taking
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:43.160]   like kind of this proactive approach
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.000]   that they started with hunches.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.680]   So like, I don't know if y'all use hunches,
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.960]   do y'all use hunches?
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.280]   - No.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.880]   No, if you turn it.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:52.240]   - Not in the text yet.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:53.600]   - If you turn it.
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.440]   - No.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:57.840]   So if you have an Alexa use hunches,
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:01.040]   if you turn it on, it'll like randomly suggest things
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:03.640]   like it had a hunch for me one day that like,
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:04.520]   oh, you're going to bed.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.920]   Do you wanna add your locks to this routine
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.320]   or do you wanna turn on your locks?
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.160]   - That's cool.
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:11.960]   - Lock your door.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:12.800]   Right.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.640]   So it's proactive steps.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:18.360]   So with this dev kit, now other developers
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:22.680]   can have their devices have hunches too basically.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.200]   They don't call it hunches.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.400]   The only thing they have right now is the stuff
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.600]   that I mentioned about naming for matter
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.320]   in a home and away.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.320]   So the home and away will be like,
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:35.440]   some device will be like, oh, craky,
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:37.160]   Stacy's away from home.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.680]   And maybe my room is device if I've given it permission
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:43.040]   and they use this kit, this SDK,
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.000]   they can be like, oh, you're away.
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.440]   Let's get Terence, which is the name of my room.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:50.360]   Let's get your room about cleaning the floor right now.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.620]   So that'll be cool.
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:55.460]   I feel like there's some other stuff,
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:57.540]   but those are the two cool things.
[00:58:57.540 --> 00:58:59.940]   And then they updated thread for matter, I think,
[00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:01.580]   which you may care about or not.
[00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:04.140]   - Sure, go for it.
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.820]   (laughs)
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:06.660]   - Oh, no.
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:07.500]   - 'Cause you wrote about this too.
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:08.340]   - Okay.
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:09.180]   - You wrote about this too.
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:10.020]   - Yeah.
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:11.740]   I actually wrote stories this week.
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:12.580]   Amazing.
[00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:14.500]   - I know, well, I went to, I went to Stacy on my own TV.
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:16.220]   Yeah, there were tons of stories.
[00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:19.620]   - That's when you get stuff done is on vacation apparently.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:20.620]   - No, it was coming back.
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.780]   - Or refreshed coming back.
[00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:22.620]   - I was like, oh.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:27.540]   With thread, they've basically thread,
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:31.420]   if y'all aren't aware, it's a wireless low data rate mesh
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:33.540]   network that is also IP enabled.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:35.740]   Google actually was the birthplace of thread.
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:38.340]   Tony Fadal was like, hey, we should do thread.
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:40.740]   And since Google had bought Nest, Google's like, all right,
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:41.660]   yeah, we'll do thread.
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:46.820]   So basically this update does two big things.
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:50.860]   One, it identifies what a border router is.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:52.820]   So with thread, you have all these low powered nodes
[00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.820]   that can talk to something called a border router.
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:57.700]   And that just basically the border router uses,
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:01.060]   it's plugged into a wall and it talks to wifi in the internet.
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:03.180]   Yes, your individual thread devices can talk out
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:05.300]   to the internet, but it would be silly
[01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:06.580]   because it would suck a lot of power.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:08.340]   So you just talk to your border router.
[01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:10.220]   Anyway, this update basically says,
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.740]   here's how border routers are gonna work.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:14.020]   Here's how you can add devices to border routers.
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:15.820]   Here's how all this stuff is gonna happen.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:19.060]   And that's great because a lot of devices were coming online,
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.540]   ahead of matter is border routers,
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:23.220]   but they didn't work quite right and together
[01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.420]   and it was kind of difficult for developers.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.180]   So this fixes that.
[01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:31.140]   Then it also makes TCP/IP be a primary way
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:36.140]   to talk to thread or to thread uses TCP/IP
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:39.700]   to talk to the internet.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:42.340]   Beforehand, you could actually opt in or out of that
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:44.380]   and it was kind of a good pain.
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:45.220]   That's it.
[01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:49.580]   These are pretty nerdy, not exciting stories.
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.660]   - We're here for the nerdism.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:52.620]   We're here for the nerdy.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:55.500]   - Yeah, they're a little nerdyer than that.
[01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:57.140]   - Even for you?
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:59.460]   - Oh wait, you're gonna get ads on your Echo Show.
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:03.300]   As an consumer, this is what you care about.
[01:01:03.300 --> 01:01:07.100]   Amazon said developers can in the app
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.260]   and on the Echo Show, you can promote your skills.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:13.300]   So y'all are gonna start seeing promoted skills
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.660]   on your Echo Show devices.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:17.620]   Eventually you're gonna hear them.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.620]   - So basically promoted skills,
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.580]   like it would flash by and say,
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.100]   you can ping this service for blah, blah, blah.
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:26.500]   I wanna install it or wanna add,
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.820]   I don't know, I don't have an Echo device,
[01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.380]   but something along those lines
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:32.020]   and then you could add it from there
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:35.860]   or ads outside of the ecosystem.
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.020]   - I think it's gonna be like,
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:40.100]   hey, would you like to try the skill up
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.980]   and it's gonna poke on your Echo Show somehow
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:42.860]   or in the app?
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:43.700]   - Yeah.
[01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.540]   - Okay.
[01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:45.380]   - So.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:48.820]   - You either like that that space is being used like that
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:49.660]   or not.
[01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:50.820]   One of the things we've been talking about
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:52.780]   on all about Android is the lock screen ads.
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:57.140]   I can't remember if you covered this on this week
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.300]   in Google in recent weeks,
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:01.700]   but that there's a possibility that somewhere in the future
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.900]   that lock screen is gonna turn into an ad.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.300]   - Oh yeah, we did discuss that briefly.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.300]   - An ad placement.
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:11.660]   - Yeah, so that kind of reminds me of that.
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.980]   And if when you're spending money on a device,
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.380]   are you okay with the possibility
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:21.060]   that part of that device is going to be used to demonstrate
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.860]   or to display ads,
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:24.140]   giving you paid for the device.
[01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:25.860]   Like I could be okay with that
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.620]   if I knew I was getting a deal on the device
[01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:29.460]   similar to what they do with the Kindle
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.940]   and the kind of low-range Kindle subsidy,
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:32.780]   that sort of thing.
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:33.620]   But.
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.700]   - Your lock screen is kind of,
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.020]   a lot of people put photos and stuff on it.
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:40.900]   I mean, on your phone, we've historically,
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:42.620]   when you take away my Kindle, who cares?
[01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:44.700]   It's not like I was using that for personalization,
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.220]   but on your phone, I mean,
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:48.780]   I don't know anybody who doesn't have
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.980]   like some sort of highly personalized something there.
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.020]   - Right, totally.
[01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:53.860]   - That feels different.
[01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:57.020]   - I don't like any idea of an ad on my lock screen,
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:00.580]   especially if it's no type of subsidy with it.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.860]   This is my device that I paid for,
[01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:07.100]   stomping, shooting on the dead screen like that.
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.820]   Seriously, yeah, it's not even an app.
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:11.540]   It's just a terminal at that point.
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:15.740]   - Give me a way to disable.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:18.740]   If you're gonna do that, give me a way to disable.
[01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:20.060]   - Yeah.
[01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:21.780]   There was no please, I noticed.
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:22.620]   - No, there was no please.
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:23.780]   - No, no, please for me.
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.740]   - So please, don't do it.
[01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:27.860]   - Oh, pretty or otherwise, not there.
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.900]   - Although even when you're speaking firmly,
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.740]   you still got like that calm,
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.140]   kind of quiet voice going on.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:36.540]   - That's a warm, please call.
[01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.540]   - The warmth, they're that calm.
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:40.180]   (laughing)
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:42.260]   - Just send him a phone, just do it.
[01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.060]   Just do it. - Just send it.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.100]   (laughing)
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.740]   - I do say thank you. - At least.
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:49.260]   I just didn't say please.
[01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.180]   (laughing)
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:51.180]   - Right, right.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:53.420]   What about Netflix here?
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:56.260]   So Netflix continues to slide a little bit.
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:59.220]   This is the second consecutive quarter of losses.
[01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:02.580]   Lost 970,000 paid subs in the quarter.
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:04.500]   They expected to lose 2 million,
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:07.300]   so they didn't lose as much as,
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:09.740]   they didn't do as poorly as the poor
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.100]   they thought they were gonna do.
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:14.380]   So I suppose that's an improvement from really bad to bad.
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:19.500]   But yeah, things are really rocky with Netflix.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.660]   Netflix used to be kind of something you could count on.
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.940]   It was pretty stable and now that stability
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.940]   is just kind of out the window.
[01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:29.820]   It seems like they're fighting in a few different ways.
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.420]   - They had to pay for all this content.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.540]   They had to raise their prices by a lot.
[01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:36.020]   There's a lot more competition.
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:37.700]   I mean-- - A lot more competition.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:38.540]   - There's a lot more competition.
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:39.380]   - And there's a lot more competition.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:40.220]   - And there's a lot more competition.
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.060]   - There's a lot more competition.
[01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:42.380]   - There's a lot more competition.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:43.220]   - Yeah.
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:46.260]   - So I don't know. - I mean--
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:49.580]   - Isn't this the financial corner
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.860]   from what we talked about in the first segment with Google?
[01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:55.060]   This kind of stuff is bound to happen
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.300]   with the economy being as craptastic as it is right now.
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:04:59.140]   Right?
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:04:59.980]   - That's true.
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:03.260]   This isn't an essential need, you know, streaming.
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:05.300]   And especially like you mentioned Stacy,
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.140]   there are a lot of competitors out there.
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:07.980]   - There's competitors out there.
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.220]   - But the longest-- - I think that's where it is.
[01:05:09.220 --> 01:05:11.980]   - Yeah, I think that's largely what it is too.
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:13.300]   I mean, for the longest time,
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.380]   Netflix was one of the earliest to the game,
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.420]   largest catalog.
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.460]   I mean, even remember in the beginning
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.620]   when they started the online digital streaming,
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:25.620]   the content that they did have really wasn't that great.
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:28.820]   But the fact that they had lots of really not great content
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.860]   was enough for people to buy into it and be like,
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:33.940]   "Well, I'm sure I can find something in here to watch."
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.180]   - Yeah, 'cause they had a lot of old-school jinnings in it.
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:38.940]   If I remember, right, they had a lot of old-school jinnings.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:42.060]   - Yeah, you had to look into that nostalgia side of you.
[01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.940]   Okay, this is worth the $15 a month.
[01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.300]   'Cause isn't that what it used to be?
[01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.820]   - Well, it was like $7.99.
[01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:53.060]   And originally it was like $7.99 plus you got a DVD in the mail.
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:54.900]   So you had-- - Oh, that's true.
[01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.460]   Right.
[01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:58.380]   - DVD's, that was such a good day coming home
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.580]   and opening the mail box and finding a DVD in there
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.940]   in the little red package.
[01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:05.300]   - I don't know. - It was a moment of delight.
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.220]   - We always had like the aspirational Netflix
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:11.020]   plus the normal Netflix and the aspirational one,
[01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:13.420]   which is sit there and like stare it.
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:14.500]   - So true.
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:18.460]   Maybe I should mail this back and free up that slot
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:19.660]   for something I'll actually watch.
[01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.540]   No, I'm gonna watch it one of these days.
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.460]   - I will watch the entirely,
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:28.820]   I would say I was gonna watch,
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.380]   I will watch this black and white film
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:32.500]   that is entirely in a foreign language.
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:33.340]   - Yes.
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:35.780]   - I've heard that it's worth it.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:38.980]   - Is there a number of the internet?
[01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:39.820]   - Yeah.
[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:42.100]   - And we hit peak subscription, right?
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:46.540]   It's 63% of all news subscriptions in the US go to Wall Street
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.500]   Journal, Washington Post and New York Times.
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.100]   Everybody else puts all the rest.
[01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:52.580]   There's just a ceiling on it.
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.460]   With so many competitors this day, he says,
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:59.460]   and some getting better, is there just peak?
[01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:02.260]   It's only so much, it's so big a pie
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:03.540]   that it's gonna get sliced up,
[01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:06.140]   did they all think they could get their pieces?
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:08.060]   - Yes and no.
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.860]   So here's what I think is happening.
[01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:13.020]   I think the consumer is gradually getting
[01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.540]   accustomed to paying more for subscription.
[01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:17.740]   So historically, you might be like,
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:20.500]   oh, well, I'm only gonna subscribe to a couple of magazines
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:22.860]   and maybe a newspaper, right?
[01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.300]   And so your subscription pie was this big.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.780]   And then maybe you add Netflix.
[01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:28.580]   So now we have a TV chunk in there.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:30.620]   So now your subscription pie is this big.
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:34.180]   And we're adding more, but we, it does,
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:35.860]   that happens over time.
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:39.180]   So you're fighting for an ever-growing pie,
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:42.900]   but Wall Street wants you to grow, you know,
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:46.300]   and take 100% of the growth of that pie.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.460]   - Better slices.
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:52.500]   - Yeah, so I think what's happening is,
[01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.220]   we're not tapped out exactly.
[01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:57.740]   We're tapped out for the products available to us
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.500]   and that will probably grow slower than anybody
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.500]   who's trying to sell us subscriptions once it grows.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.020]   Does that make sense?
[01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:07.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:10.700]   I'm basically, only time will tell.
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.060]   You know, I was thinking the other day,
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.460]   I still pay for HBO and Showtime.
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:16.500]   I'm waiting for billions and succession.
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.580]   I never watch anything else.
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:19.420]   I should get rid of it.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:22.420]   - Why don't you, like we buy a showtime, we buy it like--
[01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:23.900]   - You've been dipped out.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:24.740]   - Yeah, I got to.
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:26.420]   - You should be dipping.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:27.820]   - And there's lots of services.
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:28.660]   - Football season.
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:30.020]   - Dip it.
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:30.860]   - Dip it.
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:32.180]   - Is it trip?
[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:33.300]   No, true Bill?
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:36.260]   There's a service that'll actually monitor your subscriptions
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:39.820]   and flop it, you know, let you,
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:42.420]   it'll just be like, hey, you're doing this.
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:44.060]   Speed, subscriptions.
[01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:47.220]   - Every now and then I'll get a message in the family slack
[01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:50.500]   that, hey, so and so show is coming out next week.
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:54.100]   And that's basically my hint to go and resubscribe
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:57.220]   to certain premium service, whether it's Showtime
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.500]   or something like that.
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.660]   And they will binge right through it.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:03.060]   And they know as soon as it's over to let me know
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.300]   so I can turn it off.
[01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:05.900]   'Cause I'm not gonna keep paying for it
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:10.740]   if it's a lot of unwatched content out there, you know.
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:11.580]   - Yeah.
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:13.980]   - When succession comes along, you must dip it.
[01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:15.420]   That's what you do.
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:16.260]   - Yeah, dip it.
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:17.100]   Go ahead.
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.780]   (laughing)
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.620]   - Go ahead, put that to the 80s on.
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:22.460]   - That's not financial advice, by the way.
[01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:23.540]   (laughing)
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:24.620]   - You must dip it.
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:26.380]   (laughing)
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.220]   - Do it again.
[01:09:27.220 --> 01:09:28.060]   - Okay.
[01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:28.900]   - Dip it.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:29.740]   - Dip it.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:30.580]   - You're a lot of happy.
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:32.660]   (laughing)
[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:33.500]   - Let's see here.
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:37.620]   Oh, but before we kind of veer off of the Netflix train,
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.860]   ad supported tier is gonna launch early 2023.
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:42.660]   So we started hearing about this very recently.
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:44.980]   And now with the earnings, we're finding out
[01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.980]   this is gonna happen relatively soon.
[01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:50.180]   Not all of the content on the platform
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:51.980]   is gonna be cleared for that ad model.
[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:53.860]   It's gonna cost less, of course,
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:57.580]   than the current 1549 standard package that we have.
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:58.420]   - So, what's that?
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:00.540]   - So, what's that like?
[01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:01.620]   - Well, that's a good question.
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:04.580]   I think what I read was that it's gonna cost less than.
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:07.340]   I think everything that I've heard is that it's a fee,
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.700]   but you still get ads with it.
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:09.540]   So what is that?
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:11.780]   Like, what would differ from Hulu?
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:12.780]   It's the same as a whole.
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:14.620]   - Yeah, it's a whole new basis.
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:15.740]   - Well, actually, Hulu has three.
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:17.500]   They have free.
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.340]   - Totally free.
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:20.180]   - They have lots of ads.
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.020]   - Lots of ads and no ads.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.380]   - Yeah.
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:25.220]   Right.
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:26.500]   So Microsoft is signed up.
[01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:27.340]   Not Google.
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:30.020]   Microsoft signed up with Netflix to be their ad partner.
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:32.980]   - That's 'cause Google YouTube is competing with Netflix.
[01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:35.180]   And why would you help enrich your--
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.700]   - Well, they were in the negotiations.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.540]   - Well, no, I know.
[01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:39.540]   I mean, surely that--
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:40.380]   - It's everywhere.
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:41.820]   - Bactored against them.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.660]   - Yeah.
[01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:48.260]   And then the other thing that got me thinking
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:51.540]   is this plan, password sharing is another thing
[01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:54.100]   that we've been hearing from Netflix for the longest time.
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:55.100]   They were okay with it.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:56.460]   Hey, we don't care if you share passwords.
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:58.180]   And then suddenly they care a lot.
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:59.020]   - Wow.
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.060]   - Now they're testing, share.
[01:11:01.060 --> 01:11:01.900]   Hey, you know what?
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:03.980]   Times change, I suppose.
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:06.900]   It seems like a pretty obvious boogie man, you know?
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:08.220]   If you're losing money to say,
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.380]   "Hey, maybe we shouldn't be allowing you
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.020]   "to share your passwords after all."
[01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:13.540]   So I get it.
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.900]   They're testing charging users in Latin America
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:17.940]   with an extra fee when sharing passwords
[01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.300]   outside of the primary residence.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.020]   What this got me thinking is,
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:24.900]   like I've stayed in enough Airbnb's and hotels
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:27.380]   to realize like now, like when you go to a place,
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:29.260]   it's like there's a Netflix app installed
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:31.020]   and it's like logging with your account.
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:33.020]   I wonder how this is gonna affect that.
[01:11:33.020 --> 01:11:33.860]   That would be interesting.
[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:37.180]   Like am I gonna have to start paying for doing that?
[01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:38.780]   - Hulu already does this.
[01:11:38.780 --> 01:11:42.220]   It's experienced this with the hard hit
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.820]   because he's on like Hulu plan or what have you
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.460]   and he went off to college.
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.780]   It's up 10 hours away.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:51.180]   And it was like, no, you can't do this.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.900]   So he ended up having to create his own account
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:56.700]   because the home zip code was not close enough
[01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.860]   to his geographic location.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:11:59.700]   Oh.
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.900]   - Hey, I have to tell you, I have to correct it.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:06.460]   Hulu doesn't have a free plan anymore.
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:07.540]   We're old.
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.580]   So they only have an ad supported plan
[01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:12.580]   and a non ad supported plan.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.420]   Oh my God.
[01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:15.020]   And they also have basically cable.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:15.860]   Good.
[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:16.700]   - Yeah.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.940]   It's a lot of stuff in their package offerings.
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:23.980]   At one time I was paying for the live TV version
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:28.420]   without ads plus a couple add on things.
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.260]   And then I just started cutting stuff out.
[01:12:30.260 --> 01:12:35.260]   And now I basically just pay for their,
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:36.740]   what is it?
[01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:37.580]   It's just to add free plan.
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:39.180]   It's not live, it's just ad free.
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:40.740]   So I pay for that.
[01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:43.140]   But then in August I will re-up
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:44.780]   and go back to the live TV
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:47.260]   'cause that's when football starts.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:48.540]   - Oh, and they have ESPN.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.820]   So you can add ESPN for seven bucks a month.
[01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:51.660]   - Yeah.
[01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.460]   And then they have the little package with Disney Plus
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:56.620]   'cause yeah, I get Disney Plus
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:59.020]   for some kind of discount as well.
[01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.620]   Disney Plus and ESPN Plus.
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:02.460]   There's a lot of stuff in there.
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.140]   - This is two new businesses for Ant.
[01:13:04.140 --> 01:13:06.740]   I wanted to be my customer service representative
[01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:11.740]   on my side and I wanted to be my entertainment concierge.
[01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:12.700]   - Dearest.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:13.540]   (laughing)
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:15.540]   - Dipping me in and dipping me out.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.860]   And you didn't want to--
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.500]   - You didn't want to just make credit off.
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.340]   - Yeah.
[01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:20.180]   - Yeah.
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.020]   - This is how it goes.
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:21.860]   - This is this, man.
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:22.700]   - Yeah.
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:24.820]   - You're not watching it, just cut it off.
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:26.140]   (laughing)
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:26.980]   - That's true.
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:28.460]   Yeah, it doesn't make sense to pay for it
[01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:29.900]   if you're not watching it, absolutely.
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:30.740]   - Yeah.
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.780]   - And the system is designed to be friendly
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:36.020]   to your ability to cancel it and then re-up.
[01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:38.460]   Like if it was like the old satellite,
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:40.060]   like when we got direct TV, it's like--
[01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:40.900]   - Dude.
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:41.740]   - Sign up for the whole year.
[01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:43.660]   You could just drop in for the month or whatever.
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:44.860]   That's one of my favorite things
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.540]   about these streaming services is like,
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:48.060]   I don't have to pay, you know,
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:50.020]   when the Olympics comes around,
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:53.740]   that's when I pay for the entire month for YouTube TV,
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:56.060]   watch all the Olympics and then I don't need it anymore,
[01:13:56.060 --> 01:13:56.900]   you know, so.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:57.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:58.580]   - I see you can.
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:13:59.980]   - Cable used to do that too.
[01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.060]   Time Warner Cable used to do that to us
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:04.820]   with the whole annual package or what have you
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:06.500]   and I'd have to opt out of that.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.860]   It's like, no, let me stay month to month
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:12.580]   and I would call them at the same time each year, okay,
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:14.900]   you can go ahead and kill this now.
[01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:15.740]   (laughing)
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.220]   - And you'd have to actually call.
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.660]   Like, you know what I mean?
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:20.340]   - I'd actually jump through some hoops
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:21.180]   to make that happen.
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:23.980]   - And then they want to play chicken with you.
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:25.620]   - They want to play chicken with you
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:28.860]   and then offer you another free month and this and that
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:32.060]   and that usually keeps people on but I'm at proof.
[01:14:32.060 --> 01:14:33.140]   No, I know what I want.
[01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:35.420]   - Well, I know what I want.
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:36.740]   I don't say please.
[01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:38.220]   I know what I want.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.220]   (laughing)
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:41.820]   And then don't say please.
[01:14:41.820 --> 01:14:44.380]   (laughing)
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:45.300]   Unless it's tomorrow.
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:47.580]   - In California, y'all are actually,
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:50.500]   it's actually very nice for y'all because there's a state law
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.820]   that says if you can sign up on the web,
[01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:55.020]   you have to be able to cancel on the web.
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:56.100]   - Yes, that's right.
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.700]   - You know that.
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:59.220]   - Yeah, everywhere should have this.
[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:02.540]   Like, when I wanted to cancel the Wall Street Journal,
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:06.140]   I had to like call and like, it was such a pain in the butt
[01:15:06.140 --> 01:15:08.220]   and I was like, God, if I only lived in California
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:10.620]   'cause they're like, you know, I'm like,
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:11.460]   I don't like to cancel.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:13.340]   You click on the thing and they're like,
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:15.460]   call unless you're in the state of California
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:16.580]   then click through here.
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:17.420]   - Oh.
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:18.260]   - Oh.
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:20.460]   - Oh, but you clicked it anyways, right?
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:21.300]   Just to see.
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:23.500]   - I clicked it to see and then I was like,
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:24.900]   man, I need a VPN.
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:25.740]   (laughing)
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:26.580]   - Yeah, right.
[01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.980]   (laughing)
[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:30.300]   I wonder if that would have solved the problem right there.
[01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:31.700]   - Right, right.
[01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:33.620]   - Probably not, but yeah.
[01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:36.100]   - Yeah, that's unfortunate.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:41.180]   We're only gonna give you the customer friendly solution
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:42.860]   if we are required by law.
[01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:44.660]   Anywhere that we're not required by law,
[01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:46.580]   we're gonna inflict pain upon you.
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:47.420]   - Yeah, we're gonna be interested.
[01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:49.540]   - That is the way the world works, unfortunately.
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:52.700]   - It's a, unfortunately it is, but dumb.
[01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:54.060]   (laughing)
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:55.300]   Dumb that it works like that.
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.140]   - I'm sorry.
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:59.020]   - Quelcom. - We do cats.
[01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:00.140]   - Could we do cats sometime?
[01:16:00.140 --> 01:16:01.660]   - Okay, fine, let's do cats.
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:03.140]   All right, from Quelcom to cats.
[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:04.940]   Tell us about the musical dance.
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.020]   Relax, Aunt, don't go away.
[01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:06.860]   It's not the musical.
[01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:07.700]   - Oh, okay, all right, good.
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:09.300]   I'm sticking around in.
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:10.340]   (laughing)
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:12.860]   - Memories.
[01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:13.780]   - We're not doing that, Aunt.
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:16.460]   ♪ I'm alone in my food ♪
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:17.900]   ♪ Like ♪
[01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:18.900]   - So what are we talking about?
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:21.140]   - Talking about "Lion 67."
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:23.020]   - Stray, so last week.
[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:23.860]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:24.700]   - Stacy, you missed this.
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:27.980]   I realized that I should play some game since missed,
[01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:30.580]   and I was looking for recommended games to get a sense of it,
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:32.060]   'cause there's a book you might really enjoy, Stacy,
[01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:34.100]   called Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow.
[01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:35.900]   - Oh, it's on my hold's list.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:37.620]   - It's good, it's good, it's very good.
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:41.620]   So anyway, so Leo suggested "Stray."
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:43.620]   And I thought, oh, I got all excited,
[01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:46.340]   but it's not available on what I play with.
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:49.300]   But, people were talking about like crazy,
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.780]   they're really confused about it,
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:53.780]   but of course the people aren't the only ones enthused.
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:57.740]   Cats are watching "Stray" and then people are capturing
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:59.380]   lots of nice little videos.
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:00.900]   We have something there on that story.
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.220]   - Oh, really?
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:05.340]   - Of cats watching, it's on the rundown line,
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:07.140]   whatever I said.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.860]   - 67, I think.
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:10.180]   - 67.
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:11.420]   - I know this is more complicated
[01:17:11.420 --> 01:17:14.020]   than we can't just go to Leo's machine.
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:16.180]   - Yeah, 67.
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:18.340]   - But if you guys could go to that one,
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:20.300]   it's fun stuff.
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.140]   They should've warned you.
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:22.900]   Okay, so yes, if you scroll down a bit,
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:25.860]   you'll find a few examples of cats.
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:27.260]   There's one like that.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:28.740]   (laughing)
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:32.460]   So you see the silhouette of the cat watching the cats.
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.740]   - Aw.
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:36.620]   - And hearing the meows, there's a better one.
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:38.260]   - Oh, that's so cute.
[01:17:38.260 --> 01:17:39.620]   - Is that the go below?
[01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:42.140]   - That way it's like go scroll down, if you would.
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:44.820]   (laughing)
[01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:47.260]   - I didn't notice game was only 30 bucks.
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:50.220]   - Does the cat get hurt?
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:54.420]   - No, they just, they wanna meet their friend,
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:56.660]   their cat friends.
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:57.500]   - If you scroll down to whatever--
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:58.780]   - I mean it in the game.
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:00.500]   - There are this one.
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:02.340]   - That's a good question, I don't know.
[01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:04.380]   It's like it's trying to walk into the game, yeah.
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:05.220]   It's like.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.580]   (eerie music)
[01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:10.820]   - Wow, that's so cool, I love it.
[01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:11.940]   Isn't that neat?
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:16.260]   I don't know about a neat, that cat should be smart.
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:18.220]   (laughing)
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:19.060]   - Yeah, cat.
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:20.220]   - You know the cats are the kill of the cat.
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:22.740]   (laughing)
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.100]   So it's becoming a genre, there's all kinds of accounts now
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:28.460]   of people looking at cats watching straight.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:29.780]   Which I think is really cute.
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:31.140]   - That's cute.
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.380]   Although if your cat has claws and tries to do the paw thing
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:36.900]   at the screen, you know.
[01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:37.940]   - But for it.
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:39.980]   - Might not be good for the screen, just saying.
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:40.820]   - Oh, okay.
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.460]   - You might have to put some scratches.
[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:43.820]   You might, yeah.
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.620]   Just be careful, that's all I'm saying.
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:49.220]   Does look like a really cool game though, I have to say.
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:51.220]   I'm very intrigued by it.
[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:54.420]   - I didn't even, again, I didn't know it was a $30 game.
[01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:57.220]   I thought it was gonna be some expensive game.
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:00.020]   I may look at this, I just have to reinstall it.
[01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:01.300]   - Were you money bags?
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.820]   (laughing)
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:04.660]   - No, clearly--
[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:06.060]   - I wanted to play it and I gotta buy it.
[01:19:06.060 --> 01:19:08.140]   How much is it cost to buy a PlayStation?
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:08.980]   Geez.
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:10.500]   - Oh, yeah, there's a PlayStation 5.
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:11.500]   - Yeah, I know that.
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:12.340]   - A lot, like 500--
[01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:13.980]   - G.P., you shortage is over.
[01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:17.220]   You should be able to find one easily.
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:18.220]   - That's true.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.180]   Now that the crypto boys have run away.
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:23.860]   - Since I'm one of two Windows people
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.300]   and the whole Twitch studio,
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:28.860]   I'm fortunate to be able to play Steam on my computer.
[01:19:28.860 --> 01:19:31.900]   - God, but you gotta buy a game on Steam.
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:34.580]   And that is like, you need like a master's degree
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:35.780]   to do that, good Lord.
[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:38.020]   (laughing)
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:41.620]   - I like Steam.
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:45.780]   - Every time, I have to buy my brother's games on Steam
[01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.180]   and every time I do it, I'm like, okay.
[01:19:48.180 --> 01:19:51.540]   It is a process.
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:52.380]   - Oh yeah.
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:53.820]   - But that's you buying it for your brother.
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.980]   It's probably a lot simpler for him.
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:20:00.820]   He just goes to the library and hit buy, done.
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:03.700]   - Well, yeah, that's what I'm like, I will give you money.
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.060]   Here's a check. - Yeah, you can.
[01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.260]   - Use it towards this.
[01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.740]   (laughing)
[01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:10.300]   But then, you know, then I'm like,
[01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.340]   I'm like, did you ever get that game?
[01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:12.860]   He's like, oh no, I used it for gas.
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:13.940]   And I'm like, oh.
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:18.260]   - It went into the gas tank, went into a burrito or three.
[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:19.100]   - Yeah.
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:24.340]   - That's how it is with my boys, actually.
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:25.180]   - Yeah.
[01:20:25.180 --> 01:20:26.420]   - You need gas money, but you have to show up
[01:20:26.420 --> 01:20:29.180]   with in and out bags, really?
[01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:31.020]   (laughing)
[01:20:31.020 --> 01:20:32.860]   - In and out is waiting for gas.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:37.220]   - Yeah, I remember that age priorities.
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:39.180]   Gas money takes a back seat to burgers.
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.780]   Let's be real.
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:43.660]   - Well, speaking of food, yeah?
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:45.620]   You wanna do a TikTok moment?
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:46.620]   - Okay.
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:47.460]   - Okay.
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:48.300]   - I'm game.
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.740]   - This is the democracy I don't know why you think
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:51.820]   it's anything other than an democracy, Jeff.
[01:20:51.820 --> 01:20:52.980]   - I know, I know.
[01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:55.020]   - No, it's a revolution.
[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:57.260]   112.
[01:20:57.260 --> 01:20:59.140]   Now, the problem is John may get mad at me
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.500]   because there will be some editing afterwards
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:04.380]   'cause he does come up with some words once in a while.
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:05.980]   - John doesn't do the editing.
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:06.820]   - He's gonna be all right.
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:07.980]   - He's gonna be John is mad at it,
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:10.100]   but he defends the editors.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:11.620]   He speaks on their behalf.
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:18.020]   So this guy is a monotone, growly chef,
[01:21:18.020 --> 01:21:23.100]   and he reacts to TikTok cooking videos.
[01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:25.100]   He'll listen to him.
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:27.420]   - Oh, yeah, I watch him.
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:28.660]   He's cranky. - He's great.
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:29.900]   - He's got the fries.
[01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:30.740]   He's up nice.
[01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:31.580]   - He's Jeff is a chef.
[01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:32.420]   - Why?
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.300]   - No, we're gonna take a couple of milk.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:35.500]   - Half a couple of water.
[01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:36.580]   - One, two, three.
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:37.420]   - Okay.
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:38.580]   - And we're gonna whistle.
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:40.100]   That's gonna be your batter.
[01:21:40.100 --> 01:21:41.980]   You want a nice-- - Not impressed.
[01:21:41.980 --> 01:21:43.500]   He had me at the side.
[01:21:43.500 --> 01:21:44.580]   - He's rapping.
[01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:46.940]   - Oh, is this a salmonella gloves lady?
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:47.780]   - Nice to meet you.
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:49.140]   - And I'm just gonna wrap.
[01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:50.140]   - Letting that out.
[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:52.780]   Now we're gonna take this and cover it in some batter.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.620]   You wanna make sure it's completely covered.
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:55.460]   - Yeah.
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:57.340]   - Place this on top of the-- - No, why?
[01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:58.340]   - Rest of our fries.
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:22:00.580]   (laughing)
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:02.140]   - You're the actual.
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:03.980]   (laughing)
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:04.820]   - Oh, good for you.
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:05.660]   - Fill in the gas.
[01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:08.500]   - Now we wanna take our Saran wrap and fold it over.
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:09.340]   Same thing.
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:11.700]   - You know, I'd like to see him make one of these.
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:12.540]   - We're both party nice.
[01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.940]   - Chews those making things in the shape of buns.
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:16.340]   - Put it together nicely.
[01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:17.700]   - And you go.
[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:18.540]   - Now I just wanna try to go.
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:20.180]   - Really easy to criticize from the sidelines.
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.020]   - Glue it all.
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:21.860]   - Yes.
[01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:22.860]   - Put this low.
[01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:24.860]   There you go.
[01:22:24.860 --> 01:22:26.100]   See how that's nice and brown there?
[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:26.940]   - Yeah, sure.
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:27.780]   - Go around.
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:29.180]   Just wanna let it pound you.
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:30.180]   (laughing)
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:31.180]   - I don't know.
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:33.060]   I feel like he could be a lot more critical
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:34.060]   than he's being.
[01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:35.140]   I feel like he's holding back.
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:36.780]   - Wait a minute.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:37.620]   I'm back.
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:38.460]   - Burger.
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:39.300]   - Burger.
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:40.300]   - Sorry if you go to his,
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:41.140]   go to his lunch.
[01:22:41.140 --> 01:22:41.980]   There it was.
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:43.380]   (burping)
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:45.540]   - For something that's inevitably gonna look
[01:22:45.540 --> 01:22:47.220]   like she's being super delicate.
[01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:48.060]   (laughing)
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:49.220]   She seems like a...
[01:22:49.220 --> 01:22:51.420]   - Sorry, like, sure.
[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:53.420]   - I'll hit the straight around this video.
[01:22:53.420 --> 01:22:54.420]   (burping)
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:56.140]   - Yeah, he is not safe.
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:22:56.980]   - Or why?
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:58.300]   - Yeah, definitely not.
[01:22:58.300 --> 01:22:59.620]   Definitely not.
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:00.820]   He's hilarious.
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:01.660]   'Cause some of these,
[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:02.740]   some of these recipes are just awful
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:03.980]   and he'll say at the end,
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:06.700]   three out of 10.
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.260]   - I need it.
[01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:09.100]   I need it.
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:09.940]   - I need it.
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:10.780]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:12.100]   (laughing)
[01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:16.580]   - He's positive about like he's got the lunch offs,
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:19.420]   which I think is actually kind of a fun TikTok trend
[01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:21.740]   where you talk, you know, the lunch offs were people who,
[01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:23.020]   I think it's probably people who work
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.100]   in that construction and stuff.
[01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:24.940]   They're like,
[01:23:24.940 --> 01:23:27.260]   "What did my wife or what did I pack for lunch today?"
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:29.220]   And they all like show off their lunches.
[01:23:29.220 --> 01:23:31.780]   Pretty keen on those.
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.180]   I was like, "Oh my God, something on TikTok,
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:34.180]   I haven't seen."
[01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:35.500]   (laughing)
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:36.660]   - I know.
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:38.460]   So they search that right now.
[01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.500]   - Jeff, so if I say the phrase,
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.980]   he's an eight, but,
[01:23:43.980 --> 01:23:46.740]   and I don't have any clever thing,
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:49.740]   but would you be like right there with me?
[01:23:49.740 --> 01:23:53.340]   - For him?
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:54.180]   What?
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:55.020]   - No, no, no, no, okay, let me,
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:56.020]   now I have to do it.
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:58.820]   Let's see.
[01:23:58.820 --> 01:24:03.060]   He's an eight, but his online tech shows go on
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:04.900]   for three and a half hours.
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:05.740]   What is it?
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:09.180]   - Got it.
[01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:10.740]   - Then he's a six.
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:11.580]   And my book.
[01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:16.100]   - Whoa, we all just got demoted.
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:22.340]   Well, we better not make this a four hour show then.
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:24.540]   - Please nuts.
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:26.580]   - Yeah, don't worry.
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:28.220]   I got you, I got you.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:32.900]   Are we excited about wearables at this point?
[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.660]   Are we, you know, kind of what's going on?
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.140]   - Oh, this is where the show actually.
[01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:39.220]   - Yeah, I thought so.
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:40.060]   - Yeah.
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:40.900]   - This is good.
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:41.740]   You know why?
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:44.300]   Because the whole thing that makes Android Wear,
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:46.140]   Wear OS, sorry, Wear OS,
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:49.140]   why Android Wear OS sucks so badly
[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:53.260]   is because Qualcomm has not delivered good silicon.
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:57.820]   So Apple's like pumping out these amazing chips,
[01:24:57.820 --> 01:24:59.100]   the going into the watch.
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:02.340]   And Android watches are still like 800 pounds this thick.
[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:06.260]   And if you don't have risk the size of like ants.
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:08.060]   - They're perfect for me.
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:11.060]   I just saw online, but they're perfect for me.
[01:25:11.060 --> 01:25:13.140]   - Yeah, so Qualcomm has finally said,
[01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:15.220]   and they said this, and you can tell Qualcomm knows
[01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:16.620]   they're coming from way behind here.
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:18.860]   Because like on the call I did with this guy,
[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:20.900]   he mentioned that this was entirely new,
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:23.220]   entirely other redesign chip
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:27.740]   for the brand new Snapdragon Wear 5.
[01:25:27.740 --> 01:25:29.180]   Platform is what it is.
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:31.220]   And there's a plus and then there's a smaller one
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:33.820]   for like kids wearables.
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:35.780]   Big things if you're a chip nerd,
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:37.660]   they're moving from 12 nanometers
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:39.820]   all the way down to four nanometers for this,
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:41.220]   which is a big deal.
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:42.060]   - That's huge.
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:42.900]   - Yeah.
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:45.980]   And that's gonna help you so much with battery life and size.
[01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:47.260]   The other thing they're doing,
[01:25:47.260 --> 01:25:49.660]   and this I'm really excited about is they put a lot,
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:52.540]   they put a lot into ambient mode.
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:54.940]   So you know like forever go and you get my newsletter,
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:56.460]   you'll read about it this week.
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:25:59.660]   We're moving from like sleep in wake mode
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:03.820]   to a third liminal state, we're calling ambient mode.
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:05.180]   And in ambient mode,
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:07.660]   you're basically gonna have your sensors
[01:26:07.660 --> 01:26:10.260]   and they're gonna be always on sensing stuff
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:11.980]   and then they'll wake up the processor, right?
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:14.100]   So this is gonna save on battery life.
[01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:18.940]   Qualcomm is putting audio playback, notifications,
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.660]   always on wake word detection,
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:24.540]   and a tiny little GPU on their always on processor
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:26.060]   for their ambient stuff,
[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:29.100]   which means you can do all that stuff without like
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:31.300]   waking up the main processor for battery.
[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:32.500]   So that's gonna be great too,
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.580]   'cause like the Google Android Wear stuff
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:37.260]   was always so laggy.
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:39.860]   And so now they can have a really good processor,
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:42.860]   but it won't be stuck in your battery life the whole time.
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:45.540]   - Yeah, they said 50% longer battery life
[01:26:45.540 --> 01:26:47.540]   compared to their previous iteration,
[01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:51.460]   the Wear 4100 plus and 4100.
[01:26:51.460 --> 01:26:52.300]   So.
[01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:54.340]   - Yeah, I have, do you want the battery stats?
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:57.020]   I actually have them right here, let's see.
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:00.140]   You know, this all depends on what you do on it,
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:02.660]   but for like just a Bluetooth fashion watch,
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:05.900]   they're saying it's going to be about 43 hours
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:06.740]   of battery life.
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:08.220]   - Oh, it's not bad.
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:11.300]   - Yeah, well that's not LTE.
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:14.900]   An LTE watch is gonna get you 54 hours
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:18.780]   and then a tracking sport watch will get you three days.
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:20.460]   But that's with like double the battery
[01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:23.620]   than the Bluetooth watch, it's a 600 milliamps battery.
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:24.660]   - It's impressive.
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:26.460]   That is.
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:29.340]   - Yeah, that's, I mean, we'll see, I mean, you know,
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:33.980]   they're battery, but if you can get through like a day or two
[01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:36.380]   for like an LTE watch, that's pretty good.
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:41.540]   - I mean, I rarely, I just want to get through the day
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:44.460]   and have plenty left over by the time I put it
[01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:46.620]   on the charger at night so that I'm not cutting it close
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:49.980]   and having that like battery panic mode, you know.
[01:27:49.980 --> 01:27:53.060]   Like am I gonna make it as a watch after all?
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:56.380]   - Yeah, it is your watch and you know, so that's gonna help.
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:59.540]   If it truly is that much longer of a battery life,
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.380]   I think that's a really big win.
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:04.180]   Knowing that it's smaller, that's excellent.
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:05.780]   I think the one thing, and I talked about this
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:08.340]   a little bit last night on all about Android
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:12.540]   is that the 4100 and the 4100 plus,
[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:14.660]   like when those came out, it was like,
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:17.940]   finally Android Wear gets its long awaited update,
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:20.700]   which it had been forever since Qualcomm had updated
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:22.980]   the processors that were in watches at that time.
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:24.780]   This is what a year and a half ago, let's say,
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:26.140]   off the top of my head.
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:28.940]   And so they did the 4100 and the 4100 plus,
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:32.140]   and then hardly any watches were launched with it.
[01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.660]   So even though Snapdragon had done this,
[01:28:34.660 --> 01:28:38.860]   you know, big transformation of their wearable processor,
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:40.380]   no one was using it.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:43.500]   So I really hope that we actually see some output,
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.060]   some utilization of this chip on newer watches.
[01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:47.900]   So we see some.
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:50.300]   - And I asked them about that,
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:53.500]   and that's why that black diagram I threw in there,
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.060]   everything on there is new.
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:29:00.060]   They were like, yeah, no, they didn't directly say this,
[01:29:00.060 --> 01:29:01.740]   that nobody wanted to use it
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:03.620]   'cause it wasn't compelling enough.
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:05.180]   But basically they got the message
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:07.900]   and they were like, we're ripping everything out.
[01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:10.660]   And so everything's replaced, the smaller,
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:13.460]   like going down the process node with the 4 nanometers
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:14.460]   is gonna really help too.
[01:29:14.460 --> 01:29:18.300]   So the first watch will be out in August,
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:19.740]   it's gonna be an Oppo watch,
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:20.940]   and then the first Android,
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:22.780]   that's just the first watch using this,
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:25.900]   the first Wear OS watch is gonna be Mobboy,
[01:29:25.900 --> 01:29:28.100]   and it's gonna come out later this year.
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:33.100]   - Yeah, the tick watch, we'll have that W5 plus Gen 1
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:36.300]   prior to that, the Oppo watch three,
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:39.060]   which is gonna be a modified AOSP watch.
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:41.140]   So like you said, not running Wear OS,
[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:42.540]   but still, you know, a watch
[01:29:42.540 --> 01:29:43.700]   and still be able to--
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:46.500]   - Are you all wearing from all the charities?
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.420]   - Spark watches. - Mm-hmm.
[01:29:48.420 --> 01:29:49.260]   No.
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:55.260]   - Just a little, I'm not either a little exercise thing,
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:57.580]   but it's not smart watch, yeah.
[01:29:57.580 --> 01:29:58.420]   - No.
[01:29:58.420 --> 01:30:00.820]   - I mean, I have one long ago,
[01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:02.980]   and I'm not lost in after it, I'm just done.
[01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:03.900]   - Yeah.
[01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:06.100]   I'm not missing it when I don't have it on my wrist,
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.700]   to be honest.
[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:11.980]   - I would like to have audio playback on mine,
[01:30:11.980 --> 01:30:15.180]   like I don't think the church might have audio playback.
[01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:16.500]   - Well, when you actually say that,
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.260]   do you mean like to Bluetooth?
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:20.780]   - No, I mean actual audio playback.
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:21.860]   Like I wanna stream a lot of that,
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:23.180]   'cause I don't wanna bring my,
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:25.260]   like when I go out for a run,
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:26.860]   it's also here 'cause I can,
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:28.300]   it's colder here, so I have pockets,
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:31.540]   but like beforehand when I was in Texas, you know,
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:33.900]   you don't wanna strap a smart watch on Earth,
[01:30:33.900 --> 01:30:35.340]   a sponed ear.
[01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:36.420]   - Now.
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:37.260]   - Farm.
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.100]   (laughs)
[01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:38.940]   - Yeah.
[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:39.780]   - This thing right here.
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:40.780]   - Whatever it's called, yeah.
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:46.100]   - So you want your watch to have always connected
[01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:48.620]   ability, be able to stream from Spotify,
[01:30:48.620 --> 01:30:50.300]   but connect to your Bluetooth headphones
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:51.500]   that you're wearing when you're out for a run.
[01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.940]   And so you're just wearing your watch
[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:54.980]   and your Bluetooth headphones, and that's it.
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:55.820]   - Right.
[01:30:55.820 --> 01:30:56.660]   - Right?
[01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:57.500]   - Yeah. - That's what I would.
[01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:58.740]   Yeah, and that's only when I'm out for a run.
[01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:00.580]   The rest of the time I can talk to my phone.
[01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:02.500]   I don't, you know, I'm not,
[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:05.740]   I don't need to be like a tiny ass phone on my phone.
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:07.300]   - But is that even possible?
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:09.260]   (laughs)
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:10.940]   - Yes, you could have an LTE watch
[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:13.940]   that streams Spotify to your Bluetooth sets on our watch.
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:16.060]   Yeah, I think Apple watches that, doesn't it?
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:16.900]   - Yeah.
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:21.740]   - Oh, yeah, I mean, you know, I think the Galaxy Watch 4
[01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:24.140]   can do that if you've got a, you know, an LTE chip
[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:26.660]   and inside of it.
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:28.500]   So yeah, there are watches that allow you to do that,
[01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:33.220]   but yeah, that is nice to not have to bring the phone with you,
[01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:34.700]   not have that tether.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:39.460]   - Did we notice Stacy's very, very subtle nuanced sneak there
[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.380]   of a bite of something?
[01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:43.900]   - I was, I was a ginger candy.
[01:31:43.900 --> 01:31:45.740]   (laughs)
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:48.980]   - It was, it was, it was, it was too late.
[01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:50.340]   It's, it's like the one in the mouth.
[01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:53.420]   - It was like, oh, I bet I'm on the screen, I am.
[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.060]   (laughs)
[01:31:55.060 --> 01:31:57.780]   - You never know that Benito keeps you on your toes.
[01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:58.620]   - Oh, exactly.
[01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:01.260]   - But she's too camera right when you're eating the ginger.
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:02.740]   (laughs)
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:07.740]   We should give some props to fellow Twit, Rene Ritchie.
[01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:08.580]   - Yeah.
[01:32:08.580 --> 01:32:12.140]   - You know, he works for the Goog, he works for YouTube.
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:17.140]   He was hired by YouTube to be their second ever creator liaison.
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:20.980]   So he's going to be working,
[01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:24.180]   he's still gonna continue doing his channel, his YouTube channel.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:25.020]   - So cool.
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:25.860]   - So that's not going anywhere.
[01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:28.580]   He really wants to, from the article that I read,
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:31.980]   I haven't talked to him, but he says that he wants to stay
[01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:36.980]   connected and close to the, you know, to the creator lifestyle,
[01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:41.180]   to what it takes to be a creator, to create and actively do that
[01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:42.300]   on a regular basis.
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:46.540]   But he's also going to be working with YouTube to, yeah,
[01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:51.380]   to be kind of a liaison between other creators and, you know,
[01:32:51.380 --> 01:32:54.380]   inform them on how to do YouTube right,
[01:32:54.380 --> 01:32:56.660]   all the different facets of YouTube, that sort of stuff.
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:59.260]   So big time, congratulations to Rene Ritchie.
[01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:00.980]   - Smart hire by YouTube.
[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:02.540]   - Very smart hire.
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:06.300]   - He's done a heck of a job.
[01:33:06.300 --> 01:33:07.140]   - Yeah.
[01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:10.140]   - Like Danny Sullivan at Google, search.
[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:15.140]   You know, your shortcuts to have people have faith in.
[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:20.020]   - Speaking of which is Matt been on one of the shows lately.
[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:21.340]   - Not in the wild.
[01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:23.700]   - No, I reached out to him every once in a while
[01:33:23.700 --> 01:33:25.020]   and it just hasn't worked out.
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:29.340]   He is genuinely interested, but yeah, it's how to work.
[01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:33.500]   I keep trying, so I will keep it up.
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:35.820]   We'll get Matt back one of these days.
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:39.660]   - I've been the recipient of a Jason email that says,
[01:33:39.660 --> 01:33:43.460]   "Hey, you said no a lot of times to being in this show.
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:46.220]   Maybe you're just, maybe it's just not a good time for us.
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:48.140]   Maybe we should stop bugging you."
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:50.740]   (laughing)
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:53.940]   - Well, when I hear it interpreted like that.
[01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:57.660]   - Wow, it's true.
[01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:58.500]   - I love it.
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.700]   - I'm like, "No, it's so nice."
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:06.700]   - It's like, I mean, as a person who is booking lots of people
[01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:09.420]   on a lot of different shows, like the last thing I want
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:14.100]   is to continue contacting someone who is like,
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:16.100]   "You know what, my life is really busy right now.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:19.340]   I appreciate it, but at a certain point it's kind of like,
[01:34:19.340 --> 01:34:20.940]   "Okay, I'll save you the trouble.
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:22.140]   I'll save me the trouble.
[01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:24.340]   Is there a time down the line where I can get in touch
[01:34:24.340 --> 01:34:26.460]   with you and maybe you'll be interested again
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.100]   or your life will be a little bit easier?"
[01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:31.340]   So hopefully it comes across like that.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:32.180]   (laughing)
[01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:32.980]   - No, it totally does.
[01:34:32.980 --> 01:34:34.740]   I actually stole your thing.
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:38.380]   I stole your wording for my own, like,
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:40.140]   "Hey, I don't want to keep bothering you."
[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:40.980]   So--
[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:43.900]   - Yeah, yeah, so just let me know, yes or no, it's cool.
[01:34:43.900 --> 01:34:45.700]   If you can't do it, that's fine too.
[01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:47.260]   I don't want you to feel like, you know,
[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:48.500]   you have to do it.
[01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:49.780]   So yeah, totally.
[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:50.620]   Well, cool.
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:51.940]   (laughing)
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:54.140]   - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you Jason.
[01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:56.580]   I was like, "That's okay.
[01:34:56.580 --> 01:34:58.660]   I'm just happy that it was interpreted well
[01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:01.220]   and not like, geez, it's just nagging me
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:02.460]   to like, come on all the time."
[01:35:02.460 --> 01:35:05.340]   - No, no, it's so good that like,
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:07.820]   I who don't have to deal with treatments.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:09.340]   - I stole it.
[01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:11.540]   I was like, "Ooh, this is a good way to deal with people.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:12.700]   I like it."
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:13.900]   - Yeah, there we go.
[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:14.740]   Right on.
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:16.900]   Cool, I'm happy that was helpful for you.
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:21.060]   Let's see here, we've got lots of random stuff,
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:24.700]   but I feel like it's all really good stuff to talk about.
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:26.380]   What about the FCC chair?
[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:31.380]   Okay, they proposed, the FCC proposed new US broadband
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:36.700]   standards for the US long overdue in many people's opinions.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:41.540]   What is it, 100 megabits per second up,
[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:44.340]   20 megabits per second down?
[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:45.180]   Is that--
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:46.020]   - Flip that, flip that.
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:47.100]   - Oh, opposite.
[01:35:47.100 --> 01:35:48.940]   Oh, is it, is it 20 up?
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.100]   - Yes, yeah.
[01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:50.940]   Sorry, totally not.
[01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:53.220]   - You're still consumers more than creators.
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:56.060]   - Yes, fair enough, fair enough.
[01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:57.300]   What do you think?
[01:35:57.300 --> 01:36:00.460]   If this were implemented, is this enough?
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:05.900]   - No, but it's basically the FCC is just like,
[01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:10.460]   I wanna say they did the other standards of 25.3,
[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:11.940]   that was like--
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:12.940]   - Yeah, 25.3.
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:14.260]   - Let's go.
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:15.460]   - Yeah, that was Adjit Pie, right?
[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:17.860]   - At the time, yeah, it was Adjit Pie,
[01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:20.220]   and at the time when they did it,
[01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:23.340]   we were all like, it should be a hundred, 25.
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:26.020]   That's what everybody who was in the world,
[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:29.620]   like the tech world, people who were seeing the future
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:30.820]   of the internet, that's what we all said.
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:32.620]   So like, all the way back in 2015,
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:36.140]   we were like, you need like a hundred banks down.
[01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:37.820]   So seven years later, we're here,
[01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:41.660]   that feels like the FCC's speak in all honesty.
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:43.900]   I mean, when we got 25.3,
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:48.540]   we were moving up from like seven something.
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:50.380]   I mean, it was really like--
[01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:51.380]   - It was DSL.
[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:53.180]   - DSL was bad.
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:58.180]   - And the reason it matters isn't for like the 90% of us,
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:37:03.180]   it is for things like federal broadband rules,
[01:37:03.180 --> 01:37:05.740]   it's for things like the internet essentials plans.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:09.700]   So, you know, the FCC and various ISPs have plans
[01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:12.620]   for like people who can't afford internet.
[01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:13.460]   - Oh, income.
[01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:15.940]   - So set the, yeah, this will set the baseline
[01:37:15.940 --> 01:37:19.460]   for those programs, both formally and informally.
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:23.860]   And then it also helps determine which technologies make it.
[01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:27.980]   So satellite was a big reason we didn't go 25.3.
[01:37:28.420 --> 01:37:30.020]   Beyond 25.3,
[01:37:30.020 --> 01:37:34.060]   and getting 20 megabits per second up
[01:37:34.060 --> 01:37:36.780]   is gonna be hard for satellite, even SpaceX.
[01:37:36.780 --> 01:37:37.620]   - Yeah.
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:42.100]   - So like, it's a big deal, but it's also like--
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:43.580]   - What are the SpaceX running now?
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:44.420]   What are they running?
[01:37:44.420 --> 01:37:46.060]   - I don't know where they're at.
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:48.900]   ♪ Up SpaceX ♪
[01:37:48.900 --> 01:37:50.660]   (laughs)
[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:51.660]   - Starlink.
[01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:54.620]   - Oh, Starlink, right.
[01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:55.460]   - Yeah, Starlink.
[01:37:55.460 --> 01:37:57.260]   - Starlink. - 50 to 20.
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:00.300]   - Is what they promise.
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:01.700]   But I don't know what they promised now.
[01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:03.220]   - I don't like three or four up, yeah.
[01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:04.620]   - I'm sorry, up.
[01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:05.460]   - Yeah.
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:08.420]   - Premium service of Starlink claims to provide
[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:11.660]   between 150 to 500 megabits per second.
[01:38:11.660 --> 01:38:14.820]   Wow. - But that's, it's not synchronous, is it?
[01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:17.300]   - Claims to be, yeah, I'm not seeing that.
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.220]   - It does claim to see synchronous issues.
[01:38:19.220 --> 01:38:20.060]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:21.740]   Claims to be 150 to 500.
[01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:24.900]   I don't know if I don't think that is synchronous.
[01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:29.900]   'Cause with satellites, I mean, with any internet service,
[01:38:29.900 --> 01:38:32.500]   you have X number of channels
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:33.900]   that you can send your data over, right?
[01:38:33.900 --> 01:38:35.180]   Like X number of lanes.
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:40.260]   In most, because we're a consumption oriented society,
[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:44.700]   we tend to allocate more lanes for download than upload.
[01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:49.740]   So, that's, it makes sense,
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:51.820]   but that's where you get like the super fast speeds
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:53.340]   as you're like, I can give you 100 down,
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:58.340]   but only five up 'cause I only have 21, five megahertz channels.
[01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:02.900]   - You know what I want is an FCC or FTC standard
[01:39:02.900 --> 01:39:05.540]   for claims of high speed hotel internet.
[01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:08.980]   (both laughing)
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:11.260]   I haven't been in hotels much in the last two and a half years,
[01:39:11.260 --> 01:39:14.020]   but maybe they've improved, but I doubt it.
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:18.340]   - Yeah, they're ultra plans are at the best seven eggs down.
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:20.740]   - That's their ultra plans.
[01:39:20.740 --> 01:39:23.220]   - Yeah, they're not gonna let you stream Netflix
[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:25.420]   for very long, most of them,
[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:28.380]   but I've actually, I've actually been recording podcasts.
[01:39:28.380 --> 01:39:31.060]   I haven't done Twig from a hotel 'cause I'm not like you, Jeff.
[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:34.180]   I can't stay up till midnight doing Twig.
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:35.940]   (both laughing)
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:37.420]   I was like, oh, no.
[01:39:37.420 --> 01:39:40.140]   But they're actually pretty good.
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:43.540]   I've been doing Google Meats and Zooms and whatnot.
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:44.380]   So.
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:46.900]   - Well, maybe, maybe the pandemic Zoom era forced it.
[01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:48.100]   - Yeah.
[01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:48.940]   Yeah, it could be.
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:51.300]   Maybe there's not enough-- - Not a necessity.
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:54.100]   - Maybe it depends on the hotel.
[01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:55.060]   - Yeah.
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:55.900]   - What a resort.
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:59.780]   - Resort, resort.
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:00.940]   What do you think we are, rich ant?
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:01.780]   We go to resort?
[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:07.340]   I mean, I'm looking at you in all of the mahogany books
[01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:08.700]   and stuff behind you.
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:10.020]   Come on.
[01:40:10.020 --> 01:40:13.100]   I stayed here-- - I'll be on love agency.
[01:40:13.100 --> 01:40:14.780]   - I resort it up.
[01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:17.140]   And most of us are gonna be resorting it up
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:21.460]   because most hotels are adding a lot of resort fees
[01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:25.020]   even if they're like, God help you restart hotel.
[01:40:25.020 --> 01:40:26.020]   - Right, yeah.
[01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:30.420]   And it's like 50 bucks and up per day for those quote unquote
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:31.620]   resort fees.
[01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:33.780]   It's ridiculous. - The FTC is looking
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:35.260]   at those pricing ways.
[01:40:35.260 --> 01:40:36.660]   They call it a, what do they call it?
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:37.740]   Drip pricing.
[01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:39.820]   So in hotels are actually one of the places
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:41.500]   they're looking at that right now.
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.900]   Encouraged.
[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:46.500]   The FCC also did something,
[01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:50.540]   Rosenworzel in addition to broadband speeds yesterday
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:54.420]   sent out a letter to 15 ISPs mobile carriers
[01:40:54.420 --> 01:40:56.100]   or people offering mobile services,
[01:40:56.100 --> 01:40:58.260]   including the big four and the big three
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:02.660]   and charter and Comcast and Google and Mint.
[01:41:02.660 --> 01:41:06.380]   And it said, hey, I would like to know
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:09.380]   how you're dealing with location data.
[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:10.220]   Do you keep it?
[01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:11.060]   Do you share it?
[01:41:11.060 --> 01:41:11.900]   What's the process? - Oh.
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:12.740]   - All of that.
[01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:15.580]   So she is, Rosenworzel has sent those out.
[01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:18.660]   Their letters are due back from the carriers on August 3rd.
[01:41:18.660 --> 01:41:20.580]   So we hopefully will get some information
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:22.540]   about how that's being handled.
[01:41:22.540 --> 01:41:25.580]   - Is this road related directly or?
[01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:27.420]   - I was about to say, not that I'm excited
[01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:29.700]   that we took away the right to abortion,
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:33.540]   but it is forcing the tech industry lawmakers
[01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:38.260]   and everyone to understand the data brokerage industry
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:39.780]   in ways that, you know,
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:43.060]   I would like to have not given up my rights for, but,
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:44.380]   you know,
[01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:46.340]   silver lining.
[01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:47.460]   - Yeah.
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:48.460]   - Yeah.
[01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:52.540]   - Looking for something, somewhat of a silver lining anyways.
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:56.180]   - Miss Stacy, can we go back to the first part
[01:41:56.180 --> 01:41:57.740]   of this segment here?
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:42:01.380]   You say it's not enough, the hundred down and 20 up.
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:04.380]   You say it's not enough.
[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:06.340]   - Oh, wow. - Yeah, but that's because
[01:42:06.340 --> 01:42:08.780]   I'm a giant broadband nerd.
[01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:11.620]   For many people, it will be enough.
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:14.020]   But if you think about AKTV streaming,
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:17.100]   which does exist. - Which, yeah, but which,
[01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:21.020]   let's, are we going to assume the people that are on say
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:25.100]   the low income internet plan will have access to 8K anyway?
[01:42:25.100 --> 01:42:28.980]   - Well, I mean, who's to say?
[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:31.220]   Maybe it's important for their job.
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:32.300]   I don't, I don't know.
[01:42:32.300 --> 01:42:34.740]   I don't want to see the internet buy for Kate
[01:42:34.740 --> 01:42:38.500]   by levels of income more than it already has, right?
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:40.940]   - Yeah. - I don't think that's,
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:43.820]   call me a utopian person,
[01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:48.820]   but anyway, the point is, I know, me and I,
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:50.780]   I hope, said naivete.
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:56.140]   The point is, you can, I mean, like a family of four,
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:58.140]   like what's your internet speed in?
[01:42:58.140 --> 01:43:01.580]   - It's not 100 makes.
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:03.540]   (laughs)
[01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:05.780]   But I'm greedy. - Is it?
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:08.140]   - Well, yeah, but you're probably also,
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:09.780]   yeah, you're probably also, you know,
[01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:13.220]   if you're doing actually sending photography files
[01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:17.380]   to the world. - Yeah, lots of data back and forth.
[01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:21.260]   500 megabits down was okay,
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:24.380]   but it wasn't up to my standard, I guess.
[01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:27.020]   So I had to bump it up because everybody's in the house
[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:29.060]   with remote school and stuff like that.
[01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:33.660]   - Yeah, so I don't, yeah, I think--
[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:34.900]   - If it wasn't for remote school
[01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:38.660]   and I probably would have been okay with 500 down,
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:41.460]   but definitely not with remote school
[01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:43.940]   and coming into place the last two years.
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:47.500]   - Well, and not that you want to set policy based on this,
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:49.420]   but if you think about the data requirements
[01:43:49.420 --> 01:43:52.580]   of something like the metaverse, and I know,
[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:55.900]   we're, you know, why, I don't know what that's gonna look like,
[01:43:55.900 --> 01:43:58.380]   but even things like telemedicine and,
[01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:00.860]   like needing all this on data.
[01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:03.580]   And what I really would like to see is the FCC talk about
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:05.980]   things like resiliency programs
[01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:08.140]   and then the quality of service you've got.
[01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:12.460]   - And we're not really-- - The caps go away as well.
[01:44:12.460 --> 01:44:14.820]   Do you think caps should go away?
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:17.700]   - I have never thought caps made sense, they don't.
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:18.700]   - Okay.
[01:44:18.700 --> 01:44:19.860]   - I remember the argument. - Okay, because I remember
[01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:23.420]   the argument, I remember the argument several years ago,
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:27.260]   what do you call them, the vendors would say,
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.420]   you know what, we're trying to protect our network
[01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:32.660]   and keep it stabilized, yada, yada, yada, yada.
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:34.420]   - These greedy people.
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:36.620]   - Right, so, but then when the pandemic hit,
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:41.620]   when everybody was at home and everybody was doing remote work
[01:44:41.620 --> 01:44:44.700]   or remote school, you didn't hear one thing
[01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:46.940]   about the disability of the internet.
[01:44:46.940 --> 01:44:49.620]   You actually heard those vendors say, you know what,
[01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:52.780]   we're gonna give you a little more data, blah, blah, blah,
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:57.660]   out of goodwill and I'm sure everybody got their allotment
[01:44:57.660 --> 01:45:00.500]   in Densem and there was no problems
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:03.580]   with the internet stability then, so why even have those?
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:05.980]   Why not have the government come in and say,
[01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:09.580]   well, you need to stop all this, this is bad practice.
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:12.820]   - Oh, well, okay, so the carriers want,
[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:17.060]   or the ISPs want a scarcity model for broadband.
[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:18.700]   They always have, they have never, like,
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:21.540]   Intel wants a bigger pie model, right, for selling chips.
[01:45:21.540 --> 01:45:23.180]   So one more chip, more places, more stuff
[01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:24.460]   that uses their network.
[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:28.700]   ISPs hate that because they can't make money
[01:45:28.700 --> 01:45:30.180]   off the stuff going over their pipes,
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:33.260]   they only get to make money on having the pipe
[01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:34.340]   available to people.
[01:45:34.340 --> 01:45:37.900]   So by creating a scarcity model, they at least make more money
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:39.100]   the more you consume.
[01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:40.300]   That's all that is.
[01:45:40.300 --> 01:45:45.140]   There's no, the additional costs associated with the network
[01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:50.020]   are not commensurate with the additional costs
[01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:53.740]   of charging per gigabyte on a data cap, if that makes sense.
[01:45:53.740 --> 01:45:56.460]   They're completely divorced from reality.
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:58.620]   And this wouldn't be a problem except we don't have
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:00.700]   competitive broadband in the US.
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:02.340]   And if we had competitive broadband,
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:05.540]   then you would go to a place that offered you good broadband
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:10.100]   and no caps because the internet should be something,
[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:11.900]   I mean, it's like water, it should just,
[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:12.980]   I mean, water is a terrible example
[01:46:12.980 --> 01:46:14.580]   'cause we're gonna run out, but.
[01:46:14.580 --> 01:46:16.940]   - Well, this information, everyone should have access
[01:46:16.940 --> 01:46:19.660]   to information is what it sounds like you're saying.
[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:23.460]   - Yeah, and the services because they're essential
[01:46:23.460 --> 01:46:24.780]   for being alive today.
[01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:26.820]   I mean, some countries have named the internet
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:28.620]   and broadband internet as a basic right,
[01:46:28.620 --> 01:46:30.340]   as like a human right.
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:33.420]   And in all the power that that entails, we have not.
[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:35.940]   But we should, we just can't get a job today
[01:46:35.940 --> 01:46:36.940]   without the internet.
[01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:39.100]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:42.020]   Totally agree.
[01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:48.740]   Okay, what about, let's see here, are there,
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:50.420]   oh, we need to do the change log.
[01:46:50.420 --> 01:46:54.100]   - Oh yeah, I was so weird for you, Wanna?
[01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:56.300]   Dang, do you wanna? - Do you wanna?
[01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:58.020]   - I know it is.
[01:46:58.020 --> 01:46:59.420]   Let's do the change log.
[01:46:59.420 --> 01:47:00.660]   Sound the horns. - Do it.
[01:47:00.660 --> 01:47:02.380]   - Let's get in there.
[01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:03.220]   It's time.
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:05.620]   Don't panic.
[01:47:05.620 --> 01:47:07.260]   Here it comes.
[01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:10.140]   I promise you, I got the horns.
[01:47:10.140 --> 01:47:12.380]   Prepare yourself.
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:14.580]   There we go. - There we go.
[01:47:14.580 --> 01:47:15.420]   - There we go.
[01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:18.180]   - We stumbled into cigarettes and came in
[01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:19.380]   to pick up the horn.
[01:47:19.380 --> 01:47:21.640]   (laughing)
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:27.820]   - Sometimes you gotta assemble the band, the orchestra.
[01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:31.620]   - I know, I'll play your stupid song.
[01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:33.860]   (laughing)
[01:47:33.860 --> 01:47:37.180]   That was good.
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:38.700]   Thanks.
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:42.300]   Google Meet, apparently adding, according to 9 to 5 Google,
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:46.860]   adding support for anonymous questions and poll responses.
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:50.900]   So you can run a poll out of your Google Meet.
[01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:52.140]   That's kind of neat.
[01:47:52.140 --> 01:47:55.460]   I wonder how quick it is to spin up something like this.
[01:47:55.460 --> 01:47:58.940]   I guess you can already create polls in Google Docs,
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:01.660]   or in Drive rather.
[01:48:01.660 --> 01:48:04.740]   But now you'll be able to integrate them into a Google Meet,
[01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:07.700]   take the temperature of the room.
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:12.500]   - You know what, when I give talks on Zoom or whatever,
[01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:14.740]   and the organizers will excitedly say,
[01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:16.220]   "We could do a poll!"
[01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:18.420]   And I say, "No, we're not."
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:21.060]   (laughing)
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:22.620]   - I mean, is that a complexity?
[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:23.620]   - I love polls.
[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:24.700]   - It's kind of like we could,
[01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:27.300]   but that's too much to go wrong,
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:30.940]   or what is Stacey, you love data too, so duh.
[01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:33.420]   - Well, I just like, I like understanding my audience
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:34.420]   and what they want.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:36.980]   Like, if I'm gonna talk about,
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:38.060]   like I often ask people like,
[01:48:38.060 --> 01:48:39.860]   "Who has a smart assistant?
[01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:41.700]   "You know, who's using these services?"
[01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:43.460]   And sometimes people are like,
[01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:44.540]   "No one raises their hand."
[01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:45.900]   And then we're like, "Okay."
[01:48:45.900 --> 01:48:46.900]   (laughing)
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:49.540]   "Vant my talk to a different level."
[01:48:49.540 --> 01:48:51.620]   - In my experience with polls,
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:54.220]   it's usually I don't ask the right question,
[01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:56.100]   because people will complain about the questions
[01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:57.460]   that are on set poll.
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:58.780]   (laughing)
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:00.100]   - I just give up.
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:02.500]   (laughing)
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:05.300]   - And sometimes you find out something really fascinating.
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:08.580]   Like, I actually was doing a thing about privacy
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:09.980]   and smart devices, and I was like,
[01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:12.780]   "How many of y'all have a baby monitor?"
[01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:14.780]   You know, or have kids that have a baby monitor
[01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:15.980]   and a bunch of people raise their hand.
[01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:19.180]   And I was like, "So how old do you think your kid will be?"
[01:49:19.180 --> 01:49:22.220]   Lower your hand if you're going to stop it
[01:49:22.220 --> 01:49:24.460]   when your baby is like, "One."
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:25.780]   Nobody really lowered their hand.
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:26.700]   And I'm like, "Two."
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:28.300]   A bunch of people who are there, "Three."
[01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:29.140]   Et cetera.
[01:49:29.140 --> 01:49:30.980]   We had people like, when I was like seven and eight,
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:32.340]   there's like a few people who are like--
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:33.340]   - Still holding it up.
[01:49:33.340 --> 01:49:34.180]   - Eighteen.
[01:49:34.180 --> 01:49:35.180]   - And we're all like--
[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:37.220]   (laughing)
[01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:40.140]   - And so then we had like a really interesting conversation.
[01:49:40.140 --> 01:49:42.580]   'Cause it really, so I don't know.
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:43.420]   - That's cool.
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:44.260]   Okay, that's huge.
[01:49:44.260 --> 01:49:45.300]   - I love everything though.
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:46.500]   And Jeff, you hate everything.
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:47.340]   - You do.
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:49.300]   (laughing)
[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:50.140]   - Look at his face.
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:51.500]   - The perfect hot face.
[01:49:51.500 --> 01:49:53.700]   (laughing)
[01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:57.900]   - Jeff, how do you feel about this rebrand to Google Wallet?
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:50:01.700]   You know, we've been through many iterations to get here.
[01:50:01.700 --> 01:50:03.660]   Who knows if this is the final destination,
[01:50:03.660 --> 01:50:06.980]   but nonetheless we're here right now, what do you think?
[01:50:06.980 --> 01:50:09.500]   - It's another Google branding mess.
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:10.340]   I don't care.
[01:50:10.340 --> 01:50:11.180]   - Mess, do you care?
[01:50:11.180 --> 01:50:12.820]   - I don't care.
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:15.180]   - What is different about it?
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:18.260]   - I just got the email and I'm like, "What, what?"
[01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:19.220]   - Hmm.
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:21.900]   - I mean, it's, I mean, as far as I can tell,
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:23.180]   it's kind of about the same.
[01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:26.300]   It's just now, you know, first it was Google Wallet,
[01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:28.060]   then it was Android Pay, then it was Google Pay,
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:31.860]   then it was Google Pay with Tez, remember Tez?
[01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:33.580]   That was the thing. - That's right.
[01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:35.860]   - Then it's, you know, now it's back to Google Wallet,
[01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:37.620]   but if you're in a store and you're paying,
[01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:40.940]   it's still Android Pay when you're--
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:42.020]   - No, it's Apple Pay.
[01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:43.380]   - It's still, yeah.
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:45.540]   - The second I pull out my phone, they're like,
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:46.820]   "Oh yeah, we have Apple Pay."
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:47.980]   - Yeah, we have Apple Pay, yeah.
[01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:49.900]   - It's totally, yeah.
[01:50:49.900 --> 01:50:51.220]   - Right, right.
[01:50:51.220 --> 01:50:52.780]   And you just kind of go along with it, you're like,
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.780]   "Yeah, care."
[01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:54.620]   - Yeah.
[01:50:54.620 --> 01:50:58.660]   - Yeah, so it's just confusing more than anything
[01:50:58.660 --> 01:50:59.780]   that that-- - No, I don't even see
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:03.020]   a wallet on my phone. - I have GPay.
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:04.700]   - Yeah, that'll change.
[01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:05.540]   - That's it.
[01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:06.380]   - That'll change the name. - That'll change the name.
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:08.260]   - That'll start in the rollout.
[01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:09.260]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:11.220]   - It's starting to roll out, so your GPay
[01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:14.180]   is gonna turn into Google Wallet, essentially.
[01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:17.100]   And I think, you know, they've even updated the app,
[01:51:17.100 --> 01:51:18.300]   so you're gonna get some material,
[01:51:18.300 --> 01:51:20.700]   you and dynamic theming, if you care about that.
[01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:23.100]   - I'm checking mine. - About dark mode, Jeff, but--
[01:51:23.100 --> 01:51:23.940]   - There you go.
[01:51:23.940 --> 01:51:27.820]   So, that's gonna go-- - Yeah, I still have
[01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:29.580]   GPay for now.
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:32.060]   - Do you, yeah, I still have GPay as well.
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:33.340]   I have not got the update on it.
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:36.580]   - But it matters, not because that phone is going by by anyway.
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:40.060]   - It better not be a new one, we'll just hand put
[01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:41.140]   my credit card on it.
[01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:44.220]   - Still? - You can't put it in?
[01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:45.220]   - Oh, really?
[01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:47.060]   - My credit card still doesn't go on it, yeah.
[01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:49.100]   - Have you tried lately?
[01:51:49.100 --> 01:51:52.340]   'Cause I had the same problem and then it got better.
[01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:54.620]   - Really? - It's gotta be the bank, right?
[01:51:54.620 --> 01:51:55.980]   - Yes, the bank.
[01:51:55.980 --> 01:51:58.700]   Also, can we just do a slight detour here,
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:00.300]   a Jeff complaint moment?
[01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:02.420]   So, trying to get Jeff to play games,
[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:04.180]   trying to make me a happier person.
[01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:10.460]   So, the recommendation was made to use Stadia,
[01:52:10.460 --> 01:52:12.300]   'cause I've got my Chromebook, right?
[01:52:12.300 --> 01:52:14.820]   - Oh, yeah. - So, guess what happens?
[01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:16.980]   Guess what happens?
[01:52:16.980 --> 01:52:18.740]   Did they kill you in the description?
[01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:22.300]   - Can't use it appears because I have a workspace.
[01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:23.860]   - Oh, geez, sweet, geez, sweet.
[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:28.460]   - Oh, yeah, you got in there right at the tail end of that, Stadia.
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:29.540]   You got it, I'll give you a point.
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:32.620]   - I saw where this was going.
[01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:34.980]   - You just said, "Trumpone sound."
[01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:35.820]   Yes, you're right out.
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:37.860]   - Yes, geez.
[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:38.900]   Geez.
[01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:40.780]   - Brear's a bit ugly. - We're literally heading.
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:45.060]   - In the club to it discord last week for you, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:46.620]   I don't know if you're able to look back at that,
[01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:48.660]   but a lot of people will share the video.
[01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:50.380]   - Yeah, there were, and I was looking forward
[01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:51.460]   to trying some of these things,
[01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:54.020]   and then I got some good recommendations on Stadia.
[01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:54.860]   There's one I wanted to play,
[01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:55.620]   so I couldn't figure it out,
[01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:56.740]   I couldn't figure it out while we're on the show.
[01:52:56.740 --> 01:52:58.540]   I brought up another Chromebook,
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:01.060]   and I signed on to a different account to a Gmail account
[01:53:01.060 --> 01:53:02.220]   I never use.
[01:53:02.220 --> 01:53:03.700]   And sure, not to go right into Stadia,
[01:53:03.700 --> 01:53:05.220]   so I presume that's what it is.
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:06.260]   - Son of a--
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:07.100]   - It gives me a shit on the phone.
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:09.700]   - And geez, I don't say, "Sorry, Schmuck, you can't do this."
[01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:11.060]   It just gives me a 403.
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:13.860]   Be better if it says, "Sorry, Schmuck,
[01:53:13.860 --> 01:53:14.940]   "then I don't want to go on."
[01:53:14.940 --> 01:53:17.220]   But no, I've got to figure it out for myself.
[01:53:17.220 --> 01:53:18.580]   Google!
[01:53:18.580 --> 01:53:19.980]   Thank you for this, Paul.
[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:21.860]   (laughing)
[01:53:21.860 --> 01:53:23.020]   I needed to get this off my chest.
[01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:24.940]   - I love those, right?
[01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:26.780]   It's just the gift that keeps on giving.
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:27.620]   (laughing)
[01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:28.460]   - Exactly.
[01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:29.300]   (laughing)
[01:53:29.300 --> 01:53:30.140]   - Geez.
[01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:32.540]   - I should clarify really quick.
[01:53:32.540 --> 01:53:34.100]   - Okay, first.
[01:53:34.100 --> 01:53:36.660]   - I should clarify, ScooterX pointed out
[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:38.660]   and corrected me in the chat room.
[01:53:38.660 --> 01:53:40.580]   Google Wallet is a separate install,
[01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:43.460]   so GPay, you could still have on your device,
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:45.380]   and then you also have to install Google Wallet,
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:46.860]   which I don't know if that's any better,
[01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:47.820]   because-- - What is the difference?
[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:49.220]   - What is one do, what is the other one?
[01:53:49.220 --> 01:53:50.980]   Okay, now tell me what each does.
[01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:52.380]   - For heck, no.
[01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:54.740]   - It's a really great question.
[01:53:54.740 --> 01:53:55.580]   - ScooterX.
[01:53:55.580 --> 01:53:58.580]   - What is one do versus the other one now?
[01:53:58.580 --> 01:53:59.980]   I'm confused.
[01:53:59.980 --> 01:54:03.100]   - I mean, Google Wallet is supposed to be
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:04.780]   where you keep all of your--
[01:54:04.780 --> 01:54:06.100]   - Everything, right?
[01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:07.540]   - Everything, your card.
[01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:09.260]   That's where GPay operates out of,
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:10.780]   is supposed to operate out of.
[01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:15.780]   - So you keep your COVID card, your--
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:18.140]   - What is it, your tickets?
[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:19.900]   - Yeah, your e-tickets, your loyalty cards,
[01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:22.140]   all that stuff is supposed to be held in your wallet,
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:23.700]   the Google Wallet, right?
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:27.420]   GPay was the place where stuff like that was kept, right?
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:30.260]   Now, my understanding is that GPay
[01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:34.260]   is going to continue being a money management app,
[01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:36.980]   because you know how Google also kind of created
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:38.620]   that as part of GPay.
[01:54:38.620 --> 01:54:40.860]   Like also, you know, we're kind of like mints,
[01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:42.500]   and it's supposed to be-- - We analyze what you do.
[01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:44.060]   - Yeah.
[01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:46.300]   - So I use your thumbs hat and get wallet--
[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:47.380]   - Play.
[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:48.020]   - Yeah, you should dump that. - You should just
[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:49.660]   first play Google Wallet, guess what comes up?
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:50.660]   - Google Pay.
[01:54:50.660 --> 01:54:52.100]   - Google Pay, for now.
[01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:53.020]   (groaning)
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:54.540]   - For now.
[01:54:54.540 --> 01:54:55.380]   - Yeah, for now.
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:54:57.380]   There's a link that ScooterX based on--
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:54:59.020]   - ScooterX based on the migration then,
[01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:00.100]   I guess that's what it is,
[01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:03.180]   'cause I keep stuff in that, at GPay thing.
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:04.540]   It's fricking useful for now.
[01:55:04.540 --> 01:55:05.980]   - For credit cards?
[01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:08.740]   - Well, isn't it also where you put your like,
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:10.340]   playing tickets and stuff?
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:11.780]   - Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:15.020]   Like my airline stuff's there,
[01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:18.660]   the tickets that I buy for venues or events or whatever,
[01:55:18.660 --> 01:55:22.140]   that they're in there, it's useful.
[01:55:22.140 --> 01:55:25.020]   And then of course, the tap to pay is already there too.
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:28.580]   - So confusing though.
[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:31.380]   - Spacey, I think you're right.
[01:55:31.380 --> 01:55:33.980]   - I'll go leadership at Google.
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:35.900]   - Now, stand in leadership at Google.
[01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:39.340]   - Ah, so no focus on that.
[01:55:39.340 --> 01:55:40.340]   - Well, why not?
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:42.860]   Set a screen lock.
[01:55:42.860 --> 01:55:44.500]   - Oh, your bank is not like you, who's your bank?
[01:55:44.500 --> 01:55:45.620]   - No, it's not, it's apparently saying,
[01:55:45.620 --> 01:55:47.220]   okay, now I've got to set a screen lock.
[01:55:47.220 --> 01:55:49.020]   I have a screen lock.
[01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:50.300]   - Oh my God, we can do this.
[01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:51.140]   - Sure you do.
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:54.060]   - Sure you do.
[01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:56.780]   - Choose a new screen lock, why?
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:59.740]   This is what you're supposed to call in on Saturdays
[01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:00.580]   or Sundays.
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:03.660]   - 'Cause you're gonna have your credit card on this thing.
[01:56:03.660 --> 01:56:05.700]   So it wants...
[01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:06.860]   - I have my finger.
[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:11.980]   That's my screen lock is the fingerprint, the thing.
[01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:15.180]   - Oh, well, it asks you if you wanna enable biometrics,
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:16.100]   just say yes.
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:18.460]   - It doesn't say that, no, it doesn't say that.
[01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:19.300]   - Oh boy.
[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:21.460]   - Don't swipe the tablet in password.
[01:56:21.460 --> 01:56:26.740]   - Somebody threw up the twit bug so that a tech guy
[01:56:26.740 --> 01:56:31.660]   can reach out to Mr. Jarvis here.
[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:34.380]   When Leo LaPorte returns from his cruise,
[01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:36.820]   he will don his tech guy cap
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:38.740]   and get in touch with you and see if he can travel shoot.
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:40.580]   - Okay, you stupid person.
[01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:42.020]   (laughing)
[01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:44.780]   - You know what, we should just have Jeff.
[01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:46.940]   Jeff has tech problems.
[01:56:46.940 --> 01:56:49.300]   And then that could just be a whole show.
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:51.300]   - No, tech has Jeff problems.
[01:56:51.300 --> 01:56:52.460]   (laughing)
[01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:53.300]   - I'm sorry.
[01:56:53.300 --> 01:56:56.940]   - Yes, good reframing.
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:56:57.780]   - There we go.
[01:56:57.780 --> 01:56:58.700]   - There we go.
[01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:01.460]   - That's what it is right there.
[01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:06.060]   Google Docs getting some notifications
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:09.900]   that will alert you when there are additions or immovals
[01:57:09.900 --> 01:57:11.860]   so you can be notified essentially
[01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:14.740]   if someone makes a change into the doc.
[01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:16.300]   I feel like that seems like it's something that we--
[01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:17.460]   - That already happens.
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:20.220]   - Yeah, I feel like that's already kind of there, no?
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:21.660]   - Because I had to turn it off.
[01:57:21.660 --> 01:57:24.780]   Is anytime I turn a story as an editor,
[01:57:24.780 --> 01:57:27.620]   I'd get like eight million and like Jesus, no.
[01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:29.420]   - Ever once in a while, someone will make a comment
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:31.500]   in the doc and I definitely get an email
[01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:34.100]   that says so and so commented in the doc.
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:36.180]   - And so I wonder if it resolved.
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:39.540]   - Well, this says, so these are notification settings.
[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:42.060]   So maybe it's kind of expanded around this.
[01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:44.500]   Notification settings, you can choose to get all comments,
[01:57:44.500 --> 01:57:48.140]   comments for you, none of them,
[01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:51.940]   get notified for added or removed content.
[01:57:51.940 --> 01:57:53.300]   Maybe that's the chain.
[01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:54.140]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:56.420]   I don't know what the chain is already there.
[01:57:56.420 --> 01:57:57.260]   - Lots of too.
[01:57:57.260 --> 01:57:59.700]   - I think sounds like I, yeah.
[01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:00.820]   - All right, next.
[01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:02.740]   - Go home, go to your drunk.
[01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:04.060]   - Wah, wah.
[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:06.060]   I mean, it's probably some sort of change,
[01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:08.500]   but apparently not that monumental.
[01:58:08.500 --> 01:58:13.060]   YouTube, reducing its content ID appeal process
[01:58:13.060 --> 01:58:15.260]   down to seven days from 30.
[01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:16.100]   So if you--
[01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:18.460]   - Does that matter for you guys?
[01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:19.300]   - It's a good question.
[01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:20.780]   I mean, I have to--
[01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:22.900]   - I mean, because whenever I appeal something,
[01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:24.740]   it's been pretty quick with the--
[01:58:24.740 --> 01:58:27.100]   - Yeah, yeah, I do feel like those things are resolved.
[01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:27.940]   - That's pretty good for you.
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:29.220]   (laughing)
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:31.740]   - Yeah, that's 'cause you don't say please.
[01:58:31.740 --> 01:58:32.580]   - Yeah.
[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:37.500]   - Are we still off because of the happens though?
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:42.020]   - Pat Engine Bear, are we still off because of Pat Engine Bear?
[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:44.100]   - I think I got it.
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:47.340]   - Yeah, I don't know if that got resolved
[01:58:47.340 --> 01:58:50.300]   or what I honestly have not checked back on that episode.
[01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:51.420]   That's the thing with podcasts.
[01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:52.820]   After like a week and a half there,
[01:58:52.820 --> 01:58:53.660]   the kind of--
[01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:54.500]   - That's true.
[01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:55.340]   - Fish wrap.
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:56.340]   - I hate to say.
[01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:58.140]   - Podcasts that deal with news,
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.300]   it's kinda like in the past
[01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:01.580]   and everybody who's going to see it is kinda seen
[01:59:01.580 --> 01:59:02.420]   in the past one.
[01:59:02.420 --> 01:59:03.260]   - What?
[01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:05.420]   What, we have all our grant performances, our best.
[01:59:05.420 --> 01:59:08.380]   - There's always a group of,
[01:59:08.380 --> 01:59:10.820]   a small group of people who like y'all so much
[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:11.860]   that wanna hang out with you.
[01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:13.940]   They will listen to the back episodes.
[01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:15.660]   - They will go back in time.
[01:59:15.660 --> 01:59:17.780]   God, this is a lot of news for 10 years ago.
[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:18.780]   (laughing)
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:20.900]   - Y'all are amazing and also we're sorry.
[01:59:20.900 --> 01:59:21.740]   - We love you.
[01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:22.580]   - Yeah.
[01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:24.140]   - But we love you.
[01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:26.060]   - At least we continue entertaining you.
[01:59:26.060 --> 01:59:28.380]   - That's nice to know that we can do that.
[01:59:28.380 --> 01:59:31.580]   Let's see here, Google Photos.
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:33.660]   Oh, so if you ever take screenshots
[01:59:33.660 --> 01:59:36.100]   and they end up in your Google Photos photo reel,
[01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:40.860]   now Google Photos is gonna help you find those.
[01:59:40.860 --> 01:59:45.460]   And I guess you can delete them or get rid of them.
[01:59:45.460 --> 01:59:47.060]   So you touch and hold the app,
[01:59:47.060 --> 01:59:47.900]   they'll lift your finger.
[01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:50.860]   If the app has shortcuts, you'll get a list.
[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:52.100]   Touch and hold the shortcuts,
[01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:53.460]   slide this shortcut where you want it,
[01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:55.980]   lift your finger and that will have--
[01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:59.460]   Oh, that has a view screenshots, blue thing.
[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:02.900]   So yeah, that's okay.
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:05.860]   So it's basically on the icon, on your home screen.
[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:06.980]   If you touch and hold the icon,
[02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:09.340]   you'll know how you get that little menu that pops up
[02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:10.700]   if you ever use that feature.
[02:00:10.700 --> 02:00:11.740]   Maybe you don't use that feature.
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:12.860]   I don't really use it very often,
[02:00:12.860 --> 02:00:14.860]   but if you do, you'll be able to jump right
[02:00:14.860 --> 02:00:17.980]   to your screenshots and I suppose that's neat.
[02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:22.500]   - Now, next, here's the story of the week.
[02:00:22.500 --> 02:00:23.860]   Here's the story of the week.
[02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:26.860]   - Chrome OS is now Chrome OS.
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:28.660]   (laughing)
[02:00:28.660 --> 02:00:30.620]   - Branding, branding.
[02:00:30.620 --> 02:00:35.060]   Yeah, they just removed the spaces from the last--
[02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:40.380]   And I bet you they did not consult Dolly with that.
[02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:43.500]   They sat down with another person to discuss that.
[02:00:43.500 --> 02:00:44.340]   Not NAO.
[02:00:44.340 --> 02:00:45.780]   - I wouldn't do Dolly, that's image.
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:48.580]   You would do GPT-3, 'cause that's words.
[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:49.420]   - Yeah, GPT-3.
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:50.260]   - All right.
[02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:51.420]   - GPT-3.
[02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:54.300]   - I do love playing with, by the way.
[02:00:54.300 --> 02:00:56.620]   - See, you're gonna like Dolly too.
[02:00:56.620 --> 02:00:57.460]   - Yeah.
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:58.300]   - Yeah, I didn't say I wouldn't.
[02:00:58.300 --> 02:00:59.140]   - It's Antus.
[02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:01.500]   - Wait, wait, I say it what?
[02:01:01.500 --> 02:01:05.860]   - Antus says he hates Dolly.
[02:01:05.860 --> 02:01:07.540]   - No, did not--
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:09.980]   - What are they gonna virtualize tech punditries
[02:01:09.980 --> 02:01:11.660]   who don't know what they're talking about?
[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:12.500]   We're just gonna be--
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:14.300]   (laughing)
[02:01:14.300 --> 02:01:17.500]   - Oh man, I could see it happening though.
[02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:18.500]   Somewhere down the line.
[02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:19.340]   - I have a--
[02:01:19.340 --> 02:01:20.940]   - I have an Elon Musk's Twitter bid.
[02:01:20.940 --> 02:01:23.220]   I want a woman, two men,
[02:01:23.220 --> 02:01:25.580]   and I want it done in the style of--
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:28.300]   Walter Cronkite, go.
[02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:31.060]   (laughing)
[02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:31.900]   - Oh, oh.
[02:01:31.900 --> 02:01:32.740]   - Done in the style of the view.
[02:01:32.740 --> 02:01:34.220]   - I'd love to see that, actually.
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:36.100]   - Oh gosh.
[02:01:36.100 --> 02:01:36.940]   - The view.
[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:38.860]   - Oh, it's now Chrome OS.
[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:39.700]   - Not Chrome OS.
[02:01:39.700 --> 02:01:41.540]   - Chrome OS, Chrome OS.
[02:01:41.540 --> 02:01:42.380]   - Chrome OS.
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:43.220]   - Chrome OS.
[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:44.060]   - Chrome OS.
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:44.900]   - It was Chrome OS.
[02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:45.740]   - We have already got it.
[02:01:45.740 --> 02:01:47.220]   - More time than it deserves.
[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:48.500]   - Okay, move it right.
[02:01:48.500 --> 02:01:49.660]   - All right, that's a good one.
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:51.340]   - All right, fine, that's the Google change log,
[02:01:51.340 --> 02:01:52.180]   roller credits.
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:54.420]   (laughing)
[02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:56.340]   There we go.
[02:01:56.340 --> 02:01:59.020]   - Jason, I have faith that you would keep this show on track
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:00.660]   and you are not living up to it.
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:01.780]   (laughing)
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:02.620]   - Fine.
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:04.420]   (laughing)
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:05.340]   - Look, I'm not bad.
[02:02:05.340 --> 02:02:06.740]   - Doing the best I can.
[02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:08.380]   I feel the pressure to make it longer,
[02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:10.260]   but you know, what can I say?
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:12.380]   - How about we get to pick one waffle?
[02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:14.500]   (laughing)
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.420]   I understand you wanna get to your waffle,
[02:02:16.420 --> 02:02:17.260]   I'll get you there.
[02:02:17.260 --> 02:02:20.300]   - We haven't gone over the three hour mark.
[02:02:20.300 --> 02:02:22.740]   So I'm still, I mean, we're not even enough.
[02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:23.580]   - We're not even enough.
[02:02:23.580 --> 02:02:24.940]   - At this point, we're at two.
[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:25.780]   - Start of the three hours.
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:27.620]   - We started two hours ago, so we're doing okay.
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:29.500]   - Yeah, so we're doing okay.
[02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:31.940]   - Okay, so is there anything that we've missed
[02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:33.860]   before we get into pics, tips, tricks,
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:36.700]   all that kind of stuff that you don't wanna talk about?
[02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:39.500]   - Stacey and I are just saying about the same story.
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:40.340]   - Yeah, the same story.
[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:41.340]   - Sand battery.
[02:02:41.340 --> 02:02:42.200]   Tell us about it.
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:44.260]   - I don't know about it.
[02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:46.940]   I was just, I saw a sand battery and I was saying.
[02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:48.860]   - Yeah, so there's all kinds of efforts
[02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:52.300]   to try to store energy, obviously, in ways.
[02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:54.980]   My friend Bill Gross from IdeaLab has one we've talked about
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:58.020]   in the show of moving concrete blocks up and down.
[02:02:58.020 --> 02:02:59.900]   You move them up and then when you want the energy,
[02:02:59.900 --> 02:03:00.940]   you move them deck down.
[02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:03.620]   And the way Bill explains it is that the way this was
[02:03:03.620 --> 02:03:06.460]   primarily done was moving water up into reservoirs
[02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:09.620]   and every possible place on earth, fewer now
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:12.900]   than we have less water, had been used, so we went to blocks.
[02:03:12.900 --> 02:03:17.900]   So now these entrepreneurs say that sand holds onto heat
[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:22.420]   for an amazing long time.
[02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:27.420]   So they create basically just a silo of sand and they heat it
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:29.980]   and it'll keep it over days.
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:32.420]   And you think, well, that's a lot of energy wasted.
[02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:36.420]   You heat up the sand and then the sand through an exchanger
[02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:41.780]   goes reverse, but they say no, it actually holds onto the heat
[02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:46.420]   quite some time and has minimal loss along the way.
[02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:50.300]   So I found sand batteries fascinating.
[02:03:50.300 --> 02:03:51.140]   That was it.
[02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:53.300]   That is fascinating.
[02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:55.260]   - That's an amazing thing.
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:59.500]   - And we need progression or innovation in the realm
[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:00.900]   of battery technology.
[02:04:00.900 --> 02:04:02.380]   - Oh, do we?
[02:04:02.380 --> 02:04:03.900]   - Yeah, big time.
[02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:08.140]   So it was always right beneath our feet and we had no idea.
[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:08.980]   - Sand matter.
[02:04:08.980 --> 02:04:13.340]   - We could watch Emmanuelle Vemu on TikTok.
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:15.500]   - No, no.
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:16.340]   - Stop.
[02:04:16.340 --> 02:04:21.340]   - Excuse me, I did have one, line 59, the Tesla AI boss.
[02:04:21.340 --> 02:04:22.260]   How about that?
[02:04:22.260 --> 02:04:24.300]   - What is this?
[02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:25.140]   - What is it?
[02:04:25.140 --> 02:04:28.780]   - Line 59 Tesla AI boss.
[02:04:28.780 --> 02:04:30.660]   - You took us back to Tesla.
[02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:31.860]   Okay, all right, go.
[02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:37.460]   - Well, the AI boss was on leave for several months,
[02:04:37.460 --> 02:04:41.580]   I believe, but now they are resigned from Tesla
[02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:44.620]   because there's been fatalities with the autopilot
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:45.620]   and so forth.
[02:04:45.620 --> 02:04:49.260]   So with this lead gone, is that good news
[02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:51.340]   or is that bad news for Tesla?
[02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:53.140]   - Bad news for Tesla.
[02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:54.220]   - I'd say that's bad news.
[02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:56.300]   That doesn't sound good to me.
[02:04:56.300 --> 02:04:58.980]   - They get rid of the leadership and ready to bring in
[02:04:58.980 --> 02:04:59.900]   someone else.
[02:04:59.900 --> 02:05:04.900]   Is this something that Tesla's gonna continue to work on,
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:07.740]   or just let it go and just say,
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:09.540]   you know what, forget this autopilot stuff
[02:05:09.540 --> 02:05:12.700]   because we're not ready for it.
[02:05:12.700 --> 02:05:14.940]   - Oh man, I'd be really surprised if Tesla
[02:05:14.940 --> 02:05:17.620]   made that sort of about face on autopilot.
[02:05:17.620 --> 02:05:18.460]   - No, I'm feeling so heavily in change.
[02:05:18.460 --> 02:05:21.180]   - So have somebody as an ego at the top of that food chain.
[02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:22.180]   So I know that's not happening.
[02:05:22.180 --> 02:05:23.020]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:23.020 --> 02:05:23.860]   - That's true.
[02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:24.700]   - Yeah.
[02:05:24.700 --> 02:05:25.540]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:05:25.540 --> 02:05:29.900]   - Yeah, I don't know what to say about that other than that.
[02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:34.900]   Yeah, that seems like definitely a big reason for it.
[02:05:34.900 --> 02:05:38.820]   A reason for things to slow down at the very least.
[02:05:38.820 --> 02:05:40.300]   You know, if you don't have the visionary
[02:05:40.300 --> 02:05:42.220]   at the top of the chain,
[02:05:42.220 --> 02:05:44.420]   it's gonna take some time to build the trust around that.
[02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:46.140]   And I don't know what that leads to
[02:05:46.140 --> 02:05:48.860]   from a productivity standpoint, but yeah.
[02:05:48.860 --> 02:05:51.820]   - I wonder how important it is that feature.
[02:05:51.820 --> 02:05:53.460]   I wonder how important it is for people
[02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:56.180]   that are potential Tesla buyers.
[02:05:56.180 --> 02:05:58.140]   Are people buying Tesla's squashed strictly
[02:05:58.140 --> 02:06:00.020]   because they want the EV?
[02:06:00.020 --> 02:06:01.940]   Are they buying it because they want the status
[02:06:01.940 --> 02:06:03.460]   and the bells and whistles?
[02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:05.860]   - What is their customer base?
[02:06:05.860 --> 02:06:07.700]   - What do you think customer base like?
[02:06:07.700 --> 02:06:08.540]   - They see.
[02:06:08.540 --> 02:06:09.380]   - 'Cause some people buy it.
[02:06:09.380 --> 02:06:10.220]   - What I'm just for now.
[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:13.740]   - This is a sensible car and economical
[02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:16.500]   from a petroleum standpoint,
[02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:19.940]   but then you have people that want to buy the BMW
[02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:22.580]   for the status and the Mercedes for the status,
[02:06:22.580 --> 02:06:24.860]   even though those are very, very nice cars
[02:06:24.860 --> 02:06:27.300]   and far from an engineering standpoint.
[02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:30.340]   What is it like for the Tesla crowd?
[02:06:30.340 --> 02:06:31.220]   I don't know.
[02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:33.460]   I mean, I just see them everywhere over here.
[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:34.980]   - Yeah, and you're gonna see more of them.
[02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:39.980]   I mean, with all of the energy stuff in flux,
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:42.780]   I mean, Tesla has been increasing the prices
[02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:45.580]   of their vehicles in the past couple of months
[02:06:45.580 --> 02:06:47.300]   because demand has been so high.
[02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:48.540]   I feel like in a couple months.
[02:06:48.540 --> 02:06:49.380]   - Oh, I didn't notice them.
[02:06:49.380 --> 02:06:50.220]   - Wow.
[02:06:50.220 --> 02:06:51.620]   - Oh yeah, because of gas.
[02:06:51.620 --> 02:06:52.700]   - Oh yeah.
[02:06:52.700 --> 02:06:55.060]   - Yeah, I think it's largely about that.
[02:06:55.060 --> 02:06:57.140]   I should also mention that we are on the waiting list.
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:59.220]   We're waiting for the Tesla Model Y.
[02:07:00.220 --> 02:07:01.740]   If we really wanted to get a Tesla,
[02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:04.060]   we got solar on the house.
[02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:05.100]   What's that?
[02:07:05.100 --> 02:07:06.420]   - My neighbor has a Y.
[02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:09.300]   - Yeah, I mean, I actually fit in the Y,
[02:07:09.300 --> 02:07:10.140]   which is one thing.
[02:07:10.140 --> 02:07:12.500]   I don't fit in a lot of vehicles 'cause I'm so tall
[02:07:12.500 --> 02:07:16.300]   and the Y has the kind of taller cab, the dome.
[02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:18.660]   We test drove a lot of electric vehicles.
[02:07:18.660 --> 02:07:19.660]   And at the end of the day, it was like,
[02:07:19.660 --> 02:07:21.300]   you know what, this fits us better
[02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:23.500]   'cause my wife's also very tall.
[02:07:23.500 --> 02:07:27.340]   We got solar on our house about a year ago
[02:07:27.340 --> 02:07:29.980]   with the expressed intent of someday getting
[02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:31.020]   an electric vehicle.
[02:07:31.020 --> 02:07:32.980]   And so before the prices started jumping,
[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:35.180]   we were like, let's just put the order in.
[02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:37.220]   We're still having to wait until November,
[02:07:37.220 --> 02:07:38.980]   somewhere between November to January.
[02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:40.780]   And we put our order in probably two and a half,
[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:42.380]   almost two months ago.
[02:07:42.380 --> 02:07:44.260]   - You don't have to answer this if you don't want to,
[02:07:44.260 --> 02:07:47.220]   but this was a decision you all made
[02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:50.140]   because you just wanted something that's more economical,
[02:07:50.140 --> 02:07:53.140]   not because of the autopilot potential, right?
[02:07:53.140 --> 02:07:55.740]   - Oh yeah, we did not pay extra for the autopilot.
[02:07:55.740 --> 02:07:57.860]   If we had paid extra for the autopilot,
[02:07:57.860 --> 02:07:59.940]   which I think was another 12 grand in order
[02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:01.020]   to get that package.
[02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:03.140]   - That's what it says in the article.
[02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:03.980]   - We get a lot sooner.
[02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:04.820]   - We get a lot sooner in the test life.
[02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:06.420]   - It's 12 grand extra.
[02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:09.780]   - They definitely scale who gets what first
[02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:12.860]   based on the amount of extras that they're willing to spend.
[02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:14.520]   And that's the biggest extra you could get.
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.020]   If you get that, you're probably gonna get it.
[02:08:16.020 --> 02:08:17.100]   I don't know how it is now,
[02:08:17.100 --> 02:08:19.300]   but back when we were ordering, if we'd gotten that,
[02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:21.540]   we probably would have got it within a couple of months.
[02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:23.780]   But instead we're waiting because we didn't get that.
[02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:25.460]   It's kind of like our punishment
[02:08:25.460 --> 02:08:26.900]   for not trusting Tesla.
[02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:29.500]   - Are you ever up paid you upgrade to that?
[02:08:29.500 --> 02:08:31.860]   Or that's incapable of just out there?
[02:08:31.860 --> 02:08:33.820]   - That's a good question.
[02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:36.220]   I believe that you can upgrade to that,
[02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:38.260]   but I could be mistaken on that.
[02:08:38.260 --> 02:08:40.100]   I guess I haven't really looked into it too much
[02:08:40.100 --> 02:08:42.060]   'cause I'm just kind of not that interested in it,
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:42.900]   to be honest.
[02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:46.020]   That doesn't matter that much to me,
[02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:47.260]   the whole self-driving aspect.
[02:08:47.260 --> 02:08:48.340]   I don't really care.
[02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:52.300]   - For me and for us, it's purely about kind of cost savings,
[02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:54.980]   like knowing that we can pull the power from our solar
[02:08:54.980 --> 02:08:58.660]   and not have to pay for gas as much as we are right now.
[02:08:58.660 --> 02:09:01.140]   - No, I chose it just because I think it's fun to drive.
[02:09:01.140 --> 02:09:02.140]   So I--
[02:09:02.140 --> 02:09:03.300]   - And it's fun to drive.
[02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:04.740]   (laughs)
[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:05.580]   - Yeah.
[02:09:05.580 --> 02:09:08.260]   - I mean, and that's part of it too.
[02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:09.860]   My wife has said a number of times
[02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:11.380]   in the past couple of months,
[02:09:11.380 --> 02:09:13.860]   she never in a million years imagined
[02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:15.540]   buying a vehicle like a Tesla
[02:09:15.540 --> 02:09:18.700]   because it kind of has a flash factor to it and everything.
[02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:22.060]   But when she drove one, she was like, you know what?
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:24.980]   This car drives the way I want a car to drive
[02:09:24.980 --> 02:09:27.300]   and finally at a point in my life
[02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:29.540]   where I can buy a car that I actually really want
[02:09:29.540 --> 02:09:31.580]   and kind of spoil myself a little bit, let's do it.
[02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:33.220]   And I was like, all right, let's do it.
[02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:34.060]   - Sure.
[02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:35.780]   - Might you try the other electrics?
[02:09:35.780 --> 02:09:36.620]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:09:36.620 --> 02:09:38.540]   Drove a few of them.
[02:09:38.540 --> 02:09:41.660]   And I just, yeah, the, yeah,
[02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:44.380]   drove Leo's vehicle, what is that?
[02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:45.740]   That is the Mustang, right?
[02:09:45.740 --> 02:09:46.580]   The Maki. - The Maki.
[02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:47.460]   - The Maki, yeah.
[02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:49.380]   - And that was nice.
[02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:50.900]   I definitely fit into it.
[02:09:50.900 --> 02:09:53.060]   There was just something about,
[02:09:53.060 --> 02:09:55.220]   I don't know, there was something about the experience
[02:09:55.220 --> 02:09:56.940]   that I couldn't, it wasn't very tangible,
[02:09:56.940 --> 02:09:59.900]   but I was kind of like between that and the why,
[02:09:59.900 --> 02:10:01.420]   I think that was probably the two
[02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:04.500]   that I was considering most from my perspective.
[02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:06.460]   And there was just something about the experience
[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:08.220]   and the why that I enjoyed better.
[02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:09.540]   There's something about the styling.
[02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:10.540]   - You would, I may,
[02:10:10.540 --> 02:10:11.380]   - Yeah.
[02:10:11.380 --> 02:10:14.340]   You don't have to answer this either,
[02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:16.860]   but did you and your wife have any discussion about,
[02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:18.660]   well, but Elon?
[02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:22.260]   - Yeah, you know what, we honestly have not really
[02:10:22.260 --> 02:10:23.900]   had much of a discussion about that.
[02:10:23.900 --> 02:10:24.900]   I mean, I've had that,
[02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:26.660]   I've tossed that around in my head,
[02:10:26.660 --> 02:10:29.740]   'cause I don't know how closely she's necessarily following,
[02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:31.860]   you know, the day-to-day machinations
[02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:33.540]   of what Elon Musk is doing.
[02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:34.980]   I certainly do. - Absolutely.
[02:10:34.980 --> 02:10:37.580]   - And there's a part of me that has kind of
[02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:39.420]   negotiated that internally.
[02:10:39.420 --> 02:10:40.900]   And at the end of the day, I'm kind of like,
[02:10:40.900 --> 02:10:42.420]   you know what, I may not,
[02:10:42.420 --> 02:10:43.940]   I may not approve. - I think I'm not approved too,
[02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:45.220]   but yeah.
[02:10:45.220 --> 02:10:48.820]   - I mean, yeah, I mean, the company is bigger than just Elon.
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:51.460]   I actually know some people who have worked to Tesla
[02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:52.580]   and who do work at Tesla,
[02:10:52.580 --> 02:10:53.860]   and I know they're great people.
[02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:55.700]   And so, you know, to an extent,
[02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:58.020]   like am I supporting Elon by getting the vehicle sure,
[02:10:58.020 --> 02:11:00.100]   but I'm also supporting a lot of really great people as well.
[02:11:00.100 --> 02:11:03.260]   So, yeah, I don't know, that's how I'm justifying it.
[02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:06.700]   - I've sat in the wine, I've also sat in that Mach-E,
[02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:10.340]   and in my experience, that Mach-E definitely feels more
[02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:13.900]   like a fighter jet cockpit when you sit in it.
[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:14.740]   - Yeah.
[02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:17.780]   - And the why feels more like a sensible car, you know,
[02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:20.740]   than it is, it was just comfortable, you know?
[02:11:20.740 --> 02:11:21.900]   - Yeah, it's a good way to put it.
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:24.860]   There was something about the interior styling of the Mach-E
[02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:28.820]   that just didn't work as well for me
[02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:30.580]   compared to the Tesla, so.
[02:11:30.580 --> 02:11:34.260]   - Is the why the doors that attacked Lisa?
[02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:36.420]   - No, no.
[02:11:36.420 --> 02:11:38.820]   - No, thankfully, thankfully.
[02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:40.300]   - No, no.
[02:11:40.300 --> 02:11:42.700]   - Our neighbor has the Model X,
[02:11:42.700 --> 02:11:46.500]   and we have borrowed it from time to time,
[02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:50.380]   and it has the goal wings, and I hate them,
[02:11:50.380 --> 02:11:53.620]   I can't stand them, like they're so unnecessary and dumb.
[02:11:53.620 --> 02:11:54.820]   - Just give me suicide doors.
[02:11:54.820 --> 02:11:56.340]   - That's my opinion.
[02:11:56.340 --> 02:11:58.340]   - Give me suicide doors, not those.
[02:11:58.340 --> 02:12:00.780]   Suicide, I don't--
[02:12:00.780 --> 02:12:01.860]   - I don't even know what suicide doors are.
[02:12:01.860 --> 02:12:03.340]   - Yeah, what is suicide door?
[02:12:03.340 --> 02:12:07.980]   - Man, yeah, I need to look up a 64 Lincoln Continental,
[02:12:07.980 --> 02:12:09.020]   or as we call it. - The doors that go
[02:12:09.020 --> 02:12:11.660]   stinking Lincoln, and it's a four door car,
[02:12:11.660 --> 02:12:13.500]   yeah, and they open up that way.
[02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:15.660]   - Yeah, oh yeah.
[02:12:15.660 --> 02:12:18.940]   - Why are they waiting for me to do suicide doors?
[02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:21.220]   - I have no idea why I recall suicide doors.
[02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:22.900]   - That's a good question.
[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:26.060]   - Oh, I don't like the name, but I wanna say,
[02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:29.180]   I wanna say Rolls Royce has suicide doors as well.
[02:12:29.180 --> 02:12:33.100]   - Well, I don't think any of us are getting a role
[02:12:33.100 --> 02:12:35.140]   anytime soon, so.
[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:38.500]   - No, next year we have one.
[02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:40.540]   - Okay, well good, good for you.
[02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:43.060]   (laughing)
[02:12:43.060 --> 02:12:44.780]   - I recall suicide doors. - Congratulations.
[02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:45.820]   - You're in search?
[02:12:45.820 --> 02:12:48.460]   - Yeah, I could dream. - I don't know.
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:51.860]   - I don't know why, but yeah, one of my favorite cars
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:56.860]   is a 64 Lincoln Continental, just a beautiful tank of a car,
[02:12:56.860 --> 02:12:59.380]   and then it's got suicide doors on it,
[02:12:59.380 --> 02:13:03.180]   just a little bit of extra touch on it, love it.
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:06.300]   - Wikipedia says they're called that primarily
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:08.460]   because they are perceived as being less safe
[02:13:08.460 --> 02:13:10.820]   than a front-hinged door.
[02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:11.660]   - I don't know. - That's actually--
[02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:13.020]   - Interesting.
[02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:14.940]   - I didn't know that. - Wikipedia says,
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:19.540]   yeah, today I learned it was all, there you go, there you go.
[02:13:19.540 --> 02:13:21.100]   (laughing)
[02:13:21.100 --> 02:13:22.660]   - All right, should we do-- - Rear-edge,
[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:25.060]   so if the vehicle was moving and they sprang open,
[02:13:25.060 --> 02:13:27.940]   anyone who grabbed to stop what,
[02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:30.500]   that happening was whisked out of their seat
[02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:32.260]   into the roadway. - Oh boy.
[02:13:32.260 --> 02:13:33.740]   - Oh boy.
[02:13:33.740 --> 02:13:35.380]   - That's, wow, that's-- - That's not good.
[02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:36.900]   - That's saying a-- - Nobody wore seat belts
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:39.220]   back then. - Yeah, that's true.
[02:13:39.220 --> 02:13:40.420]   (laughing)
[02:13:40.420 --> 02:13:42.340]   - Nobody wore seat belts.
[02:13:42.340 --> 02:13:44.300]   But if someone wanted to give me a 64-link
[02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:48.300]   and I'd take it, a working 64-link and I'd take it.
[02:13:48.300 --> 02:13:50.140]   - Oh, a working, working, you gotta be picking.
[02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:50.980]   - Yes.
[02:13:50.980 --> 02:13:54.100]   (laughing)
[02:13:54.100 --> 02:13:57.140]   - Did you ever read that book I told you to read?
[02:13:57.140 --> 02:14:00.260]   Aunt, about-- - I'm just now--
[02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:02.700]   - About the Finnish player and the son.
[02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:04.980]   - Don't think I'm cranky about that.
[02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:06.860]   It's called Blacktop Wasteland,
[02:14:06.860 --> 02:14:10.220]   and it's about a getaway driver.
[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:13.700]   And I swear there's a 64-link in that book.
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:15.020]   - Blacktop Wasteland.
[02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:17.820]   - You gotta read it, man.
[02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:20.020]   - I wanna edit to the queue.
[02:14:20.020 --> 02:14:21.420]   I wanna edit to the queue.
[02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:26.060]   - It's "Litosians 11 Meets Drive."
[02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:28.860]   - Says the synopsis on Amazon.
[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:30.220]   (laughing)
[02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:31.580]   - Nice, I see that. - There you go.
[02:14:31.580 --> 02:14:33.220]   - Okay, there you go. - There you go.
[02:14:33.220 --> 02:14:34.660]   Thank you.
[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:35.780]   - Right on.
[02:14:35.780 --> 02:14:39.220]   - Let's do tips, tricks, things, all that stuff.
[02:14:39.220 --> 02:14:42.700]   We are at the nearing the end of this episode.
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:43.700]   Gotta keep us on track.
[02:14:43.700 --> 02:14:45.900]   - There's some tricks at the end of this show, yeah.
[02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:47.380]   (laughing)
[02:14:47.380 --> 02:14:49.460]   Something along those lines, I suppose.
[02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:51.500]   Jeff, what did you-- what you got?
[02:14:51.500 --> 02:14:52.340]   - Oh, what should I do?
[02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:53.380]   Oh, geez, go into me first.
[02:14:53.380 --> 02:14:54.580]   Oh, no, no, okay, I'll ask you.
[02:14:54.580 --> 02:14:55.420]   - Why not?
[02:14:55.420 --> 02:14:56.900]   (laughing)
[02:14:56.900 --> 02:14:59.900]   Just to keep me off by rocker.
[02:14:59.900 --> 02:15:04.900]   So, "Old Country" is a novel and a Netflix deal
[02:15:04.900 --> 02:15:07.380]   that came out of Reddit.
[02:15:07.380 --> 02:15:08.500]   I think it's pretty cool.
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:13.500]   Matt Quirry was in R/NoSleep,
[02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:17.260]   which were first-person horror stories.
[02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:19.180]   His thriller, "My Wife and I Bought a Ranch"
[02:15:19.180 --> 02:15:21.220]   was so engrossing, says "The Washington Post."
[02:15:21.220 --> 02:15:24.700]   It led to a book deal and a Netflix adaptation.
[02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:27.900]   Comes out July 26th and earlier reviews
[02:15:27.900 --> 02:15:29.180]   are comparing Quirry's writing
[02:15:29.180 --> 02:15:31.540]   alongside his brother, co-writer Harrison Quirry
[02:15:31.540 --> 02:15:35.620]   to horror masters Stephen King and Paul Tremblay.
[02:15:36.620 --> 02:15:38.620]   So, I'm not gonna do myself. - That's great, I love that.
[02:15:38.620 --> 02:15:41.220]   - I won't be doing it, but I love that it came out of Reddit.
[02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:44.180]   I think that is, is an indication of where we go here
[02:15:44.180 --> 02:15:47.020]   is that these are ideas that couldn't have gone
[02:15:47.020 --> 02:15:50.260]   through the gauntlet of publishing houses,
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:52.140]   which I'm trying to go through right now,
[02:15:52.140 --> 02:15:54.260]   and wouldn't have stood out,
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:56.340]   or it was just a simple little story or an idea
[02:15:56.340 --> 02:15:57.900]   and somebody saw the potential in it.
[02:15:57.900 --> 02:16:01.660]   And that kind of finding new talent and collaboration
[02:16:01.660 --> 02:16:03.900]   is what excites me most about the internet.
[02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:07.220]   So, yay to the Quirry runners.
[02:16:07.220 --> 02:16:08.980]   That is really cool.
[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:11.220]   How cool to like, you know, write something
[02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:15.380]   and post it to a Reddit forum and end up with a book deal.
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:17.020]   - And I've done it. - No, I could have.
[02:16:17.020 --> 02:16:19.140]   I could have made it awesome.
[02:16:19.140 --> 02:16:24.140]   Emmanuel, the TikTok emu, but you would love it.
[02:16:24.140 --> 02:16:30.780]   - It's just an emu that tries to steal somebody's,
[02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:32.740]   yes, I've seen it, it's not that funny.
[02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:34.380]   - It's all right.
[02:16:34.380 --> 02:16:36.660]   (laughing)
[02:16:36.660 --> 02:16:39.300]   You might also enjoy a history of user interfaces,
[02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:41.060]   but I think, don't bother.
[02:16:41.060 --> 02:16:44.460]   - No, that would be fascinating.
[02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:46.980]   - All right, all right, if you insist,
[02:16:46.980 --> 02:16:49.060]   they say can blame you for hunger.
[02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:54.020]   So it starts with the zero-oxed out.
[02:16:54.020 --> 02:16:55.980]   - This line is in on.
[02:16:55.980 --> 02:16:58.060]   - It's in my stuff, it's in my things.
[02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:02.660]   It's line 165, there we go, you got it.
[02:17:02.660 --> 02:17:06.020]   So dive in, which just scrolls up as all it does.
[02:17:06.020 --> 02:17:09.580]   Starting with the Alto, it doesn't have CPM,
[02:17:09.580 --> 02:17:14.580]   it doesn't have Chrome, but it has Alto's your Oxstar,
[02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:17.740]   Lisa.
[02:17:17.740 --> 02:17:21.180]   - Oh, cool. - Cool.
[02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:24.580]   But you can see, you know, get the images, which is nice.
[02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:26.580]   - This is much better than any manual.
[02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:30.020]   - Yeah, I agree, I agree.
[02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:31.380]   (laughing)
[02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:32.940]   - This is much better.
[02:17:32.940 --> 02:17:35.740]   - A manual would irritate you, that's the whole point.
[02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:38.260]   (laughing)
[02:17:38.260 --> 02:17:39.700]   The honest here.
[02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:40.540]   - Fair enough.
[02:17:40.540 --> 02:17:44.620]   - Windows 1.0, 1985.
[02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:48.820]   I was brought along to interview Bill Gates
[02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:52.500]   when Windows came out because the editor of People Magazine
[02:17:52.500 --> 02:17:54.940]   was gonna write the profile of him being the 24
[02:17:54.940 --> 02:17:57.900]   of the 25 most intriguing people had no idea
[02:17:57.900 --> 02:17:59.620]   what computers and laptops and things were.
[02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:01.060]   So I had to explain, I had to do like
[02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:03.900]   a simultaneous translation between Gates and him.
[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:04.740]   - Oh my God.
[02:18:04.740 --> 02:18:06.380]   - At Windows coming out.
[02:18:06.380 --> 02:18:07.220]   - Wow.
[02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:08.060]   - What it meant.
[02:18:08.060 --> 02:18:10.100]   - That was it.
[02:18:10.100 --> 02:18:10.940]   - This is cool.
[02:18:10.940 --> 02:18:11.780]   - I love this is awesome.
[02:18:11.780 --> 02:18:13.380]   - This is a nice thing.
[02:18:13.380 --> 02:18:15.260]   Very cute. - Pretty sweet.
[02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:16.540]   - Very.
[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:18.300]   That's what I love about it, right on?
[02:18:18.300 --> 02:18:19.700]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:18:19.700 --> 02:18:21.060]   Stacy, what you got?
[02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:26.260]   - All right, this isn't out yet, but I've talked
[02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:30.060]   to the creator, I think it's really a cool idea.
[02:18:30.060 --> 02:18:35.060]   It is Wush W-O-O-S-H Air.
[02:18:35.060 --> 02:18:38.980]   There was a Kickstarter, but now it's just, you know,
[02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:40.340]   the Wush system.
[02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:42.860]   And so what this guy has done is he's recognized
[02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:46.300]   that air filters, you know, the things that you stick
[02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:48.780]   in your house when you have an air conditioning thing,
[02:18:48.780 --> 02:18:52.060]   the biggest cost associated with them is actually shipping
[02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:53.740]   costs 'cause you have to put it, they're big,
[02:18:53.740 --> 02:18:57.460]   they're not heavy, but they have to be protected and whatnot.
[02:18:57.460 --> 02:19:01.740]   So he was like, why don't we create a filter
[02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:04.860]   that is replaceable and can be mailed in like a flat,
[02:19:04.860 --> 02:19:07.180]   not a flat pack, but like a puffy pack?
[02:19:07.180 --> 02:19:08.020]   - Not cool.
[02:19:08.020 --> 02:19:09.020]   - A puffy mailer.
[02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:11.020]   So that's part of it. - In a cardboard box.
[02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:12.220]   - No cardboard box.
[02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:15.620]   And so that takes down the cost.
[02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:17.780]   Now what's interesting is once you have a filter
[02:19:17.780 --> 02:19:21.500]   that the filter screen part stays in place,
[02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:23.460]   you can add a lot of sensors to it.
[02:19:23.460 --> 02:19:25.300]   So they've added an air quality sensor,
[02:19:25.300 --> 02:19:29.660]   they've added some pressure sensors for air pressure
[02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:32.500]   in your vents so you can start doing like information
[02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:35.540]   about how well your air is moving.
[02:19:35.540 --> 02:19:39.300]   And so the guy who did this, his name is Winston Mock,
[02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:44.300]   he's a former Googler and he's trying to work,
[02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:46.460]   like their goal is to become a data company
[02:19:46.460 --> 02:19:51.500]   not to make this stuff, but they're working with other
[02:19:51.500 --> 02:19:55.100]   companies who you probably have heard of in this space.
[02:19:55.100 --> 02:19:59.020]   And with smart like HVAC companies.
[02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:02.300]   And the idea is that you can create a smarter HVAC system
[02:20:02.300 --> 02:20:07.300]   without like putting all your vents,
[02:20:07.300 --> 02:20:09.500]   you know how people are doing like vent covers
[02:20:09.500 --> 02:20:10.540]   and stuff like that.
[02:20:10.540 --> 02:20:12.980]   So I thought this was a really kind of cool idea
[02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:13.900]   for a bunch of reasons.
[02:20:13.900 --> 02:20:18.220]   One, I've seen people try to attach sensors to air vents
[02:20:18.220 --> 02:20:20.300]   and it sucks because then you throw that away
[02:20:20.300 --> 02:20:23.540]   and there's now electronics plus the big bulky air vent thing.
[02:20:24.460 --> 02:20:26.180]   So that replaces that.
[02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:29.500]   And then you get like good data about like how well
[02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:31.940]   your air is performing in your home.
[02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:34.980]   So that's it.
[02:20:34.980 --> 02:20:38.180]   Yes, you don't have to go buy these things.
[02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:39.660]   They just ship them to you.
[02:20:39.660 --> 02:20:41.260]   - Just show up nice.
[02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:45.780]   - So that's this is kind of more like instead of a thing,
[02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:46.660]   it's more like a company.
[02:20:46.660 --> 02:20:49.020]   Oh look, they even wrote that I wrote about them.
[02:20:49.020 --> 02:20:50.100]   Ha ha ha.
[02:20:50.100 --> 02:20:52.540]   (laughing)
[02:20:52.540 --> 02:20:54.700]   - May I do an addendum to my earlier?
[02:20:54.700 --> 02:20:59.660]   There's a Twitter account at cats watch stray.
[02:20:59.660 --> 02:21:01.340]   So if you do get into that folks.
[02:21:01.340 --> 02:21:02.180]   - I thought it was gonna be that.
[02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:03.940]   - It's the entire Twitter account of that.
[02:21:03.940 --> 02:21:05.420]   No, no, I didn't, I didn't do it.
[02:21:05.420 --> 02:21:06.700]   I listened to democracy.
[02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:08.820]   I listened to the will of the people.
[02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:12.500]   There is however, the first one in the Twitter account
[02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:16.820]   is a dog, but you know, so much for holding with the concept.
[02:21:16.820 --> 02:21:18.220]   - Of course.
[02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:19.860]   There's always one messing it up.
[02:21:19.860 --> 02:21:20.860]   (laughing)
[02:21:20.860 --> 02:21:22.580]   - There's always one dog.
[02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:24.300]   (laughing)
[02:21:24.300 --> 02:21:26.540]   - So much cooler than all the cats.
[02:21:26.540 --> 02:21:29.700]   - All right, right on.
[02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:30.980]   - And what you got?
[02:21:30.980 --> 02:21:35.260]   - For me, my picks are fairly quick.
[02:21:35.260 --> 02:21:38.660]   First up, Adobe Max, we've talked about that in the past.
[02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:40.900]   The registration is now open.
[02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:43.460]   Adobe Max is going to be on October,
[02:21:43.460 --> 02:21:46.780]   I believe it's 18th through the 21st.
[02:21:46.780 --> 02:21:49.660]   I don't know if I will be there covering it or not.
[02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:51.980]   I'd like to be, but we'll see.
[02:21:51.980 --> 02:21:54.620]   It's going to be live or virtual,
[02:21:54.620 --> 02:21:55.860]   'cause they had a virtual last year,
[02:21:55.860 --> 02:21:57.660]   so they're going to give you a virtual option too.
[02:21:57.660 --> 02:22:00.860]   If you can't attend, they're still working out
[02:22:00.860 --> 02:22:03.580]   all of the speakers, but I believe they got a bunch of them
[02:22:03.580 --> 02:22:05.780]   pretty much squared away and just still finalizing
[02:22:05.780 --> 02:22:07.780]   a handful left.
[02:22:07.780 --> 02:22:12.580]   But go to max.adobie.com and register to hang out
[02:22:12.580 --> 02:22:13.700]   at the Creator Conference.
[02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:16.740]   I love it, I love being there and seeing the people
[02:22:16.740 --> 02:22:18.700]   and learning some things too.
[02:22:19.540 --> 02:22:23.300]   Next, we were talking about birthdays and pre-shows,
[02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:26.500]   and this is a bit of a shout out to a friend of mine
[02:22:26.500 --> 02:22:30.500]   and an actual former Google employee,
[02:22:30.500 --> 02:22:33.100]   but she's still back in Charlotte, my friend, Tamika.
[02:22:33.100 --> 02:22:38.300]   Her son is playing, he plays a football,
[02:22:38.300 --> 02:22:40.620]   Rick Leake football, the Leake football,
[02:22:40.620 --> 02:22:42.540]   and they did their little fundraiser,
[02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:44.940]   and I told her I would mention it on air
[02:22:44.940 --> 02:22:47.020]   because I believe in the Little League fundraiser
[02:22:47.020 --> 02:22:48.900]   and the Little League sports,
[02:22:48.900 --> 02:22:50.220]   especially in the black community
[02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:52.860]   because it gives a lot of kids some guidance
[02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:55.540]   and some leadership and sometimes a little kick in the butt
[02:22:55.540 --> 02:22:58.940]   that they may need that they're not getting at home.
[02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:01.300]   So I will always advocate for that.
[02:23:01.300 --> 02:23:04.340]   They've already met their goal,
[02:23:04.340 --> 02:23:06.620]   but you can still donate to it
[02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:09.940]   buying a bag of popcorn or something like that.
[02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:12.020]   The popcorn people get half of the funds
[02:23:12.020 --> 02:23:14.580]   and the football team gets the other half,
[02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:16.260]   and it's good because they can use the support.
[02:23:16.260 --> 02:23:19.220]   I've worked on these Little League teams before
[02:23:19.220 --> 02:23:21.500]   and I know how difficult it can be
[02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:23.420]   because a lot of times what you end up doing
[02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:27.060]   is helping to provide a spot for a kid
[02:23:27.060 --> 02:23:29.540]   that their parents couldn't afford to be on the team.
[02:23:29.540 --> 02:23:33.340]   My kids, they both played Rick Ball,
[02:23:33.340 --> 02:23:34.700]   didn't have a problem getting them on,
[02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:37.220]   but there was a couple of times
[02:23:37.220 --> 02:23:38.740]   where I had to come out of my pocket
[02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:41.980]   to help pay for another kid to be able to play.
[02:23:41.980 --> 02:23:43.700]   And I know one of the playing was a good kid
[02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:45.900]   and it's just unfortunate that parents couldn't afford it
[02:23:45.900 --> 02:23:49.380]   and fundraisers like this help keep the coaches
[02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:51.380]   from coming out of their pockets like that
[02:23:51.380 --> 02:23:53.260]   and plus help provide some decent equipment
[02:23:53.260 --> 02:23:54.100]   and things like that.
[02:23:54.100 --> 02:23:56.340]   So Link would be in the show notes
[02:23:56.340 --> 02:23:58.260]   and happy birthday, Tamika.
[02:23:58.260 --> 02:24:01.540]   And lastly, just follow me on Instagram
[02:24:01.540 --> 02:24:02.820]   and time to score Pruitt.
[02:24:02.820 --> 02:24:05.060]   I've been having fun playing with Instagram,
[02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:06.060]   (laughs)
[02:24:06.060 --> 02:24:08.580]   playing around with the whole video
[02:24:08.580 --> 02:24:10.220]   versus photography thing on there.
[02:24:10.220 --> 02:24:13.380]   And that algorithm has been quite fascinating,
[02:24:13.380 --> 02:24:15.380]   quite fascinating.
[02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:16.420]   You have a new headshot too.
[02:24:16.420 --> 02:24:17.980]   Did you take that of yourself?
[02:24:17.980 --> 02:24:18.820]   Oh, that's good.
[02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:19.660]   I liked that.
[02:24:19.660 --> 02:24:21.060]   Yes, sir, I did.
[02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:22.980]   I was like, I need a new headshot
[02:24:22.980 --> 02:24:25.340]   and I've just been lazy with getting it done
[02:24:25.340 --> 02:24:28.140]   and I finally shot it and put it out there.
[02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:30.420]   It just made me really updated.
[02:24:30.420 --> 02:24:31.740]   Thank you.
[02:24:31.740 --> 02:24:33.540]   Yeah, look sharp.
[02:24:33.540 --> 02:24:35.980]   And you did that all by yourself.
[02:24:35.980 --> 02:24:38.820]   You didn't need a camera person to come in.
[02:24:38.820 --> 02:24:44.340]   How do you strike that authentic like spur of the moment?
[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:45.460]   Like, you know what I mean?
[02:24:45.460 --> 02:24:47.380]   Sometimes it requires the camera person
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:49.860]   to kind of like pull you out of your own head.
[02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:50.940]   No, it is natural.
[02:24:50.940 --> 02:24:53.660]   You sit there and hit the button and say,
[02:24:53.660 --> 02:24:56.180]   all right, okay, does this look okay?
[02:24:56.180 --> 02:24:58.780]   And I had my camera tethered to the computer
[02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:01.500]   so I could see what the camera's gonna do.
[02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:02.340]   It's gonna be loose.
[02:25:02.340 --> 02:25:07.340]   And, you know, so I'll take probably 20 shots or so
[02:25:07.340 --> 02:25:09.100]   and then I'll stop.
[02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:12.580]   And then you'll run it through Dolly and say,
[02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:16.500]   give me the perfect version of this shot
[02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:17.540]   and it will return.
[02:25:17.540 --> 02:25:19.140]   It already is, sir.
[02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:22.260]   Yeah, I can do nothing more.
[02:25:22.260 --> 02:25:23.100]   You nailed it.
[02:25:23.100 --> 02:25:23.940]   I had to prove it.
[02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:26.420]   You win.
[02:25:26.420 --> 02:25:29.100]   Meanwhile, mine will be Stacy.
[02:25:29.100 --> 02:25:30.180]   Pick a better shot.
[02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:33.580]   Thanks, Dolly.
[02:25:33.580 --> 02:25:41.380]   Oh, my pick is just something that I thought was kind of cool.
[02:25:41.820 --> 02:25:45.620]   Apparently there's a now a Lego kit
[02:25:45.620 --> 02:25:48.100]   for the Atari 2600 console.
[02:25:48.100 --> 02:25:49.300]   I guess what is it?
[02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:51.860]   It's the 1977 debut.
[02:25:51.860 --> 02:25:56.860]   So this is the 1980 revision of the console
[02:25:56.860 --> 02:26:02.620]   that comes with just shy of 2600 pieces.
[02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:04.420]   It's 2,532 pieces.
[02:26:04.420 --> 02:26:06.060]   Oh, really? Come on.
[02:26:06.060 --> 02:26:07.700]   I feel like they could have like, yeah,
[02:26:07.700 --> 02:26:10.940]   I feel like they couldn't have boosted that somehow.
[02:26:10.940 --> 02:26:11.900]   That would have been perfect.
[02:26:11.900 --> 02:26:14.620]   But anyways, it's kind of cool looking.
[02:26:14.620 --> 02:26:17.540]   In your minds around, they could have come up with that math, man.
[02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:19.420]   I mean, they were that close.
[02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:20.860]   They could have done something.
[02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:22.860]   Let's be honest.
[02:26:22.860 --> 02:26:25.620]   But it's going to be available August 1st, $240,
[02:26:25.620 --> 02:26:29.100]   so a little pricey, but very cool for the video game nerds out there.
[02:26:29.100 --> 02:26:31.300]   And actually on the inside,
[02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:35.020]   it's like it's not a fully functional console or anything to my knowledge,
[02:26:35.020 --> 02:26:38.180]   anyways, but if you if you open it up on the inside,
[02:26:38.180 --> 02:26:41.340]   it's a recreation of like a 1980s living room.
[02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:43.700]   So I don't know.
[02:26:43.700 --> 02:26:45.540]   It's super nerdy, but I love it.
[02:26:45.540 --> 02:26:48.740]   Has a couple of cartridges that you can put into it and everything.
[02:26:48.740 --> 02:26:49.820]   It fits the cartridges.
[02:26:49.820 --> 02:26:52.260]   Wait, does the living room have the faux wood paneling?
[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:53.620]   Tell me.
[02:26:53.620 --> 02:26:54.620]   It looks too.
[02:26:54.620 --> 02:26:57.380]   It has to. Yeah, it looks like it has wood paneling to me.
[02:26:57.380 --> 02:27:00.620]   I mean, it's their brown Lego pieces.
[02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:05.340]   So yeah, it looks like it has someone playing a guitar
[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:11.780]   and a CRT monitor and a boom box and, you know, all the all the things.
[02:27:11.780 --> 02:27:16.300]   Yeah, there's a little there's a little phone.
[02:27:16.300 --> 02:27:19.420]   It's apparently, no, I guess that's how big phones were.
[02:27:19.420 --> 02:27:24.380]   It looks a little big, but I'm like, no, actually, I guess we were pretty gigantic.
[02:27:24.380 --> 02:27:26.700]   Yeah, that's a pretty large phone.
[02:27:26.700 --> 02:27:28.540]   Yeah, that's a pretty large one.
[02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:32.780]   And actually the joystick that you build as well actually moves.
[02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:33.820]   So it's not static.
[02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:36.020]   Like you can actually move around the joystick and stuff.
[02:27:36.020 --> 02:27:38.180]   So it's a dynamic joystick.
[02:27:38.180 --> 02:27:40.260]   Wow.
[02:27:40.260 --> 02:27:41.380]   I mean, it moves.
[02:27:41.380 --> 02:27:44.940]   I don't know if it does much more than that, but it's still pretty awesome.
[02:27:44.940 --> 02:27:45.780]   I love it.
[02:27:45.780 --> 02:27:46.780]   Kids.
[02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:49.660]   What's that?
[02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:50.580]   What is that?
[02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:51.060]   You found it.
[02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:51.660]   I don't understand.
[02:27:51.660 --> 02:27:52.620]   What is that, Jeff?
[02:27:52.620 --> 02:27:54.020]   That thing's fancy.
[02:27:54.020 --> 02:27:57.300]   Oh, you talk a little courty chord.
[02:27:57.300 --> 02:28:01.020]   That's talking PBX to from the museum.
[02:28:01.020 --> 02:28:02.660]   Wow.
[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:10.780]   So somewhere a number of years ago, we acquired a phone that looks a lot like that.
[02:28:10.780 --> 02:28:14.220]   And it became like a toy for the kids, like for them to pretend.
[02:28:14.220 --> 02:28:17.580]   That's what those old phones are good for now.
[02:28:17.580 --> 02:28:18.860]   They're good for being toys.
[02:28:18.860 --> 02:28:20.340]   That's a thrift store.
[02:28:20.340 --> 02:28:21.100]   Ten dollars.
[02:28:21.100 --> 02:28:21.820]   Dear, sir.
[02:28:21.820 --> 02:28:23.100]   Yes, indeed.
[02:28:23.100 --> 02:28:24.780]   Yes, indeed.
[02:28:24.780 --> 02:28:26.300]   All right.
[02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:27.740]   That's the that's it.
[02:28:27.740 --> 02:28:29.460]   We've reached the end of this episode of this week.
[02:28:29.460 --> 02:28:32.700]   You always always so much fun hanging out with you.
[02:28:32.700 --> 02:28:33.420]   You brought us through.
[02:28:33.420 --> 02:28:35.100]   Nice works or nice work.
[02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:36.260]   Thank you.
[02:28:36.260 --> 02:28:37.420]   It's a lot of fun.
[02:28:37.420 --> 02:28:40.300]   Stacy, what do you want to leave people with?
[02:28:40.300 --> 02:28:41.980]   Where can people find what you're doing?
[02:28:41.980 --> 02:28:42.820]   What do you want to know?
[02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:48.220]   You can find everything at Stacy on IOT.com and, you know, download the podcast.
[02:28:48.220 --> 02:28:51.180]   If you're into the IOT and sign up for the newsletter, it's free.
[02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:53.020]   Do it.
[02:28:53.020 --> 02:28:53.860]   Do it, everybody.
[02:28:53.860 --> 02:28:54.780]   Good to see you, Stacy.
[02:28:54.780 --> 02:28:55.460]   Appreciate it.
[02:28:55.460 --> 02:28:56.580]   Thanks.
[02:28:56.580 --> 02:28:57.300]   Yeah.
[02:28:57.300 --> 02:28:58.940]   And what about you, Jeff?
[02:28:58.980 --> 02:29:00.260]   Where do you want to direct everyone?
[02:29:00.260 --> 02:29:04.700]   Once I get a pub date, I'll be plugging the book every week, but not until then.
[02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:06.260]   So you're safe until then.
[02:29:06.260 --> 02:29:08.100]   All right.
[02:29:08.100 --> 02:29:11.340]   We'll be we'll be on the lookout waiting for that.
[02:29:11.340 --> 02:29:15.620]   And finally, and but we should say buzz machine.com.
[02:29:15.620 --> 02:29:17.820]   If people really want to find out, you can see that.
[02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:19.540]   There you go.
[02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:21.500]   And then add Pruitt.
[02:29:21.500 --> 02:29:22.740]   What do you want to leave people with?
[02:29:22.740 --> 02:29:23.620]   What you got in the works?
[02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:26.620]   Hey, hands on photography this week.
[02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:29.380]   A bit of a different episode coming up.
[02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:34.700]   Going to talk about some of your photography imperfections, if you will.
[02:29:34.700 --> 02:29:35.700]   And it's going to be fun.

[02:29:47.180 --> 02:29:48.700]   Indeed.

[02:31:44.100 --> 02:31:45.140]   Bye everybody.
[02:31:45.140 --> 02:31:49.300]   Hey, I'm Rod Pyle, editor of Ad Astor magazine.
[02:31:49.300 --> 02:31:54.100]   And each week I'm joined by Tariq Malek, the editor in chief over at space.com.
[02:31:54.100 --> 02:31:58.660]   In our new This Week in Space podcast, every Friday Tariq and I take a deep dive into the
[02:31:58.660 --> 02:32:00.580]   stories that define the new space age.
[02:32:00.580 --> 02:32:01.700]   What's NASA up to?
[02:32:01.700 --> 02:32:04.420]   When will Americans once again set foot on the moon?
[02:32:04.420 --> 02:32:06.580]   And how about those samples from the Perseverance rover?
[02:32:06.580 --> 02:32:08.020]   When are those coming home?
[02:32:08.020 --> 02:32:10.260]   What the heck is Elon Musk done now?
[02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:14.580]   In addition to all the latest and greatest in space exploration, we'll take an occasional look
[02:32:14.580 --> 02:32:17.700]   at bits of space flight history that you probably never heard of.
[02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:20.900]   And all with an eye towards having a good time along the way.
[02:32:20.900 --> 02:32:22.900]   Check us out on your favorite podcatcher.
[02:32:22.900 --> 02:32:33.140]   [Music]
