[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.440]   Yes, it is cold. Did I mention that it's cold here? It's cold. Yeah, it was four degrees yesterday
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.760]   And I just I don't own
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.760]   thermal underwear folks
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:03.120]   Like I was at American apparel by my office just like buying random legging like just please like like layers
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.120]   I'm wearing as many layers as possible
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.400]   I need leggings
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.840]   I nearly task-ravated somebody to go to need my clothes for me to get to get heat tech
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.720]   Wow, so yes, it's very cold here, but I'm so happy back on the show. I really missed you guys
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.200]   I'm so sorry that I miss the the New Year's shenanigans, which was amazing. I caught some of it
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.400]   Well, here's the good news. We're doing it again
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.080]   We'll have to wait a year of course. I'm not doing it again tomorrow
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.400]   But and I want you and Jeff to be here what we found was the really the real benefit of doing that New Year's thing
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.520]   Well besides the fact that we got to talk to people all around the world
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.480]   I mean really it was a real celebration was getting to see our hosts in unusual
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.040]   Contexts, so I think we're gonna do next one. Yeah, so next year they'll be beyond me though Leo
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.280]   I know I yeah some of them I the Star Trek thing we won't make you
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.680]   Chad looked in place there. I think I'd be a little out of place. You have to be a Star Trek fan
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.040]   I was at a place that was fun though. We were commanding a starship
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.680]   in a simulation and we had all the
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.560]   People to be on the bridge and Navigator comms officer tactical officer captain and everything
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.400]   It was really fun. That was called the Artemis simulation. He goes around from a conference to conference doing those
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.680]   West us and we'll have that and all of the highlights on our youtube channel
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.920]   Soon in fact we're putting hour by hour up right now on youtube.com/insight twit and then on twit specials
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.400]   We'll do in a series of specials, but what I was saying is the thing that I think is so great
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.120]   And we will definitely do next year one is we're gonna get every time zone
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.680]   I gotta talk to everybody in every time zone and say and because we had 30 bottles of champagne
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.840]   And we just it was so much fun opening one every hour or sometimes every 15 minutes
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.480]   But then the other is I want to get every host out here
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.800]   And I want you all to pick something that you love that isn't what you normally talk about
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   So steve made coffee. Mary Joach gave us a beer tasting Alex lindsey mixed drinks
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.040]   It was really fun
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.200]   Very cool. Yeah, can I talk about MMA?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Yeah, you want to is that what you do?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.440]   We can have a little MMA demonstration, you know we did have we had a team of
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.520]   theatrical fighting people show us how to do
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:24.800]   You know light saber fighting. Oh, that's cool. That's really cool. So I put on my hood and oh
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.360]   I think that was the geekiest moment of all
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.880]   By the mr. P you but I don't know if it sounds like you watched the show
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.640]   Came in on off throughout the 24 hours. I'd say I'm bored. You were like my twitter that did it was on twitter
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.800]   I think what's what how is leo making the full of
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.320]   Really did you kind of feel like you had friends who were having a party and you could drop it when you wanted
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.840]   I did kind of the same thing I was working
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.440]   But everyone said a while I would just kind of stop in and be like what are these what are these guys doing now?
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.400]   And it was always it would always make me laugh well now you are going to be the friends
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.560]   We're having the Barney. Oh, I like it. Well, fly. We'll fly you out
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.600]   Yeah, please do bring your baby and everything your your wife everybody wants to come out
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.960]   We're gonna this this is going to be I think a regular feature
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.840]   Of the network because it's just so much fun
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.760]   You know, we're also want to be at that time of year next year is the chaos computer club meeting
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.560]   I was watching tons of videos when I think jake about apple bound just did brilliant brilliant presentation
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.160]   Now that is a is it german? Where is the chaos computer club?
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.200]   It's still this year is at hamburg. It's only been in brelind at the beginning of the wiki leaks movie. That's where that's where
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.000]   Assange is presenting with he leaks at first
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.160]   It's it's the mondo gathering of of good hackers and
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.520]   They had glen warden wall give a a
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.200]   Keto'd
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.880]   Nice if snowden could have snuck in for that would have been phenomenal phenomenal
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.520]   Well, one of the great pictures was at the airport for hemburg
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.480]   That bought people took this picture a guy standing there as if a as if a chauffeur with a sign that just had snowed
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.600]   Just a case
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.280]   Is right is waiting. I really recommend jake back when bombs video look it up folks
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.520]   It's it's um and is that a new year thing they do every new year they do it between
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.720]   So okay, so you could go to that and then come out here. It's fly at fly to hamburg. Yes
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.960]   I don't like the idea
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.840]   Of having you be here. He was was he talking about nsa this time?
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.880]   Yeah, he was talking about the stuff that the der Spiegel revealed. Oh, I guess now afigo
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.840]   And and he kept on saying it's gonna blow your mind and blinds not blown yet and he got to the end of the presentation
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.240]   You know he's Eddie who here still hasn't had their their mind blown. He said you're cynics
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.480]   Just wait now i'm gonna do it and then one guy raised his hand his mind still wasn't blown
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.680]   It was it was what they can do to us. It was pretty amazing
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:54.880]   Well and the ant materials which we've talked about extensively security now effect all of security down next week will be on the ant materials
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.640]   Uh, I guess not having steve on before the show. I always get to learn a little bit
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:04.640]   I know you're gonna have to do it in it's on tuesday's now one pm pacific four pm eastern
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.440]   Um good. I will watch this
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.960]   It was called to protect and infect the militarization of the internet. Oh, yeah
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.160]   um
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.240]   So there's good stuff that happens that time of year, you know, yeah, you're saying that slow
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.480]   It's a slow time as we as everybody gets ready for c. Yes, which is going on right now
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.240]   Um and it is tends to be a little slow in tech news the nsa really kept us lit up
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.280]   And this I credit steve
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.600]   Edward Snowden and grilling greenwald for this because their strategy was
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.840]   to
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.600]   Doll out bit by bit this information, but it but now they get accused of doing that cynically
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.800]   And and it's important to say and it's really really important to say that that's I don't think that's fully the strategy
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.960]   It's it's also that each of these revelations takes a lot of reporting
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.160]   And yeah, here's my guardian friends. You really got to dig in figure out what the uh, you know
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.680]   What does this acronym mean?
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.400]   What is this really one of the implications of this and that talk to people?
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.200]   There's a huge amount of work that goes into each one of these stories
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.360]   So I think that's part of the reason it takes time
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.960]   And so when they get accused of doling it out or he gets accused of
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.760]   Of hoarding it until he gets under um, pure midiars wing
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:23.440]   Um, you know, is that true or not? I I don't know but but if they did it the fastest pace possible
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.400]   I don't think it'd be a lot much faster than what they've been doing. I think
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.000]   It's easy you could interpret it either way. It's easy to say oh, it's cynical
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.160]   They want to maximize the monetary value, but I I it by now there should be no question in anybody's mind at the
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.800]   Whether whether they're doing that or not that by slowly dribbling it out
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:47.040]   Gives it. It's appropriate amount of attention had they dumped this all as wiki leak style dumped this all
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.320]   It would not have gotten the attention it deserves you're right. Um, just the just this
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.280]   Catalog of exploits from leak source
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:02.480]   Uh, the ant exploits and admittedly these are old these are few years old the iphone exploit for instance is from 2008 for the second
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.080]   iphone
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.680]   Um, so we
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.880]   Presume that there's much better effective stuff going on right now
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.160]   Shows how they can target an attack against pretty much anybody now
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.560]   Bruce shanair does make that point on these that this is
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.600]   Uh privacy invasion
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.000]   Retail style not wholesale style unlike gathering all the phone records
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.840]   This is how you can take someone's iphone
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:31.920]   And spy on what they're doing not everybody's just some bodies
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.880]   How you can embed something in a computer so they can't get rid of it and things like that how to
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.560]   And let's say that that that you know if you look at the principles that were put out by google and the other seven companies
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.720]   I think we're all fine with specific surveillance of people who are properly suspected
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.040]   Under due process and with with, uh, do cause
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.200]   Uh, so some other technology, you know, I guess isn't bad
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.680]   But do we have any faith that they use it only for that purpose when we have secret Pfizer courts
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.440]   Not so much. Oh, there's no
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:10.960]   Look at the great revelation coming this week of the the revealed who the burgers were who went after the fbi and showed how
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:32.020]   jay
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.660]   No, no, no, no, no, no, look at there's there's no more important story of 2014 it should have been
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:44.180]   uh times person of the year and everything else but yes, um, I don't know if there's much news we can add
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.580]   Except to say that if you want to know what these exploits are
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:57.460]   Bruce schnire is going one by one a blog post a day through them and his blog schnire.com and steve gipson's going to do his analysis of the ant and dow
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.580]   Technologies next week
[00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.980]   Yeah, I think security now is now on when you know two stays one pm pacific for pm eastern time
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:12.180]   Onto it dot tv you can watch live, but you can always get anything after the fact you can watch last
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:19.220]   Tuesday's show if you want uh twitter dot tv slash sn we talk a little bit more about this it is kind of shocking
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.340]   And depressing a little bit
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.620]   It is so do you have any temptation at all to go to ces is here
[00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.700]   I always am tempted. I always it's a mixed feeling. How about you?
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.540]   No, I haven't been in two decades pro gina. Did you want to I bet you wanted to go?
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.900]   No, never been don't want to go. It's just not my thing you can tell from a distance. It's too much
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.820]   I can tell from a distance. It's just not my thing. Well, I've never been much of a hardware
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:50.740]   I I always sort of I'm biased towards software and I'm also just an introvert. So it sounds like hell to me
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:58.660]   It is a lot of noise a lot of commotion a lot of fuss everything's twice as hard as it ought to be from
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.140]   Getting a sandwich to getting a cab
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:08.500]   Um, yeah, it sounds like comic con except without the cool costumes times a thousand. Yeah, it's time to thousand and yet
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.700]   There's certainly stuff to see
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.020]   Some of it fascinating like michael bays meltdown at the sam's song event
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:21.140]   Some of it silly like the idea of mixing and right in windows 8.1 in a computer
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.860]   Yes, what do you guys think of that?
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.900]   That's an asus
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.900]   transformer
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:34.340]   Yeah, we you know we covered that last line on android and all about android and um, I was saying after the show to my friends
[00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:37.860]   Like I forgot what a crazy time the android ecosystem
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.780]   the the
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:44.260]   Notebook laptop that do a hot dual boots android in windows
[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:50.660]   Uh, that was up against the phone that docks into the tablet which I know isn't a new thing as like the two
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.220]   Crazy why would I ever want this?
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:55.620]   Right gadgets for me for me
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.580]   Um, but it does kind of feel like oh, let's just throw something up against the wall and see what sticks
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.820]   You know throw everything up against the wall and see what sticks
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.300]   It does not seem like there's demand. I don't understand who what the use case is
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.740]   Um unless there's like a game or some app that you use in an i don't understand the use case for windows period
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.180]   Well, I mean you would go all the other way
[00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:22.660]   Yeah, I mean I haven't used windows in forever. So I I realized that my my mac my mac bias gonna makes me scoff
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:29.380]   You know, but it's it's for people leo who can't decide between an android laptop or a windows tablet. You can get both
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.460]   I can't decide
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:42.980]   Transformer book to it. Yeah. It by the way, it's android four one is jelly bean
[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.900]   Um kind of a little behind we're up to four four now
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.620]   Uh, it's not the first we've seen
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.500]   Uh other companies have done this even last year
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.300]   And I thought asus did this last year
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.380]   But you know there you go. There's it's there if you want it
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:05.700]   You're right about the timing here. I I wish I could figure out the year, but I realized that I now use no microsoft products at all
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.580]   It's the first and the first time since probably
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.860]   1982 something like that
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:16.500]   Yeah, yeah, I was on cpm and 81
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.700]   That's doss
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.780]   In when when did the pcs come out?
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.420]   IBM pcs 1981
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.300]   81 so it's probably about 82 that I got that
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:33.860]   Uh, and so from 82 until 2013 I used microsoft products and now I don't use any microsoft product
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.340]   Yeah, no offense to microsoft. It's not because i'm trying to it's not gonna be good. They're bad or anything like that
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.500]   It's just because I just don't need them now. I got to cloud
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:47.460]   The other uh point to be made about ces is that I think if you're a company that really has something to say
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.980]   Doing it at ces is really a crapshoot
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.180]   You might get more attention because there sure is a lot of press there
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:58.340]   But you might not you might get buried in the sea of information
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.500]   And not get the attention you want I think it worked well for for marissa
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.300]   She get okay. So marissa mire gave the keynote
[00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:10.820]   Um, I think she got attention. I think that that's so if you can do a keynote
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:16.100]   At ces that's going to guarantee you a certain amount of attention. There's only a handful of those
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:20.740]   And I mean she's running a huge company gets and gets a lot of attention just because that company
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.460]   You know she's turning that company around and well as the first time
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.260]   They've done a keynote there, right?
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.900]   Yahoo's done a keynote. I think yeah, unless i'm
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:35.940]   I don't maybe terry simmled it one. I don't remember it doesn't seem like right. It seems like the equivalent of a consumer app
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.140]   Announcing it south by south west, which is something I do exactly
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.340]   Yes, there's some benefit
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:49.300]   Well, I note for instance that mo to rolla has announced is doing an event in london january 14th now if this were a big important announcement
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.900]   I they could have done it a week earlier at ces
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:56.180]   By the way according to droid life
[00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.700]   The thinking is this will be good news for you in england
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.500]   modo x
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.500]   And modo maker perhaps
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.300]   um
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:12.020]   Motorola told droid life at ces we have a bit of an announcement
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:16.500]   It's very british and we have ambitions to broaden our geographic footprint
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   There is a job listing on the moderola uk site suggesting
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.980]   That modo maker might be coming along program manager modo maker
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.500]   It's in the uk
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:35.300]   Right now modo maker, which is the way to build those moderolas in the us right is only in the us
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.460]   responsible for national and international integration of
[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.140]   Modo maker point of sale and online registration
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:51.700]   So when modo came out modo x came out modo rolla said, sorry north america south america only I think we're now going to see the expansion
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.940]   And I think there you know a lot of people go ho hum
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:04.420]   But I think this is still my phone of choice. I think this is a great phone and a really good introduction to android for people coming from the iphone
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:09.140]   Side so marissa mare brought katie kurok on stage
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.020]   Why had coffee with just two nights ago? Oh
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.780]   Fancy, huh?
[00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.580]   Fancy
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.740]   John legend cast mem did you have coffee with him too?
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:24.980]   No cast members of saturday net night live tumblr ceo david carp and
[00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.740]   David pog their new tech columnist
[00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.380]   So our studded lineup. I guess we don't want to bury the leads so tell us about katie
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.740]   Oh, it was not a big deal. I I was asked what she was
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.700]   And now she was going to um yahoo
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:46.740]   I got a call from weekend edition uh npr and I you know blather about katie going yahoo the truth is or everything
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.980]   They're just saying no, but I decided to use it for my own agenda
[00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:55.140]   Which I saw I hope that katie and marissa who are really smart really good reinvent tv news because it sucks and it needs it
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.460]   Oh, yeah, and so out of nowhere. I got a tweet
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:01.220]   From katie saying what's that coffee? Wow?
[00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:04.900]   We just we just had a nice nice coffee talking about about that and she and such and forth
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.700]   Was she pitching you on what they were about to do it?
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.020]   Yahoo or was it she wanted to hear what you had to say?
[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:16.340]   I think she's she's in in listening to her mode. I think wow and uh this is the day before she went out to vegas
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.980]   but um, you know, I I've always admired her. I think she's very very smart
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:24.020]   Uh, and you know, she's gone through every network now
[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:28.500]   She's in something new and I think she might try to reinvent things in in substantial ways
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.860]   And is not going to presume to do it the way that she's done it
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.100]   She doesn't have the kind of staff that a network hat, right?
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.100]   So it was just no it was just kind of battering back and forth about what's possible
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.620]   But it was very enjoyable
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.180]   You should send her the could you tweet her the clip from the show where you guys were you all talked about this?
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:47.380]   Yeah, I don't think so
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.620]   Completely positive
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.340]   Self-loathing new media said leo report
[00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:00.500]   Yeah, yeah, I don't know if that's the headline you came back around saying how you'd like it in my arcade
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.740]   But you got to get through well, I think she's great
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:07.380]   But I don't think that that is internet native by any means
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.540]   I don't think many of the moos yahoo's made our internet native moos
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:17.140]   No, uh, but there are new uh, there are new uh, starder screen thing
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:21.540]   The my uh-hoo page. No, they they bought it
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:28.500]   Oh, they bought av8 av8. I didn't like av8 when it came out. I paid it. I said no wasn't crazy
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.020]   Yeah, I think av8 versus uh, what's the other one? Um
[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.100]   Cover
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:38.340]   I don't like either of them. I yeah, I agree. I installed them both and don't use either of them
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.980]   What do you use as a launcher, uh, genite?
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.180]   I've got the google
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.460]   Experience going on. Yeah, yeah, and I don't use a launcher
[00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.300]   I just group my I group a couple of apps in a folder on my dock
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:58.660]   My most use apps and I basically do that and I've tried a bunch of launchers and you know with different methods swipe in and
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.900]   And I just I just do I just kind of do it that way
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.740]   I don't like to keep icons on my home screen. I like to look at the picture of my daughter and that seems to work
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.740]   I keep it simple. Yeah
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.820]   um
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.820]   Avi the idea of av8
[00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:14.260]   It's it's kind of it's context
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.500]   So the idea of av8 is that it organizes your phone for you based on context
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:23.300]   So so I could tell from the play store page instantaneously that it was not for me because it says straight up
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:27.300]   Like if you like to customize your phone yourself, this is not the app for you
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:34.180]   Uh, so you install av8 it takes over your home screen from what what it does is it categorizes your apps for you in the groups
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.900]   And it brings up apps that you'll want based on where you are and what time of day it is
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.500]   So for example, you go to the gym. It'll bring up the Nike plus app
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:48.580]   Uh, if you're at a restaurant, it knows that it'll make a recommendation of what you know what you should eat based on
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.580]   I don't know four square other apps
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:55.220]   Um, if you know if it's nighttime you're going to bed or it'll bring up the alarm clock app that kind of thing
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.460]   So it sounds sort of google now
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.180]   Which except it takes over your whole home screen and makes assumptions about what you'll need and when you'll need it
[00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.700]   And I I always prefer a stick shift to automatic
[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:11.060]   Well, I like to know what I'm doing. We also don't want to uh ui that's changing all the time
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.460]   Yeah, I know I think that's a mistake
[00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.860]   I agree
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.860]   I think it's a I think it's a good idea
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:22.740]   I mean that they're marking as somebody who you know someone who just wants to make their phone easy to use and forget it
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:28.500]   Not not customize it themselves. I don't know but I but I understand what you're saying if my phone home screen changes
[00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.460]   You know, it's confusing. I don't yeah
[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.900]   Potentially be confusing. Yeah, I it's not the first time
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:41.700]   This is a very common area people say oh no you you want it to customize yourself, but hi, right?
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:48.340]   I don't know. I tried it. It was in beta. It's still in beta. I guess is yahoo gonna make it um public soon
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.500]   Well, they
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.460]   I was 25 000 beta invites that they're giving out
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.540]   I bet if i bet if you go for it right now, you can get on the beta invites still a real quick
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:04.100]   You just you just use yahoo all caps as the uh code. Okay. There you go. Um
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.980]   Yeah, I just hmm
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:12.340]   It's well what and to it is kind of answers. I think a little bit the question that everybody's had about
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:18.820]   Uh, mire and what she's gonna do with yahoo whether she's gonna go in the content direction or the services direction
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:25.540]   Like and she's going in both. It's very clear. Yeah, uh big focus on content mainstream content though
[00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:30.500]   So I think she's also looking at what happened at youtube. It's pretty clear at this point
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:34.500]   That youtube is a little bit of a failed experiment
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:36.500]   Um
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.260]   Really? Yeah, how so well here's my thinking you tell me if i'm wrong
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.820]   um
[00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.220]   It it came to the forefront
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.260]   Uh doing a few things one sharing
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:53.620]   copyrighted content like you know nbc saturday live clips which nbc ate it
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.900]   And crotch shot in you know humorous stuff
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:01.380]   It's been a great place for viral videos a real problem with viral videos is
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.980]   Uh, it's they're pretty much all one shot
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.620]   One hit wonders
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:14.980]   Now on you then then for a while, uh youtube recognizing this sees a terrible platform for advertisers because advertisers don't know what they're going to get basically
[00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.860]   Am I gonna get a crotch shot? Am I gonna get a pirate
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:25.220]   Content what am i gonna be except they've they've well they responded that they responded that by investing 150 million dollars
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.940]   In channels from people like chakele o'neil
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:30.340]   all of which
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.460]   Failed
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.460]   So they've retrenched on that right
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:39.540]   Um, they're reaching out to you know who's successful on youtube is in mainstream is allen
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:44.020]   Because allen degenerus puts clips from a tv show on youtube and people watch it and they monetize it
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:50.900]   But i don't think that that from the point of view of google. This is a brand message that is is great for them
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:57.220]   Um, so i i think that the pro you know when i say failed hey hundreds of millions of people watch
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:02.100]   Videos all the time i mean everybody my son's age watches videos all the time
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:05.060]   But the problem for google is how do you monetize that?
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:10.180]   Yeah, i guess that was what i was i was wondering how you do it's not a failure in the sense that people use it
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:15.140]   Cultural force a huge cultural force. Yeah, and in that way it's absolutely been successful
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.980]   And and there are people you know the jenna marbles of the world who have
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:24.820]   J you know pd pie giant fallings but pd pie's a good example is he killed still the number one most followed
[00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:31.220]   Most subscribed to channel on youtube chat. I think he is. Yeah, I think he is. I mean he's uh what swedish guy
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:36.980]   Who uh watches who plays video games and swears a lot while he's doing it and there's a little picture of him doing it
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:44.340]   And uh, uh, you know lisa's son michaels 11 lives on pd pie videos watches him over and over and over again
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.940]   How does this help google in any way?
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:51.220]   It helps pd pie well
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:56.180]   I mean, I think I think people make fun of pd pie because he's so make fun of bole
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.620]   But no, but no, no, no. I didn't pick him because he's make fun of bole
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:05.060]   I pick him because he's the most followed person on on youtube right by a long shot. He has
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.260]   three million three billion video views
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.140]   19 million subscribers
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:18.020]   This is just a dude, huh? That's great. Well good for him and it's good for him in the sense that
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.100]   He's gonna people watching him play video games. I guess he's making money
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:29.220]   He's gotta be he's definitely a partner, right? I mean not making as much money as he'd like to be
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:33.540]   I mean, he's not a real. I mean maybe he's making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:37.940]   It's very possible. He's probably making here that social blade the network that I I have
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.300]   Uh, what do they say they'll estimate it and I bet he's making a million
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.620]   Yeah, he's making it at least
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:48.180]   115,000 at most 1.1 million
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:52.740]   Uh, that's a monthly earning. Sorry. Well, you're really earning is one point
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.620]   Uh, and this is based off of the lowest cpm
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:00.900]   Uh, google and youtube offers versus the highest cpm they offer
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:06.500]   So if he's making 16 million dollars a year more power to him, what does google get out of this?
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.700]   They get 45 percent right and so they they would get a little bit less than that
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:16.340]   Just on one user. So I just think this is a short term win
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:22.980]   But in the long run those are those advertisers getting anything because michael watches pewdiepie over and over and over again
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.340]   Absolutely. They're getting the eyeballs they want and and pewdiepie
[00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.780]   eyeballs
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:31.460]   But but pewdiepie is a bad example because there's there's many
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:38.740]   Well, let's say lamar wilson. He's created an audience that comes to him every day. Is he making a lot of money?
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.860]   I mean, he's making enough by living but there's also
[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:46.660]   3,000 people that are like right him and
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:54.420]   Google in youtube is making 45 percent of whatever they do. I mean you can do things like the fine brothers who make
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:27:01.700]   kids react videos and that's a that's a television basically a television show that people are subscribing to
[00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:08.180]   And that's where I see the future of that type of entertainment is that I there is meat there
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:14.420]   And chat it's about who was always about scale the weird thing about google to me is if they would reduce that percentage down to
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.340]   25 percent
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.340]   They would multiply the size of
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:24.020]   The talent pool and what goes on there and they would end up netting more and yet there be little greedy
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:28.660]   You know the network economics are take out as little as you can to make it grow as big as possible
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.900]   Well, we have somebody in the chat from sam harrisons as he runs an ad agency
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:39.060]   He says I assure you advertisers are getting lots from youtube if you do a tad bit of work to keep things relevant
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.380]   So it's a key point they often don't but I think
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.900]   I gotta tell you advertisers don't make don't get a lot from
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:51.220]   NFL football either. I mean it's very easy to buy an ad to spend millions on an ad that doesn't change anything
[00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:53.460]   uh
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.940]   Around you. I just it feels like okay. It could be that really I come from and
[00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:06.020]   out of uh touch uh era in terms of content. I would say this is as digital native as you can get I agree
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:10.260]   Like that's for sure like here's someone you've never heard of his name is aunt venom
[00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:14.660]   He makes minecraft videos. Yeah, two million people
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.740]   Subscribed to him and most of his videos have over
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.540]   You know youtube's numbers to me
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:27.940]   Still I don't think they may be a little bit squishy the numbers and in that
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:31.300]   If you click on it and then leave within you know five minutes
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:37.380]   I think you two's numbers are way over and they may be over and I think youtube's benefit to an advertiser is
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.220]   Questionable. I just wonder if it's a if it's a long term
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.020]   If it really could survive long term
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.020]   You built a business on
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.060]   We do something really different. No, no, no. I'm not saying web videos bad
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:56.420]   I'm not saying that you're saying the content on youtube is but like content the youtube model is
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:01.140]   Is not a good is a failed model, but I but obviously the evidence is against that so
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:09.060]   So it's like medium versus blogger that kind of thing. Yeah, it's very much like that. Yeah, okay. Okay, so it's what who's the winner or there?
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.860]   Who's the winner in that comparison?
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:16.900]   Oh, well the idea that medium has high quality content that it looks beautiful and attracts a
[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:24.580]   High quality audience. However, you wanted to find that and blogger is just like a bunch of junk that people started fd paying up to the web
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:31.220]   You know 1990 zero cost to google at huge volume and in pockets high
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.860]   Is google happy with youtube
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:39.860]   They say they arbor world is gonna say right, but I mean I wonder do you think they are?
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:43.060]   I think they're trying to still figure it out. I think that
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:50.100]   Looking at what they've spent money on and what they're focusing on they're definitely they definitely feel like they're not there yet
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:52.820]   And that they do need to shift
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:30:01.540]   Things going forward, but I don't I think that's that may be easier than all of us expect because the gaming community on youtube
[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.820]   Exploded out of nowhere because of a few
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:09.460]   Changes that they did to the algorithm. I would guess that that's really for youtube
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.420]   for google a lot of what youtube represents is more
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.580]   um
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.580]   more more a
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.220]   Way to see how stuff works
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:25.940]   Then it is something now. I mean, I guess they make money on it, right? So who might I remember a couple years ago
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.700]   uh being at pardon me for this davos with
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:35.780]   Chad then herli and marissa and eric and eric saying, you know, we're pleased with
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:42.580]   The direction and it had just started making money. Right. Don't forget it was it was in great measure of defensive move to buy yahoo
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:47.860]   So the way else got it. They became kings of video in that sense. No, are they kings like hulu?
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.940]   No, but who lose you know, I would argue that hulu is
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:54.660]   More more of a failure than oh there. I think they're struggling a lot more. It's uh, it's apparent
[00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.260]   They are their parent company keeps trying to sell it or figure out what to do with it
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:05.540]   um ironically you hulu looks a lot more like traditional media youtube to a traditional media like guy like me
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:07.300]   looks like
[00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.340]   chaos
[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.340]   But that's so is the web
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.740]   Right. So is the web if you're not looking for a new model you have to look at netflix
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:19.060]   I think the beginnings of it at netflix tim wu had an amazing story in the new republic
[00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.620]   uh about about
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:25.060]   How netflix is reinventing the world as we know it and it's something i'm
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:33.140]   dear to my heart talking about is the notion of the value of signals right and and that's what netflix is beginning to do and that's what you
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:37.460]   That's what google understands better than well youtube is all about signals for sure
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:41.460]   Exactly. So I think if we see google as a signal monopoly
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.140]   Yeah, uh, and i'm involved in a company. Yeah, that's a good point
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:47.780]   I mean in the same way twig twitter is
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:54.340]   Yes, yes each of their own way and so so i'm a full disclosure here is i'm about to start
[00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:59.620]   I think advising and maybe even investing in a company called infinite analytics that came my way from sir tim burners lee
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:06.500]   That uh potentially can break the signal monopoly by those of us who don't have it or in it media companies
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:14.820]   Commerce companies and so on and and if you can start to understand people's signals so you can give them better relevance get better engagement get higher value
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:20.180]   Uh, that's that's where media to my mind goes. It's not about content
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:23.300]   It's about signals and relationships with people and the value can return
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.860]   except for six the person who
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:29.700]   Consumes to me it doesn't think it's about signals inside that content for
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:31.460]   Viewers
[00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:37.220]   They do it. It's about relevance when I go ask google for pizza if you know if if the old days of yahoo
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.940]   You ask about pizza you're gonna get a treat us on pizza
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:43.540]   Pizza here's where you can get some
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.180]   And what you're gonna get with jelly. I don't know yet
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.460]   All right, i'm wrong. I stand corrected
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.900]   You know
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:59.540]   But I think so the reason this came up is because it struck me that what marissa mire was trying to do at yahoo was the anti-youtube
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.020]   Which was a highly curated
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:10.100]   Uh safer place for advertisers to spend their money that has always been yahoo was known brands and known content
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:14.660]   Yeah, volume and and known names and not at all
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.860]   Digital native
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:22.340]   No, except the tumblr acquisition tumblr is yeah. Yeah, tumblr is
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.340]   even tumblr doesn't tumblr to some extent jina match your
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:29.700]   matter versus
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:34.740]   Blogger comparison the tumblr is more about trying to curate quality or is that ridiculous as I don't use it much
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.060]   Uh
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:39.060]   Yeah, I mean
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.660]   I don't know where tumblr lands on the quality spectrum probably
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:48.180]   Somewhere in the middle, but yeah tumblr does seem to be more about curating and reblogging
[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:53.380]   Right then uh than anything else, but tumblr has a has a has a nice aesthetic
[00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.380]   It has a very creative community and i'm making broad generalizations here
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:02.180]   There are lots of different kinds of tumblers. Do you think yahoo sees tumblr as just an ad platform?
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.660]   With a lot of with millions of eyeballs they can play ads to or something larger
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:11.540]   I don't know. I mean, I I like to think that tumblr is somewhere in the flicker bucket
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:16.020]   Um of like, you know, it could be a bad place to be in the flicker bucket
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.900]   It's not been a good bucket to be in for a while
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.460]   Look, I look at flicker just a flicker
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:25.860]   Is getting incrementally a little better. It has had some changes
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:30.260]   Uh since mire took the helm that the the mobile apps got a refresh. They're the lay it layouts
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.660]   The photo layouts are getting better. Look, it's not
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:36.740]   Google plus does a lot better work with photos at this point. I look
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:40.820]   Videos a lot more than flicker notifications and I use both
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:43.140]   Extensively
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.100]   But you know flicker hasn't gone away. I still have a real soft spot for flicker
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.180]   I use it for my my kids photos
[00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.780]   And um, so I don't know
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.620]   I like to think that tumblers in the flicker bucket
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:59.060]   And I also like to think that mire is going to continue to refine those tools and focus on them and make them kind of capture that audience of
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.740]   Those are kind of creative digital natives with a certain kind of aesthetic
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.260]   um
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:09.220]   And I think that those are those are good monetizable. That's a good monetizable audience as well
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.180]   But then there's also the weather app and the news, you know
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:16.500]   The news app that they're launching so and you know things like aviate
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.140]   So it's interesting to see what they're doing there. I mean
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:27.780]   She's obviously trying to get tools out there that have yeah the yahoo name kind of relevant again on her devices on our home screens
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:29.220]   um
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.940]   And uh, you know, I don't know maybe she is taking a cue
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:36.740]   They are taking cue from something like youtube where they're going more curated and more high quality
[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:41.460]   Understand that I wear two different hats and and all of this which one is
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:46.820]   uh, the you know as a as a pundit i'm supposed to have an opinion on everything
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.460]   And so you know that's an opinion
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:54.500]   But then as a reporter reporter and a journalist there is this is fascinating
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:59.940]   Thing that I think should continue which is that people are trying all sorts of stuff. There's more experimentation
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:07.780]   There is more creative is being skeptical, which is right. You should be you're skeptical of everything. Yes, right. Yes
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.620]   Um, and I yeah anyway, I'm you know, of course
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:17.140]   One of the things I fear as a business owner is yahoo tech because that's
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.060]   The closest thing to what we do here at twit. Although not that close
[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:25.140]   Really, I'd be more afraid if I were buzzfeed than I find than anything else
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:30.340]   This is the front page of the new yahoo tech launched very in a timely fashion during ces
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:35.780]   That's the best time if you're going to get people get them now. There's an overwhelming amount of news very uh,
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.780]   Uptworthy in some of its headlines
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:43.940]   um a lot of this gadget can control your iphone without even touching it and
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:49.780]   Uh, you know this enormous phone battery lasts allegedly lasts more than two days
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:52.180]   Um
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:56.180]   Is this razor the last one you'll ever buy very up worthy in its feeling
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:00.660]   Very, um, and its design, you know, I mean look at that front page with the owl going
[00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:05.300]   The sassiest birds on the internet
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:12.740]   So are we have we officially coined the term upwardly describe these times like it's is not worthy
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:15.060]   Stipe or it's not buzzfeed
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.060]   Well, you know, same thing
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.300]   At least with upwardly its positive content
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.940]   Okay, so listen
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:28.820]   This is a typical every parents three biggest facebook fears and what to do about them
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:35.540]   That's upward that you're reading from that's oh, that's yahoo. Oh, that's yahoo
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.420]   Okay
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:46.260]   Yeah, it's an upwardly story generator. Yeah, we used while you were gone and and I think I think buzzfeed my my one new year's
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.500]   Resolution is not to click on the on the list again
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:52.420]   listicles. Yeah, no list and um
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:57.460]   But upwardly or stories that things that tell you how you're going to feel after you click
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.500]   That's important. You won't believe
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.940]   Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, here's your morning cry. Yeah
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:06.980]   This isn't quite that bad
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:09.700]   but it's clear that their headline writer is
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.660]   There's something going on with this well this
[00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.820]   Stay on this for a second
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.300]   That is i've been wanting to play with this i've written a post about this yet
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:22.740]   But there's this notion of manipulation that we go from search engine optimization to human brain optimization
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:26.900]   And and we look at the catalogs of ways that we're trying to be manipulated
[00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.260]   And so so upwardly is one this is how you'll feel
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.500]   Um
[00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:36.500]   Buzzfeed is one. Oh, there's what a cute list you can't avoid clicking on this and you're going to pass it around
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.740]   A native advertising is one. We're going to fool you and make you into thicknesses content
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:44.900]   It's all a form manipulation. If you go back to what I said earlier about signals
[00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:50.980]   There there's a there's a small bridge between cynicism and reality there where
[00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:56.980]   Um, giving me something that's targeted to me so that I will engage with it more because I value it more
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.900]   I say that's good
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:03.860]   Giving me something that cynically says they're going to manipulate me into clicking on something that i'm going to be disappointed in
[00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.580]   But they got something out of it. That's bad
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:12.740]   Um, the latter is an as a mass media model the more we can fool people to click
[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:15.540]   The better we are slide shows right?
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:20.420]   Raj all that stuff right the former I would argue is a google model where in the long run
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:24.980]   They know that if they're evil and misuse this power they have they'll lose us
[00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:30.980]   Yeah, it's it's a tough it's a very thin line. I mean
[00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:38.100]   Every product I mean editorial is this hyper product right so every every product you design it with the idea of like how
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.380]   Are your customers or your users gonna feel we're going through this with think up right now
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.740]   I mean we're agonizing over every word because you want to be evocative
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:48.580]   Right you want to create some sort of feeling mostly you want to create delight
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.020]   I mean jobs talked about this all the time with with the iPod and that kind of thing
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:55.300]   But you don't want to be manipulative you want to be evocative with a purpose right
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.860]   uh, so it's like
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:01.620]   Cotton candy versus broccoli, you know, maybe broccoli with a little butter
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:05.220]   You know, it's like what do you what are you actually giving your consumers?
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:07.060]   So the metrics the metrics are everything
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:12.660]   Because if you measure yourself by gross tonnage then you're gonna do what buzzfeed does and you can get a lot of tonnage that way
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:18.740]   If you measure yourself by the outcomes in your user's life, did they accomplish what they want to accomplish and they better off for it
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.180]   Then you have a valuable product
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.820]   You may not have the right way to monetize that yes or no
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:30.740]   But you'll have something that somebody values from you and there's a big difference there and then it's the mass media way of tonnage
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:35.140]   I think i think is still corrupting the net
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:42.500]   Yeah leave it to me to say something to lead to silence. I specialize in that
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:47.220]   I'm translating it into german in my mind
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:53.540]   That's profound, but you know, no, it's true. Um, and it kind of segues a little bit into the the rap genius
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:41:00.180]   Um, yeah story a little bit. I guess get to that. Yeah, tech has just had life was about growth hacking gone bad
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.260]   Yeah, let's take a break and do that and I wait
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:08.020]   I do want to get matt cuts on to talk about rap genius at some point soon because uh, that was his ban
[00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:13.380]   So, uh, he was a little booked today. Yeah, he was almost done. It was busy busy busy. We'll get him next week. Maybe
[00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:17.700]   I listened to all the shows by the way. I really uh while I was gone. It was very
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:21.620]   It was um both luxurious and frustrating to be a listener
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:24.740]   Yeah, you want to get on there and say something
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:29.940]   But I was all in the subway listening to and I really love the episode that matt was on. I'd love to have it back on but uh
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:34.740]   Yeah, it was was fun. Well, and I could just say in the other side we really missed your input
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:38.980]   So we did really truly it's not the same with that. I was not you guys are too nice
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.820]   Our show today brought you by the folks at at lascian
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.860]   They make a product called jira
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:50.260]   And uh, I think that that name comes from the uh japanese name for godzilla gojira
[00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:54.500]   Uh, what is jira? It's the project management solution
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:42:00.660]   One of the world's most powerful and customizable issue and project management systems out there

[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.500]   runs a team
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.740]   knows that the biggest challenge in all of this
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:23.780]   Uh is is is getting all these disparate pieces of information into a single place so that you could plan
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.420]   so that you can communicate
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:31.460]   Jira gives your team a simple intuitive interface for collaborating with each other in real time

[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:17.540]   I don't do a I don't I'm not an enterprise guy. I have to get to
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:20.820]   Father robert to explain all this to me sometime
[00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:27.060]   Although as we run our business I start to understand what complexity means holy cow
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.460]   Holy cow
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.420]   Rap genius what is rap genius was started by some Yale guys
[00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:37.940]   And it was I think kind of a I don't know have you ever used it jina? It was kind of a comedy site to begin with
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.700]   I haven't I guess I'm not not hip enough. But Jake
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.940]   Sun Jake said to me before all this broke like a couple days before he said, you know
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:51.220]   Pa you really need to look at he didn't call me pa. Hey pa. That's what I call my father
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:56.900]   uh, you really need to look at this thing because uh, uh, it's a really interesting form and and it was a leery
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:02.340]   It's kind of a wiki PDF for hip annotation. Yeah, but then it takes anything else you can annotate anything else
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.580]   So some authors are putting up chapters of their books and annotating them not as footnotes
[00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:12.500]   Put his background material and explanation. You could put up a government statement and annotate it. It becomes a very interesting
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:17.460]   Let me look at this so for journalism go go go go go go
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.260]   Go shorty. It's your birthday
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:23.620]   We gonna party like it's your birthday

[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:35.460]   You can find me in the club
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.500]   bottle full of bub
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:43.300]   Look mammy. I got the x if you into taking drugs
[00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:46.580]   I'm into having sex
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:49.700]   I ain't into making love
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.900]   So
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:52.820]   Come give me a hug
[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:56.740]   If you're into getting rubbed this guy sounds like a creep
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.540]   whitest people are
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:05.620]   So I don't see no annotations. Let's see. Yeah, this is good. This is good
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:10.740]   So I would go here if I if I'm listening to a song and I'm trying to understand
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.340]   right
[00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.340]   You know
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.820]   What this means
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:20.420]   It's a lyric site. Yeah, but it in it takes it
[00:46:20.420 --> 00:46:22.020]   So
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.420]   Anything else it's a platform. Well, as you annotate anything
[00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:29.540]   She got a thing for that gucci that fendi that prada that bcbg
[00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:31.940]   Burberry Dolce and Gabada
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:35.300]   And then okay the other foolish man
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:39.620]   Explain the I was hoping that but it doesn't the phrases
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:46.820]   Built into well here. So here's here's one. I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:52.260]   Get that rack catch a date and come pay the kid
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:58.260]   So apparently in this annotation evidently 50 cent does not care about customer satisfaction
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:04.180]   So do you remember when uh group on ceo and remason did his farewell letter?
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:08.660]   Yeah, some people back to something in our context some people annotated this so
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:11.540]   So he has each it so you know, I'm posting it publicly
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:16.820]   So because it's gonna week leak anyway and you click it it says this is a wink to among the others the pre ipo
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:22.420]   Uh, you know, uh, you know thing and then you know after three and a half four intense years
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:30.260]   And then it provides a whole bunch of stuff about like well, they were valued at 16.7 billion when google tried to buy them for
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:33.540]   Succession, but now they're useful forget the rap lyrics
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:38.900]   Absolutely, and then it says, you know, he's he's decided to take off time to spend more time with his family and it links to
[00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:44.900]   Wikipedia articles about the first time that i'm going to go spend time with my family was ever used in a
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:48.660]   Uh in a letter, you know to say that he's stepping down as a company
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:54.740]   Um and each any of these yellow things are written by users, right and any of the green things are
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:48:00.100]   Links back to other articles or other other things like that if you go to i chat chat
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.460]   I just put one up lyric one up on the the rundown in the chat
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:09.220]   Uh, if you go to the weekend jake is a huge fan of the weekend the weekend that's a band or that's a song
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:12.900]   It's a song singer singer the weekend. Yes, so adaptation lyrics
[00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:15.860]   So if you go down it says i lay my head on a thousand beds
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.860]   You click on that it's just has a picture of him and talking about the tour of life
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:28.100]   Right, so it's you get a sense of the inside of the of the lyrics. So there you go. That's rap genius ladies and gentlemen couple of yale boys
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:35.220]   Enables enabled so then they and so it was a wonderful thing. That's really pretty cool. Yeah, and it was growing like crazy
[00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.780]   But then yeah
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:41.380]   Are you gonna pick up the story now? Well, they decided they wanted to grow faster
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:48.740]   So they did something called seo except that there's seo and there's seo and there's there's black hat seo and they did things like
[00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.300]   uh giving people
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.060]   uh
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:49:00.180]   Mensions for blogging about them things like that and they got came to the attention of the world famous matt cuts
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:03.860]   Who delisted them? You don't want to do that?
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:09.140]   Yeah, so they would go to bloggers and say if you link to our site from your site
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:13.060]   Then I think we'll tweet about you. It was link trading. Yeah, he
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:19.780]   It was a growth hack. That's what they call a growth hack
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:30.500]   So, um matt did delistem and huge drop in um
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:36.740]   By the way rap genius responded but a huge drop immediately it went from 700,000
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.380]   Of views to 100,000 views in a minute. You know, whatever it was
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:43.860]   Um, they wrote an open letter
[00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:47.780]   to google about rap genius seo by the founders
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.580]   And the tldr we effed up
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:55.780]   Other lyric sites are almost definitely doing worse stuff and we'll stop
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:57.780]   We'd love
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:04.020]   We'd love they really needed to re or arrange the order of that sentence. Yeah, okay. I I can't stand
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:11.060]   Apologies that are not contriting off either apologize if you can try or don't but you know what they're saying is this is a very
[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:13.060]   This is a very competitive
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:20.500]   Environment this lyric site thing and they're all they're all cheating. So we felt we had to cheat
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.700]   it's um
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.700]   The lance armstrong defense
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.620]   Um
[00:50:27.620 --> 00:50:33.540]   We'd love for google to take a closer look at the whole lyrics search landscape and see whether it can make changes that would improve
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.100]   lyric search results
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:44.100]   So they explained what they did and actually google responded by unblocking them. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have made a difference
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:50.020]   Uh at least um according to an article here on search engine watch
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.740]   By jennifer slag
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:56.340]   The lyric site fails to recover traffic after the google penalty
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:00.420]   um
[00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:04.500]   Once uh, goot here's the graph by the way so you can see the uniques
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:10.420]   Uh once google allowed rap genius back in the index after they cleaned up the bad backlink profile
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:14.500]   Which largely involved them nuking their poor quality backlinks
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.820]   Um
[00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:21.860]   They went from 700 000 uniques a day to 100 000 according to quant castes in the delisting
[00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.500]   But now they're only 400 000
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:27.860]   So they still lost 50 of their
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:32.740]   Total and they haven't recovered from it at least of so far
[00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:38.820]   In the engine rights rap genius only lost their google rankings for slightly over a week
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:43.380]   Something that's definitely on the extremely short size of side of penalty links
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:47.780]   So it would appear they were getting special help from google to resolve the issues
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:50.020]   That's why I want to get matt on to talk about it
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:54.260]   Uh perhaps because they're funded by andresin horowitz
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:59.300]   Uh, they're gonna end up better off as a business because they're gonna end up gonna end up not with cheap
[00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:02.580]   Mac go back what we said before mass horrible traffic
[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:07.540]   Synically raised versus honest to god relationships of value
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:12.260]   In the long run, I believe the latter is gonna be you know, we see the same thing in podcasting
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:19.300]   Yeah, um, and I uh, what are the tricks? What are the tricks in podcast? Yeah, what's what do you mean leo? What do you mean?
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:22.340]   That sounds like a good story
[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:28.740]   So I was at new media expo on monday and I uh, keynoteed a panel which I didn't realize but we actually broadcast
[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:32.980]   So it was kind of an industry insider panel, but one of the people on the panel was norm patis
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:38.500]   Who was the founder of westwood one the big radio syndicator? He's a radio legend. He's in the hall of fame and everything
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:41.860]   And he started a company called podcast one
[00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:44.580]   And we were talking backstage
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:49.540]   And we were talking about metrics because of course any uh media ad supported media like this
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.500]   Uh, we sell ads the way we bill our advertisers as we say you had a certain number of impressions
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.860]   They call it in radios cost per thousand or cpm
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:03.460]   Uh, and we charge we charge $70 or $80 per thousand
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.140]   uh
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:06.740]   listens
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.620]   And uh, which is very high radio charges about $10
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:14.340]   Um, but we think we're worth it and apparently what do you charge 80?
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:17.220]   Wow, really high
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.460]   That's good. That's about premium man. That's oh, yeah
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:23.780]   Well, we feel like we're a premium product and advertisers seem to agree in my positions always been look
[00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:28.740]   Uh, you tie that by that's tied to the numbers. We have to give you download numbers and we say well, uh, you know
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:30.740]   And this show gives this show
[00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:33.460]   70,000 people downloaded it so it's 70,000 times
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:37.220]   70 actually 70 times 80 is the cost for an ad
[00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:39.700]   um
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:45.620]   But norm went oh, yeah because we use uh pod track is the number a generator. He said, oh, yeah, we do we don't like them
[00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:47.860]   Someone so they count uniques
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:52.820]   I said, oh, well, yeah, they count unique individual downloads. What do you count?
[00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:58.260]   So it turns out and this is true a lot of people they count every time that file gets hit
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:04.100]   And page use versus visits. Yes in web parlance. Yeah, your hits you know how you sometimes say uh, uh,
[00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:06.740]   Yeah, that site had a million hits
[00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:11.220]   Well, yeah, because each person who loads that site gives you 30 hits because they're hitting over
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:14.740]   Same thing. It's almost identical in podcasting various podcast
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:18.740]   Downloaders and so forth will hit the file many times instead of once
[00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:24.260]   So what we do is we count each unique ip address now we that gives you an undercount in some cases
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:27.940]   Microsoft for instance everybody listens at microsoft comes in under the same ip address
[00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:31.300]   We count on once so it could be 10,000 people listening at microsoft. We don't know
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:34.900]   But we've decided that we want to use the lower conservative
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:36.980]   provable number
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:41.540]   Uh, and then that's one of the reasons our cpms are high and then bill accordingly good for you
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:47.300]   He charges $10 cpm's but uses this magic number that is very high
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:52.980]   And uh, we could use that number. It's usually, you know five times higher or 10 times higher
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:57.620]   Um, and but that's how podcasts, you know a lot of podcasts when you hear this, you know
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:02.500]   We have a million users or million listeners. That's what the number they're quoting. So that's not at all unusual
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:08.980]   There's also the issue of like you you have clients like podcatchers that will automatically download a new episode
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:11.940]   But it's not necessarily a listen right like there's no way to tell
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:14.740]   So don't even mention that
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:18.340]   Might be sort of wash there might be a wash, you know, right?
[00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:22.580]   Um, ultimately the only thing that matters is the advertiser paid x amount of dollars
[00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:27.540]   And he got this much value out of it and if there's you know if we're if we're overcharging they won't come back
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:32.100]   And if we're undercharging then we don't get what we think we deserve so it's a it's a very
[00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:37.380]   It's a you know, you work hard to do this right and my position's always been
[00:55:37.940 --> 00:55:40.420]   Uh, we want a win-win
[00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:46.420]   Basically, we're we're no good if we don't win for our advertiser and and vice versa and the advertiser has to be win for our
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:50.660]   So it's our audience. So it's a win-win-win everybody has to it has to be good for everybody
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:53.620]   Uh, how did I get into this but the point being that?
[00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:59.940]   Every industry has cheating as it's correct. What happens with cheating is
[00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:02.740]   It makes it much harder
[00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:09.460]   For those who don't cheat and intense pressure and I guess the analog is sports is lance Armstrong is uh,
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:14.980]   the performance enhancing drug era of baseball is if everybody's using peds
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:20.340]   There's intense pressure on you to do so as well because you can't compete
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:23.700]   Right
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:25.380]   Yeah
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:29.380]   So I can understand rap genius saying hey everybody cheats we got a cheat too
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:35.140]   And sometimes you know being the honest guy is not the way to succeed because they could just disappear
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:45.380]   Anyway, yeah, it's true long boring explanation. I'm sorry. I brought it up. No, no, I I was like I was I wanted to hear the podcasting dirt
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:50.580]   Um, but in that case, you know, look, this is why you sit in the big chair, right?
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:54.660]   I mean, I mean, I mean the case of being able to charge a higher price for fewer numbers
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:58.100]   That's the that's a quality product. You know, that's
[00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:00.820]   Proof that your audience is more valuable versus
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:06.260]   Yeah, we're sold out many of our shows are already sold out for the first quarter right lisa
[00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:10.100]   She's not paying attention. She's doing wrong some twig
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:14.500]   Are hey lisa how's twigs sales for q1
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:18.820]   Looking really good transparency and action
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:22.260]   I'm actually gonna do an insight twiddle later on. We'll we'll fill you
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:27.460]   But no, I think I will leave it until I see that sponsored burrito dammit many of our shows are sold out
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:34.420]   But sold out another thing that we do that others don't do that's three ads for you limit. Yeah limit. So um
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:38.340]   Yeah, yeah, don't say that
[00:57:38.340 --> 00:57:41.620]   She says it's really six ads
[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.260]   And the reason it's six ads is because the billboards count as an ad
[00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.820]   Yeah, we even have that
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:50.420]   So the at the beginning of every show as you know, we say, you know brought to you by blah blah
[00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:56.020]   And you get a little you have three interruptions per show. That's what they're gonna. That's what they view work. That's what real people gear up, right?
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:58.020]   Yeah, yeah
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.500]   And and I remember
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:03.460]   What's his name my good friend from rev three?
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:07.780]   president of earth three jim ladder back. Thank Jim
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:10.900]   back in the days of
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:14.020]   Ignatian
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:16.340]   He bragged about and kind of sure you have the same
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:22.340]   They're incredibly high on a did recall of sponsors of who sponsors to show and what their messages
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:26.420]   Yeah, well, we have the relationship of you reading the spot and talking about it
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:29.940]   And and not really interrupting the show, but it's true native advertising
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:33.380]   Yes, but it's well labeled known you say it's time to go to a sponsor and this what we have
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:41.140]   But that has a higher impact than just slapping 87. Yeah, uh, veils at you. Yeah, which is another way to game the system. Yeah
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:44.740]   And uh by the way
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:47.140]   I just want you to know arse or even higher
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:50.100]   Up that they are
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:54.900]   Jim says theirs were 105 percent. I don't know how you're perfect plus
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:58.580]   Google buys timely my favorite alarm clock app
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:05.300]   Um your favorite alarm clock app is probably not gonna get a lot of development done on it for a while unfortunately
[00:59:05.300 --> 00:59:08.020]   Was it an act
[00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:10.020]   Higher
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:16.180]   Damn nation. You know, I like timely besides his beautiful blah blah blah is that it's synced with all my other devices
[00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:19.380]   So this is really this is a huge value
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:22.500]   Maybe not maybe maybe people don't have multiple android devices
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:26.980]   But I did and so when my alarm goes off of my betterment goes off all over the house
[00:59:26.980 --> 00:59:31.060]   The tablets go off the other phones go out because they're all
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:38.020]   The dogs everything goes off. I will no I cannot over sleep anymore. That's a good thing for an alarm clock
[00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:41.700]   So i'm yeah, I mean it works
[00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:46.660]   Any app that properly implements cross device syncing real time is so cool
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:50.820]   Is a good app in my book so cool. That's a relatively new api is it
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:57.300]   Relatively like it uses google it uses your google account as the yeah, it's a store data
[00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:01.540]   Yeah, that's relatively the last couple years does it store it like kind of in your google drive?
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.620]   Where does it store that data?
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:09.540]   Um, I do think that it's your I do think it's drive. I think it's like a hidden secret kind of drive
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:12.660]   But yes, what a clever way to do that
[01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:17.860]   Yeah, like the game. I really like clash of clans the same thing as soon as you log into your google id
[01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:22.180]   Uh, it says oh, yeah, okay, and that and not it's not it's kind of like the game
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:25.460]   Play games or whatever the center game thing is but
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:30.420]   I think it's all it's all underneath that right. It's all same api
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:34.900]   By the way, you will be seeing android in your cars soon
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:39.300]   GM Honda and Audi are all going to do android instead of
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:45.060]   Microsoft car or qnx as their telematics system big win for google
[01:00:45.060 --> 01:00:51.940]   Kind of a response to the apple partnerships, right?
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:56.260]   Yeah, except I don't think I think it's different because the apple as far as I know
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.660]   When your car is apple-fied it doesn't mean your car has been running ios all along
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:04.420]   It means there's an interface to the data from ios
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:11.620]   And the screen completely put up on the screen this if i'm not mistaken means that android is the underlying operating system of the car
[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.300]   Now, maybe i'm wrong
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:17.860]   But I think that's the deal it was microsoft car that's looking very dated. That's what ford uses
[01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:24.740]   And it was starting to get dated google created the open automotive alliance kind of an analog to their open handset alliance
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:27.060]   Which is what android is on phones?
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:31.380]   Um, and I believe the plan is to have android run
[01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:37.380]   The infotainment system or the telematics systems in these cars that makes sense. It's a free operating system
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:39.380]   They've been been open really
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:42.020]   Yeah, the same way open hands that alliance is open
[01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:45.460]   No, it's not open. What what?
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:49.700]   Silly, it's it's a marketing term open marketing
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.380]   Open not in not like it as in a door is open
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.020]   Come on in
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:58.340]   And I make you some tea
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:02.580]   Blackberry owns the other biggie, which is qnx oddly enough
[01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:08.500]   Maybe some of this flight to android is fear that what will happen if with a with blackberry and qnx
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.940]   Um
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:13.940]   I don't I mean
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:14.660]   in
[01:02:14.660 --> 01:02:16.660]   2009 bmw gm
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:20.820]   Announced and I and intel announced the janee v allowance
[01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:23.700]   I'm sorry alliance
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:27.940]   Based on linux see android is linux. I think this makes perfect sense
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:35.540]   Um in your already you're already involved in that and so forth. I I cannot wait for the chrome car
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:40.100]   I will I hope it works better than your chrome book is
[01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:46.020]   How many how many is it now
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.820]   On number three. What's wrong mine's fine
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.900]   Uh
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.660]   Well, I use mine maybe too much. Oh, yeah
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:59.220]   I had a weird sound thing where we'll get out of phase and I talked to the product manager for for pixels today
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:03.060]   It was very nicely called introduced by somebody. It wasn't I asked for no special treatment
[01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:06.580]   I got no special treatment. Well, I did say I was gonna when I when I was having problems
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:10.580]   I said I'm gonna talk about this stuff on twig that was see a warrant. Oh
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:13.620]   So
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:15.300]   Uh that one they were placed immediately
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:19.060]   That's good and then the the screen on the next one went completely black when I opened it
[01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:24.100]   And the problem was it happened two days before new years, which supposedly the order went into me
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:28.500]   They supposedly was shipped to me but it wasn't so I was a week without a machine. I was using
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.140]   uh my old poor samsung
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.580]   toy my my my togg kind chrome book
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:39.380]   It's talk a book. Yeah talk a book right. I like that and um
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.340]   uh
[01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:42.340]   So I just got I got
[01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:46.260]   In fact, I had thought that no one was someone else was using my io book
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:48.980]   So I finally got that one out and saved myself two days at that time
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:54.500]   And the product manager said that there's a problem with some screens that they knew and they thought they caught them all where
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:59.780]   I didn't know this that the chrome book most laptops have the lcd and then put glass in front of it
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.940]   Chrome books and like your phones laminate them together into one. Ah
[01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:10.340]   So it gives you less depth and yeah, but you have to replace the whole stuff the whole thing. Yeah, um
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:13.220]   So, uh, yeah, I think the problem with the chrome book
[01:04:13.780 --> 01:04:17.380]   Probably I really had the end was the fulfillment. It wasn't the the ninjas. It was a fulfillment
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:22.980]   You're gonna have lots more choice linnovos announced that they're gonna get heavy into chrome books this year and in a variety of
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:26.900]   Price points and configurations, which I think is something that's been missing
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:30.580]   You've had the very low end. You've had the pixel be great to have a mid-range
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:34.180]   Exactly the the aces in fact
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:37.940]   I was I was almost getting ready to buy there so cheap. I was getting ready by one for the use of the week
[01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:42.500]   It was so desperate. Wow. They are so cheap. Yeah, the aces c 720p
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:48.820]   Is their touch screen version at 300 bucks the non touch screen is 200 bucks
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:52.660]   And it's a people rave about it. It's a good machine. It's solid
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:55.540]   Uh, it's has well only two gigs
[01:04:55.540 --> 01:05:00.740]   but uh people people seem to rave about it and I think you are going to get that mid
[01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:08.420]   Uh three four hundred dollar having a lot of the features now with the guy at at um at google kevin today
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:11.060]   Said well when we have people have a bad experience
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:15.380]   We we offer them something we offer them a play certificate. We offer them this I said, I don't want anything
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:17.380]   I don't want to have any you know treatment
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.820]   They say it's not so stupid. I said don't give me anything
[01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:21.380]   And I said you know what you can do for me Kevin
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:26.660]   You can you can wink at me when I when I say tell you how much I want to have
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:32.500]   An new version of a chrome book with has well in it. Oh, you wouldn't they wouldn't play my game
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:39.460]   Do you touch the screen a lot? Uh, yes
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:44.980]   That's a really interesting thing. Yeah, because here's what happened. I didn't realize how much I do it
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:50.340]   Uh because when I was off of it, I was not just reaching for it, but I was getting carpal tunnel
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:54.500]   Because I what I why I do it for is when i'm in twitter or things like that
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:06:01.780]   Our stories I end up mainly to scroll not to point so much but to scroll and it relieves the the hand pressure you get
[01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:03.300]   Oh
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:06.740]   Interesting interesting. Yeah, you know, I'm turning around a little bit on the chrome book
[01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:10.820]   My my wife handed in her her laptop, which was her work laptop when we left San Diego
[01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.060]   And so I gave her the pixel and said good luck
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:15.780]   And
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:22.260]   She uh, she she loves it. We we hang out. I we hang out on it all the time
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:23.380]   She's at her mothers right now
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:25.540]   So I see the baby and she's you know
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:31.220]   You know the job searching on it and doing cover letters and resume the whole thing and drive and like she you know
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.060]   She's somewhat um
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:36.500]   Paranoid about google. She doesn't like the idea of google having all of her stuff
[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:41.620]   You know, she uses yahoo mail as like a matter of principle, you know, not all of all of her eggs in one basket
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:43.620]   So she's sort of sufficiently skeptical
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:48.260]   Uh, which is why I love her, but but yeah, no the she's been loving loving the pixel
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:48.980]   And it's funny
[01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:54.100]   We you know we we moved and we had to ship some stuff and she wound up like throwing the pixel into like a priority mailbox
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:07:00.180]   And shipping in across the country and I said to her hey, uh, did you did you ensure that box and she's like no?
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:05.140]   It's a Chromebook. It's only like 200 bucks, right? I was like that was the pixel
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.780]   Which is a 1500
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:11.140]   It was like whoa, but it arrived safely and it all was fine
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:14.980]   But um, it looks like the Chromebook sold really well over the holiday season too
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:18.260]   First and third best-selling laptop on amazon
[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:21.700]   Yeah, but I don't know what that means and there was that
[01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:28.580]   I know it was amazon a good indicator. I don't know. It's price. It's all price. It's price
[01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:34.340]   It's but I think it's I think it's growing constituencies right one is schools education. They're making huge in roads
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:38.100]   I see schools that that install 1800 2000 Chromebooks
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:45.140]   I do feel like it is the right choice for a school for education. I think some companies are starting to realize this is a lot cheaper way
[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:48.100]   It's not it's it's a good thing for a sales person. It's it
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.060]   They're talking to the cloud they're talking to sales force or whatever
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:57.140]   Um, and so I think we're seeing company some companies starting to go in and then I think that it's starting to become a grandmother machine
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.180]   It's a perfect grandma machine
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:07.460]   I hate to imagine I was gonna think about it for my father and I thought no the just just to try to explain the notion of the cloud to
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.780]   Would be more than life where's my stuff?
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:12.660]   No, thanks for this 200 dollar laptop
[01:08:12.660 --> 01:08:19.140]   So you when you get into your wife you didn't say it's 1500
[01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:22.900]   You gotta go for the get some credit get the points
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:26.100]   I look I I said to her look. This is a really nice machine
[01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:29.620]   I showed her the little thing with the rainbow lights. I was like how cool this is, you know
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:33.540]   Look, it's our machine. It's our machine
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:38.580]   You didn't this shows you how out of touch she is she didn't look at the unibody
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:45.460]   Aluminum construction the four by three aspect ratio the touch screen and say this must be a premium lap
[01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:48.100]   She did not she did not
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:54.820]   If I had handed her a tonka book she would have said this is a piece of crap. I handed her the pixel and she's like, okay
[01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:56.900]   Let's try this. Okay
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:59.380]   All right, I'll just throw it in a box
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:06.020]   Mail it back East. Yeah, right. She didn't even carry with her on the plane. She was like I got too much baby stuff
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:12.980]   I'll just ship it. Yeah, no, I look okay. She's in now. She loves it underscore normal person normal person. This is how normal people are
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:15.940]   Yeah, but she took to it really really well
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:19.540]   I was surprised I'm waiting for her to say like how do I start up office?
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:25.060]   Uh, but I think that she's gotten out of that, you know, she worked she worked at a big university and they were all microsoft
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:30.820]   It was exchange and office and the whole thing and she and that she hasn't gotten there. She grabbed her documents and yeah
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:38.180]   That's actually really good. I'm trying to convince my new dean just to listen to the tech guy and switch to to uh,
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:41.780]   Doc's I think it I think it's a great way to go for her education is
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:44.180]   um
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:50.260]   But it be down let's uh, let's do the uh change log and then we can uh wrap things up. What do you say?
[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:54.020]   Well, it's just you know, we didn't do it without you. It's just not the same
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:59.940]   I heard that one episode you said well jina was here. This would be in the change log and I went oh, but she's not
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:05.700]   Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome back the trumpets because it's time once again for the google
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:08.740]   Well, let go change log
[01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:16.820]   And now ladies and gentlemen need all new for 2014
[01:10:16.820 --> 01:10:24.020]   Well, I decided not to include everything that's happened all through december a while
[01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:28.980]   That was a lot. Yeah, and there actually wasn't really a whole lot in the past the past two weeks
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:32.500]   Um, oh my my magic balance. I'm sliding all over the run down here
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:35.140]   But we got a one new thing and a couple of shutdowns
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:36.580]   first
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:38.420]   Google launched a new
[01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:45.780]   uh g plus auto backup utility for your desktop so on your on your mobile phones on ios and an android good the google plus
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:46.900]   um
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:52.580]   App has this auto backup or it automatically stores your photos up to google plus you can now do that from your desktop
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:57.060]   If you download the latest version of picasa for windows or mac
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:11:04.740]   There's a separate app in there called, uh, google plus auto backup. It's got the same icon that you see in google plus
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:09.380]   It's separate app from picasa and you tell it what folders to look at on your desktop
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:13.380]   Uh, if you've got sim card any sort of drive that's attached to your computer
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:19.380]   And it does exactly what the auto backup mobile app does it uploads all your photos and then you get all the auto awesome
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:22.020]   Uh goodness along along with that
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:27.060]   So pretty pretty cool. I have to say I really love the auto awesome stuff or especially around videos
[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:30.740]   I'm taking a lot more videos on my daughter and it really it takes all you know
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:34.180]   You don't have to edit it all and it actually comes out that the video comes out pretty pretty nice
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:38.420]   Have all three of both of you received your 2013 auto awesome film
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:42.820]   Yes, I was it was surprisingly good so amazing
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.580]   It was it actually led with the photo of us at google.io, which made me really happy
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:49.220]   That was in mind as well. It would then lead with it
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:55.300]   Yeah, I think i think i've had a lot of responses on i think that they ranked the photos by you know how people
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:58.180]   Must have been that
[01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:02.180]   Uh, because I think that photo went around most of my photos are private so there's not a lot
[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:05.540]   To a signal there to measure but um, yeah, it was pretty good. It was pretty good
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:09.540]   It was a nice although the snowfalling thing drove me nuts. I love the 23rd
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:10.180]   above
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:12.660]   Yeah, too many people put snow on too many things
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:15.060]   Yeah, and I you know
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:19.300]   I heard you guys say on the show that google plus was doing it if you if you shook your camera
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:23.300]   I shook your phone after you took the picture. I was completely unaware of that
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:25.780]   But a bunch of my photos had snow on them
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:30.500]   Oh, yeah, it doesn't do it. You you have to do it
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:36.260]   I was like that's why that happened. I'm like, it's clearly I can't hold my hand still because a bunch of my photos had
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:43.540]   Um, so two a couple of shutdowns along with that. That's the only new really new thing
[01:12:43.540 --> 01:12:49.540]   No more location history dashboard. I knew this was gonna make me sad leo because I know you'd love this
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.660]   Yes
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:53.140]   latitude where you check in or attract your
[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:58.100]   Your location there was a dashboard that would let you visualize and I think we've even looked at yours leo
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.740]   How much time you spend it or how much time is better at home?
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:05.220]   Google's killing the dashboard google's does it is not erasing the data
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:10.580]   Uh, they say you can continue to view and manage your location history information. You go to maps.google.com
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:14.580]   Slash location history, but we've removed the location history dashboard
[01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:21.380]   Um, the part of the location history website with the summary of your locations and miles traveled and trip information
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:25.220]   They're not deleting any raw data. They're just rethinking the dashboard. So
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:31.460]   Yeah, what they're rethinking is gee we really shouldn't let people know how much we know about their location
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:34.580]   Because it's not like they're yeah, they're not getting rid of the data
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:39.620]   Yeah, so the point of the dashboard is to let people know how much they know about my location
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:43.220]   And then let me use the data that you already have if they said oh
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:46.100]   We decided not to keep that date anymore than I could see it
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:50.820]   But I think the dashboards are critical to letting users know what google knows
[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:56.500]   And I think it's bad pr for them. That's why they got rid of it
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:02.420]   I'm um, oh you okay. So you think people looked at that dashboard and got free. Yes because people got free
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:06.100]   Yeah, yeah, that's a valid theory. I'm
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:11.460]   I'm kind of anti dashboards at this point. I came this place with think up where we built this dashboard
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:16.980]   I think a dashboard you look at a dashboard. He's like look cool charts and it gives you kind of a shot in delight like initially
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:21.300]   But unless you're really obsessed with the data set you never go back and look at it again
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:24.980]   And I think that dashboards kind of rely on you to interpret the information
[01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:30.020]   Although I know google did some cool stuff like oh you travel this many times around the the moon or whatever
[01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:34.020]   In the past three years, which you know kind of translates the data into something
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:38.820]   I just think there's a better way than dashboards to show and this is what we're working on we think up
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:42.660]   Um to give you kind of insights into that data, but you might be right leo might be a pr
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:47.140]   But but this makes me this makes me worried though like they have the raw data and now
[01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:49.380]   Taking away my view into it
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:53.140]   Isn't that the point of dashboard if you go to google.com/dashboard
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:58.980]   The point of it is to show what google I mean really is to show what google knows about you
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:05.460]   Right. And so I don't want to see them moving away from I want to see them moving toward being more transparent about what they
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:09.220]   Know what they're compiling. Yeah. I mean this is all the stuff google knows about me
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:11.220]   But now when I go to location
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:14.260]   What this used to give me at least something valuable
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:19.700]   Does it is it over already or is it still no it's still here so I can at least still show you what you got?
[01:15:19.700 --> 01:15:26.340]   This is amazing stuff. I can go back to a date and watch me move around petaluma for that day
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:28.660]   Uh, you know the places I went
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:31.300]   Uh, I wonder if I go back
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.780]   to uh, europe
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:36.500]   Boy, wouldn't that be cool?
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.700]   Yeah, um, let's let's go to turkey. I was in turkey
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:44.180]   And you know that they have they still have this data internally when they take away the user-facing dashboard
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:48.100]   Well, that's my point. That's kind of my point is yeah, it's a bummer
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:50.660]   If you're gonna have this you better darn well show it to me
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:55.940]   And yeah, if it crosses the creepy line guess what it crosses the creepy line, right?
[01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:58.100]   and uh
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:03.860]   The optimistic part of me thinks that they probably saw that not a lot of users were looking at the dashboard very much
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:08.740]   And they don't want to maintain a user-facing product that isn't getting the use and that they're going to launch
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:13.060]   They're going to offer something better. That's that. That's what I'm hoping. I'm hoping that it's not the uh
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:19.620]   This is bad PR for us. So let's just pull it down. I hope you're right. But yeah, yeah, also another um
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:24.500]   Fatality, I guess that's a little more extreme way to put it
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:29.940]   Schemer, um, I don't know if you remember schemer schema. I was I was my tool for uh, uh,
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:34.740]   a twig many moons ago. Yeah, it was it was so this is reported by um
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:40.500]   This is google operating system says that an internal version of
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:44.260]   The schema site says that it's going to be shut down
[01:16:44.260 --> 01:16:47.700]   So there has been no announcement, uh, and there's no link to that internal site
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.020]   I'm not really sure what that means. I think this was a tipster inside
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:55.300]   But apparently this internal site says schemers being shut down soon sign in to get your data before it's gone
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:57.380]   So they'll probably have some sort of takeout
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:02.580]   Um, and uh, just yeah, it just sounds like sk- she's hemer doesn't didn't really get the the use
[01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:06.500]   That go-go-go-whires, which doesn't surprise me. You don't hear a lot of people talking about this app
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:10.260]   No, I stopped using it. It was actually kind of annoying
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:17.220]   Yeah, yeah, so that's all I got for the changelog one new thing and uh plays its wrongs
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:19.700]   changelog in person
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.140]   Actually, this is kind of cool. This is
[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:25.860]   My google location map when I went to europe
[01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:30.740]   But the only thing that's bad about it is that the phone kept thinking it was back in italy
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:33.300]   So if you follow
[01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:36.660]   I keep going back to italy see
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:40.980]   What's that out and then briefly for a moment. I went to bordeaux
[01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:42.340]   Huh?
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:45.940]   Italian sim or something? Um, no, I think it was the ships internet
[01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:51.220]   Or something was thinking because so if it was just the phone gps it would have been fine
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:54.660]   But I think it was the ships internet that was getting it confused
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:59.060]   And then for some reason I went to france briefly. I don't
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:02.820]   Hope you had a good time
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:09.300]   But still don't I mean this is neat. I don't even if nobody ever looks at it. I think this is uh
[01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:12.100]   There's some value to this
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:15.140]   Oh, well
[01:18:15.140 --> 01:18:18.580]   I guess download your location his can you is there can you?
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:25.060]   Get it exported to kml and look at it and other stuff. I don't I they don't have to do a fancy dashboard for me
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:31.940]   I think that it's just a straight takeout if there's takeout for location data. Yeah, I don't think that
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:34.420]   I don't think there's any way to save the dashboard itself
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:43.300]   See that key button here delete history from this day delete all history. That's gotta be there
[01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:46.100]   That's important
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:49.140]   You know, yeah, I don't want my wife to know where I was this day
[01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:52.500]   Google knows
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:55.140]   That's I
[01:18:55.140 --> 01:18:57.380]   Oh, well
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:01.700]   Thank you, Gina for the change vlog good to have you back. Oh, it goes great to be back
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:08.020]   You want to see my 2010. I mean 2013 movie. Yeah, let's see guys you guys feature prominently in it
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:09.620]   Aww
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.620]   Perfect beginning. Yeah
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:13.700]   This shouldn't be in there. That's random
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.980]   This shouldn't be these are all shows and things we did
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:19.700]   people I love
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:21.700]   People I hate no, no
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:26.660]   That's sideways. I don't know why random sideways video of it's Alika singing the star spectrum
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.820]   Oh, where is that? Who are they?
[01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:34.900]   It does somehow know so you think that it's doing this see it got my son's graduation from high school
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:37.780]   That's awesome
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:40.580]   I mean it got Jason going
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:44.900]   Colleen
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:47.540]   I just this is really special to me
[01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:52.340]   This in many ways was 2013. That's a good year right there
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:20:00.820]   People think for some reason that Chad's my son because he keeps showing up in the
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:04.100]   2013 video
[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:07.860]   As a cat in Greece Greek cat
[01:20:07.860 --> 01:20:11.700]   Top cupcake palace. There's Jamal in his honor. That's great
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:13.700]   Fun
[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:16.020]   And there you are Chad wrapping it up. Yeah
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:22.500]   It's like this is how you do stuff on your phone. Yeah. Yeah. I mean look. It's a computer. It ain't perfect
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.940]   But that that's a good that's a good year right there. That's a good idea
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:27.940]   I love a good year and I would never do that myself
[01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:31.060]   Although it kind of inspired me to think maybe I could do something better
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:33.860]   If I you know choose my own things
[01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:37.780]   Oh, I've I love editing video, but I've accepted that so much work
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:43.060]   It just takes yeah, it takes it's what is it eight hours at every 30 minutes. I don't know how your staff does does it so well
[01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:45.780]   Yeah, just a lot of time. We have a lot of time
[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:47.380]   Yeah
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:49.380]   How many staff editors do we have five
[01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:55.140]   That's a lot. I mean, there's a lot of a lot of people in her. I mean just thinking about the best of 2013 videos

[01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:00.660]   And you shouldn't because it's
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:03.460]   Are they Google bots?

[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:23.860]   And you can one of the google google plus developer experts built this so you see you
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:27.220]   You can export your latitude data
[01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:32.980]   And then you drag and drop the the jason archive right onto this page and it will generate a map for you
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:36.820]   So, hey, I like this a lot. I don't I don't care if it's a third party
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:41.380]   Um app or if google's doing it for you. I mean, I like that's a good point
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:45.700]   Maybe that's why they did this is like hey we anybody could do you the dashboard
[01:23:45.700 --> 01:23:52.340]   Yeah, exactly anybody can make the dashboard and I really like the idea that your archive their takeout archive is doing something versus just kind of
[01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:57.140]   You know laying on your hard drive somewhere not doing anything. So thanks a lot tabry him for that

[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:29.540]   I guess they're pointing out that not everything is important, but some is and you know
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:32.820]   Wow, that's amazing. What?
[01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:35.380]   Wow kickstarter

[01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:04.260]   Escape park opened in philly. That's awesome photo exhibit on the burland wall. This is pretty impressive, isn't it?
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:08.660]   It is. Yeah kickstarter was on jeopardy. Let's hear this
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:15.940]   I will use the energy of niagara falls to carry power to buffalo by 1896
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:22.820]   Come on. My coil works trust me if early inventors used kickstarter. Who is nicolide tesla
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:25.700]   That is awesome
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:34.020]   Oh, I'm sorry. It's nicolas kickstarter was in cards against humanity. All right. All right. All right
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:36.980]   Blue ruin won at cans. That was uh
[01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:40.580]   That was a kickstarted movie. I guess huh wow
[01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:48.180]   Inos ande Wow, so anyway long list of yeah of things, but you're right. It did focus a little bit on the gadgets
[01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:50.660]   It's interesting because now there's a huge
[01:26:51.540 --> 01:26:54.260]   Wide range of crowds crowds sourced
[01:26:54.260 --> 01:27:00.900]   Funding platforms platforms. I mean it's almost it seems like they've just I don't know if even kickstarter was the first
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:09.460]   But the spot dot us started by david cone who's now at circa was was a very early venture in this was trying to
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:14.580]   Duke do proud source crowd-funded rather journalism projects. Yeah
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:20.580]   So there you go. Yeah, tics are wasn't the first there are micro payments and there were others but kickstarter just hit the right note
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:25.700]   Yes, boy today boy at the right note and i'm in that sometimes that's more important than the technology
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:29.780]   I'm in that group of 80,000 that has contributed more to the 10 kickstarter
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:38.420]   I keep following I keep following. I think it's a good idea on yahoo tak that they have kickstarter reviews
[01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:42.260]   Uh
[01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:46.900]   Reviews of products that yes, yeah, they're no they're getting the prototypes
[01:27:46.900 --> 01:27:50.660]   Oh, they're getting the product. So during the campaign. Yes
[01:27:51.300 --> 01:27:58.500]   Oh, that's interesting because they did I have mine right here the razor that oh look how many miles of you travel chad
[01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:03.940]   So I just started importing it. I didn't know it was gonna do this really cool animation. So I love the little rocket
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:07.620]   Yeah, that's right to the moon. I don't have that far left to go
[01:28:07.620 --> 01:28:12.260]   But it says you know which which city is i've spent the most time in and
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:15.300]   apparently I went to
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:16.980]   uh a few
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:23.300]   Imriville for two hours at some point and uh, well, i'm downloading mine to now and i'll do mine
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:26.020]   Didn't get very far unfortunately
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:29.060]   Just a little bit to the moon
[01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:32.260]   Do you upload the zip or uh?
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:34.900]   Do you have to unzip it first uh you have unzip it
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:39.860]   Then get the json file. I need to json file json
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:42.420]   Is that thing jeth?
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:45.780]   I have my I was trying to plug it in. I have my um three doodler
[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:50.100]   Oh, there's a successful kickstart there at ces also
[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:51.940]   Yes, they are
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:55.380]   So what do you think are you have you have you built the iphlet tower?
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:59.300]   I got the abs plastic as opposed to the pla
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:03.140]   Yeah, and the and the abs is more for doing things in the air
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:07.220]   Whereas I think the pla is more about sketching and tod and then making things out of it
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:09.220]   Which I think it'd be more fun actually
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:14.420]   Writing somebody's name and that kind of stuff. So it's fun. I mean, it's it's people still make fun of me for a reason
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:17.140]   Um, but they have many other causes to do so
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:24.340]   I I still think it's a very neat device and I think you should care it in your pocket and take it to davos
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:29.620]   Yes, he'll do guitar for bonnie. Well, here's it. Here's the problem. So I just got the return package
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:32.660]   to upgrade my glass
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:36.900]   Oh nice. I just just sent that in
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:38.820]   I saw
[01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:43.700]   But I don't know I might want a I don't know where the heck the charger is it's a ubs. It's a usb charger
[01:29:43.700 --> 01:29:46.660]   I don't know. I made it to the moon. I made it to the moon. I made it to the moon
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:49.140]   I made it to the moon. I made it to the moon. What?
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:52.900]   I made it to the moon several times over
[01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:54.580]   Wow
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:58.980]   Looks like I traveled when are you gonna get back? That's the question apparently you only go once
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:01.780]   You only live once
[01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:05.540]   And these are all the places I've been
[01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:10.820]   Just been a long time in australia. Yeah, I feel like mine doesn't it only has like a full
[01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:19.060]   5000 hours basically. These are all the cities a ton more well. I've been using google location for a long time
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:22.020]   Um, this is really
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:26.980]   Yeah, I mean if this goes to australia it goes back. Um, you know, this is a couple of years worth of data
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:29.700]   That's awesome
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:32.740]   I don't even remember going to edge water united states, but
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:35.380]   According to google, I was there once
[01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:38.420]   CNBC look at this is that where cnbc is
[01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:45.700]   Maybe I was or you just go across the george washing bridge or didn't you write a bike across it or some such a prediction?
[01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:48.340]   Maybe I did something like that. This is very nicely done
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:54.980]   But now I think this is it says I've traveled 1 million four and four eight thousand eight and 51 kilometers
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:31:01.700]   That's pretty good. I've traveled to the moon and back almost five times
[01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:05.620]   So my tool my friends my tool
[01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:09.220]   Is has nothing to do with google
[01:31:09.220 --> 01:31:14.180]   It's just a little thing I like to call a mac pro
[01:31:14.180 --> 01:31:21.220]   It looks like it just a big beer glass. Yeah, I'm taking this to october fest next time I go to churman
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:23.620]   This is when you should show what pog did
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:28.020]   What did pog do with it? I haven't seen his review yet. You had the video on oh
[01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:30.820]   You did oh
[01:31:30.820 --> 01:31:35.620]   Chad you're gonna play it for us. Yeah, I don't know. I'll get it. I'll have to go to yahoo.com slash
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:38.180]   tech you think I keep tabs open
[01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:44.180]   I don't I know you guys all do you have hundreds of tabs open, but I believe in tab purity
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:48.420]   Let's go to yahoo tech
[01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:51.140]   apples new mac pro I don't I have to say
[01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:53.300]   just a
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:55.700]   Snide remark. I don't like the
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:58.500]   What happened so you go to the website
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:05.380]   And you down and you click on something and you get these articles, but this is very fussy little times roman
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.380]   tiny
[01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:12.740]   In here. I don't like how this thing with the new york times redesigned today put out today. Is that the new thing?
[01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:20.100]   There's font problems online. Maybe that's it. The rendering isn't very good. All right. Let's see what yahoo
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:23.940]   David pog the jerry louis of technology report is
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:32.020]   What is that thing this show where we ask you? What is that thing? How do I go full screen?

[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:43.060]   C or d
[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:56.980]   The answer is e none of the above. It's the new apple mac pro available now starting at the high high price of
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:32:59.860]   $3,000 and going up to
[01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:04.020]   $500 this computer is crazy fast
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:12.660]   Look at this in final cut pro. It can munch this 4k video like butter. That's four times the resolution of i-deaf tv
[01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:15.780]   And it's made in the USA
[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:18.340]   It's portable
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:25.300]   One handable expanding the memory is super easy. The shell pops right off. Oh, the music's gonna make me shoot myself
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:28.900]   Light up when you move it. It's like benny hill. It's super quiet
[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:32.740]   That that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that no one who's watching this is going to buy
[01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:37.300]   But it's not like the old mac. Oh, that's all right. These stuff too drives and cards inside
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:42.980]   I don't know. I mean, I'm glad it looks like this. This is good if there's a market for this all the all the better
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:46.100]   It's not our mark. You're market at all. Thank goodness
[01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:49.220]   I'd be
