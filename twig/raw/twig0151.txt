[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400]   It's time for Twig this week at Google Jeff Jarvis is at the big US Postal Service Convention.
[00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:15.400]   Aaron Newcomb joins us to talk open source, Jane and Japan, to a very exciting Twig in which we compare Android to the brand new iOS next on Twig.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.400]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.400]   From people you trust.

[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   Time for Twig. This week in Google, I'm going to start with Jeff Jarvis because no one knows how long he's going to last.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.600]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.600]   It looks like you're on a funeral parlor for one thing.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.600]   Is that the coffin behind you? Is this a wake? What's going on here?
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   It's a wake for bandwidth. I'm at the Postal Vision 2020 Conference in Washington, D.C. looking out on the Washington Monument as we speak.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.600]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:06.600]   And I have no bandwidth from the Lowe's All-Fault Plaza Hotel has .16 up. So I'm on my my my Fi and we're praying.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600]   Hey, but I got to tell you this looks fantastic.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   Yeah, it's a good one.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.600]   Yeah, you never know. So is this a is this 4G?
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   It's 4G. Yeah. Well, I think in D.C. they've got good 4G.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   Don't keep this here. It's Verizon.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   So it's LTE. I think that looks pretty darn good. In fact, that might be better than a lot of home.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   Chad and I were talking though is I want to get the what do they call it? Bondering or whatever the thing you had in your backpack. It's out the Southwest.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   I want to get it.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   I keep this for this this one and then get a thing and bond the two. So I'm safer.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   I think actually well, we'll see knock on wood, but this looks this looks like you might be this might be a good alternative for in areas where there's a good LTE.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.600]   It looks really, really good.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   Yeah, we downgrow to the sit down great the signal and I'm not getting video from you and I'm not doing anything else on my laptop.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   Right.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   So well, I'm like this.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   This hotel that they supposedly had wired downstairs. It was just awful. These hotels should all be shot.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.600]   Well, they're, you know, one of the problems is they're sharing bandwidth with everybody else in the hotel and everything else.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   There's not quite enough though. They need to go in charge this conference $100 a head for the Wi-Fi.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   Wow.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   Wow.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   It didn't, but that's now as they're going in bid.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   And you're hit. You're in a postal company. I'm going to get. I haven't introduced anybody else. Let me introduce the rest of the panel.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   First, and then I want to hear what this is all about. Chris, you could pay your stamps.com commercial.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.600]   And then I actually will do a steps like a gene.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.600]   Jeana, Japan is here. Of course, for smarter where.org and think up app.com.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   I'm going to move you in a little bit closer, Jean. I don't like you so far away.
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   You were, but I'm mad at you because you were in the area and you didn't stop by.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   I was. I'm so sorry. I was, I was up there for a couple of days just for, I had like back-to-back meetings for think up.
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   And I was at food camp over the weekend and then just had back-to-back meetings for think up and just got home last night.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   Just started to watch the, the, the WWDC keynote this morning, like, you know, three days later.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   So that's what I thought you were here for because you are doing a iPhone development as well as Android development, right?
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   Yeah. Yeah. And actually someone in the chat room asked why I'm carrying an iPhone. It's because I'm dog-fooding my iOS app.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.600]   Right.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   I love Android and I'll be a Google I/O in a few weeks. But yeah, that, that was it.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   It's likely excuse Gina.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   Is it to do text? Your dog-fooding? What is it that you're?
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   Yeah, it's, it's to do text. Yeah, exactly. I wanted to get a sense of what it was like to walk around in the world.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   You know, instead of just getting an iPod touch and using it as a test device, I wanted to live with it the way that my users were.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   So that's why I switched.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   Well, now I got to know.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   Do you like it?
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   I do. I like iOS a lot. It was a big learning curve for me because I was Android for years.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   There are just a lot of iOS conventions that I didn't, I didn't know about.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   I mean, people say that iOS is just naturally easy to use. There are certain things about it.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.600]   You know, like double clicking the home button and certain like swipes and gestures that I had to learn.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   But overall, yeah, I really like, I like iOS a lot. And I was impressed with the keynote this week.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   And I think that Apple, you know, I think that Apple just does really great, you know, designs, great user experiences.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   I do believe that. I love Android too. And I'm really loyal to Android's values. That's for sure.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   And I think Android's made a lot, a lot of progress.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   And I'm thrilled to hear Android news in a couple weeks at Google I/O.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.600]   And I'm dying for that phone that you've got in your hand there, there, Leah.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   I love this galaxy S3 more and more. It really is a wonderful phone.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   I really appreciate both both for different reasons.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   Good. And you might recognize this fella sitting to my right in studio here.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:47.600]   Aaron Nukem is here from The Source Show. It's a open source podcast, hacking, making, that kind of thing.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   He also frequently co-hosts our Floss Weekly open source show.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   Trying to do that as much as possible. We love having you. And disclaimer, full disclaimer, you worked at Sun when Sun was acquired by Oracle.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   You were acquired as well. So you are an employee. What do you do at Oracle?
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.600]   I am in hardware marketing. So...
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   Well, if any big database hardware comes up in this conversation, you must...
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.600]   You must have...
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.600]   Turned to me. I'm your man.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.600]   I was going to say you should recuse yourself.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.600]   I should recuse myself.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.600]   But frankly, maybe we should turn to you. Better be better.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   Anyway, it's great to have you, Aaron.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.600]   Yeah, thank you very much for having me on. This is great.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   Not the least of which reasons, because you always bring donuts.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   In the morning, in the morning.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   He is a welcome guest at the brick to it house.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   So, yeah, I guess we should start with WWDC because a lot of people have pointed out that
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.600]   Apple made a number of announcements about iOS 6.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   It's next version of the operating system for the iPhone that many of the features in iOS 6 are really just cribbed from Android.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   In fact, it's pretty obvious.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   One piece that says that Android is still better. It's on the list.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.600]   Well, let's talk about it. Let's talk about it. So we can go through these...
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.600]   The most obvious one is the...
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.600]   Well, Maps is probably the biggest news story, which is that Apple is in fact...
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   Apple is in fact going to boot Google Maps from its operating system.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   You still, I'm sure, be able to get it as a third-party app and do its own maps,
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.600]   which are as far as I could tell a direct clone of what Google's doing, especially...
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.600]   Except people are having fits because it doesn't have driving or transit directions.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   I mean, walking or transit directions.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   It doesn't have biking or transit.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.600]   It also doesn't have... And I think this is not a small thing. It doesn't have street view.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   I like street view.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.600]   When you use it, the VORAC of all people is always raving about how...
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   When you use the turn-by-turn on Android and you get there, the street view pops up and says,
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.600]   "There it is. That's the building you're going to." And that has some real use.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:47.600]   I think 3D, which both Google and Apple are doing, you know, they both have little mini-air forces flying over major cities...
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   Is a cool thing, but not really of much use at all.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.600]   Well, is there some use for it that we don't see the same way that street view is probably useful for...
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   Self-driving cars and all kinds of other things?
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.600]   Is there some reason that...
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.600]   Yeah, it's not enough to just be cool. It's not very useful for 3D.
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.600]   Street view is not in the same way that street view is.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.600]   Street view is really useful. I mean...
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.600]   Yeah, it is. The 3D stuff. I don't get the investment.
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   I think that... I don't know. And maybe it's because you and I, Jeff, don't think spatially like that for directions,
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.600]   but I know my wife loves it.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   Really?
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.600]   Yeah, my wife really loves to drag down the map and turn it into 3D.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.600]   For some reason, it helps her navigate a little bit better.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   It's different on turn-by-turn she wants to see.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.600]   Yeah, but that's not...
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   That would be distracting if it used those actual rendered buildings.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   That's not what you see. You want to see the little kind of simplified version of where you're driving.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   And I agree on turn-by-turn.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   Right.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.600]   But what is the... This is like Google Earth. It's got a high cool factor.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   I can't see it's really practical, please.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.600]   I don't really see it's just a quick correction.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   Walking directions are in iOS.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   They are.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   Oh, okay.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   Yeah, Andy Baio did it.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.600]   I walked corrected.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.600]   Yeah, there were some reports that said that it wasn't in it, but it is.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.600]   Bike directions are not there.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.600]   And public transit aren't in the current beta.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   But does it have traffic?
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:06.600]   Yes.
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.600]   In fact, that was how we knew that Apple was going to do this because remember a year ago,
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:16.600]   when there was a privacy issue about Apple, remember saving that large database of where you'd been,
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:20.600]   the database of Wi-Fi access spots and GPS locations,
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   Apple is in explanation at the time said we're developing a traffic app.
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   So yeah, they probably will have the best traffic, maybe even better than Waze.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   Waze is the same idea of crowdsource traffic information.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   Waze ZE, it's on iOS and on Android.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.600]   But I think if you have what is it all?
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.600]   380 million... 380 million iPhone and iOS users doing it all at the same time.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.600]   You're going to have excellent traffic, especially in areas where the iPhone is very popular.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   Somebody pointed out in the chatroom, this is true, because there is, and this is huge,
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:01.600]   an API for Apple, much like Google does with its maps, you might expect third party apps
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:07.600]   for Subway or walking, biking, well they have walking, but biking.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.600]   This is going to empower apps throughout iOS.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   Much the same way that Google Maps does, right?
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.600]   Okay, so that was the first one. The second one is Siri.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:25.600]   Siri's smarter, Siri's more like the original Siri app that Apple bought.
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.600]   It can book tables, it can finally launch applications.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.600]   Now, the reason this is a little confused is because, for instance, what's available
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.600]   on my Galaxy S3 is a Samsung product.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.600]   And I can do all of those and more with the Samsung product, but I don't know.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:42.600]   What is the Google product?
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   Well, it's voice commands, right?
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.600]   I mean, it isn't a personality quite like Siri.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   Well, there is Vlingo.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.600]   Are you familiar with Vlingo?
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.600]   Vlingo, Samsung used to ship Vlingo.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   Well, the S voice is based on uses Vlingo.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.600]   It still does use Vlingo.
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:00.600]   Yeah, it's branded as Vlingo on the Galaxy S2 and the Note, and now they've dropped the
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   branding on the S3, but it's still Vlingo.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.600]   It's still powered by Vlingo.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.600]   At least, according to Life Hacker, it looks a lot like Vlingo.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.600]   So I could show you.
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   And by the way, I think the dictation is more accurate in Siri.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.600]   So here's the thing I wanted.
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   There'll be on that, Leo.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.600]   I hear people all the time say Siri's not that good.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   It's not that good.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.600]   How good is it?
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   Siri's pretty good.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.600]   What do you think, Gina?
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.600]   You're new to this.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   Ah, hm.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.600]   Hit-miss, hit-miss.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.600]   I mean, sometimes I say things to Siri and it spins and it can't fulfill the request.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   Other times, it's great.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.600]   Certain things, it's great.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.600]   I use Siri to set reminders constantly.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   Excellent.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   And very accurate there, I think.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.600]   Shopping lists, too.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:43.600]   Add bread to my shopping list, which is really a reminders list.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   Right.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.600]   It does that almost perfectly.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   And it has the geo-fencing, which is very cool.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.600]   And they're going to enhance that geo-fencing.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.400]   So for instance, when you walk into the store, you can have it set up so that it will, or
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.600]   when you leave work, it'll remind you things like that.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.600]   But these are things you can do, if not natively in Android with third-party apps for sure.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.600]   Right.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.600]   But it's interesting that Siri's built in to iOS, right?
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   And that she's such a personality that she did the opening monologue at the keynote.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.600]   And slammed Android.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.600]   And slammed Android.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:19.600]   I think John Gruber said that there was clearly an FU Google tone throughout the whole thing.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.600]   And Siri kind of said it in the beginning, right?
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   It was Siri talking on the iPhone and then the rimshot on the iPad.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.600]   It's pretty funny, actually.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.600]   Yeah, she actually made fun of all the, you know, they showed all the Android build names
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.600]   and that reminds her to list and she said, you know, who's naming these things.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.600]   Yeah, that was interesting.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.600]   And it was interesting that no human took that tone, but Siri was allowed to--
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.600]   Right.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   --series like the Vice President.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.600]   The Vice President is the attack dog, not the President.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.600]   Siri is the attack dog.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.600]   Let's--let's--some other features that Ice Cream Sandwich--
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.600]   Remember, a passbook.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.600]   Yeah, a passbook.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.600]   Passbook.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.600]   There's no analog in the Google world, although--
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.600]   There's a bunch of analogs, right?
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   You can do--you can do every piece of what passbook does, but it's not integrated into
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.600]   one app.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.600]   Right.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.600]   Fandango will let you buy movie tickets, but not airplane tickets.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   Right.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.600]   You're--you're my--United app has the boarding pass, my Starbucks app has that.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600]   So it's all on there.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600]   It's just not pulling to one.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   I would submit--and I think that was always true in iOS as well.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   And I would submit that the unification into one tool is what makes passbook interesting,
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.600]   not the--
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.600]   Passbook is really interesting.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:33.600]   So look at it more broadly, passbook is about offloading all the stuff in your wallet to
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   your phone, right?
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   And Google's trying to do that with Google Wallet, but you know, I was talking to a friend
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.600]   and I give him all the credit for making this observation, is that, you know, Google
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:46.600]   Wallet is really cool, but you can only have it if you have NFC, and if you go to certain,
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.600]   you know, retail shops that support it, and this whole idea--I mean, I absolutely believe
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:54.600]   that, you know, tapping to pay with your phone is absolutely the future, but people are getting
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.600]   there slowly, right?
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   I think people are really kind of skeptical and not sure that they're ready for that yet.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.600]   And Google's kind of released that in a very limited way, unlimited hardware with limited
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:03.600]   retailers, right?
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:10.600]   Apple is introducing the idea that you're going to use your phone for wallet-like functions,
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.600]   kind of slowly, and easily.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:17.600]   I mean, the idea of, you know, having my Starbucks card pop up when I approach a Starbucks and
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   that the balance is automatically deducted, you know, that I never remember what the balance
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.600]   is on my gift cards.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   That is--that's a beautiful user experience.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:29.600]   It's not that threatening, and it kind of introduces this idea that your phone will become your
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   wallet.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:36.600]   In a way, I think that was a lot less, you know, some extreme and limited, I think, than Google
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.600]   Wallet.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.600]   So I was really impressed with Passbook.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.600]   The idea--I haven't tried it yet.
[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.600]   I haven't installed it on your iPhone.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.600]   You're also ambitious.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.600]   Oh, and there are the 4G fails us.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.600]   No!
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.600]   He's frozen.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.600]   We're going to get Jeff back in a second.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:56.120]   I do think that the thing about Passbook is not so much what it can do today, but what
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.600]   it says about what Apple's intentions are down the road.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.600]   I mean, if you add the true contents of your wallet that we care about, Starbucks card
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.920]   OK, movie tickets, airline tickets OK, but if you put my credit cards in there, if it
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:13.760]   becomes an Apple wallet, especially since Apple already has my credit card, that's just
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.760]   Google, I guess.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.760]   Right.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.960]   Have you gone into Apple Store with the Apple app and purchased something?
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.560]   No, but I know people who have, and you don't have to talk to a customer.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:21.560]   You're a human.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.560]   It's wild.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.560]   It's wild experience.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.560]   You've done it?
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.560]   Yeah, I've done it.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.560]   It was incredible.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.560]   I had the Apple App installed, the Apple Store app.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:34.560]   I had it installed because it gives me stats on my own sales for my app.
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.560]   Actually, that's--now that may be a different app.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:38.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:43.040]   I went to the Apple Store and I was buying something, a time machine, and someone said--and the
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.920]   Apple person said, "Hey, you can buy this using the app."
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.120]   And I was so excited I actually installed the app right on the spot and did it because
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.120]   I wanted to try it.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.360]   Because you could go and take it and walk out, which is really weird.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.360]   Right.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.720]   You scan it, it charges your Apple ID account just like as if you were buying an app and
[00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:00.960]   then you just walk out of the store.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.960]   So weird.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.360]   Isn't that the nature of shopping though?
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.600]   I mean, isn't that what's going to happen?
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.600]   Absolutely.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.720]   That's what Apple would like and Apple would love to get a little 30% on all those transactions
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.040]   and probably wouldn't be that high.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.480]   And I think that's why there's so many players in this market.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.040]   I mean, everybody is trying to get into this.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.040]   Obviously, all the credit card companies are trying to get into it.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:23.840]   Google, Apple, all the cell phone carriers are coming together around one product or
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.760]   another, one standard or another.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:29.600]   And I really think there must be a lot of money here because everybody is trying at
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.600]   it.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.600]   Jeff, we got back.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.600]   So I'm also sorry about that.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.360]   Yeah, and I'm sorry for this connection.
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.120]   This company called Infotrans did a study to say, "Who would you most trust to handle
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.000]   a digital email account similar but for business?"
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.960]   Number one, Amazon.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.040]   Last Facebook.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.240]   Really interesting that people don't want to mix the reasoning was they don't want to
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:53.080]   mix their social and so you have in your business.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:59.520]   And so you have, right, banks, phone companies and technology companies all vying to be that
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.160]   trusted intermediary.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:05.600]   The problem is, I hope they're not going to charge 30% for MX is bad enough.
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.960]   Yeah, no, and I'm sure they won't.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.960]   I mean, that's...
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:12.360]   But I think there's an opportunity here to undercut all of the credit cards and you know,
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:19.240]   something you can imagine Google doing of saying, "We'll charge 0.5% for transactions
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.880]   and make it work just to become the killer and it could change transactions, which would
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.520]   be a good thing, I think, for businesses and us.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.160]   Who has the natural advantage?
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:33.680]   Is it the OS maker, the handset maker or third party like Visa?
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:40.200]   I think the real feel that Visa and MasterCard and Verifone, which really hates Square, for
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:44.480]   instance, have is that they're going to get intermediated out of business.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.000]   It should be a good thing.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Wouldn't be a bad thing.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.040]   It would be really like their bank or their credit card these days.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:50.040]   Right.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.240]   Although I have to think that somebody's going to partner with somebody.
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.440]   So here's an opportunity for Visa to say, "I'm sure what they're waiting to see is who's
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.800]   going to be the winner in this horse race or at least this preliminary heat?"
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.480]   And then Joe would love it not to be a phone company or a bank or a credit card.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.840]   I would love it to be at Google.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:13.640]   Well, and I think that that's the clear choice of consumers is Apple or Google, right?
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.640]   Yes.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.640]   We would trust Apple or Google.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.240]   We don't want Samsung.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:18.720]   We don't want Visa.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:25.840]   They'll remember back in the day, Microsoft bought...
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.160]   My friend, you're Pender Chardonnaw's business.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.240]   I'm suddenly forgetting the name of it.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.720]   It was actually a music recommendation business, but they bought it to...
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.720]   Why?
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.720]   Oh no.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.720]   The passport.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.720]   Right.
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:35.720]   Yes.
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.720]   We're Microsoft now.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.720]   It was an early attempt.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.800]   Well, of yours ago, it was going to be the wallet and I think the reason it didn't work
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.400]   was that we didn't necessarily trust Microsoft with this task.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.520]   And I don't know if we trust Google either, do we, really?
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.520]   Maybe Apple's the one.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.360]   Because Apple, you know, we know what Apple's business model is, is to sell hardware.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.640]   So they're kind of like Switzerland in this, right?
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:02.720]   But the problem is unless Apple decided to do it for other handsets, then it's only a limited
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   utility.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.440]   Well, unless you have an iPhone and then you're good.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.440]   Why Apple does this?
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.040]   Because it makes people buy iPhones.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.760]   True, but then that doesn't get them into all the stores across the world.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.000]   I think it does.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Really?
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.760]   Well, you know...
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.760]   There's got to be a partnership.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:23.680]   I mean, I don't think Google or Apple want to be in the transaction processing business
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.280]   itself, that part of it.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.280]   So they partner with...
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.280]   They partner with...
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.960]   Like I think Google's really already partnered a little bit with MasterCard, right?
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.800]   Actually, you're partnering with...
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   Actually, there's back-end transactions.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.400]   But Yodley is who you partner with, somebody like that.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.680]   Well, there's even back-end ones to that.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.520]   There's big industry shifters, and I can't remember the names of them right now.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.240]   But those are the guys that you probably buy one of them.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.240]   I saw it in a movie.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.520]   The guys who handle all the transactions behind the scenes.
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.520]   Right.
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.760]   I can't remember who it is.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.240]   I'm sure somebody will tell us.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.240]   I remember in the early days of Connie Nast when I was there working on Style.com and that
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.000]   kind of stuff to try to get a store up in the early days was torture.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Yes.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.640]   The only way you could really do it in the early early days was by having Yahoo! store.
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.320]   Swift, that was the company in Europe.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.320]   I think Swift is worldwide.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.320]   Swift is internationally.
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.320]   They're international.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.880]   They do the upper bank clearances.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.680]   There's also a lower level credit card.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.800]   Right, to get your Swift number, right?
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:21.800]   Yep.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   Yep.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.960]   So how do we want to pay?
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.320]   So this is the next question.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:31.240]   So Google's betting we're going to want to do this almost a swipe or a tap against a
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.080]   piece of hardware.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:37.560]   Apple, Passbook right now, it looks like it's using barcodes and QR codes.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.560]   Right.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:42.760]   Which I'm not sure that's a good, but that's kind of, as we, I think we've experienced,
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.760]   that's kind of hit or miss, right?
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.880]   Well, but it's not the problem of you having to take a picture of a QR code that goes nowhere.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.320]   I use the Starbucks app all the time in Starbucks and all they do is hold it up in front of
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.160]   the scanner and it's done and boom.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.160]   It's very easy.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:57.160]   Right.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.200]   What do you think, Gina?
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.640]   What would you like?
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.200]   Yeah, I want that.
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.120]   I mean, I don't care about the technical implication.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.800]   I mean, I just want it to be easy and I want it to work.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.400]   And buying that thing at the Apple Store that way was-
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.840]   You swiped the barcode, right?
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.840]   On the product?
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.640]   If I remember correctly, yeah, I was actually looking at the barcode.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.680]   I was pointing the phone at the barcode on the object, on the product.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:25.120]   The problem with NFC, too, is I think people will have this fear that-
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.480]   Is it charging me for things when I don't know it?
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.480]   Right.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.480]   Whereas when I hold it up and the scan and the beeps, I know that that's a finished transaction.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.480]   Right.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.480]   Right.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.240]   I'm like people, people like tap to pay, you know, tap to pay is not that big a deal.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.880]   The fact is is that paying for a meal at a restaurant with a credit card involves handing
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.880]   over the card, bringing it back, signing-
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.880]   That's scary.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:47.880]   There's a lot of transactions.
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.440]   Cash is dirty and inconvenient and you get lost.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:57.240]   I mean, there's so many things- Paying with your phone is a much easier transaction.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:02.320]   And I think that really somebody in the chat room asked, do people really trust Apple or
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.040]   they just trained because of iTunes?
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.520]   I mean, Apple really has done the best job and has been doing this for the longest of
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.520]   training people.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.960]   Like, hey, we've had your payment information, we've made it so easy for you to buy songs
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.960]   and now apps and now software in your desktop and now products in our Apple stores.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:23.480]   Apple's really teaching users like how to pay and that it's safe and secure and that
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.480]   works.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.480]   Right.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.320]   I mean, Apple really hasn't had any security issues with payment.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.760]   And they've had credit card.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.320]   I mean, they were talking about this as WWDC.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.360]   They have the largest database of credit cards that they know of.
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.240]   So I don't know what that means if there's another one.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.560]   Is Amazon a player in this?
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.840]   I mean, Amazon is the payment method for Kickstarter, right?
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.560]   I'm surprised I haven't seen them do more.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:45.560]   I think they'd be such a natural.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.960]   But they're not in your pocket.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.400]   The Kindle is a buying machine, right?
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.400]   And Amazon purchasing.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.400]   Right.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.560]   But they never think past their own shelves.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   They've got this infrastructure.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.320]   Well, I bet you they are thinking.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.320]   I bet you they are.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.320]   I don't see the results.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:08.000]   I mean, so if Apple starts to become preeminent, what's Google's relationship with Amazon?
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.920]   Is it hostile because Amazon didn't give them credit with in the fire or is it good
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.080]   because they're an Amazon?
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.080]   They're a distributor of Android.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.720]   It's a very interesting landscape we're about to enter.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.720]   It is interesting.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:27.640]   But I think being in your pocket, I mean, your phone is in your pocket, so you're going
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.200]   to pay with that anywhere, right?
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.840]   You don't have your Kindle on your pocket.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.880]   And you know, I mean, Amazon is great for payments on the web, right?
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.440]   But, but it's not.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:40.240]   And the other thing that does, it's really interesting is the fear of credit card fraud,
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.800]   right?
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.040]   Somebody can take your number and all the fear about, oh my God, they have your number
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:46.440]   and your other little numbers.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.320]   There's been a breach of security and all that.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.520]   If we start to get to physical devices, that's going to be potentially a much more secure
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.760]   transaction, people are going to feel a lot better about it.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.040]   We had Bill Harris on triangulation a month or two ago.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.880]   He was former CEO of PayPal.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.480]   He runs a kind of mint-like website called Personal Capital Now.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.800]   But his great interest is in finance.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.480]   He says it's all an authentication problem.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.480]   Yes.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:15.000]   Anytime you have payments, really, the problem is merely, are you who you say?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   You are.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.640]   Am I who I say I am?
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:23.000]   Once we validate that, then the transaction can proceed securely and safely.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.240]   And so if you think about it, in that case, these phones are really perfect for that kind
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   of thing.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.440]   This is a great cloud story because money really is a cloud.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.440]   There is nothing.
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.440]   Yeah, it's all bits.
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.440]   It's all bits.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.600]   It's all just up there somewhere and you have to have authorized and authenticated access
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.800]   to a supposed virtual value in the cloud.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.520]   So who is the best at authentication?
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.360]   Who has does anybody have a leg up on this?
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.920]   I mean, Google probably, right?
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.920]   Who knows?
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:55.920]   Facebook.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.920]   Facebook knows who you are.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:57.920]   Maybe it's Facebook.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.920]   It could be.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.920]   Facebook and Amazon together?
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.160]   Facebook doesn't have my credit card.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.160]   But Amazon does.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160]   They're a part of it.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.160]   Amazon does.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:12.000]   But you could imagine a lash up there to be very powerful.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.240]   So why would Facebook do that to get back at?
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:19.480]   Well, I mean, supposedly they're now Facebook's all levy-w with Apple, but how long will that
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.480]   last?
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.480]   It's a very...
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.480]   Facebook and Apple, Apple doesn't really have your credit card.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.560]   Apple has access to transactional infrastructure at scale.
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.000]   The potential for this is so massive.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.520]   And we're talking trillions of dollars a year, I'm sure.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.520]   And the data.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.520]   And the non-list.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.520]   And the data.
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.640]   That's what the value really is.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.960]   So there's going to be competition on the rates to come down, I'm sure.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.560]   But there's huge value.
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:50.920]   And even if you're doing millions and millions of transactions a day and you only get a fraction
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.760]   of a penny per transaction, it still can be a significant amount of money.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.600]   There's huge incentive.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:01.160]   You've got a lot of stakeholders here, most of whom are competing with one another.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:06.920]   But there is incentive if you could see your way to a winner, if you could say it's Facebook,
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:11.760]   if only they had hardware, maybe that's why they're doing a phone and a credit card.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.080]   You know, there's got to be some way that this...
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.240]   Oh, well, it'll kill me, though, is if the retailers can't stand to have five different
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.240]   hardware standards.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.240]   No, one way has to work.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:24.520]   In fact, with credit cards, it didn't work when it was Visa or MasterCard.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:26.080]   It didn't work till it didn't matter.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.000]   And you just go in and you give them a piece of plastic.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.320]   If you had to think about, "Oh, do they support MasterCard or Visa?"
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:37.160]   And that's why MasterCard and Visa won versus American Express Discover.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.160]   Remember Diner's Club?
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.800]   Would you remember that the days Leo, my mother, used to have a charge plate?
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.800]   Charge plate, it may see.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.800]   It was a metal plate.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   Yes.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.320]   And it had notches based on what stores was authorized to use.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.320]   Right.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.200]   And none of that worked because it was too fragmented.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.240]   That's kind of the state we're in right now.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.360]   At some point, there's going to be some...
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.480]   And it's going to be like rock candy, I think, because I think we're just super saturated
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.480]   right now.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.200]   And we're just waiting for it to click.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.320]   And when it happens, it's going to happen and you will look back and say, "Wow, that
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.320]   was fast."
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:13.720]   Remember, like ATMs, you know, I mean, people don't go into banks anymore.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.720]   That's going to be like that.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.720]   We're just...
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.920]   Well, then it's going to turn around too, is the ATM was there to get rid of the tellers.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.920]   Once they got rid of the tellers.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.560]   And so they begged us to go to the ATMs to save the money there.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.440]   And then once we're on the ATMs, they try to charge us for the ATMs.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.440]   Right.
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.960]   I think the key is it comes down to three things.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.120]   Ease of use, ubiquity and security.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.120]   Precisely.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.720]   And when you do those three things first, the best is going to win.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   Precisely.
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.000]   Or at least be the leader for a long time.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.080]   And that's why you look at somebody like Square who really is kind of the out party.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.720]   They're not really...
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.720]   They're doing a great thing.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.440]   I love card case, or what I guess to pay with Square now, they call it.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:51.760]   But I go into the local coffee shop here because that's the one I can go in and just say,
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.120]   "Put it on Leo."
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.080]   And that is a really perfect...
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.000]   It's got convenience on its side, but it doesn't have ubiquity.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.520]   And I think without ubiquity, I trust them.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.400]   And it's convenience, but it's not everywhere.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.400]   Yep.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.200]   There's another one on Kickstarter and I supported this project.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.440]   I forget the name of it.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.280]   But it's an iPhone case.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:14.920]   And what you do is you take all of your credit cards and affinity cards and scan them in
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.200]   or roll them in.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.240]   And then you have one card out of the case that's readable as if it were your Starbucks
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   card, as if it were your...
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   I think this is terrible.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.080]   Yeah, I think it's probably not going to work.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.480]   Is it too late to get your money back?
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.480]   No, I think...
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.200]   Wow, this one of those things I'll put it in the closet.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.360]   I have thrown away so much money on Kickstarter.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.760]   And this is a privy example, Jeff.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.920]   You don't even remember the name of it.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.480]   You thought it was a good idea.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.920]   And you don't even remember the name of it.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.920]   They got your money.
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:41.920]   Oh, no.
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:42.920]   The board's too late.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.920]   The board's gone.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:44.920]   They got your money.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.920]   It's too late.
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.920]   It's over.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.920]   We're going to take a break.
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.200]   Jeff Jarvis, Gina Trapani, Aaron Newcomer here.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.960]   We're talking about Google, the cloud, Facebook.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.120]   And yeah, a little Apple too because Apple's announcements.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:00.360]   Actually, there's a really good article on the Verge about comparing Chrome and Safari
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.240]   on the new MacBook Pro Retina.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:07.960]   And it just shows you everybody, including Chrome, have to update now to support this
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:08.960]   high resolution.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.640]   There was an article in the Wall Street Journal, like I said.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.440]   Businesses, CIOs, watch out.
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.520]   Don't let your employees get these new displays.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:22.480]   They'll suddenly be watching high def video all the time.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:23.480]   Jeff, what are you at?
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.920]   You're at a postage conference?
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.520]   What is that all about?
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:29.320]   We lost him.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.760]   He's a quick street.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.760]   A guy in the industry named John Callen, a delightful, wonderful nice guy.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.960]   By the way, there's a lot of our fans here.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   Good.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   There's fans here.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.160]   So they'll be watching.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:41.760]   So John read my book, What Would Google Do?
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.040]   And tried to apply that to the Postal Service.
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.360]   What would Google do if it was on the Postal Service?
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.640]   And the head of the Postal Rate Commission, Ruth Goldway, happened to answer a question
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.960]   at a conference just that question.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.720]   What would Google do if it was on the Postal Service?
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.880]   And she said Google would buy everyone in the country, every home in the country.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.760]   A computer and a printer.
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.760]   Yes, mini-tell.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.760]   Right.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.760]   Right.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:06.080]   And so it led to, I helped last year a little bit more than this year, but organizing, John
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.240]   organizing a conference of trying to get all the people together, trying to figure out
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.720]   what the future of the Postal Service is.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.560]   This is the second one this year talking all about the Postal Service as a platform.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.880]   What should that be?
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.880]   What should it be enabling?
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.880]   That's fast.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.960]   A lot of discussion was really fascinating.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.560]   More of the experts who were on one of the panels I ran, really, really smart guys, I
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.880]   asked them, what's the opportunity?
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.120]   And the four things were control of the address structure.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.120]   Aye.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.240]   Time, you know, you're named to an address where you can reliably deliver.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.920]   Number two is big data.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.080]   Number three is e-commerce.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:44.160]   The post of Hong Kong has places where small businesses can come in and very easily send
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.760]   to things, not just receive.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.720]   And four is trust and privacy.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.200]   Yes, there you go.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.440]   You talk about authentication, the Postal Service.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.440]   Exactly.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:55.960]   Some danger there, you know, I don't want to have a national identity card that we have
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.600]   to use for the internet, but you do want identity for things like all these transactions
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.800]   that we just talked about and all that authentication.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.920]   I think they've said, yes, this is really you.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.200]   The USPS has been talking about signing and stuff like that, right?
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.000]   I mean, I think they've been involved in this.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.640]   Yeah, but the Postal Service is, you know, in terrible financial straits.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:22.240]   The Postmaster General spoke here yesterday and said straight out that it's Greece, which
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.240]   is pretty serious talk.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.960]   But so it's this weird thing.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.400]   John Callan brought me into it.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.240]   You know, what the heck do I know about Postal Service?
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:31.240]   What a fascinating.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:37.160]   It's a fascinating discussion about another industry in great disruption that should be
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.920]   a platform for a lot of innovation.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:48.880]   And here, one of the vendors mentioned, you don't want me from this, as an entirely new
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:55.080]   way to do indicia and to do selling of stamps in terms of going into the post, having to
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.720]   go into the post office.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.640]   And do we need 35?
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.560]   Oh, he's fading in and out.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.360]   I'll see what the council says to you.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:10.640]   Patterson says he wants the Postal Service to deliver cold milk and eggs.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.160]   And then soon they'll be delivering shampoo.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.880]   And oh, wait a minute, that's the milk man.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.960]   You know, I do think the Postal Service is clearly sees an opportunity within indicia.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.320]   That was, that's the, the ability to print postage yourself.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.480]   And that's where stamps.com, our sponsor actually, in fact, I'm going to do a stamps commercial
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.480]   right now, really has a leg up.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.960]   They've been doing postage, printing postage, not a postage meter.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.240]   We're not talking Pitney Bose here.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.160]   We're talking your computer, your printer, no special links.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.840]   You print postage right on the envelope.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.080]   If you want, you could print stamps.
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:45.400]   You can actually buy blank stamps and you print on there, print on a piece of paper
[00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.880]   and tape it to the box.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:54.760]   Stamps.com, it's how they work with the post office so that you can buy and print US postage
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.000]   with what you've already got.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.160]   They even offer a USB scale so that you're always using exactly the right postage.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.120]   They've got a lot of really neat solutions.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:07.720]   Plus the Postal Service like stamps.com so much they offer you discounts.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:13.200]   You can't get it, the post office, up to 21% on Express, mail and up to 15% on Priority
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.720]   Mail.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:21.040]   They make it easy to mail packages of any size of mail care come and get it free.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.360]   You can even schedule free pickups.
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.080]   The post office loves stamps.com.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:28.360]   It's really a solution for them and I think this is a great solution for you if you're
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.160]   a small business.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.160]   Lots of good features.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.960]   In fact, if you are a heavy user, you don't even have to pay anything for this service.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.960]   It is so great.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.960]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:42.840]   We've got a special no risk trial offer if you go to the stamps.com website.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.840]   Now wait a minute.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.480]   Before you click that, see the $80 offer?
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.480]   Don't click that.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.820]   Click the microphone above it.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.600]   This is kind of a trick.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.320]   And use the offer code TWIG, T-W-I-G.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.000]   That's how they know it was us.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.080]   And they're going to offer you, "Oh, there's my smiling face."
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.280]   If you don't see my face, don't buy it.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:03.080]   If you see Adam Corolla's face, it's not for you.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:11.360]   You get a $110 bonus offer, $55 in postage coupons, the digital scale, USB scale, you
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.680]   just pay shipping and handling on that.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.800]   I think it's $5.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   There is the details.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.800]   Read the details too.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.520]   If they get the supplies kit, the month trial, this is a great offer.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.520]   I really like it.
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.920]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.000]   Stamps.com, click the radio microphone.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.720]   Use the offer code TWIG.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.800]   And try this for 30 days.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.200]   I think you will be very impressed.
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.360]   I know if you're an Amazon or eBay seller, you're going to just love it.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.880]   It's the only way to fly.
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:43.120]   And you never have to go out and go to the post office against Stamps.com.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.120]   Are you back, Jeff?
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.120]   It's funny.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.120]   When it's good, it's great.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.800]   It's just, yeah, I think somebody comes in and makes a phone call.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   How dare they?
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.080]   It's network congestion.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.280]   Network congestion.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.880]   Thank you, Chad.
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.520]   Chad's calling me back.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.520]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.520]   That works.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.160]   We're used to doing that.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:06.320]   It's amazing what we do to keep this network on the air.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:07.320]   Spit there.
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.320]   What you're calling?
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.680]   Yeah, it really is.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:15.320]   If you saw the basement, you don't understand.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.760]   Apple's going to add integrate Facebook and Twitter.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.400]   We've had that for a long time on Android.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.760]   In fact, we've had everything.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:26.320]   I've got Pinterest, pinboard, anything with a pin in it, I've got integrated.
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.320]   I could share.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.120]   The only negative on Android is my sharing list is so long.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:34.600]   Sometimes I have to scroll a long way because it integrates with everything.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.080]   There's an advantage Android has by being open.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.080]   Yes.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.080]   It just works with everything.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.680]   Something I really miss.
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:46.560]   Apple is, let's say, stealing the notification system that Android has.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.560]   It's so good.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.560]   You wanted for ages?
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.560]   That's on the desktop, actually.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.360]   They're going to do it too on the desktop.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.560]   They liked it so much.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.920]   Yeah, I mean, the convergence of iOS and Mac OS X is very interesting to watch that happen
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:01.920]   slowly.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.080]   That notification center looks exactly like it does on iOS.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   It does.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.080]   And it's on your desktop now.
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.560]   It's amazing.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.920]   And the Growl has been Sherlocked, unfortunately.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.120]   I feel bad about that.
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:14.600]   They're going to add, this is really interesting.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.720]   They're going to add cellular calls to FaceTime.
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:23.200]   Now you can do that with Skype and Tango, but to have it built in to the OS, to the point
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.720]   where you go to a contact, and now-- and it's actually been this way for a while, but
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:31.320]   the button's always said call, FaceTime, message, or email.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.560]   And now, it doesn't matter if you're on cellular, you can still do it.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.120]   And I think that that's interesting.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.640]   I don't know how they got the carriers to go along with that.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.640]   Well, it's easy.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.280]   They're charging people for bits, right?
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.440]   The carrier's probably--
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.440]   Well, yeah.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:48.840]   But I think the issue was all of those people, and I'm still one of them with unlimited data
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.840]   plans on AT&T.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.920]   Oh, you're going to be a dodo bird too.
[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.920]   I know.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.920]   I'm on the tour.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:55.920]   I'm on the new plan.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:37:00.160]   I could feel that the laser targeting on my forehead.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:06.240]   And Google's obviously had some form of this with G-Talk and doing phone calls.
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.200]   And Google Voice to some extent.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:13.840]   I think what Apple fans say, and I might be one of them in this case, is that, yeah,
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.080]   okay, but Apple's going to do it nicely and elegantly.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.200]   And with Android, it's always kind of a little bit of a cluge and a little bit difficult
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.520]   to figure out how it works.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.520]   That's not wrong.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.520]   It's not.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.520]   Right.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.520]   Apple creates beautiful, simple user experiences, right?
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.520]   Yep.
[00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.520]   They get the UX down.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.520]   Yep.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.160]   So, well, so is this unfair?
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:38.000]   Apple tends to take the ideas from Android and it burnishes them, and then Android learns
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.320]   how to burnish back.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.320]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.280]   I think there's-- it's complete cross-polarization.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.360]   It's not a one-way street.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:48.640]   Just as Microsoft took the recycled bin from Apple's trash can.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:52.480]   I mean, and this is all good for users because it just makes everything better.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.480]   Right.
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.480]   I mean, Apple may try to sue.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.120]   In fact, they tried very hard to keep the Samsung Galaxy S3 out of the US.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:04.280]   They're asking the International Trade Commission to actually block it.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.280]   And I know why.
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.600]   It's a really good phone, probably better than an iPhone.
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.840]   And so, it's not that it infringes.
[00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.280]   It's that it's too good, in my opinion.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:20.360]   I know John Gruber and MG Seagler will disagree, but I happen to think the Android phones are
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.360]   better.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.360]   I thought it was interesting.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.000]   Some of the-- I'm not an iPhone user, so some of this was new to me.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.960]   But I was really surprised, like, unique account signatures for email.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.960]   I know.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:30.960]   I was like, what?
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:31.960]   You don't have that?
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.840]   And then another one was, like, I guess you can't attach things.
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.480]   I'm a total noob when it comes to iPhones because I really don't like them.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:42.240]   But you can't attach things in email, apparently.
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.200]   And now you can at least attach a photo.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:48.840]   No, it's the handling of the attachment, I think, once you get it, right?
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.160]   You can't do it from with--
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.160]   From within the email.
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.000]   From within email, but you do it from a third party.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   So you have to go from the--
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.800]   Yeah, in the photo app, you can attach a photo.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.800]   --to email, exactly.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:01.400]   But you can't attach, like, a PDF or other things, apparently.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   And I guess they're changing--
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:03.720]   Apple locks down the file system.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.800]   I mean, that's really the key-- the secret of what Apple is doing.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.960]   I mean, to me, that's crazy.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.440]   How do you expect to get worked on on your phone?
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:14.160]   If I can't send a copy of my presentation to somebody that I'm working with or a PDF
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.640]   of something that I'm working on to somebody else, so anyway, I found some of those things
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.040]   to be really interesting.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.040]   Really interesting.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.040]   They didn't have a wedding.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.760]   To me, that's a design decision.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.120]   And I understand the design decision.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.480]   I'm looking at Apple's mail app in the iOS.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.680]   And there's just four buttons.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.760]   It's very simple, right?
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.480]   And the more features you add, OK, now you're going to add a paperclip, that's the fifth
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.480]   button.
[00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:38.160]   And so I think that that makes sense.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.200]   And Gina, you're a software designer, so I know you--
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:45.840]   --this is a constant decision, a trade-off decision between simplicity and functionality.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:47.560]   It definitely is.
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:52.840]   My other favorite moment was we are going to merge the search box and the address box
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.840]   for Fari.
[00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.080]   So you just type something into this in one place.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.280]   The last browser's not to do that.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.320]   I mean, really, really.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.080]   The very last browser not to do that.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.080]   That's innovation.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.120]   But I mean, I'm really glad.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:13.080]   I'm glad because I still type search terms that are Fari's address bar.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.520]   Yes, constantly.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:19.240]   And for some reason, I'm not fully sure of Chrome does not work very well.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.880]   And Mac and Tasha's, you kind of--
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.440]   Not all of them.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.440]   Not all of them.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:29.640]   But for some reason, on some of my Macs, Chrome is like slow as molasses.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:30.640]   Wonder why that could be.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:31.640]   I wonder.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:32.640]   No, you're using Chrome, right?
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   No, I'm not.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.640]   Got a bunch of tabs.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.400]   I'm using Chrome, but I'm using it under Linux.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.400]   Oh, you're in Linux.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.400]   Linux on my MacBook Pro.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.040]   Which is so everybody knows.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.760]   Aaron looks like he's using the white apple.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:43.760]   Right.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.760]   That should really be--
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.760]   There we go.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.760]   Yep.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.760]   I got this from work.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.760]   And they said, hey, this is really cool.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.760]   We hear.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.760]   So I have one.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.760]   I was like, oh, great.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.920]   Let me install Linux on it as soon as I get it home.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.920]   Wow.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.520]   Did you wipe back Mac OS?
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.440]   I didn't wipe it only because I want to be able to go out and get hardware updates
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.440]   or software updates.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.440]   Right.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.920]   If there's something, a driver or something that's not working--
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:03.920]   That's right.
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:04.920]   Firmware won't be updated unless you have OS.
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:05.920]   Right.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:06.920]   Exactly.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.920]   But you know what?
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.880]   I've been running Linux on this since I've had it, and I have not been disappointed.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.880]   I've been able to get it.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.880]   It works great.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.440]   And that does not look like Ubuntu.
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:16.440]   What is your--
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.440]   It is.
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.440]   It is actually Ubuntu.
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.640]   You're not running that new shell that Ubuntu has.
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.080]   No, I could be.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.080]   This actually is--
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.080]   It's not Unity.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.600]   It's-- I took Unity on.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:25.600]   I'm not crazy about Unity.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.600]   I can't stand Unity.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.120]   So what are you using for your desktop?
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:35.280]   So this-- I'm using-- actually, I'm going back to the Gnome 2 compatible shell with this.
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.120]   And I recommend Linux Mint to anybody.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.360]   Because it has Gnome, and it doesn't have Unity.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.360]   Exactly.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:45.640]   It's based on Gnome 3, but their shell is so much easier and better to use.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.640]   Yes.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.640]   I totally agree with you.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:48.640]   So anyway, Linux Mint-- sorry to get off topic.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.640]   No, I took you off topic.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.640]   All of that.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.640]   There's no such thing as being on topic.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.280]   It just brings me so much great pleasure that we're talking about WWDC, and you're running
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.720]   Unix on your Mac.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.720]   I love that.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.720]   Let's have that coverage.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.720]   I love that.
[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.720]   Well, and I'm the fan.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.720]   That's a big fan.
[00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:08.720]   I'm the consumer who actually-- the minute they announced that Retinat bought one.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:09.720]   And it's--
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:10.960]   Of course you are.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.120]   I got all excited because I got an email from Apple this morning.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.800]   It turns out the notebook's not on its way, but the MagSafe Adaptive that will allow me
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:22.000]   to use older adapters on the new MagSafe connector is.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.360]   So I'll be getting that tomorrow anyway.
[00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.640]   We'll do it unboxing.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:31.040]   Andy Rubin, whoa, laid a bombshell, right?
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:35.040]   You know, you kind of think there was a concerted effort on Google's part to do the best they
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.160]   could to kind of throw some water on the Apple bonfire.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:42.240]   They knew that the WWDC conference was coming up last week.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.520]   They did their maps, events, they didn't know what we're doing.
[00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.080]   They wanted to make sure they announced that stuff before Apple made its announcements.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.920]   They were right to do so.
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:53.760]   There was a lot less ooh, and a nine on the 3D feature for instance because Google had
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.920]   announced exactly the same thing three days earlier, or five days earlier.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:05.880]   But Andy Rubin tweeted also last week conveniently as a pretext using the fact that Scoble had
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:12.960]   tweeted or Google-plused a room, a completely bogus rumor that Andy Rubin, the Android
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:19.000]   head at Google, was going to leave for a startup called CloudCar.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.040]   In fact, Rubin then used that as an excuse.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:27.280]   No, I'm not leaving an oh, just to make sure the meme is complete.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:31.720]   There are over 900,000 Android devices activated daily.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.720]   Daily.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.480]   That's amazing.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:40.680]   And then drilling down on that, I think some people thought, "Oh, well he must mean reinstall."
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:45.960]   No, these are activations where they're going to a phone company and saying, "I'm signing
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.600]   up."
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:48.600]   So that's real.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.280]   I mean, that's not a bogus number.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:52.640]   That's an amazing number.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:54.400]   That's almost a million a day.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:57.400]   Does that include people fires, by the way?
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.360]   No, I'm sure it doesn't because they don't say it's an Android device.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:01.360]   I don't know.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:02.360]   That's a good question.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:07.360]   It did.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.360]   I can't be more than a few thousand.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.360]   True.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.360]   I don't even know how you can get to 900,000 a day.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.360]   What's wrong, Masgar?
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.360]   Are there other devices we're not thinking of that are powered by Android?
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:23.360]   Well, it's got to include a bunch of inexpensive Android devices in the underdeveloped world.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.360]   Right.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.360]   Right.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.360]   When I was in Korea, you didn't see iPhones.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:31.360]   You saw Samsung Notes.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:35.160]   You saw new phones and lots of them.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:41.000]   They say, though, that this does not include Wi-Fi tablets because they're not hooked up
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.760]   to an account.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:50.200]   So there may be many, many more devices out there.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.080]   I find it hard to believe, but I believe it.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.080]   I don't think he's lying.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.840]   I'd love to see a breakdown on this.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:58.840]   I'm not sure.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.840]   I'm not sure that there's some way they could hide the numbers so they didn't give away
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:06.960]   too much information, but just show how does this breakdown per country, per device type?
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.440]   I'd love to see a breakdown because just so many.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.800]   They don't want to show that.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.840]   It would be a fragmentation evidence.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:14.840]   Right.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:15.840]   Absolutely.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.840]   Yep.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:17.840]   That makes sense.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.840]   I love the picture on the Verge, too.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:24.840]   I don't know how they got that picture of the rumor that he was leaving.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.840]   They got this picture of him saying, "Look, here's my phone."
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.840]   What is that phone?
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:29.840]   Is that a Nexus?
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:30.840]   It looks like a Nexus.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:31.840]   Yeah, I think it is.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.840]   It's a Galaxy Nexus rather.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.840]   Aww.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.840]   I'm not using Google.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.840]   I love Google.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.840]   I'm still here.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.840]   I love Google.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.840]   We're getting excited about Google I/O.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:47.360]   Apple's had its developer conference now in a couple of weeks, Google I/O.
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:51.520]   Kevin Marks asked, by the way, if he can have your ticket, Jeff, do you mind?
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:52.520]   It's not to me.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.520]   It's not transferable.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:54.520]   I would love for him to have it.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.520]   Just go to the press, folks.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:56.520]   All right.
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.520]   We'll go to the press, folks.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.520]   Yeah, let them know.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.120]   And say, we want to send a different correspondent, Kevin Marks.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.520]   It's got to be the thing to do, yes.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.880]   You ever hear of him?
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.440]   You might remember him.
[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.160]   He used to work for you.
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.640]   You'd think Kevin could get into Google I/O.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.640]   Oh.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.280]   We're crying out loud.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.240]   Anyway, we'll talk to the press people.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:22.720]   3.7 million Android activations on Christmas Day and New Year's Day.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.560]   That was last year.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.800]   100,000 daily now.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.880]   Pretty soon the whole world will be using Android phones.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:34.640]   I mean, don't you run out of people at some point?
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.080]   30 million a month?
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.760]   There's a lot of people.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:39.760]   There's a lot of people.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:42.480]   There's a few OS Leo for the phone that's in a Ford.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.480]   Microsoft.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.480]   Actually, it's Windows CE.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.480]   Right, of course.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:46.480]   It's Windows, right?
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:48.760]   But now that was another interesting -- boy, was that an interesting one?
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.880]   And I had to say, I was gulping a little bit because Apple announced that they were making
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:47:00.840]   deal with everybody but Ford, including Mercedes, General Motors, Chrysler, Honda, Toyota, to
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.080]   put a Siri button on the steering wheel.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.600]   Ford got Sherlocked.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.400]   Because I mean, basically, if you put an iPhone in a car and put a button on the steering
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.560]   wheel, you've got Ford Sync.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.200]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.320]   Now, of course, you have to have an iPhone.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:21.520]   But if you're buying $100,000 Mercedes, I think they should throw the iPhone in.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:23.520]   Frankly.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.520]   I mean, they'd sell more.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.520]   What?
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.520]   It's an iPhone.
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.520]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:29.520]   They'd sell more.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.520]   They probably would sell more.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:35.760]   Just building the price, guys.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:39.840]   So is Apple just abandoning their relationship with Google?
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.240]   Is it really all over now?
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:43.240]   This is kind of the maps thing.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.800]   That kind of does it, right?
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   It's --
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   Well, I think it's the maps thing.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.160]   It's the Facebook stuff that they announced.
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.720]   Obviously, Facebook kind of has it in a little bit for -- it's one of their --
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:54.720]   I guess that was bad news.
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.480]   They didn't mention Google plus integration.
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.480]   Right, exactly.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.480]   You know?
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.080]   So I mean, I think all of these things, you know, and starting with the -- you know, there
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:08.480]   was an article on Wall Street Journal about this actually about how really most of what
[00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:13.520]   Apple announced is about taking down -- or trying to compete better with Google.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.600]   And I think that is what it's all about at this point.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:23.880]   As Scott Forstall pointed out that Apple iPhone users are far more satisfied than Google Android
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:29.640]   phone users, 75% of our customers check the top box very satisfied compared to less than
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.720]   50% for the competition.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:36.520]   But that's like saying you're more satisfied with marijuana than air.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:38.000]   You know, it's a drug.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   I like --
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Wow, that's really good.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.440]   Let me think about that.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:47.920]   You mean people are satisfied with the iPhones because they're stoned?
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.120]   Buy it, yes.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:50.120]   Right?
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.680]   It's a cult.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.680]   It's religion.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.680]   It don't come out to me.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.680]   I have it too.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:55.680]   I like it too.
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:57.680]   I got my three Apple products right in front of me here.
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.920]   So I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not dissing you.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.640]   But let's admit that it's far more cultish.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.640]   And --
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.640]   I think the first --
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:10.400]   The first step is admitting that you would have no control over your addiction.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:11.400]   Don't you think?
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.800]   Apple will work with Google products when it suits them, right?
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:17.640]   Google is the default search engine in Safari.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.480]   It's still there, by the way, interestingly enough.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.200]   And will be unless there's a better alternative, right?
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.920]   I mean, the fact that there's not Google+ sharing from the notifications bar.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.840]   I mean, that's just because Google+ just hasn't -- it's not -- I mean, you know, it
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.000]   hasn't had the penetration, right?
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.680]   I mean, if everyone was using Google+ and wanted -- and users wanted Google+, I think
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.480]   Apple would have supported it.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:38.480]   Good point.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.040]   Very good point.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.040]   Your market-driven company.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.120]   Well, I think that's a big part of it, Leo.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.120]   It's what you just said.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:49.240]   I mean, interestingly enough, in this Wall Street Journal article, they say that 58% of
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:52.600]   Apple's revenue in the quarter ending in March came from iPhones.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:56.920]   So, I mean, that's their biggest revenue generating profit right now.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:01.360]   And then if you look at the smartphone distribution, 59% of global smartphone shipments in the
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.200]   first quarter were Android.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.000]   So I think, you know, for Apple, they see the writing on the wall.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   They're threatened.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:11.600]   Just like they were with Microsoft back in the day, maybe not, you know, they were the
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.600]   underdog back then.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.040]   But, you know, I think that they really feel threatened by the potential that Google has
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:21.720]   in this -- and what they're actually demonstrating and showing they can do in the marketplace
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:22.720]   now.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:27.680]   Mike Elgin pointed out something that I noticed has been happening with me on Facebook on
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.680]   the mobile platform.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.000]   I don't know if it's happening on the desktop platform.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.200]   Facebook has become more of a walled garden when you click on external links.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.440]   And maybe this was a bug.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.960]   I don't know if it's gone now.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:41.720]   But when you're in the Facebook mobile app and you click on any external link, including
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:47.280]   Google+, as Mike points out, you get a warning saying security a link alert.
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.760]   This link may not be safe.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:55.000]   You are about to leave the safe environs of Facebook world.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   There are unwashed masses out there.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Be careful.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.800]   I got to try this and see if it's still doing it.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.840]   When I -- when that happened, I was offended.
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:03.840]   It wasn't just Google.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.360]   It was anywhere on the free and open web.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:12.880]   My co-founder, Aneel wrote this great piece called Facebook is gaslighting the web.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:18.120]   And that was one of the things that he brought up is that Facebook instills this distrust
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:21.640]   of any link that goes outside Facebook by default.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.960]   I think that that's probably a bug though.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:27.000]   I think there are some folks from Facebook who came out and said, "Oh, this was a bug.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.640]   We didn't -- you know, this shouldn't pop up for every link."
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.560]   Don't they test anything at Facebook?
[00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:33.560]   Seriously.
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:39.160]   If you move fast and break things, that's how Zuck does it.
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.160]   Oh my God.
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:43.080]   You would think somebody would have noticed that.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.080]   I don't know.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:47.200]   Was it a bug or do they wait and wanted to see what the reaction would be?
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   No.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:52.280]   But anybody that's so silly, they're not really going to say they don't really believe that.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:56.200]   I don't think it's not worth the tourists that go through.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.200]   Nope.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.200]   I just got it.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.200]   Okay.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.000]   So I'm scrolling through my Facebook.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.920]   This is on mobile through my Facebook news feed.
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.920]   I saw a great article by M.G.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:11.520]   Seeker I wanted to read on his website, Parislemon.com.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.840]   Please be careful.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:18.000]   For the safety and privacy of your Facebook account, remember to never enter your password
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.200]   unless you're on the real Facebook website.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:26.120]   And be sure to only download software from sites you trust.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.080]   Sincerely, your friends at Facebook.
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.240]   No, I added that much.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:34.280]   Facebook is actually making another interesting change to their API, which is affecting me
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:40.320]   at ThinkUp, which is that when you authorize an application to access your Facebook data,
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:45.280]   that token, that privilege only expires now after 60 days.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.800]   So you can't say this app has access to my Facebook data forever.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.200]   No, you're constantly asked for a relaunkin.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:53.800]   You're constantly asked for relaunkin.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:56.040]   So every 60 days max, it can be shorter.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.640]   You have to ask the user to reauthorize.
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:02.360]   I just clicked a link to Ford Motor Company.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.320]   Please be careful.
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.160]   For the safety and privacy of this is not a bug, Gina.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.400]   Maybe it thinks you're nine years old, Leo.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.760]   Danger, danger, stranger, danger.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.840]   It's almost like they got their whitelist and their blacklist mixed up or something.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:20.480]   But I'm telling you, this is on the Ford Motor Company fan page.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:21.480]   All right, try to try to.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.880]   You want to lose general motors.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.880]   You want to lose Ford?
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.000]   Do start doing that.
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.800]   These page links stop working.
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:30.680]   You're going to have some very angry people.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.680]   Try to go to Microsoft, Leo.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.120]   A friend of theirs.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:34.760]   I think it works on everything.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:38.520]   And maybe it is a bug, but it's a long lasting bug.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.680]   The microed about this how long ago?
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.680]   Hours ago.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.680]   I'm trying to find a Microsoft link.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.680]   You know, that's the problem.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.880]   It's only whatever is in my news feed.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:52.800]   Boy, that's just shocking.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.880]   This is Spotify.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:54.880]   That's a partner, right?
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:55.880]   Well, Apple's there.
[00:53:55.880 --> 00:53:57.800]   Oh, even worse.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:58.800]   Please be careful.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:01.080]   Yeah, this is terrible.
[00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:03.080]   Oh, so welcome to the walled garden.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.080]   Now that's on the mobile.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:07.480]   I don't think it's doing it on the desktop.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:10.600]   But boy, that's AOL 2.0, isn't it?
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.000]   Please be careful.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.680]   You know, it's dangerous out there.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.720]   And we love our friends at Facebook.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.360]   Yeah, it doesn't do it.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.360]   It's interesting.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:20.360]   It does not do it on the desktop.
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.800]   Sounds a little bit like a bug.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:26.400]   Undertale wrote his post, Facebook engineer said, you know, I work on the Facebook on
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:31.480]   the team that, you know, the team that generates the warning and the question, the site integrity
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.520]   and this warning appears to be a bug.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.960]   This is a while back.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.440]   I was still doing it.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:39.640]   I'm going to email the Facebook guys right now.
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:45.040]   By the way, and we had last week we bashed Facebook for killing the weather minds or actually
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:49.160]   it was, it was not weather minds, but it was his James Spann's individual site.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:50.760]   And it did go back in 18 hours.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.080]   And they said, we should reiterate this.
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:56.840]   You had a conversation and we just complete error and they fixed it as quickly as they
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:57.840]   could, which they did.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:54:59.160]   They fixed it within 12 hours.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.160]   And this has happened to school.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.160]   Well, it happens all the time.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:05.120]   It's just, you know, that I don't mind so much about.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.680]   But I think so, and some of our chat rooms reporting this is now works on the desk.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.560]   This is happening on the desktop as well.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.960]   So maybe it's all this.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:21.680]   What is this security warning when we click on links from within Facebook?
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:26.480]   See I'm getting a direct link out to the web for me on the same link that I did not
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:27.480]   work on mobile.
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:28.480]   So maybe it's just mobile.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:29.480]   Maybe it's just Android.
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.480]   I don't know.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.320]   Yeah, I can't reproduce this on the desktop.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.320]   All the links are going on.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.320]   We're trying on iOS.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   Oh, well.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.960]   It could very well be.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:42.840]   And I think this is kind of well within Facebook's kind of MO that they thought, well, let's
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.120]   just see what the reaction is.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:48.080]   We can always call it a bug.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:54.200]   If I've emailed Elliot Shrag and Andrew noise for Elliot every Wednesday.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.720]   I get an email.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.240]   Guys again, he was glad we asked.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.520]   No, and I was glad to give his response.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:03.960]   That's nice that they gave a response.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.800]   Maybe it's just me because this is another.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.760]   Yeah, no, no, and they responded very quickly.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.840]   Guys were the people who knew were all off at an offsite.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:15.000]   So they gave you a responsibility and they came back the next day after they verified
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.520]   and talked to people and said, you know, it was a mistake.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.520]   Sorry.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.520]   This is what happened.
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:20.520]   Well done.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:25.280]   So I'm clicking on iOS now to see what happens on iOS.
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.080]   And it may be that it's just me.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.080]   That's another thing.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.120]   I don't know if you're seeing it.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:37.640]   They're not short URLs or they're full links with little thumbnails and all of the above.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:39.280]   It's being very slow right now.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.120]   I'm going to take a break while we know it.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.120]   You know what?
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.120]   It's funny, an iOS.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.480]   Oh, but that was a Facebook page.
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.480]   Let's go somewhere.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.400]   It's not a Facebook page here.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:49.400]   Yahoo.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.600]   Fish oil fail trending articles.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:53.720]   Oh, it's another Facebook page.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:54.720]   Nope.
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:55.720]   Yahoo.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.720]   Let's see if it goes out to Yahoo.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:59.360]   So I did not get that error on iOS.
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:01.440]   So maybe it's just me.
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.040]   Maybe the I'm in a test group.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:07.480]   Are you getting in a Gina on your things are weird and slow.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:09.280]   I'm checking it right now in iOS.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.280]   It's not happening on the desktop.
[00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:14.800]   Let's see if the Ford thing happens because this happened on Android.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:16.000]   I got the error message.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.840]   Maybe there's something I've knows about my.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.800]   Are you using Chrome or the built in browser?
[00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:20.800]   It's in Chrome.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.800]   No, no, no.
[00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:22.800]   I'm using the Facebook app.
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:23.800]   I apologize.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:24.800]   Okay.
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.360]   Anyway, it's not happening to me on the desktop.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.760]   It's a bad idea.
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:29.760]   Right?
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.400]   It is.
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:32.400]   It's a really bad idea.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.960]   Oh, it's clearly a bad idea.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:34.960]   It's a bad user experience.
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.760]   It's not a web.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.760]   It's just bad.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:43.000]   Well, and it makes me, truthfully, it's bad for them because I will not, if I can't click
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.840]   clicks in my news feed without getting that every single time, I'm just going to stop
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:47.840]   using it.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:48.840]   Right?
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.480]   Especially when they're trying to do deals with news corporations to have this.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:57.160]   But I'll come off like a fanboy of the company, but I just can't believe it.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.160]   Here it is on the desktop.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:06.160]   One of our chatroom people said I got on the desktop too.
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:10.480]   The safety and privacy of your Facebook account, and this is a link to the same Yahoo page I
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.480]   tried to go to.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.480]   So that's really weird.
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.760]   A good morning America site.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:17.240]   It didn't happen for me on iOS and the app.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:19.360]   It's not getting it either.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.360]   Something's going on.
[00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:23.160]   It sounds like it could be one, you know, one set of servers.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.160]   Right.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:26.040]   It has a bad version in it.
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.040]   That happens.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.360]   You know, and it's not checking in.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.600]   It has some kind of, you know, blacklist or whitelist.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.600]   It's not checking in.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.880]   I'm just guessing here.
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.600]   And it says, oh, you know, when you fail to do something, then make sure you show a warning
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:38.600]   and it's showing a warning.
[00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:39.800]   It doesn't happen to me on iOS.
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:41.720]   So this is the thing.
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:46.560]   We've got to get better on the net about these things happening and not having a bet.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:49.560]   And you know, right, because there's mistakes are happening right and left.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:53.080]   Yeah, the fact that these guys at Facebook, I mean, they've done some stupid things at
[00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:54.080]   Facebook.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.080]   Let's be clear about that.
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:56.080]   But you know, they'll answer the question.
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.640]   You know, said I'm going to add, said I'm a question.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:58.640]   They'll answer it.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:01.000]   I we're going to take a break and come back with more.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.200]   This is fun. Aaron Nukem is here from the, it's the source show.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:08.720]   Yeah, the source is the name of the podcast and the URL is the source show.org.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:10.440]   That org got it.
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.760]   If you want to know more, and of course, Floss, we, Liki, he's a regular on there and it works
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.320]   for Oracle in charge of big iron.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:19.960]   And I've been on all about Android for, I don't know, four or five times now.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.320]   So I'm a stand in.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.280]   Yeah, he's an Android guy.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:32.040]   Jeff Jarvis here from DC today where he's at the big postal conference and Gina Trappani
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.680]   from San Diego, California.
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.280]   We'll have more in a moment.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:41.360]   But first I mentioned these people traveling all around because sometimes when you leave
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:47.840]   town, you wish you could access your office computers securely, easily, quickly.
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:51.080]   Sometimes you just go home early and you say, Oh, shoot, I forgot to and you don't want
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:52.280]   to turn around.
[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:56.640]   That's when go to my PC runs to the rescue.
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.840]   Go to my PC from Citrix is the best remote access solution out there.
[00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:07.200]   And now now you can use it with your iPad or your iPhone, which is very, very cool or
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.560]   your Android tablet.
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:14.440]   They got an Android app as well because suddenly you're accessing your Mac or your PC, your
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.400]   Windows machine from your portable device.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.680]   I mean, your iPhone and you could do everything you could do at work.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.400]   You could send and receive email.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.080]   You can access network resources.
[01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.200]   They get a keyboard on it and the whole thing.
[01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:32.040]   So if you get that urgent request, Hey, where's your PowerPoint slide or can you put some
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.240]   numbers in this spreadsheet?
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.040]   We're missing your input or the boss calling.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.920]   Hey, did you see my email smithers?
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:41.920]   Where's your response?
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.920]   You don't have to turn around.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.920]   You don't have to go back to work.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:49.600]   You just launch go to my PC on your iPhone, your iPad and you and you take care of it.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.440]   You can receive email, run any program access, any network resource.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.960]   Go to my PC.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.120]   Here's a free 30 day trial.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.480]   See that orange button at go to my PC.com.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.560]   Click it and use the offer code twig.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.560]   I'm sorry promo code.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:06.680]   It's going to be a hard habit to break promo code twig.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:09.960]   See, it even says offer code on the lower third there, by the way.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.320]   Is it a legal thing?
[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.240]   No, I don't know why, but for some reason the sponsor has asked us.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:15.240]   I don't even know if it's Citrix.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.680]   It might be their agency.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.080]   Please could you say promo code?
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:20.080]   I'm a force.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.400]   It's a force of habit because it says promo code on the site.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.440]   I think if I say, I think actually this makes sense.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:29.560]   If I say offer code and you get to the site and it says promo code, you might be confused.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.560]   Do not be confused.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:32.200]   They're the same thing.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.560]   There you go.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:36.600]   I said, I'm going to call it the Leo code.
[01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.400]   Use the Leo code twig.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.400]   You know what I'm talking about.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:43.280]   The promo code there, the field put TWIG and that's just so we get credit.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.280]   That's all.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.960]   So they know where you heard it.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:47.480]   Go to my PC.com.
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.600]   Click the try it free button.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.840]   Use the promo code twig and we thank them so much for their support.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.000]   I've been saying this for a while.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.400]   You know, I got this phone and I love this phone.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.400]   I'm big.
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.400]   I am in love.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.440]   I'm with a Galaxy S3.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.480]   I go to bed with this phone every night.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.000]   I wake up to it every morning.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.960]   Sometimes with my limbs wrapped around it.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:17.160]   And I have to say it's great, but I have to point out also that it is a quad core processor
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.640]   in here.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:24.400]   And I have to ask myself, do I really need four cores in a smartphone?
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.920]   Well Intel now says, no, you don't.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:31.160]   Of course, this is an ARM processor, right?
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:39.320]   Intel says that the current versions of Android make woeful use of Intel's dual core
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.840]   processors.
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.440]   Poor implementation of, Gina, you're going to have to translate.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:50.520]   More implementation of threading technology by the operating system saps any benefit dual
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.400]   core processing brings to a system and could even be detrimental to performance.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:02.320]   He said even ice cream sandwich has a bad thread scheduler that limits the benefits dual
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:07.360]   core ARM processors bring to Intel to Android to phones.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:11.720]   Now remember Intel is trying to get people to use an atom processor.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.200]   And phones.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.520]   Interesting.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.720]   But I do, I have to say, I do agree with them, whether it's a bad thread scheduler or not.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:24.040]   I can't really think of a compelling reason to have four 1.4 gigahertz processors in this
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.040]   device.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.040]   Right.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.960]   Well, you're never going to get four times the amount of processing power just because
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.720]   you have more cores doesn't mean they're usable.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.520]   And I think that's what they're trying to get to here.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.840]   I mean, when I was at Sun, we found this out because we were coming out with something
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.920]   called chip multi threading, which was like 32 cores on a.
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:41.680]   Wow.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:48.960]   And so this was one of the big problems that they had to overcome was the scheduling, the
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:57.120]   thread scheduling in the kernel had to be adjusted to make proper use of that many,
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.920]   you know, multi processing going on.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.600]   So that was something that I know that the engineers worked really hard on and they were
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   able to overcome it.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:05.320]   Otherwise, we would have never been able to put that many cores into a chip.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:11.160]   Well, but also the truth is that you aren't probably running for concurrent processes on
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.160]   the smartphone.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.720]   I mean, you know, yes, you have, you know, when you do the recent apps thing, it shows
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:18.360]   you all the apps you've launched, but they're not really running on Android.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.360]   They're kind of at best in a sleep mode.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.360]   They're not using sleep mode.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.400]   Yeah, they're not using CPU cycles.
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:29.420]   Dealing of multiple processors on a mobile app is it's like an ample the problem is amplified
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.840]   so much because you're switching apps very quickly.
[01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:38.600]   The app has to be responsive to your taps, even when it's, you know, doing making network
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:43.720]   connections, which can also often be slow and often switching from Wi-Fi to data to nothing.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:48.640]   I mean, there's just a lot more going on on your mobile phone than on your desktop computer.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:53.200]   So the writing has to be really great to be efficient and make good use.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.000]   And you know, I would just, I would love to see a third party and objective third party
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   kind of.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   Prove this point, right?
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.200]   Yeah, because Intel, somebody in the chat room said it.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.000]   Soon as Intel has quad core processors for mobile devices, they'll be saying how great
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   they are.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   Right.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.320]   And have these multi core processors if Intel hadn't realized they couldn't get to four
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.280]   gigahertz on a single core.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.760]   And they said, well, I guess we'll put two in and we'll say it's twice as good.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:21.400]   And it's kind of an odd strategic positioning to say, oh, you don't need a good chip.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.400]   Right.
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.920]   Yeah, for Intel it is.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.000]   Now, an aunt tech, thank you, chat room.
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.280]   Again, an aunt tech has a review of the lava Zolo.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.440]   Isn't that that Russian singer?
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.440]   Lava.
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:43.360]   It's a Intel Medfield based phone.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:48.840]   And they're running the JavaScript benchmark and boy, oh boy, it does have the best time
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:52.000]   well over every other phone.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.480]   All these other Android phones in the JavaScript benchmarks.
[01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.000]   Here's browser mark.
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.680]   Also the lava Zolo is tops only bested by the international version of the HTC One X.
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.080]   Which is quad core.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.440]   Which is quad core.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.200]   And I don't see the Galaxy S3 on here.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:21.360]   So how about let's look at low level floating point performance again.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.360]   Very good.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.920]   Except the quad core beats it.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:28.440]   The lava Zolo who's buying this phone?
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.440]   I can't even say it.
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:33.240]   Here is Linpak, which is a scientific benchmark.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:37.840]   And the HTC One quad core phone beats handily.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.920]   Beats the lava Zolo.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:43.760]   So maybe the Intel is not the super.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.520]   But remember the Medfield is not a quad core.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:51.440]   I think that is the Medfield two cores.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:56.680]   Here's a Qualcomm benchmark which presumably would do very well with the Qualcomm chips,
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.680]   the Snapdragon.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:05.000]   Oh, so they left the Snapdragon off and the HTC One again clobbers the rest of these.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.800]   I think you could safely say that at least in these benchmarks which are synthetic.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:13.240]   The quad cores are doing pretty well.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.480]   Do you have enough bandwidth to do much more?
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.200]   Yeah, benchmarks are not.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:26.320]   They're so synthetic that they're doing stuff that you don't actually do on a phone, right?
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.320]   And today we will.
[01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.640]   It can be very misleading.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:36.240]   And again, those benchmarks might be able to take advantage of the quad cores where I
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:39.960]   don't know the whole lot of Android apps that are threaded in the first place.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:40.960]   That allow multi-threading.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:41.960]   Right.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.600]   So I mean, there's a lot of desktop apps.
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:45.600]   Games certainly do this.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.600]   Photoshop.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.640]   They take advantage of those multiple cores.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   But I don't know.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:50.640]   And I could be wrong.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:51.640]   Chat room can correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:56.120]   I don't know a lot of applications yet, at least for Android, that take advantage of
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.120]   multiple cores.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:00.280]   They all run in one core usually.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:03.160]   So your Google TV is getting an update.
[01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:08.400]   Sony and Logitech both updating to 2.1.1 and Honeycomb.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.000]   Actually, Honeycomb, oh, Honeycomb.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   The Logitech refused going to Honeycomb 3.2.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   Oh, oh.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   Oh, Honeycomb.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   It's a great name, Laoze, the operating system.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:26.200]   Now, there is the new Google TV box.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.120]   And that will be Ice Cream Sandwich.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.320]   And we'll have AirPlay like streaming.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:33.680]   I have to say, this is another thing that I really like in the Galaxy S3 is DLNA, which
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:38.560]   is the kind of the open, real version of AirPlay, Apple's AirPlay.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.520]   And I was able to play back music.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.640]   I haven't tried it with video yet, but playback music on to-- I have two DLNA compatible devices,
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.760]   the AV receiver and a little internet radio.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:50.760]   And it was great.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.760]   I pressed the button.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:52.760]   It sees them.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.760]   They're all on the Wi-Fi network.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.760]   And I press play.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:55.760]   And boom, it's playing from the phone.
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.480]   It was really sweet.
[01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:02.320]   I presume when they say the new Google TV box will have AirPlay like streaming, it will
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.480]   be using DLNA.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:10.440]   Allowing Android phones to stream media directly to a TV, however, users will need to run
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:12.400]   a separate app to stream content.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.240]   Mm, that doesn't sound good.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.600]   Is this the Honeywild devices that you guys mentioned?
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   Honeywilds.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:18.600]   Honeywilds.
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:19.600]   Honeywilds.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:20.600]   Arm processor.
[01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:26.480]   They will only be sold in Taiwan, $95 to $120.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.720]   I think that you also have to consider the market.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.520]   And a US device might have a very different feature set, right?
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:39.120]   Yeah, these little USB devices are becoming-- or USB profile devices seem to that.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.160]   They're coming out like crazy now.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.840]   And I think this is one of them.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:45.480]   These devices, they're really small.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:50.120]   They usually have a HDMI plug that you can just plug right into your TV.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.120]   Right.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.520]   And they're running Android 4.0 on an ARM chip.
[01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.080]   It's pretty incredible what they can pass through this thing.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.080]   Like the Android andro stick?
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:58.080]   Exactly.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:09:59.080]   That's one of them.
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:01.320]   So I don't know if these things require MHL HDMI.
[01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:03.200]   This is a new spec for HDMI.
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.200]   It's called MHL.
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:09.440]   It provides power and means that you could-- because Roku is going to do a Roku on a
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.440]   stick that will plug into this MHL port.
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.760]   So I have my onkyo AV receiver has an MHL HDMI port.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:19.080]   So I will order this andro stick.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.120]   It is about the size of a USB key.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:29.480]   Full Android capabilities, multimedia services, Wi-Fi, HDMI plugs right into your TV.
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.520]   I don't-- doesn't say it requires MHL.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:35.520]   Let me look and see on the product page.
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:40.960]   It will work with IR remotes, wireless mouse, mini keyboards with touchpad.
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.840]   And these things are incredible.
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.760]   And they're the size of my thumb basically.
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:45.760]   I mean--
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:46.760]   This looks really cool.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.360]   So wait, but this isn't a Google thing.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.360]   This isn't a Google TV thing.
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.120]   This is an Android on a stick.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.840]   This is better than Google TV.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:55.840]   It's Android 2.3 Gingerbread.
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:59.320]   It's on a Cortex A9 gigahertz processor.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:10.360]   It's got a Mali GPU, 4 gigs of NAND flash built in, built in Wi-Fi 802.11, BG and N.
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:15.760]   The USB port for power supply, HDMI 1.3 doesn't require a MHL.
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.760]   It looks like--
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:17.760]   That one doesn't.
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.760]   I mean, most phones come with MHL.
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:23.600]   And even if you don't have an MHL capable receiver or TV, they're starting to come out
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.600]   now.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.280]   But even if you don't have those, you can get an adapter on Amazon for like $10 at the
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.280]   most.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:31.240]   Yeah, it's like a little-- it's like a tipping tail that comes out of the phone-- out of
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:38.840]   the phone's HDMI or USB port and then has that special-- our HDMI adapter.
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.760]   These things will use DLNA.
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:44.280]   I think this is going to be an explosion of little tiny USB.
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:45.280]   You have one?
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.280]   I've got one somewhere.
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:48.280]   Little explosion of devices.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.080]   This one is called Andro Stick.
[01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.720]   I was trying to get Chrome on one.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.080]   I couldn't do it.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.080]   But you have one.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.080]   It's just no less.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:58.600]   I was trying to get Chrome on on a stick.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.600]   Oh.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.600]   I failed.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.240]   Yeah, there's a bunch of these coming out.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.240]   They're all based on the various arm chips.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:08.880]   You've got to be careful because the nomenclature with arm is a little goofy.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:12.760]   So like arm 7 is more powerful than arm 8.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.360]   You have to be a little bit careful.
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.640]   But there's a lot of these coming out.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:19.160]   And I think it's really great that technology has gotten this small and portable.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.160]   It's amazing.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.160]   It's incredible.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.160]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.160]   It's amazing.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:29.880]   It's like these-- what was the name of that little mini computer that was $40?
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.680]   I want to say that peppermint stick, but it was something like--
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:33.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.680]   Mm-hmm.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.680]   Raspberry Pi.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:36.680]   Raspberry Pi.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.680]   I can't wait to get everyone.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.680]   Government's stink.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.680]   Raspberry Pi.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.680]   There's a definite switch to something developers.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.680]   You should be naming Android operating systems.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:44.680]   Yeah, really.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:45.680]   Raspberry Pi sounds good.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.680]   I don't know what that is, but I'm going to get that.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:49.680]   Mm-hmm.
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:52.880]   I was hoping I would have mine by today to bring it in with me.
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:58.800]   I don't know if you saw-- if you saw our security now earlier today, but Steve Gibson
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:02.880]   was talking about something pretty amazing apparently.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:07.360]   And we had talked before about Stuxnet and the New York Times article saying that was
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:14.640]   an Israeli joint Israeli US spy development to take down the Iranian nuclear enrichment
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.640]   plants.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:18.960]   They were aimed directly at the centrifuges as those plants.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.400]   They were a government cyber warfare weapon from the US and Israel.
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:31.440]   And then we heard shortly after that about a much older ginormous malware called Flame
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:34.040]   or a flamer of a variety of names.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.920]   Christ, I think there were some other names.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:40.440]   20 megabytes in size with a lot of modules.
[01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:45.960]   Last week they had a suicide module and last week command went out to flame installations
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:47.040]   to self-delete.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:55.600]   Well, now researchers have, and I think very convincingly connected flame to Stuxnet apparently.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.400]   It's the same-- they believe the same people wrote it.
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:04.440]   The code is nearly identical in both-- there's a module of code that's identical in both
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.440]   viruses.
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:10.040]   Kaspersky Lab discovered this.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:14.440]   So I think we now know, although I suspected, where flame came from.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:18.960]   And in fact, one of the things-- one of the very interesting revelations was that flame
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:28.560]   is using super sophisticated number theory to create collisions in the hashes or to take
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:30.680]   advantage of collisions in the hashes.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:34.880]   And mathematicians were saying only the top-- the best mathematicians in the world could
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.920]   have crafted this attack.
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:41.400]   These guys are like super good.
[01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:46.680]   I think we know now that they're very busy in Quantico, Virginia right now.
[01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:53.720]   But isn't this-- I mean, here I have fits on this show about China doing evil with hacking
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:56.960]   sites in the US and going after Google and the whole Google fight.
[01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.400]   It really does put us in a terrible arguing position that we do.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.320]   I guess I shouldn't be surprised.
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:07.280]   But I think we just have to drop the thing that holier than thou, oh, you're using cyber
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:08.280]   warfare.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.280]   We would never do that.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.840]   Hell yeah, we'll use it.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.000]   And what the hell's wrong with it?
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.520]   Oh, Leo the hawk.
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.520]   Well, here's your-- OK, here's your choice.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.520]   White were hawk.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.520]   Yeah, I'm a cyber hawk.
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.520]   And here's your choice.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:24.600]   And this was the choice the Bush White House made.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.680]   You know, Vice President Cheney wanted to bomb Iran.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:29.920]   So did Senator McCain.
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.360]   Remember bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb Iran.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.760]   That was their plan.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.600]   Imagine how destabilizing that would have been.
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:41.160]   Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed, created a virus to slow down their nuclear enrichment.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.760]   Wouldn't you rather have that?
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:47.760]   Right, but the next time we get attacked by one of these bad--
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:52.800]   What do you-- Well, OK, so there is, you know, in warfare, we do often make agreements
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.280]   like the Geneva Accords.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:57.240]   Well, we won't use bio-weapons if you don't use bio-weapons.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:01.280]   We'll all agree no civilized nation should use bioterrorism or whatever.
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.840]   Should we be doing that with hacking?
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:05.880]   It's not their internet, it's ours.
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:12.760]   So you and Gina agree that it's bad to use cyber warfare.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.760]   Oh.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.760]   Who puts us in a comfortable position?
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:16.760]   I'll go that far.
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:17.760]   What do you say, Gina?
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:24.760]   I maybe wouldn't have stated it strongly as Leo, but actually Leo, I think I agree with you.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.760]   I mean, I feel like it's a defensive necessity.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:30.760]   Wow, surrounded by hyper-sau--
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.760]   Hawks, cyber-hocks.
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.760]   Well, I mean, what's the fourth vote there?
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:40.760]   Well, I think it's an unfortunate reality of the world we live in, but that way.
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.760]   I mean, it's the reality.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.760]   That's what we are unfortunately stuck with.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:51.760]   People-- computer started coming, virus has followed soon after, and, you know, I would agree with Leo.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:55.760]   It is better than sending the planes over enemy territory.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.760]   So we go from "rayal" politic to "rayal" technique.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:16:59.760]   Why not?
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:04.760]   Now, I admit there's collateral damage as there is in all warfare, and we saw that with Stuxnet.
[01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.760]   It foolishly leaked out.
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:10.760]   It was intended only for these Iranian nuclear enrichment plants.
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.760]   It was propagated on USB sticks, and it leaked out, and it did spread.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:20.760]   And then malefactors who, you know, were non-political took advantage of the code in there.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:28.760]   But I think that we have, clearly with Flame, you can see some very, very, very sophisticated coders at the NSA
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:33.760]   who probably are the best programmers in the world who are writing stuff.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:38.760]   And I'm sure that they will make sure or do their best to make sure that this stuff is very highly targeted.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:44.760]   And look, let me put it in a very specific way that might make it easier to accept.
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:47.760]   If I said to you, Jeff, well, we have a choice.
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:54.760]   We could bomb these nuclear plants in Iran and run the risk of igniting a forest fire,
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:18:01.760]   a wildfire in the Middle East that we can't contain, or we could very selectively inject malware into their system
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.760]   that would break their centrifuges and slow them way down.
[01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:05.760]   Which would you prefer?
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:13.760]   It is the, I don't want to make an equivalency here, but it is the logical version of the nuclear weapon argument
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.760]   that, you know, bombing Japan ended the war earlier.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.760]   Yeah, but this whole bit of kill a lot of people. This did not.
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:25.760]   I agree, I agree, but it's the lesser of evils.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.760]   I just, oh geez, I guess I'm on Pollyanna.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.760]   I just liked, like, I was downstairs at the Postal Conference.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:37.760]   Believe it or not, talking to somebody from the State Department, because they're related to the ITU
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.760]   and they're related to all the stuff going around the world.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:48.760]   And we had a very high, you know, full-lutant conversation about trying to uphold the principles of freedom on the net
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:55.760]   and the net as this tool and fight against nefarious governments doing nefarious things on the net
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:01.760]   and not nefarious governments doing things that will open the door for nefarious activities
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:07.760]   and the political activities and so on. So it's hard to stay above the fray.
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.760]   Maybe it's impossible.
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:13.760]   So, you know, I don't know the right answer, and I'm being overly provocative,
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.760]   but I think it's a very interesting question.
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:21.760]   And certainly cyber attacks can be used to kill many, many civilians.
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:26.760]   If a cyber attack against our electrical grid or our water system or a variety of other things could be
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:29.760]   absolutely as deadly as any bomb.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:32.760]   But I'm also enjoying you as Dr. Strangelove.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:40.760]   I think if the United States, I have to phrase this very carefully, because I don't think, you know,
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:47.760]   it says, "Has any moral supremacy or any right or we, there's no the US, you know, white man's burden or anything?"
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:52.760]   I'm not saying that, but let's say there were a coherent threat to the United States
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:57.760]   and to our security and to our shores, and we decided that the best way to fight that threat
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:02.760]   would be with a cyber attack, not one that kills a lot of innocent civilians,
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:06.760]   but a cyber attack that is very targeted and effective.
[01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:11.760]   I would think that that would be far preferable to a lot of other choices.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.760]   I'm not talking, I mean, why should we use this?
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:25.760]   Okay, so now that I'm going to absurd, I'll continue the absurdity, is a drone attack better than an infantry attack?
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:28.760]   Oh, now we don't have time to get into that one.
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.760]   Yeah, I have to say this opens up.
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:33.760]   This is a very different conversation.
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:39.760]   Don't disagree, but you've got to put things on a continuum somewhere, and that's less.
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.760]   It puts fewer lives at risk.
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:46.760]   I'm a pacifist, and I wish there were no war in killing at all, and I don't think people should kill,
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:53.760]   I don't think there should be war, but I'm also a realist, and I think that there are cases where you do have to fight.
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:58.760]   Yeah, and I read, I was a pacifist until 9/11, and liberal in the foxhole was me.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:20:59.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:00.760]   I agree.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:05.760]   Yeah, well, and I hate to use, I mean, let's use World War II, I mean, let's find women's the last good war.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.760]   Okay, let's say World War II, nobody would argue that.
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:11.760]   I mean, we did, we tried to blow up Hitler.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:15.760]   If you could have successfully blown up Hitler, I think that would have been a good thing.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:16.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:21.760]   And yet nobody wants to acknowledge political assassination as a legitimate tool.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:22.760]   Right.
[01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:23.760]   Right.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:24.760]   True.
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:25.760]   True.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:35.760]   So that's a very difficult realm, and I think it was a mistake to rule out the use of cyber warfare as a tool of the US, of the US foreign policy.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.760]   Okay, all right.
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:38.760]   I think it's a little bit of a bit okay.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:47.760]   Next question, more appropriate to the show perhaps, is were our special wonderful Quantico geeks bad because number one stucks next spread, stucks net spread.
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:53.760]   And number two, it could be tied to the other worm.
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.760]   Did they do a bad job?
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.760]   Well, you know, this is an interesting conversation.
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:03.760]   It is, and I could think of reasons they might have done that on purpose.
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:15.760]   We are, I think it wouldn't be necessarily out of the question that the US government would like our enemies to know that we are capable of this because after all, who has the best computer scientists in the world.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:16.760]   Korea.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.760]   On that note, we're going to take a break.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.760]   We're going to come back with our tool tip and number of the week.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.760]   This is a great conversation.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.760]   Let's table it.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   You know, one of the things we really, what Tom and I really want to do, we want to use the Oxford debate format for some subjects.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:32.760]   Oh, oh, and I think that would be the very first.
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:34.760]   Debate submitted.
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:37.760]   That cyber warfare is a legitimate tool.
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:40.760]   Oh, foreign policy.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:42.760]   Agree.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:43.760]   Would that be fun?
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:44.760]   Oh, that would be fun.
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:45.760]   Yeah, that would be a good.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:46.760]   I like that.
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:48.760]   You've got the right people here.
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:52.760]   Our developers for the software, the effects of the software that they build.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:54.760]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.760]   And what's in what's your more responsibility as a software developer?
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:58.760]   Okay.
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:22:59.760]   Well, we'll put it all off for the debate.
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.760]   Okay.
[01:23:00.760 --> 01:23:02.760]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:05.760]   Our tool tip and number of the week was first a word from ting.com.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:06.760]   We're talking Android phones.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:07.760]   Let me tell you something.
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.760]   It's not just the handset.
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.760]   You've got to get a better cell carrier.
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.760]   And these guys, I love them.
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:14.760]   I love them to death.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:21.760]   It's actually Elliot Noss and his team at the ultimate, well, two cows, the ultimate collection of Windows software.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:22.760]   They used to be there.
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:24.760]   I think they just call it two cows now.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.760]   Elliot came to me last year.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.760]   Said, we want to reinvent cellular companies.
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.760]   We realize it's a terrible experience for human beings.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:34.760]   And there is a better way where you could save money, get very clear billing pay only for what you use.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.760]   Never pay prepayment penalties.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:41.760]   Never pay premium prices for excess bandwidth.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:44.760]   That's ting.com.
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:47.760]   They have real people on the phone.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.760]   There's a no-hole phone policy.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:54.760]   It is just check it out at ting.com/twig.
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:56.760]   You can find it.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:03.760]   They have a little calculator that you just put in your stats, who your current mobile provider is, how many devices you have, what your total is.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.760]   And then you take a look at the ting plans.
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:06.760]   And here's the beauty of it.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:13.760]   This is all just suggestion because no matter what you pick, you could say, I'm going to take extra large minutes.
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:19.760]   That's 2,000 minutes and 2,000 text messages a month and say 2 gigabytes.
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.760]   And I'm going to do three phone, my family's four phones.
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:25.760]   That would in total be $109 for four phones and all of that.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:29.760]   But if I don't use all of those minutes, they give me my money back.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.760]   If I use more, they charge me at the same rate.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:32.760]   There's no penalty.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:38.760]   And I get voicemail, picture and video messaging, three-way calling, caller ID, tethering, and hot spot for free.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:41.760]   It's built in.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:44.760]   I don't have enough time to tell you all of the great reasons you should check out.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.760]   Ting, they use the Sprint service.
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.760]   That's the nationwide Sprint network.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:54.760]   So if you've got good Sprint coverage where you are, Ting will work just as well.
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:56.760]   They've got great phones.
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:03.760]   Now, I should say the way it works because you're not getting a subsidized phone is you're going to be paying a little bit more for the phones up front.
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.760]   But this is the fair price.
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:09.760]   And if you use our show code Twig, you'll get $50 off that device.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:14.760]   Galaxy S2, they have feature phones too.
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:19.760]   The Samsung Conquer, they've got some very nice Android phones.
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.760]   They call them small computers, I love it.
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:25.760]   These guys are geeks and they want to do a better phone service.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:37.760]   They even do, by the way, my five cards, high-speed internet cards, USB and they have the Sierra and the Huawei mobile hotspot.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:41.760]   So I got to tell you, Ting.com/Twig, please, just do yourself a favor.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.760]   Find out about it.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.760]   You're going to love it.
[01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:45.760]   Make it better.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:50.760]   This is the only way to make it better is to patronize a better company.
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.760]   Let the other guys know, hey, there is a better way.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:57.760]   Gina, Trapani, your tip of the week?
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.760]   You got two of them.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   Go ahead and do both.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.760]   Yeah, do both.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:01.760]   Okay.
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.760]   First one is called Blockly.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:08.760]   It's a web-based graphical tool for people who are interested to learn how to program.
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:12.760]   At least people who are interested in learning how to think like a coder.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:19.760]   If you go to it, what is it?
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.760]   It's code.google.com/p/googleblockly, just Google Blockly.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:29.760]   Web-based graphical programming language, users drag blocks together to build an application and then you can output the source code.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.760]   This is so cool.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.760]   This is so cool.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:36.760]   So I can move forward, turn left or turn right.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.760]   So move forward.
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:43.760]   Oh, I see you go down.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:46.760]   Turn left.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:49.760]   And you see it right away, right?
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.760]   So then you can run the program.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:56.760]   If you click on the Run Program button, you can see what you've done, how it works.
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:58.760]   Oh, this is fun.
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:26:59.760]   Okay.
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.760]   This was inspired by Android App Inventor.
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:06.760]   It was a similar kind of whizzy way to put together my Android app.
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:11.760]   There's a lot of loops in there and you can have the little for people who are listening.
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.760]   We're working on one of the Blockly demos.
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:14.760]   This is just a demo.
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:16.760]   It's a maze.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:28.760]   It's a little, the little peg man, the yellow street view guy who's on a map and Leo is dragging and dropping the moves that he should make go forward, go left, go right to make him circle circles a maze and reach.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.760]   I guess the goal is to reach the little Google Maps pin.
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:32.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:33.760]   I think that's a good goal.
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:35.760]   Let's see here.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.760]   It's a great trivial.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:41.760]   But you know what's interesting is you can generate Java code so you can actually see what the Java code you're generating is.
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:45.760]   So that's a good way to learn Java as well.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:46.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:47.760]   Java script, I should say.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:48.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.760]   Java script.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:52.760]   You can export a Blockly program to a Java script Dart Python or XML.
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:53.760]   It's pretty interesting.
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:58.760]   You know, this is just a preview and it's kind of fun, but kind of fun to play with.
[01:27:58.760 --> 01:28:01.760]   But check it out if you're interested in whizzy wig coding tools.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.760]   Yeah, I am actually.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.760]   This is really neat.
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.640]   All right, and your other pick wait, let me just see if my program works. Oh, yeah, let's see run
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.880]   Make in the left
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:28.560]   You can also see you can have as you said
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:34.640]   Logic, so I could actually write that was a very brute force but I could also write
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:40.160]   One of the sense walls and stuff like that. Yeah, I do a while true and make like man
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:44.600]   I go back and forth continuously so you could write a solver a more generalized program
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:46.160]   Yeah, yeah
[01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:51.640]   So my other pick is the new version of four square which came off our iPhone a couple couple weeks ago came out for Android
[01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:54.840]   It's beautiful and I love it. I have to say that four square
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:57.280]   I was in San Francisco this week. I don't spend a whole lot of time there
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:01.800]   I spent the entire time looking at four squares explore tab
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:06.880]   Really emphasize you now. Yeah, it's not a game anymore. It's not check in
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:10.400]   I mean they have those features, but really it's about it's a recommendation engine
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:16.360]   Yeah, and if you got your friends hooked up and what's interesting about the new the new apps layout is that to me it looked very Google
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.920]   Plus ish there's a big emphasis on images
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.560]   Comments and likes are in line. So if you're following people in four square
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:28.720]   I know it learned a lot of people who aren't into look the check-in location the geo apps are you know probably skeptical
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:33.480]   This app is really nice. It's really fast and it's now the experience is the same on Android iOS
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:38.520]   And it's hugely upgraded and I find myself taking a lot more pictures and commenting to my friends
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:40.040]   Hey, let's let's meet up for coffee
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:45.760]   You know kind of making ad hoc plans inside before square app really than anywhere else and fantastic for recommendations
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.120]   for
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:53.560]   You know restaurants or whatever when you're nearby and it works it particularly well when you're in San Francisco during WWDC
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:58.480]   It's much more of a social network than it was before which I think is really interesting
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:03.720]   I mean I could see spending time here now. Yes. Yeah, and they've added likes you can heart people
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:07.560]   You know, it's all my San Francisco friends were like liking my check-ins because like hey, you're in my town
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:11.400]   Which is really funny you can upload multiple pictures and swipe through them
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:14.120]   It's really it's a really nice experience and it's a lot faster
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:18.040]   Which is always four squares like kiddies. Yeah, I mean if you pull out you know a check-in app
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:21.560]   It takes a long time for it to figure out where you are that gets old really fast
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:27.880]   And and this app is is actually is quite fast. Yeah, look here Russell unlocked the flame broiled badge
[01:30:27.880 --> 01:30:33.360]   Bad collector I have a dedicated
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:38.800]   Badges a terrible I'm back on force grid because of this app I have to say
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.240]   Jeff Jarvis your number of the week
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:47.560]   By the way Facebook both people responded to me the one asked for a link the other one asked the time frame
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:53.240]   So they're trying but they don't have an answer yet my number of the week will appropriate to be in at the postal vision 2020 is
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:31:02.800]   168 billion. That's how many pieces of mail the USPS delivered last year and that's down the three billion from the year before
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:06.840]   They delivered to a hundred thirty eight million addresses every day
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:15.640]   228 thousand roots and I mean and two hundred seventeen thousand vehicles in their fleet. That's a little
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:19.200]   Wow is to understand why it costs 40 some cents
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.560]   I don't even know how much it costs to send them a letter. Do you know?
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:26.880]   44 cents by things I say I would even know that I use stamps that come I just prints it
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:31.220]   Yeah, I'm gonna let air I'm gonna give air in the seed the seed my seat to Aaron cuz Aaron
[01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:36.080]   Newcomb has come up with you could take a pic we only have a minute. Let's do it usually do a tool, right?
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:41.840]   So yeah, I'll do a tool this tool is called. I don't know how do you pronounce it griv or g-rive
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.840]   I don't know, but it's basically if you remember
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:48.920]   When Google came out with Google Drive, there was no Linux native Linux client interface
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:53.400]   Yeah, you could use so of course what does the Linux community do they get to work and they build their own?
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:32:00.920]   So this is called griv gr i ve and you can go out and get it. It's on github
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:04.040]   They have a github page. It's griv.github.com/grive
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:10.080]   And so if you're a Linux user and you want to interface with Google Drive and have your documents sync back and forth
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:13.520]   You can now do that with this tool. It's not it doesn't support
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:20.880]   They don't have packages for every version of Linux. There's a PPA you can get if you just search for griv PPA
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:25.800]   You can find PPA is in a bun to term which is a way to get packages on a bun to
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:30.560]   So that you can get that I had to build it myself last night on my server that I run at home
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:35.760]   Actually, it wasn't that bad and it did it worked right away. It's very very simple
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:36.920]   You just go into the directory
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:38.480]   I love that you can use it from the command line
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:45.040]   So you can actually navigate into the directory that you want to sync with and you just type in griv and it sinks automatically
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:47.440]   It does all of the thing it doesn't do it. It doesn't do it
[01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:51.120]   If you want it to do it automatically without intervention user intervention
[01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:55.560]   You have to put it in cron or something like some sort of scheduler, but hey what could be easier than that?
[01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:57.920]   Yeah, exactly everybody can do this to a cron job, right?
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:03.680]   But actually nice the reason I like this is because for people that work on the command line
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:06.720]   It's great and also if you're a script writer if you write scripts
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.920]   Oh having the command line interface there
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:14.760]   Yeah, so like that's the first thing I did was I went into my backup script and edited that to automatically launch griv
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:16.920]   After I run my backup job so it syncs everything up
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:19.400]   So I went into Google Drive this morning and sure enough
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:23.960]   There was a backup of all my my SQL databases waiting there in my Google Drive. So
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:27.040]   This would be good for your server. I'm thinking
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:32.880]   Yep web server or you know if you're just running on your laptop and you want to and you run Linux like I do most of the time
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:37.760]   Go give it a try that the the only downside is that Google will they have committed to
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:43.560]   Developing integrated tool for Linux. So this may get superseded at some point
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:46.280]   Or Google may change their API
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:49.520]   It's always always a possibility in this you know
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:53.640]   There may be some hiccups along the way, but right if you're a Linux geek like I am go give it a try

[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:15.800]   Oh, I don't know why they have a picture of Cameron, but that's okay. So Cameron's okay, too
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:23.700]   He was kind of underappreciated he was yeah, is he the guy who drove the car off the porch? Yeah, yeah, exactly out of his dad's
