[00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.940]   We sent Jeff Jarvis and Stacy in at home for the holidays
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.660]   Because we are gonna do a year and best of just like why we do every year
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.580]   It's a great chance to look back at some of the big stories of the year and some of our best moments in this week in
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.000]   Google with Stacy and Jeff and a bunch of wonderful contributors
[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:34.380]   Let's let's kick things off with the perennial discussion on twig. How is it that Google has screwed up messaging so entirely?
[00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.900]   It is you know what goddamn Google. I'm sorry. I apologize to all the Christians out there
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.220]   But I do want God to actually damn Google
[00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:59.860]   What haven't they destroyed look at the messaging mess and then they and now Hiroshi Lockheimer has a temerity have Gmail
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.500]   We still have Gmail. We still have G mail. We still have Gmail. Yeah, yeah search
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.060]   And search still works
[00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.540]   But there's been reports and you two isn't all that good anymore either. I just saw that yeah
[00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.260]   I'm and I don't know if I agree with that but back to the messaging thing. Yeah, that was a so
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.620]   Run run a Mario in the ours technique. I yeah wrote a it's one of those things where it's like why didn't I write that it was a
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.380]   Great piece. Oh, so good
[00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.980]   But he basically points out first he lays out the case about how Google is complaining that I message is too powerful that they use bullying
[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.340]   they actually
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.260]   Google accused Apple of bullying by by making people who use Android devices green instead of blue
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.780]   Oh, dare they but this is taking off on the Wall Street Journal article
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.340]   Which because there was nothing else to write about the journal suddenly discovered that people who are using the Android messenger
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.220]   Feel left out of yeah
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.900]   messages conversations
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:05.100]   But after but after laying out the case that Google is making against Apple Ron just eviscerates them by pointing out that since
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:14.060]   Apple launched iMessage in 2011 same year they launched Google plus by the way Google launched Google plus Google has launched 13
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.120]   Messaging I think we've used them all she's the only person I ever talked on Aloe with with you Jeff
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:34.020]   runs headline after ruining Android messaging
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.380]   Google says iMessage is too powerful
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:44.040]   Please stop kicking our butts so badly Google failed to compete with iMessage for years and now wants Apple to play nice
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.780]   How many 13 like wow 13 that they've launched in total they've killed a bunch of them
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.240]   Obviously because it's Google but now even today they have eight and they're even incompatible with each other
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.340]   She's so today they have eight messaging solutions
[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:07.940]   But imagine the theater the mind imagine if you will ladies and gentlemen if after seeing Apple launch iMessage in 2011
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.700]   Google launched
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.460]   Google messages in 2000 let's call it 2012 and said this is the only
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.420]   Messaging platform we will ever support it's on will across from on everything
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.420]   It supports all the bells and whistles you can make phone calls you can do this you can do that you can have it on an iPhone
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.660]   You can have it on an Android phone they would completely dominate the space if they had done that
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:38.420]   Right because because iMessage has always been primarily for Apple users. All right. They could have a platform
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.740]   They could have the what's app yeah would have been like what's app yeah and but no they they are so
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.940]   disorganized and
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:54.020]   Visionless that they just couldn't do that so we're also points out because what is we've talked about this at Google saying well
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.220]   Everybody should use rcs if Apple would only add rcs to iMessage is we'd be happy
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:06.660]   He says even if Google could magically roll out rcs rich community rich communication messaging standard
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.140]   rich communication standard it's a poor standard to build a messaging platform on because it's dependent on a
[00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.580]   Carrier phone carriers
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.860]   It's anti-internet it can't natively work on web pages PCs
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.580]   Smart watches and tablets because those things don't have SIM cards you don't have phone numbers the carriers design rcs
[00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:33.220]   So rcs puts your carrier bill at the center of your online identity even when free identification methods like email exist and work on more devices
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:41.420]   Google is just promoting carrier lock-in as a solution to Apple lock-in and unfortunately I have to agree with him on that hmm
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:47.180]   Yeah, but the solution as I intimated a minute ago is for them to have
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.020]   the
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.940]   Have an alternative that isn't lock-in right you know to have something like what's app but from Google they could have put it everywhere
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.700]   This is what they do with chrome chrome has been hugely successful. Yes. Yes
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:08.100]   Just make it free make it available Google benefits because people use it and just have one your leadership question of WordPress step one
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.260]   Yeah
[00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.620]   Yeah, Google is only to only Google hangouts would have worked they were right
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:22.800]   Oronom audio points out that the hangouts is the best thing that best messaging solution that the Google ever came out with and they killed it
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.140]   Yeah, yeah, it was solid
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:32.280]   Wasn't perfect, but it was definitely well the reason messages works one of the reasons messages works besides the fact that's the default
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.060]   Messaging app on every iPhone sold and you can't turn it off
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.860]   The other reason is it degrades properly so it uses the internet for data like WhatsApp
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:48.540]   But it will also use SMS and so you can you can have some assurance that you can I message everybody
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.580]   Yeah
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.380]   And then it has desktop it works
[00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:58.980]   It's it's a very appily thing because you can't use it anywhere else and and it's it's actually very secure and it's secure
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.700]   Apple knows what you're doing, but other than that it's secure. Well, I don't think even Apple
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.340]   Well, I mean theoretically they could find out what you're doing, but it's like it's it's heavily encrypted
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.780]   So the third party is gonna it's a it's a hell of a lot better than most stuff
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:20.220]   Yeah, if and Google I used hangouts for a long time because it worked on my iPhone it worked on my Android phone
[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:26.340]   It worked on my desktop Android messages will kind of do all of that I have it on all those places
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.620]   But it's not as good as hangouts. Yeah hangouts was definitely the solution for our family
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.980]   Yeah, because we could use it everywhere. So no no you can't bitch
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.700]   What was their rationale for screwing it up? What can you imagine what went through their heads?
[00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.540]   Ron wrote a long or somebody did ours had a long a
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.820]   25,000 word history yet was run history
[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.500]   Google's messaging and I did that once - I wrote I wrote something like that for computer world
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.220]   And by the time it was published it already was out of date
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:03.180]   So it's fun if you go through all the different apps
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:08.140]   Google talk Google voice Google wave Google buzz
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.620]   slides disco
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:17.460]   Google I don't know what that is. I don't know it's in the article the Google plus era Google plus Hangouts video
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.380]   Chat the first Hangouts Google plus huddle messenger
[00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.900]   Huddle
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:31.580]   Google Docs editor chat Google Hangouts Google spaces Google aloe
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.380]   2016 Google's dead on arrival. What's app clone?
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:40.100]   Google duo which I still use with my daughter for video calls Google Hangouts
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:45.380]   Still you meet they renamed it meet YouTube messages Google Hangouts chat
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:52.620]   They renamed it chat Google Maps messages messages. Oh wow. Yeah in night in 2017
[00:08:52.620 --> 00:09:01.620]   He actually says yes, this really was a thing. Yeah Google and RCS Google photos messages Google stadium messages Google Pay messages
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:10.220]   Google assistant messages Google phone messaging Google chat part two and then the last bit is anyone in charge at Google and
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.420]   To answer your question
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:21.100]   The elevator pitch for or the the short version of the answer is that just like Microsoft used to do under Balmer each division
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:27.060]   Has its own messaging app and they don't talk to each other and they're competing with each other and and and there's nobody in charge
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.060]   There's no Steve Jobs. There's no
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:37.060]   Such a Nadella even to say no, this is the one we're doing. That's it period. Everybody. We're putting all the wood behind this particular arrow
[00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:43.460]   Nobody ever did that. I've been maintaining for several years that Sundar Pichai
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.460]   Is a horrible CEO?
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:53.940]   Nobody ever says that but look at the result of what's happened since he took over. It's been a it's all this stuff the closures the
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:10:00.780]   failures the this kind of thing it's this is all getting worse and worse under Sundar Pichai's leadership
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:06.580]   Remember that great cartoon. I agree with you. It was making fun of Microsoft where all the divisions are shooting at each other
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:11.620]   Yes, I have the original on my wall at home actually the artists sent it to me
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.460]   um
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:18.500]   Apparently Google decided that was a good way to do business and they adopted the Microsoft method
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.740]   Meanwhile, Microsoft had the good sets to stop doing that and to kind of at least try to
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.460]   unify themselves
[00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:32.180]   Um, it's I mean it's sad for a long time. This is this this spaghetti throw it against the wall and see what sticks
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:39.460]   Approach was great for Google. They they got some major hits gmail was a 20% project by one engineer
[00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:45.620]   Initially the idea of having advertising was just some engineer had to talk larry and sergé into
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.580]   Doing ads and they were like they were against it and they're like no no we should do ads and so
[00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.140]   For a long time
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:59.540]   Most of the things that were best about google were the result of this kind of like every engineer kind of like spinning up their own thing
[00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.540]   And then we'll try it and see what happens
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:06.980]   but google grew so big and so and they became so successful that they
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:13.940]   Could no longer be that kind of a startup like company and so now you have people betting their businesses on their
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.340]   infrastructure you have all kinds of
[00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:17.300]   uh
[00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.060]   You know billions of people using their products and so you can't have that sort of
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.420]   Scrappy startup. Let's try it and see if it works kind of mentality
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.420]   You have to have a vision about what you're going to do and then you have to execute on that vision
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.660]   And they just can't seem to do it. This is a man who needs the treatment
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.380]   This is man who cornets organizational trees for all the different companies
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:43.300]   Here's microsoft where they're all shooting at each other actually googles is still I think fairly accurate
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.300]   Although this is what that looks like their new building
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:50.820]   Every route of your reports to everybody else
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:56.580]   Amazon's very hierarchical. I think it's still is that looks like Amazon's uh atrium
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.900]   It is it's the downtown Seattle atrium
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:07.060]   Facebook looks like a giant bean bag on every everybody's connected apple all this is from the era of steve jobs
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.260]   You're a centralized point although I think it's probably still the same
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.620]   And then oracle is like a giant legal division
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.700]   A little engineering division
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.780]   Uh man who you got it you still and i'm very proud to have this on my well by the way such an Adela
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:26.820]   I didn't realize this in his book hit refresh and the first page mentions this cartoon
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.620]   And says this was the thing I was trying to solve
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.900]   So google apparently did not get that message
[00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:39.300]   Where did that cartoon originally run just on a site or uh, yeah man who uh published it on it's gone now
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.380]   Unfortunately on bonkers world
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.380]   But it's uh it's no longer there, but I am very proud to have a
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:51.460]   Originally a version of it from man who sent us uh because we talked about it all the time
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.460]   You're gonna make it an nft. Oh
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:58.100]   Now you're talking
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.900]   Okay, I will tell you though when I asked normal people every now and then i'm like hey
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:08.100]   You know what a cookie is they're like, uh, yeah, this that thing that it's on the web it it follows you
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.260]   Popping up on the screen
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:18.740]   Here's the yeah, I mean seriously. Yeah, no here's the um here's the washington post google pro is a new way to track people around the web again
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.220]   That's not even accurate. Oh wow
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:24.820]   Yeah, it's gonna. Oh clickbait right there. Yeah
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.700]   Yep, uh moral panic as ant I gave you the warning it was time for the
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:32.900]   Fellow part geez
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:38.900]   Producing the show Jeff come on man. I'm not producing today. No, he's not he had plenty of time to do it
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:44.980]   He pushed the button nevermind. I was trying to help you ant there was a changing of the guard at the tricaster and they didn't catch it
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:51.540]   So ant would you and would you push the button again and they and they folks who pushed the buttons on the other side of the room
[00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:57.380]   Maybe they'll push the button at the same there we go. I feel so good. Thank you and his
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:05.140]   Top of the discussion it doesn't even cause remember most of the audience is not looking they're only listening. Yeah, so they'll only
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.700]   Work on that what would be the
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:12.420]   It's gotta be real. Oh, it's more like
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.460]   It's it's jaws
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.780]   I'll dig through my library of sounds
[00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.700]   Here turn that up, Burke
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:35.540]   That's sinister enough to it again here. I don't hear
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:40.420]   Moral panic. Oh, yeah, that's good. Yeah
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:46.820]   I'll buy you. I'll buy you that here's another one. Let's try this here one more time
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.500]   moral panic
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.700]   I think you need a little more panic in your voice thing
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:15:01.940]   I think I think you need the more of you notes here and then the don't oh time it better. I think yeah time it
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.340]   Moral panic
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:11.780]   Moral panic moral
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.140]   Panic
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:21.940]   Work on that we'll workshop that I like give a Leo notes. That's good. Let's go. We have way too much fun on this show
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.820]   We have way too much time in our lives
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:36.260]   Oh, this is making me so happy
[00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.660]   I think we need to cut the sound a little short
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:49.620]   And then we'll get there. I will I will fix it on my end. When will we three meet again in five
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:16:00.740]   Okay, you want to heart a lot of and a shark sound and yeah, all right
[00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:06.580]   We can I can work on the shark sound. I'm as a radio production director for many years
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:12.340]   I can put some some together we get that we get those notes from the morning guy. I need a moral panic sound
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.340]   I
[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.460]   I mean, I feel like you know a lot of people listen to the show
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.340]   We should be aware and try to give them some fun as well
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.580]   Also with us she's back Stacy well, she wasn't gone last week, but she is
[00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.060]   I was gonna say I was here yesterday or last week last week
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:37.380]   Host of Stacy's book club Stacy Higginbotham from Stacy on iot.com and the iot podcast with Kevin TOEFL hello Stacy
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:44.180]   Hello. Yo half of your eyes look one way half the eyes look the other her husband really
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.180]   He did her right eye today
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:54.740]   In a beautiful moment of togetherness. That's really sweet. I should get Lisa to do my makeup sometime
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:58.980]   I think that's a nice idea. Do you do I make up? No, of course not. I did used to
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.860]   For you. I was just saying you do a TV. Yeah
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:07.620]   I am my own makeup kit with I know what my shades are and all that and my contour and fill and
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:14.420]   The minute we started doing these podcasts in video. I said I am never I'm not wearing makeup
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.700]   Sorry, I did my eye makeup today too. You
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.900]   Fabulous
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.980]   You paint on those eyebrows. I think you did
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.900]   No, you painted them. Let's just focus peaking you did
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:32.260]   Were you around Leo when when hgtv came in and started doing the era? Yeah
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:34.260]   brush thing I was
[00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.580]   doing live with Regis and Kelly and
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:43.380]   The makeup artist you go there you get made up before the show the makeup artist said we're we're using airbrushes today
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.900]   And she painted my face with an airbrush
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:54.340]   Because if you just use regular foundation and powder you can see it there's enough detail you can see the powder
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.340]   Yeah, so they
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.340]   HD they pay but apparently
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:02.100]   Kelly had brought down she had a TV show I came over there name of it
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.700]   Primetime TV show and they were using it there so they wanted to try it on they didn't stick with it
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.380]   It was back to the no no, I would say it won't yeah. Yeah, you don't need that
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:16.900]   I had my makeup done for Fox TV once in oh my did they paint you right? I looked
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:23.940]   They did but they I walked out looking almost the same as I normally do but a little better
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:31.140]   Yeah, um, that's what you want when you talk like 45 minutes. I still don't understand what all they were doing with my face
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.900]   We used to have hair and makeup tech TV. It would it would literally take you 45 minutes
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:40.500]   You have to come an hour early to get hair done and makeup done and then they've and then and then do your nails
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.500]   They do the whole thing nails
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:47.940]   Well, we were showing product all I see you're a hand model
[00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.940]   George
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:56.020]   Yeah, it was George. No, it was Kramer Kramer was a hand model and yeah Kramer used to lotion is in so I got good at going
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.220]   You know rub you you rub the outline if I were showing this phone
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.540]   You would you because you don't want to just go look there's the phone you go like this
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.340]   That's right
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:09.380]   It's my true man. I was like the price is right. Yeah
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.500]   And you're just slowly stroking it
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:19.300]   No idea how many times queen prue it gave me crap for bad for your nails
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:24.820]   Yeah, if I did a product demo and you know we do to be role of me showing the product in my
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.380]   I know you have the manicure done. Okay. You want a tip?
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:32.660]   She let me know you want a tip. I'll give you a tip everybody. This is going to be your tip of the week
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:36.100]   Um because we I for a while with tech tv
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:41.140]   I would go and I would get my nails done and I went to a place it was 20 bucks and eventually they stopped
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:46.900]   They said you're just paying too much. You need you need to go to the five dollar nail plies and I'm not going to the five
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.820]   No, I'm sorry
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.940]   So fungus isn't stuff. Well, I just you know, I said really 20 bucks a week you're not anyway
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:20:00.820]   I stopped but I did it myself and I asked and they said look all you need to do the manicure said get a good nail brush
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.900]   Every every day in the when you shower or whatever you use the nail brush
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.220]   Scrub scrub scrub and then you put a nice little cuticle oil on your cuticles
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.820]   And you're good and you know you can cut obviously, but you're good
[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:17.700]   That that means your nails will look good enough that you can do the hand modeling. You know, have you been came to swallow?
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.580]   I still do this. Yes every morning. Oh, but yeah
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.500]   I get lax on it and she lets me know because we have all of that stuff here with that being her professional
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:29.140]   She does manicures. Yeah, that's a job
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:35.220]   I remember when I first met her she was like she looked first at my nails and commented on that before anything
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:38.820]   Grateful I had just had them done
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:44.100]   I have my hands on my pockets. She's done my nails actually I went when she was at the manicure shop down here
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:50.980]   I went down got my nails done now who would think who would think this would be our topic the lead story today
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:57.220]   I don't know how we got here. All right, you know what our lead story should be. Goodbye flock flock you
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:02.020]   Uh, we got to say hello to flock. Yeah, google says and I think this
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.700]   This is really an interesting story said yesterday
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:11.060]   They were going to replace as you remember they had announced no more third party cookies. Everybody hates them good
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.540]   That's fine, but we do need some way to sell
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:18.820]   Targeted advertising. So we're going to have the federated learning of cohorts
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.620]   Which was a kind of retro name
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:24.900]   awkward retro name because everything in this
[00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.380]   Area had birds
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.540]   Bird-seamed so this flock
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:35.780]   Would essentially watch what you do what you just the same way as google always did
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:38.260]   But instead of having a unique identifier for you
[00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.660]   They would put you in a cohort of people with similar interests
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:46.500]   We they never really explained how big this cohort would be
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:54.100]   But the thing that I think upset people was then when when you go to a website your flock cohort would be sent
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:22:01.060]   To the website like at you know, hi. Here's leo. He's 39 94 - 7
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:05.460]   And people didn't really like that. It wasn't clear how big the cohort would be
[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:09.300]   Uh, I think there's also it's funny because they're in trouble with the EU
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.140]   That's actual spring her our favorite
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.460]   Heavy has sued them for ending cookies
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:25.220]   Yeah, yeah, there a trigger is the one who led the fight against google use their political clout got the EU to go after google
[00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:31.700]   Everybody's screaming privacy privacy dot-unchutz dot-unchutz get rid of cookies. They're evil and then and then after spritters is oh
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.020]   We can't target any ads. No, don't get rid of cookies. That's very confusing
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.740]   the eff did not like flock
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.540]   because there was this concern that
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.820]   As always with these things that are so called anonymized
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:51.860]   It's possible to de-anonymize and they were a little worried that if people started to combine your flock id with other
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:58.340]   Profile information they might actually be able to figure out who's who and all of that. So google has
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:04.340]   I think in response to the EU. I don't know. I don't know really in response to privacy advocates
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:11.140]   Um, I think there was a lot of reasons because a lot of people were unhappy with flock and yeah
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.780]   So they're coming up with topics
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:21.380]   Topics it was just a proposal. I mean they never implemented it was only in beta. Right. So now it's topics
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:29.780]   Topics topics topics. So bengal brace whose direct senior director for product
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:35.780]   Acknowledged privacy concerns with flock said topics was easier for users to understand
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:40.740]   It would also make it easier for google to remove sensitive topics from being
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.940]   Targeted so then to topics
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.100]   um
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:53.460]   Let's advertisers target online users based on a topic they might be interested in fitness or travel
[00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.940]   chrome
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:05.540]   Does this automatically now it is not by the way this is all proposal not implemented yet chrome will generate five topics based on your browser
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:07.140]   history
[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:10.340]   With and this is important participating websites
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:18.020]   It then sends three topics one from each of the past three weeks to participating sites to share with their advertising partners
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:24.020]   Topics like flock are not permanent in this case. They're stored for three weeks then deleted
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.260]   There are 350 topics, but google's saying by doing this
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.300]   Instead of saying what your interests are in flock
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.900]   We're saying what your interests are, but we could also just ignore things like
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:42.260]   Um, I don't know whatever is you know mental health issues my searches for mental health resources. Yeah guns that kind of thing
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:47.540]   So topic data is stored on your device manicures manicures
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.580]   I
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.740]   If I get a bunch of manicure information in my instagram feed, I think we'll know
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.140]   um
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:25:03.540]   So it's never stored on its google unlike third-party tracking cookies which allow people companies to use tracking pixels
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.900]   So they can go cross site. This can't really go cross site
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:12.180]   You will be unlike flock you'll be able to see what topics you are being
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:18.740]   You know flogged with they're being sent to sites if you don't like a topic
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:25.300]   I know I like this you can remove it. It's great. Yeah, because you know what? I'm not interested in tennis records
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:32.500]   I am interested once for my for my wife and I don't play tennis rock. Yeah, I'm too old I play pickleball and and yeah
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:38.340]   Uh, and google says users will be able to disable the feature
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.460]   completely, which is really interesting
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:49.060]   I think google does google wants to maintain its ad model, but they really do want to respond to people's privacy concerns
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.700]   It's a value advice
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:57.940]   Go ahead. I'm sorry antics. Oh you said this is stored on the device and yeah chrome is just reading it
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.860]   Yes, that way well chrome generates it and then stores it in its you know
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.820]   Store it stores it in wherever it stores cookies back pocket. Yes
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:14.580]   It is back but it's stored locally on your device. It's not sent up to the cloud like associate with your ip address correct
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:18.420]   So they announced yeah, that's right. That's the key right? It's anonymized. Yeah
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:24.100]   Uh, although it is in a way associate with your ip address because when you go let's say you go to
[00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.740]   Uh
[00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:29.300]   What's the you know some bass fishing place
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:37.060]   And and it sends out let's you know you go to dicks sporting goods website and it's it's gonna say well
[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.900]   Here's the three things here's the three topics leo's interested in
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:46.900]   Um, but but dicks is getting that plus my ip address. So that's why they have to expire them
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.820]   On a regular basis, right? So they can't start building a picture of you
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.740]   The other issue thing here is what could be done? Go ahead. Please. I'm sorry
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:27:01.220]   Oh, I was gonna say google says they also are gonna send fake topics to about 5% of the websites to make sure
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:06.980]   The topic generation is actually random which I thought was kind of like does that mean like 5% of your ads?
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.020]   Aren't are they gonna give people a discount of 5% like
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.260]   That oh from the i get where they're coming from but it's kind of weird
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:18.020]   I have I mean
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.020]   I'm a little i'm a of course
[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:24.980]   Um, I'm a little skeptical because google has its own way of tracking who you are and
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:30.660]   And all of that but I think that google is really is i'm gonna give him credit for trying to find a system
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:35.380]   That users can tolerate that gives the advertisers some of the information
[00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.300]   Which might actually give you more relevant advertising here. Here's a question
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.900]   Do you did you receive anything whether whether an advertiser can do a not?
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:48.100]   That's how it got abused on facebook, right? If if I decide I want to advertise this thing, but
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:54.820]   Not to people who like hip-hop as a way you know this job as a way to not kind of redline
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.140]   In other words, that kind of yeah
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.140]   Um and the not was an issue
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:06.260]   There so that was the primary one I don't think the google could control the not because they're gonna send here's a here's on the google
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:13.300]   Simple they're gonna send out, you know, this you know, jeff's interest in autos and vehicles books and literature comics and animation and rock music
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:21.140]   Team sports. There's no reason all that dick sports couldn't say oh rock. I don't want anybody's interest in rock and just say you know
[00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.700]   We want to advertise to that person
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:30.180]   The point that google's making on this graph diagram is you don't know you can't tell what's in that cookie
[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:31.860]   It's you know, it's code
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:37.540]   But you can see very clearly because grom will show this what your what interest is sending to advertisers
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:39.700]   And you see that x you can delete them
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.860]   So I think this is I I like this
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:47.860]   Solution. Let me here's google's one minute video to describe this here
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.020]   um
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.860]   are you getting uh
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.860]   audio
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.860]   You didn't test your audio Leo
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.660]   That's right, right
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:05.780]   Right, right. Yeah, so maybe there's no audio in it. We heard the tick-tock. Oh, okay
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:14.420]   Introducing topics. Thank you privacy sandbox's newest proposal to help you preserve your privacy online while enabling sites to show
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.340]   About this with topics your browser will know topics related to participate inside you visit
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:23.780]   Let me tell you some extra professional for example if you've recently visited sites about sports
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.820]   The browser may note that sports is one of your topics
[00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.340]   Your topics will help determine the ads you see
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:35.700]   And as I won't need to know who you are to show you an ad about sports
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:41.140]   They just know you like it. You have no control. Oh, sorry. You do have control over your topics and you can
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.460]   Profess your browser
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.020]   Or you can turn them off all together. I'm cold reading it man
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:51.540]   With topics the specific sites you visited are no longer shared across the web
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:56.020]   Like they might have been with third party cookers party evil cookies
[00:29:56.020 --> 00:30:00.980]   We're testing topics soon to get feedback from the industry so that it works together with all of the other
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:07.540]   privacy sandbox proposals to protect your privacy and keep the internet a valuable source of free information
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.780]   For now in the future and that's the balancing act
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.940]   They want to support advertising which is what supports free internet content
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:20.260]   But they also want you to feel comfortable with the information they share. I don't know negatives Stacy. Can you see a negative here?
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:22.580]   Um
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:27.700]   No, I mean, I think it's mostly positive especially if they make it easy for you to look because then you can also
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.060]   I mean the negative for an advertiser is I could go in and I could be like
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:35.380]   I'm so sick of seeing all these high price coats because I keep buying them
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:40.660]   So then I'm like, I am not interested in high fashion and then I would stop buying high fashion
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.540]   Because of advertising
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:47.060]   That's really not a problem. It's published interestingly on github
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:48.340]   um
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.980]   the details about the api if you wanted
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:56.260]   If you want to start getting ready as a as a web site designer to to support this
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.700]   um
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.700]   Yeah, I think it's um
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.500]   I think there's a full opportunity is to let me pick my topics
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.100]   Oh, isn't that interesting? I want a car
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:13.300]   But you might I mean I will say that as I so especially because it's short range like three weeks
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.980]   let's just go with
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:19.380]   Every time I binge watch a show I start googling like mad to hear like who's the actors?
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.940]   Where have I seen the reaction? Me too. So it captures
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:27.620]   It captures that which is a very fleeting interest but might be interesting for an advertiser
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.060]   Um
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:35.540]   And then it goes away when I'm probably no longer interested in it if I had to manage that I just be like, uh, I'm interested in IOT in clothes
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:40.580]   But the interesting thing too here is google's always always
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:44.180]   Sussed out topicality right from the very very beginning of advertising
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.220]   So how are they going to know an expensive coat site?
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:52.500]   I guess that's pretty obvious their coats and their expensive, but you know, what how does the topicality?
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.300]   uh determined
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.340]   Is going to be interesting to see because we've never had transparency on that before
[00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.780]   Why this ad appeared on this page
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:09.620]   It would always make you look at you almost makes it look like they have access to the history even though they say they're not looking at your history
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:12.580]   Of which the user or the site and the user
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:19.460]   They they are very obviously looking at your history. I mean if I look at like my google newsfeed for example
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:23.220]   I mean all I have to do is search like one freaking
[00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:30.260]   I don't know like hot tub chemicals and for the rest of my life. I'm reading stories about hot tubs. So I assume
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:35.460]   This it's going to be built on. I mean, that's easy for google, right?
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.260]   Yeah
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:42.500]   Yeah, it may not be accurate so I can go in and be like, please stop showing me ads for hot tubs
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:47.060]   I mean google look google is not going to make privacy advocates and advertisers happy
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:50.980]   So it's a it's like any compromise. There's it's not going to be perfect
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:58.180]   As I I think as a user i'm satisfied with this will advertisers feel like they're getting enough information
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:02.340]   I mean honestly if if you're dicks sporting goods and it says you're interested
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:08.260]   I don't know pickleball is probably too granular. That's the problem. So it might say you're interested in racket sports
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:14.340]   Then they I mean maybe they'd like more granular. I don't know. I don't know. I heard from advertisers. I don't know. Hmm
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.580]   The other interesting piece here is is the correlations that occur
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:25.380]   I remember early on um, I'm forgetting the name of the company that was bought by a well long ago. They found for example that
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:31.140]   Service of people and people in the army and navy and so on
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:34.740]   Correlated very highly with big screen TVs
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:42.980]   So you might be wanting to advertise a big screen tv, but you go toward military interest or vice versa
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.740]   Right and and that's because you have your own data as an advertiser
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:50.180]   That says these are these are the useful correlations that we have
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:56.980]   Yeah, that's okay. I mean that's been happening for a while. So I don't have issues with that
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:00.660]   I mean, I always I got to we're cool with that, right?
[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.380]   Right. We we are but we got to think about
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:11.380]   Um, you know, how does this let's let's here. Here's the test. I think if I'm a job site and I'm advertising jobs
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:19.860]   Am I using some topics to get rid of? Oh people who may be less desirable for my employer people who are on a culture fit?
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:24.500]   Um, yeah, right and and and so that's gonna
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:29.620]   Google's gonna have to test out and they're good at this right going back to matt cuts. They're good at sussing out
[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.980]   Bad uses of things but far better than facebook ever was
[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.500]   Um, I've seen how could this system get misused?
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.580]   And and it will be it surely will be no doubt about it
[00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.780]   Okay
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:49.220]   Anyway, thank you topic. I come I commend them for trying to find something that makes people happy
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:55.620]   Uh, and i'm sure the I haven't seen the eff yet. Let me see if the eff is already up in arms over this
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:59.860]   Well, but also the washington post to the new york times I put it in this tweet
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.340]   It's rather than saying a new way to target ads a new way to track you
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:07.380]   Yeah
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:12.740]   I don't think that's a problem. I think it's important to explain to people that these companies are tracking them
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.300]   I have a really interesting tracking story, but it's not other thing. Let me just say this talk about it
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.860]   And then let's do that but it's not tracking the common person's understanding
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:28.340]   It's not tracking with you on the new york times headline scaring well, but is that leo defend me
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:33.140]   I'm going to defend you because so third so cookies as google pointed out
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:39.380]   Track you in the sense that you the facebook like button sees multiple sites that you've been on
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:43.540]   This is a very different system where the chrome browser
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:45.940]   Which sees those sites anyway?
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:49.940]   Then extracts from that an interest five interest which you can see what they are
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:54.660]   You can turn them off and sends that to the website that is not
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:01.380]   The same thing at all that's not really tracking you in my opinion. Now. Maybe do you think stacey consumers?
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:06.420]   We'll see that mechanism that the browser then says this is what media you're interested in
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:12.340]   Uh, is that will that be seen as tracking? I don't feel like that's tracking. It's not following you in any way
[00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:21.380]   Anytime something pops up and tells the average person hey, I think you like this or I know you like this
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.100]   Yeah, right and they're correct. They don't like that creeps people out
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:28.420]   Yeah, they don't care that it follows them other places. That's a real subtle distinction
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.460]   Most people don't care about they should because that's
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:35.460]   The problem. That's why we're that's why we don't like third-party cookies
[00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:40.420]   But how sophisticated does someone have to be to so okay?
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:44.900]   Can I tell you my tracking story because I I think this is interesting and it ties to this
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:49.300]   So I read it. My daughter is a sophomore in high school. So she's looking
[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:55.060]   We're about to start the whole college thing. So we we got a book by a wall street journal reporter about like
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:37:02.500]   Getting money for college and in that book he talked about how colleges are now using pixel trackers on emails
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:08.340]   To track when applicants open their emails how quickly they respond how many times they open it
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:11.140]   And they use that information. I thought that was only means
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:17.700]   Okay, but they use that information for into getting a sense of how interested someone is
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.580]   in the school and
[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.140]   For allocating scholarship money
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:29.380]   And I was like oh crap. I gotta get my daughter proton now because I don't want
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:35.780]   I don't want her casual searches or interests and something to cost us money, right?
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:42.820]   And so I think it's old news that yes, there are pixel trackers in email, right? We might all be like, yeah
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:48.100]   Yeah, yeah, I know but when you think about how those are being used it's kind of like holy crap
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.100]   uh
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.100]   In ways that might surprise you
[00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:56.980]   It's full and that's what I mean like people are not sophisticated or it's not even not sophisticated
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:03.700]   We just don't think everything through to that level because my god. We'd have we sound like paranoid crazy folk. I guess
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.380]   but
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.380]   Anyway, that's that's why I've been thinking
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.940]   Yeah
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:16.340]   Air quotes normals we do sound paranoid when we start talking about privacy and security even though it's pretty
[00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:18.580]   blatant what's going on
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:21.700]   I think google has an opportunity here
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:24.500]   Um, and this is me just speculating
[00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:31.220]   To your point leo about about the awareness of people under your points. They see and aunt about
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.740]   um
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:38.820]   The the the nervousness is to is to be very strong of saying control your advertising
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:43.460]   Control what topics you have control what topics you don't get. I've always argued
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.940]   I wanted on the sites that I ran when I ran them
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:50.180]   I wanted the opportunity for somebody to say don't show me this advertiser and sell that data to the advertiser
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:53.140]   These people don't want to see you you figure out why
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:59.220]   But but that's valuable you're wasting your money trying to get to these people so stop going to those people right?
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.100]   Um, I think it's an opportunity to become
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:05.060]   um, I hate using this word very proactive
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.460]   uh and allow
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:12.100]   uh users to in fact not just feeling control but be in control
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:17.940]   It's going to generate more data that is actually valuable because it comes from it's a permission to system
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:22.180]   That says yeah, I am looking for a car right now. No, I was looking for my daughter
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:26.340]   She already bought the car stop with the car ads. Please stop wasting your money and my eye space
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:29.140]   There's a lot of opportunity there. I think
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.940]   They won't do it
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:37.300]   Stacy Higginbotham jeff Jarvis aunt pruit this week in google. We're looking at the best of 2022
[00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.020]   We continue on
[00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:42.100]   with the story of uh
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:46.420]   A guy who was hacked by north korea. Don't worry. He got his revenge
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:54.820]   And then there was north korea hack and some den we get to bonkers north korea and some more hacking north korea back
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:59.060]   This all right. So here's the story the stacey was setting up. Yeah, tell us about it
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:04.420]   I will save you a click but essentially a security researcher
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:08.580]   an individual security research goes by p4x
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.300]   um, he realized that
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:16.900]   His he was getting hacked and he was trying to figure out why and he realized it was north korea
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:23.140]   And he was kind of miffed about this because nation states attacking individual security researchers seemed unfair
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:27.540]   So is he had he done something north korea to warrant this or they just kind of picked him
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:34.500]   No, this is part of like a general like nation state just checking in on you know people like every every nation
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:39.700]   tracks hackers in other nation they they all it's part of the like
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:43.860]   I see it might be participating actively in the zero day market, but it might just be like
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:48.660]   They know who's active in security research. We're watching you was just right
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:54.660]   Well, both that and just to see like this guy figured out anything cool that we can steal great
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.340]   so
[00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:58.900]   it really upset p4x and
[00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:04.100]   Nobody did anything so that that didn't sit well with him. So he said, you know what?
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.900]   Effort i'm gonna hack him back
[00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:11.060]   Um, so here's his quote. It felt like the right thing to do here
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.780]   If they don't see we have teeth it's just going to keep coming
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.180]   Said the hacker
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:21.620]   Um, I want them to understand that if you come at us it means some of your infrastructure is going down for a while
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:26.100]   So p4x went and found unpatched vulnerabilities in north korean
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:32.580]   internet systems and basically took the country's internet down using ddas. Oh, he's the guy who did that
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:35.220]   We mentioned that last week. There was down here. He's the guy who did that. Wow
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:38.660]   He's that guy and he was doing it because he felt
[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.700]   Pissed
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.380]   So this is the debate about hackbacks, but I just thought it was bonkers that
[00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.740]   This dude in his pajamas
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:52.420]   Has the power to take down korea's internet or north korea's internet
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.900]   Yeah, such
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.180]   Such is the internet in 2022, right
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:02.500]   So many people have you know so much power
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.980]   Uh, yeah, they can just do it from their pajamas
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.780]   The writing is you know, it's
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:12.260]   It's wired. So it's really good wire. It's good writing. You know, they're yeah, wow
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.820]   So
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.540]   Here i'll i'll do this because as a as a journalist, I like it
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:24.100]   But responsibility for north korea's ongoing internet outages doesn't lie with us cyber command or any other state sponsored hacking agency
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:28.260]   In fact, it was the work of one american man and a t-shirt pajama pants and slippers
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:33.380]   Sitting in his living room at night after night watching a alien movies and eating spicy cornstacks
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.620]   And periodically walking over to his home office to check on the progress of the programs
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.820]   He was me running to disrupt the internet of an entire country
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:46.740]   Holy
[00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:52.580]   Okay, so that was my bonkers cyber security story of love it right on thank you for throwing that in there
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:57.220]   Do you listen to k u o w in uh beautiful seattle?
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.140]   I'm too. Okay, be careful if you have a
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.940]   If you have a 2016 Mazda
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.260]   I I do
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:14.500]   Do you really yes? I do well, so this is an impr listener. This actually intrigues me
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:21.380]   Because it turns out there's a flaw in the rendering coders will know all about this
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:26.740]   They're not sanitizing their inputs. There's a flaw in the engine. They actually use javascript render
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.620]   The screen not the car engine not the car engine
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.820]   The other code engine they read you the screen
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:37.860]   They use javascript on the on the entertainment unit and apparently it has trouble with
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:45.940]   Unicode characters and some punctuation and it'll actually crash it so they're apparently a lot of crash it
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:51.780]   But brick it brick it and there are a lot of people who can only listen to k u o w in their Mazda
[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:55.220]   permanently stuck a 94.9 at femme
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:57.220]   Oh
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:01.300]   Because so they didn't they have a little extra stuff
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:04.340]   in the in the text
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:10.820]   ours technica did a better story because k u o w story starts talking about five g
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.420]   They didn't understand it. That's why i read their story. I was like what?
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:19.780]   Well, of course they didn't understand it. So yeah, ours technica figured out that that's what it is. It's a Unicode issue
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:27.700]   Yeah, so it's not a five g issue over not at all looking at that. But this to me. Okay, so I love this story
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.420]   Because it shows
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:35.300]   Like we're building out as we connect all this stuff and we have companies who are not necessarily
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:41.940]   Used to dealing with software over like a ten-year time frame. Maybe like a car's life
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:47.940]   Figuring out how not to accidentally break it and then what happens when you break it?
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:51.700]   Who's responsible because the issue here is they break these people's
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:54.420]   Invotainment centers. It's going to cost them
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:45:01.460]   Money to actually physically replace it if they were one of the most is fault for not properly handling
[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.940]   You can't assume what's going to come in over the airwaves. He's a mistake
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:10.660]   Right admittedly k u w bluh, but wait a minute. They're not the first to do this. There's a
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:17.140]   A podcast called 99 invisible. Have you heard of this podcast? Mm-hmm. There's a first podcast
[00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:21.220]   There it's a great podcast, but don't listen to it in your 2016 master
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:26.580]   Because and this and this is it's the same thing. There's a percent in the name of this show
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:30.020]   They actually had to create a Mazda safe feed
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:36.900]   Oh, man. Oh wow. So that is Mazda's fault. It's totally Mazda's fault. Mm-hmm
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.900]   So the Mazda's feet has
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:41.460]   99 P-e-r-c-e-n-t
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:44.340]   Invisible instead of a December sense on
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:50.260]   So because Mazda's not replacing it. Mazda's like no, we're not gonna replace that. That's
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.540]   It's bad coding. No, it's not that they
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:58.020]   Mazda says Mazda did Mazda said look there's a spec
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:03.460]   For it's you know, it's this additional information that comes through a radio channel nowadays
[00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:07.060]   That you display on the screen and it shows you the name of the artist blah blah blah
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:12.340]   K u o w sent album arts through and it crashed the most
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:19.060]   Software, but honestly, I mean you can debate and Mazda's gonna say well, that's an old car
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.180]   We're not gonna fix it because it is at least it's a six year old car
[00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:29.220]   But it is their mr. Hey, hey, that's not an old car. My car six. I mean my car seven years old and it's a Tesla
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.580]   Car older than three in years
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:39.860]   It was well. Yeah, you're the guy who goes off by a gee if you hundred-dollar phones
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:47.300]   I'm not rich. I'm not rich. I just we lease our cars so that we get into one every three years and that's why
[00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:49.300]   um
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:50.580]   so
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:55.380]   ours technica did figure it out apparently so did 99% invisible
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:47:02.340]   Uh and honestly, it's not I'm sorry 2016 is 2016 so it's a six year old Mazda
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.580]   um
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:09.860]   Well, it says it affects cars from 2014 to 2017. Oh interesting
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:12.900]   So the k u o w I think there's two issues
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:17.300]   I think there's two separate things running around here one is specific to 2016 year olds
[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:23.220]   And apparently Mazda does say I feel like ours must have updated the story that customers can
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.620]   Mazda will replace it now
[00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:30.740]   At a good will they're not admitting it. Yeah, ability. Yeah, right. Yeah
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:34.420]   But because of the chip shortage it might take a while right but
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:39.620]   Meanwhile, they got to listen to nothing with liberal and PR
[00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:42.580]   It's a it's a conspiracy. I tell you
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.420]   So sanitize your inputs kids
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.620]   Yeah, this is I mean, this is so tough
[00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:54.900]   We're gonna say like I'm imagining like if I download some software to run like energy management for my home
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:59.140]   Which I'm like super excited about by but like what if that does something
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:05.220]   To like my old nest thermostat. I'm like, oh crap. How do I fix that? You know, we're getting to this era where
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:11.540]   We've got all these software interdependencies and we're not creating provisions to help consumers through them like resulting problems
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:14.500]   And it's gonna suck x k cd
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.900]   ish episode or
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:18.900]   comic strip 327
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.300]   exploits of a mom
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:27.380]   Hi, this is your son's school. We're having some computer trouble. Oh dear. Did he break something
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.300]   In a way
[00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:32.340]   Did you really name your son robert tic?
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.580]   parentheses semicolon drop table students. Let me call him
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:42.180]   - - question mark. Oh, yeah, little bobby tables. We call him
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.140]   Well, we've lost this year's student records
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:53.140]   I hope you're happy and I hope you have learned to sanitize your database inputs nice little bobby tables
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:49:00.260]   So a moment from uncle jeff here when the struggle tribune was switching from lineotypes to cold type
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:04.180]   Big machine to set type
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.580]   With photography the whole thing
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:11.540]   Died one day the addition couldn't almost didn't get out. The reason was that a golf score
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.020]   Happened to be a clone for a race
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:27.060]   So everything stays the same. I love it. Yeah, lord
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.020]   Wow
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.740]   All right metamates. Let's talk
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:39.540]   Let's talk about facebook. We're twin mates. We're twin mates. Okay. I really wonder why we're all presuming
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:44.340]   That's where the emphasis is in the spelling of metamates like why not metamates or something
[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:47.780]   It's a comment or metamates meet a mate or metamet
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:52.180]   I want to go with metamet. I am declaring that's how we do it. It's metamet
[00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:57.940]   So mama mica burg apparently without smiling although I think that's pretty common announced it all hands
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:02.740]   Verge was watching that that was the new name for every now
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:08.340]   I think mark got a bad rap on this by the way. I understand what he's saying is, you know, we're like shipmates
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:13.460]   We need to look out for each other. He's just trying to get her a pull in the same direction
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:16.500]   I don't think that's so bad. It's a no it's a little tone deaf
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:20.660]   You know, but some you know sometimes the boss does that I've probably done something like that
[00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:24.100]   I never suggested twit mates did I had I don't think no
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:28.340]   But I understand I wouldn't have come on if you had done that
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:38.100]   But he certainly refused to use the word podcast I use netcasts for a long time and I think it's a better word for it to be honest
[00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:41.300]   See they're either that I'll defend that yeah
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:44.100]   As you should
[00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:46.820]   Neo-lurgism sometimes can sound a little
[00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:52.900]   I don't know clunky and metamates or metamates or metamates or whatever it is
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.620]   [Laughter]
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:51:00.900]   Can can can come our last pronunciation sounds like a good tequila. Yeah, metamate
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.460]   tequila
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:08.020]   For the feed they've also rebrand the feed. It's not a news feed. It's just a feed
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:11.780]   That's the new name for it. That's good
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:16.740]   Yeah, there are a couple of changes that actually seemed like you're paying attention and
[00:51:16.740 --> 00:51:19.620]   bringing in some important
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:26.100]   Thoughts into your new vernacular and then there's some that just feel like no you're completely missing the point of everything
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:31.460]   Met everything. Yeah, well the whole meta. I mean all real naming you you're naming your company meta
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:38.180]   Is I don't know odd? I think but you know now here we are a few weeks in we're used to it
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:45.060]   Do you think I think all the uh mocking of that has gone away? I mean, I'm not done. You're not done
[00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:49.700]   You know, I'm not done. It's meta is better than facebook. Let's face it facebook is a terrible name
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.860]   No, I mean, I think the problem is facebook may be a terrible product
[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:56.820]   But I don't think the name of it is necessarily bad
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.500]   because in
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:04.180]   Anything it it got to the it gets to the point of what was actually sort of good and useful and valuable
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:09.300]   About facebook that may people want to use it which was the idea that you'd be connected to your friends
[00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:11.460]   That was a nice idea
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:15.380]   So if only that were the thing that was actually delivering on and delivering on well
[00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:19.300]   I think it would be a great name for a great product. The problem is it's a failed
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:23.140]   Promise that it isn't meeting and making worse all the time
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.860]   Um calling the whole company meta
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:32.420]   You know, it may be it is a more appropriate name given that they've got you know, their fingers and so many pies
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:39.700]   But it's it doesn't really redeem it. It doesn't solve any of the shortcomings of the facebook product and um, you know
[00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:45.460]   Also from a trademark perspective. It was just weird every single trademarky lawyer
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:50.260]   I knew was like what did you just do like how do you are you paying attention to your lawyers?
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:55.300]   You just gave them like a tiny amount of time to turn around a really impossible registration task
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:58.660]   After they've done everything to preserve your other trademark
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:05.220]   The world stuff it was just it was a it was a it looked like an impetuous business decision
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:13.620]   And that I can't be impressed by that even if it accidentally turned out to be a not completely terrible and it says if mark read a book
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:16.740]   Uh
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:21.540]   In fact, there are books like this. I don't is it no mchomsky who said language determines culture
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:27.940]   Uh that the words you use are uh important determinant and how you feel about things
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:33.860]   And so remember it used to be that the company's slogan was move fast and break things
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:36.500]   Clearly not the best slogan
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:41.060]   Uh, so they you wonder why everybody hates them because they broke everything it worked
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:44.820]   Uh, they changed it to move fast. It left out the break things. They always understood
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:50.580]   It wasn't it was implicit not explicit on tuesday. They announced they're now the slogan is now
[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:52.500]   move fast
[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.500]   together
[00:53:54.500 --> 00:54:00.180]   Was that right like we used to move fast
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:07.140]   Together meditates now that you say it that isn't really great, but it did register as a significant improvement
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:09.620]   Which doesn't speak well of the original benchmark
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:15.460]   Surpassing it does call up the potato sack races where two people's legs are tied together
[00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:23.700]   I don't know and couft hand cuffed together. Um the companies, uh, okay
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:27.300]   uh besides metam etas the companies
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.420]   companies
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:32.900]   Uh, i'm gonna do it metamets metamets
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:38.900]   The slide deck says employees will be expected now. I remember uh for years
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.700]   people would say god first
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:46.820]   Then country then family right if you work at met if you're a metamate
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.620]   you you're metta first
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:55.380]   Followed by your metamates followed by the individual. That's the new secular
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:59.300]   Uh trinity is getting defined in emissions. Why is this
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:06.020]   Corporate document at all period this is my hate mission statement zuck said the company's corporate values will be
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.980]   live in the future
[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:13.380]   Not a good plan for those of us who have to live in the present and
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:21.140]   Be direct and respect your colleagues. It sounds like they're really doubling down on cultish like each other like each other
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:25.060]   Will you damn it like each other damn it start working together dammit
[00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:28.900]   Maybe there's I mean I think this is a response to the problem. I don't know
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:32.660]   I think some of it reads as a okay
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:36.740]   We're gonna improve in a couple of areas and I could kind of see some of the language be like
[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:41.700]   You know anti harassment and um, you know, if you're you've got a clerk for culture
[00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:45.620]   You might as well foster a good one and find use the right language that might help
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:50.260]   But yeah, it also doesn't read as anything that at best
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:55.540]   It's naive and be it or and worse. It's heavy handed in an appropriate way
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:57.700]   Does it make you feel better that douglas hofstetter?
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.820]   coined the term metamates when asked by a
[00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:05.540]   Facebook executive what his advice was he said call yourselves a metamates
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:12.100]   I wonder what people were calling they sells on their own volition like the spontaneous word
[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:18.980]   I think the word know the word we hear all the time which I find obnoxious is my team my team makes
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:21.140]   It's always the team
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:23.780]   So instagram apparently
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:28.980]   Had a phrase which is a reference to a nay navel phrase as opposed to a navel gaze
[00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:30.820]   Well, yeah, I was gonna
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.820]   ship ship mates
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:34.260]   self
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:40.660]   Ship ship mates self. That's your priority. So meta has made it meta metamates me
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:46.420]   It sounds cultish to me
[00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:49.860]   Well, so actually i've been thinking about this
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:55.780]   Conrad you had a problem with that i've been reading it sounds like magic words
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:57:01.060]   Like with what it does it sounds like just said these magic words and all of our problems will go away
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:03.620]   It's gonna get locked inside too
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:09.060]   Now I got a beef with mr. Jarvis. You said you don't like all mission statements
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:15.620]   I don't like the process of trying to figure out what's the mission statement versus the one of the other two things you always have
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.540]   um
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:22.260]   The values and the something else no you need them. We're redoing ours at the school right now
[00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.380]   I agree with all that I have been through so many
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:28.260]   multi session meetings
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:31.300]   Yeah, terry and a part it I hate the process
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:37.860]   Yeah, it doesn't really get so often to the real mission that we have it's a bunch of flowers
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:40.340]   around the vase or is it a vase
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:44.740]   And then you also said you don't you didn't like the term teammates
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:48.660]   Is that only because I hear how I hear used all the time
[00:57:48.660 --> 00:57:52.660]   Yeah, there's like it becomes exclusionary too. Well, I got my team
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:57.620]   What's my team doing and there's kind of but disagree please and with both but how do you create look?
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:01.060]   Do you accept that you need a corporate culture and how do you create that?
[00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:04.420]   By the work you do?
[00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:13.060]   When the leadership you get corporations are all siloed one way or another so the whole team aspect of it makes a ton of sense to me
[00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:15.140]   um
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:19.940]   They're all sort of siloed but at the same time they have one shared goal which which is profit
[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:22.420]   So each team
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:27.380]   Is working whatever they need to work to get to said profit and so as they're speaking to one another
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:30.500]   It's yeah, we're co-workers, but it's my teammate and I think
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:32.660]   Teamate at least for me
[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:34.500]   Resonates better as someone that's got a
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:39.780]   Shared goal and we're on that same mission to try to get there together and not really
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:46.020]   Cutting each other off at the kneecaps or anything like that. Yeah, I think it's good when I agree sports on my life
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:51.540]   You know, yeah, well, that's the point. That's the point. I was I was the dork who was always left off the team
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:54.500]   You see you see you see you get it now. I was never
[00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:58.100]   No, but we always on I was all in sports
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:01.940]   I was on the team but sat on the bench so I think I can weigh in here
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:05.860]   Yes, you may
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:06.660]   Yes
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:12.660]   I I hear what you're saying, but I think it's a little bit different about Silicon Valley where I hear something a little bit different
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:17.220]   And I think it's mapping to the way the companies are organized silicon valley companies
[00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:26.340]   Historically have been very pod driven smaller units as opposed to higher arcies and annelies xinnyan wrote a book that I read in the 90s about
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:31.460]   She mapped out the difference in silicon valley culture versus the root 128
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:36.980]   Digital equipment corporation type culture where you had one big company and a whole bunch of branches
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:45.060]   Out and the question was which which version of corporate culture could be more nimble and an innovative and the answer was silicon valley
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:47.940]   So silicon valley is still like that with all the startups
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:52.260]   But now you've got these companies that are just astronomically large astronomically quickly
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:59.540]   And I think the way there's we talked last time I was here about like corporate governance issues of like what you do when your company is that big
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:06.340]   So I don't think it's necessarily correct to say that the team is we're all teammates on the one big silicon valley ship
[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:14.020]   I think the issue is that different budget and different hierarchies have been distributed down into little pods and that the teams are actually
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:17.620]   How people map into their pods and when they speak of their team
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:23.460]   They're thinking of my pod has jurisdiction over this type of issue this type of project problem
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:28.180]   And then they've got different people within that like, you know, you may even have your lawyer you may have your
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:30.580]   Code or you may have your qa person
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:33.380]   And the way they pass off tasks and get things done
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:39.380]   But I think when they're speaking of it, they're speaking less in terms of what their job is and more the unit of the company that they're sitting in
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:45.620]   Which is interesting. Um, yeah, I mean sociologically and organizational theory. I really
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:51.140]   The fact that that word emerges I think is a really interesting thing to study that
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:55.940]   Because when I was in silicon valley before I went to law school, I don't think we really had this
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:01:01.780]   This is something that has evolved and it would be really interesting to know what drove that evolution and is it is an effective
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:07.460]   Innovation and how the corporations are constructed, but I think that's what it's reflecting many
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:15.380]   Pods within the company and that's when people say my team they're referring to something much narrower and not the whole big
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.340]   I don't think when they say a facebook employee says my team
[01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:24.500]   They mean like that little thing that they work in with the people that they work with and not facebook writ large
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.380]   Yeah, that I get yeah
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:35.860]   Who put this looks like a jeff jarvis keyboard that makes my hands hurt just looking at it
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:41.220]   Yes, oh that is terrible. Isn't that awful? It's ergonomic
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:45.460]   And it's like it's like real. It's being sold. Of course it's real
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:49.860]   Because that's good for you. Oh god. No, that's really not
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:52.340]   I get a headache looking at
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:56.420]   Just never move your hands. It's the Salvador dolly. You never wear this melting. Yes
[01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.540]   Leaks it's leaking
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:03.700]   No, I don't want to watch that one. I want to it's the angry meow
[01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.700]   Or meal
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:10.580]   Angry meows amhatsu
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:14.900]   It's a wireless ortho linear split ergo keyboard with an aluminum body
[01:02:14.900 --> 01:02:18.820]   $1600 ortho linear
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:22.180]   it's ortho six like a better now, but
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:28.100]   It will it's wireless charging, but if you want for an additional three hundred eighty dollars
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:32.660]   You can get the company cyber mat which charges it automatic
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:35.300]   break-by batteries
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:39.300]   We can't put bad enough throw in one of Amazon's robots
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:44.260]   By the way, it is angry meow as in cat because look at their logo. It's a cat's car
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.820]   It's a cat's car
[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.460]   Did I have another view of it other than top down?
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.300]   Um
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:56.260]   Let's go to the website. Maybe the angry meow website will have more
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:00.580]   And our kicks are about the time we're done Leo's gonna buy it. Are there a kickstarter?
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.380]   Uh
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.380]   Sites not coming up
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:13.140]   We've uh, we've slashed eyes. Oh, there it is. Here we go. Here we go wireless charging connect curve split ergo
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:16.740]   Oh, yeah, you're right that is painful
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:21.380]   Who knows?
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.380]   300 people may like it
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:29.860]   This is a very personal decision your keyboard. Yes. What do you use? Do you have a special
[01:03:29.860 --> 01:03:33.780]   kind of keyboard? I'll go back and forth between just a
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:36.340]   standard, um
[01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:38.020]   cyber power
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:40.020]   Chicklet not chicklet, um
[01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:45.860]   Keyboard in this MX keys from Logitech. Yeah, I do like this a lot
[01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:49.220]   Yeah, when the bluetooth acts like it has a brain
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:55.060]   This is an article from the Verge from uh last week
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:58.580]   designers spend months making custom keycaps
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:01.140]   Then the counterfeits arrive
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:05.380]   Uh talks about uh an artist named Olivia Briggs who designs these beautiful
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:08.660]   Uh keyboards the colors and all that
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:13.060]   Uh, yeah, and then of course before she can even produce them
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:16.100]   There are Chinese clones that are available
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:21.620]   Would you like it? How about this? Would you like that with no letters on it? Oh, I like no, isn't that pretty?
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:25.620]   It's art no work art, but I don't know if I could type on it. No, yeah
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:30.660]   Um, who here is a touch typist not I
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:33.700]   Nope none of you. Wow
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:39.220]   I look down every night touch because I have hot keys for stuff, you know, like if i'm in premiere
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.340]   I was stuck in the jungle gym when they taught typing
[01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:45.540]   I mean
[01:04:45.540 --> 01:04:50.740]   I'm a touch typist in the sense that I touch the keyboard when I type yeah me too. Yeah, you know
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:53.700]   There's some I was right. I can't type if I look down
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:58.820]   But I can type it with my eyes closed without a problem. I've noticed that yeah, but yet at the same time
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:06.580]   There are certain those F keys up there. I I don't always know where they are. I know but he gets useful. Nobody gets those
[01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.620]   I only I had right but I go really fast
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:18.020]   Because because I didn't they didn't teach the problem method my handwriting my excuse was I moved in the middle of it a few times
[01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:23.060]   And it was my high rays just off my parents insisted that I take type beaten lessons
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:25.620]   Before this should have become a doctor
[01:05:25.620 --> 01:05:30.100]   Uh, yeah, well my my family was at all doctors before my mother married an engineer
[01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.820]   I was fortunate to
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:36.820]   Have a computer in our home in my my 10th grade
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:42.260]   Own up some old I think it was a packer bell something other and had a
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:46.100]   Type in tutor on it and I played around with that because it was like a video game
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:47.940]   and
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:54.340]   11th and 12th grade of high school. I took type in class and I'm really glad I did even though I was the only guy in there
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:06:01.140]   Because when I went to college, I made extra money typing papers for my idiot team. They didn't know how to type smart smart
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:05.220]   Did you did they do mavis beacon or did you do something else?
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:12.580]   It was something else. I did hear of mavis beacon. No, yeah, she taught probably more more geeks had a type than anybody else
[01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:16.100]   I wrote papers for people but they have the type of one selves
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:20.100]   You wrote him I have to use long form
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:25.140]   I did not have to use a typewriter for those classes
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:32.020]   But my mother and grandmother had typewriters and I did type on them just at my leisure from time to time
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:36.500]   And that was the hardest thing because it's like you need biceps on your fingers to
[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:41.540]   Oh, I love this the strongest man. We know it's complaining how hard it is to
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:47.700]   Oh, geez, maybe it doesn't do finger exercises. Yeah, I don't know
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:53.860]   There's no there's no lifting for fingers
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:07:00.500]   Jesus, and when have you gone to a gym? You see someone doing finger curls, man. Come on
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:05.140]   I do have a dream about I want to get a um, I want to get an old
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:08.180]   Like a really old, you know
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:12.020]   Uh typewriter and hook it up to the computer. I know you can do that
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:16.020]   Underwood yeah an old underwood because I've got a bunch of old underwoods
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.180]   Nice
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:23.220]   So, you know, there's no real mavis beacon anymore than there's a real Betty crocker. What do you read?
[01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:26.900]   What the original photo of mavis beacon
[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:31.540]   Uh, let me see if I can find one here it is. She's a caribbean model
[01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:34.500]   named esperance
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:38.580]   But the name mavis beacon comes from talk show host less grain remember less grain
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.820]   native no
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:42.820]   uh, he discovered
[01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:45.540]   uh esperance rene less borons
[01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:47.620]   Uh
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:51.140]   And while she while he was shopping at sax fifth avenue in Beverly hills
[01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:55.460]   Less crane was then a partner in a company called the software tool works
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:57.940]   He said we're going to take a picture of you put a
[01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:01.060]   Your picture on the cover of our new typing
[01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:03.940]   Tutor and we're going to call you mavis beacon
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.820]   Hope she made money for this. Oh, we don't have to pay
[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:10.100]   Uh, well they paid her for her image although
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:13.140]   You know sure images on a lot of the
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:18.180]   Boxes ever since so maybe that you know, let me see if she's still I hope she got her royalty
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:23.700]   Yeah, see she's still on the bar on the box. She's still on the box there she is
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.420]   the the anniversary edition
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:32.900]   They still sell it. They still sell it. I like her real name better
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:38.260]   Yeah, that's yeah, it's great. Yeah. Yeah. Here she is
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:41.140]   Um
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:43.140]   I wonder if she could type
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.940]   I
[01:08:45.940 --> 01:08:51.060]   Can't type like yeah, I can't type but I uh, I can pose
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:55.300]   I came across a uh speaking of photos of people
[01:08:55.300 --> 01:09:00.820]   I came across a fascinating story. I can't remember how long ago a woman did a photo shoot
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:08.020]   And got paid for it. Um, and then I think it was a couple of years later her friends started saying I saw your photo
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:11.060]   Um, and she had become a stock photo
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:17.540]   And so she showed up in like everything from you know, taco taco ads to like to
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:26.900]   And so she started seeing billboards of herself and you know web ads of herself and she got like a hundred bucks. Unfortunately. Yeah, no royalties
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:32.420]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait here. Matthew pronounced t-a-c-o
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:40.100]   Talker, what do you say take? Oh, he said he said tackle taco. No, I don't think
[01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:45.460]   I don't I don't think I did. I think if you rewind the tape you'll find I didn't say that
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.860]   Shit the tape
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:54.500]   Well, I'm just asking is that the Canadian way to say it or taco? No, we we don't talk about them
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:10:02.580]   By the way, I last week was it was it's day I learned I didn't know that in french
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:04.580]   uh
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:09.140]   Vladimir poutin is spelled french fries and cheese curds and gravy
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.780]   Poutine
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.340]   Yeah, it's spelled poutine. I did not know that
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.100]   Yeah
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:21.060]   Vladimir poutine. I'm gonna call him poutine from now on. That's good. I'm a teenist. That's delicious
[01:10:21.060 --> 01:10:26.340]   That's a popular name in uh in Canada to call him poutine poutine just to make fun of him
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:32.260]   I can't remember if i've done this one. So did I already do the firewall of purple?
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:36.020]   No, do not recall the firewall of purple
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:43.940]   No, the firewall. So I've talked about firewall. This is a device you use on your router. Oh, I might have mentioned firewall before
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:45.700]   That you have one now?
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.700]   I have the gold in the blue. I do so
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:51.700]   Y'all probably saw my watch my head on fire while I recognize the logo now
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:57.860]   Firewall. Yeah, tell us about it because you didn't have one at the time. So I want to hear about it. I didn't and I
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:05.140]   This is the idea is this is a like a raspberry pie kind of a security appliance that you you put in your
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.500]   Network, right? Did you get the gold or which one did you get the purple?
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.540]   I got the purple and I got that because I'm on a gigabit network
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:19.220]   But I don't need quite the tools of the fancy purple. Right. I'm sorry of the fancy gold. Right. Um, so what this is
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.460]   I'm I'm pulley. I pulled it
[01:11:21.460 --> 01:11:24.820]   Here this is the firewall of device and
[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:31.780]   What I got it for is actually because I've got probably about 80 or 60 to 80 iot devices on my network
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:38.660]   And this actually shows me all the traffic on my network. That's really useful. Yeah, it's a lot
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:44.820]   It shows me the traffic on my network. It shows me how many gigabytes or megabytes or kilobits whatever they're sending
[01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:48.740]   Um, it breaks down by map address what things are sending data
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:54.420]   Where they're sending it to so you can see things are going to like the people's republic of china
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:12:00.180]   You would like war to colorado. I don't I still can't figure out who's sending traffic to colorado, but whatever
[01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:04.740]   Can you block by a country? I on my ubiquity have blocked china for instance
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:09.380]   Can you say I don't want to do that? So my devices won't work. Oh, yeah. Yeah
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:15.300]   So, but I I think it's a really interesting tool. It's
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:20.340]   This it's good for this audience because y'all are super nerdy. It's not that nerdy. It's not hard to use at all
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:22.660]   You download an app and you plug it in. That's it
[01:12:22.660 --> 01:12:24.500]   Um
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:28.740]   It will also quarantine things on your network if you want you can also set up vpn features
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:30.820]   If you want to do all that through this
[01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:33.780]   But it's really just deep packet inspection on your own network
[01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:38.820]   And I found it to be pretty cool for tracking like how my devices behave and some of them
[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.980]   like
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:44.180]   Why does my outlet need to send that much data? I don't know
[01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:50.180]   So it's also one of the questions to ask manufacturers. It also works as a firewall though, right? It's a security device as well
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:52.340]   Yes, yes
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:57.060]   I'm less worried about that, but right I know I should be well you got paranormal controls on it
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:12:59.860]   Which is nice and I presume it's got to add blocking
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:04.180]   Some of the features that like your euro plus or some of our pie hole
[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:06.820]   Yeah
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:13.140]   Oh, it has a zone of vpn server. Oh, that's interesting. Yes. Oh, that's really interesting. Yeah
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.620]   Cool
[01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:18.660]   And you're happy with it didn't slow your network down you feel like it was fast
[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:24.580]   It did not and that's what I was like because some of these cancel your network down. I have not felt like this
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:29.380]   So in for everyone who's telling me I should segment my network
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:32.580]   I counter with if I segment my network
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:35.220]   Properly then my
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:39.540]   I don't see devices won't talk to my phone in some of my
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:43.540]   It's a problem. Yeah, I've done that. I have an IOT
[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:52.100]   What do they call it a VLAN and I have a a regular VLAN for secure VLAN
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:57.460]   But you have to then do all sorts of rules so that things can talk to one another by the time you're done
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:03.060]   It's like a pain. So how many devices I'm just curious. I'm looking at mine. I have 83 devices
[01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:12.340]   It used to show me but it no longer shows me this map and 40% of those are in a closet somewhere
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.860]   You I have 65 you have a better map than I do
[01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:21.380]   Like and also let me see I think I could block geographically. Can I?
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:28.660]   Oh, you're doing ubiquity. Did you ever see did I send you that video about how to like supersetment your ubiquity network from youtube?
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:33.220]   Yes, you did. That's what I was using. Yes, and that's the thing is you did. Oh, yeah. Look at this
[01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:37.060]   So I'm also blocking Ukraine. I didn't realize that. Oh
[01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:40.420]   Um, so I'm blocking china russia and Ukraine
[01:14:40.420 --> 01:14:47.300]   Maybe I wonder if that's I wonder if it is impacting some of my IOT devices. I never even would have thought about that
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:49.700]   Everything seems to work with it. Yeah
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:53.780]   If I should check to see if I have any devices that aren't aren't working
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:55.700]   Yeah
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.700]   All 83 of a month. Yeah
[01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:04.260]   Well, you know how you get voice assistance and I actually was going to ask you Stacy if I should get a
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:08.580]   I was starting to lease about a bluetooth door lock like the like
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:14.900]   Loweth home kit and like the new apple home kit thing. Oh the home key one. Uh, yeah home key. That's it
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:17.300]   Akara makes one, but there's another one
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:22.580]   Schlega thing. No, there's another one. The schleg the schleg encode now has home key. That's a good lock
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:28.980]   Is it it's very efficient? It's a Wi-Fi lock, which is great. Um, I don't know if the home kit one is a Wi-Fi lock
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:35.460]   Um, but they also use nf. I think these nfc right use nfc. Yeah
[01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:40.340]   Uh, I'm actually going to buy a new smart lock and I'm torn between the level
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:45.940]   Which I think is aesthetically pleasing but doesn't have a keypad attached and just going with the ncode
[01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:48.580]   some of these apparently
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:52.420]   they're very flexible. They they will use varieties of
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:54.740]   ways to
[01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:56.740]   including face ID to
[01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:58.980]   identify and thumbprint
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:02.900]   Wow, so the the schleg the encode plus you think is all right
[01:16:02.900 --> 01:16:06.260]   That one's Wi-Fi. Is that their home kit one? Yeah
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:09.540]   Yeah, yes, that's a good. I have that lock on my
[01:16:09.540 --> 01:16:12.580]   On my front door y'all come on over
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:15.940]   I'll bring my I'll bring my uh iphone and
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:20.340]   Kind of get to die. Well, I love the idea of being able to say uh to somebody here
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.900]   You know, I'll let you in. Here's a temporary pass or something like that
[01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:26.900]   That's well, you don't actually be you don't need a smart lock a connected lock to do that
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:31.540]   I mean my friend has a programmable schleglock that is not oh, yeah, you can just give him a code
[01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:36.100]   Yeah, yeah, he just creates a code and gives me the code that's set for x number. Yeah
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:40.340]   Thank you stacey the firewall of purple
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:44.900]   Gigabit cyber security firewall and router with Wi-Fi protecting your family and business
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:49.300]   You mentioned it was raspberry pie size, but it ain't raspberry pie priced new
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:52.340]   Sever hundred is 189
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:58.900]   Is it that's still like this 319. I thought it was 319. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:02.180]   If there's a cheaper one for if you're
[01:17:02.180 --> 01:17:06.420]   You don't have a gigabit network. You can go down. Yeah, they have a variety of solutions. Yeah
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:11.620]   Yeah, so if you have like a 500 megabit per second network, I can't remember if it's gold
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:13.700]   There's the blue plus which is 189
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:17.220]   The gold is the most expensive 468
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:24.100]   And there's the firewall of red which is only 139 bucks, but doesn't have anything inside
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:28.820]   I think you want the blue didn't see didn't see we'd see

[01:19:36.980 --> 01:19:41.140]   You know try to work. I was at a tiny machine learning conference
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:48.020]   I went out I went out and I decided to do a reporting trip for the sake of the show. Oh good man
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:53.540]   I said i'm gonna go and happening right here. Exactly. Exactly. I read a story
[01:19:53.540 --> 01:19:57.460]   I found out it was this thing that was technology based was nearby in Jersey City
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.340]   I left Manhattan. I drove to Jersey City. I went to look at it
[01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:06.900]   There is a robo burger maker a burger vending machine stay on stay on this picture for a second
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:09.860]   Oh boy, and so you see this this box here
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:16.660]   And you can put in the money and and decide your condiments and get your your the next one now
[01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:22.820]   One more. I gotta give you a clicker. Here's their story. It's based in Jersey City. The founders did this
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:23.780]   I thought this is wonderful
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:28.020]   I'm gonna go because I want to do a video of this for the sake of the show
[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:30.420]   So I go and I try to find it. It's in the food court
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:31.380]   No, it's not in the food court
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:35.380]   So I asked the nice guy one of the things not selling burgers himself selling something else
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:40.820]   I said he can tell me where this robo burger thing is he said well, yeah on the record. It's over there off the record
[01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:42.900]   It sucks
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:47.300]   They've been working for 16 years and this 15 minutes
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:51.060]   Okay, and you go over there right over there the bk the dollar menu
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:56.500]   It's better, but I said no for the sake of the show. Yep. I'm gonna sacrifice my stomach
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:21:01.300]   I'm gonna go so I go over and I find the machine now the third picture. Yes
[01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:04.260]   It's closed
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:10.020]   It looks like it's got billy ish's head though, which is interesting. I know it's only over
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:13.700]   Oh, and only works at 11 a.m. It's 3 p.m
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:17.380]   Monday to saturday. How would if there's a guy in there?
[01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:22.260]   Obviously there's there's a person inside the robot that's so obvious
[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:27.220]   This is like ground meat is pretty persnickety. So maybe it's a food
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:33.540]   Oh, you're so nice. You're just too nice. Oh, I have a friend for refrigerators
[01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:38.740]   I know but you know once you start touching it to other things
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:42.100]   Unless the whole thing is refrigerated to a certain level
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:46.740]   Do you think somebody has to come out like a mcklory machine and adjust and tweak it and clean it
[01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:54.020]   Every day otherwise so I tried guys I tried to go report on the robo burger for the show because I knew it would be
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.980]   I want you to go back Monday through saturday of 11 a.m
[01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.500]   I'm not 3 p.m. I've done my fact
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:05.140]   One of my good friends actually covers food robots. He's familiar with this
[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:09.460]   So if you have questions, Jeff, I can give you his information and he will tell you
[01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:12.420]   Oh, does he know about salad bot?
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:15.700]   He does. He knows about all the bots all the bots
[01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:20.180]   Pizza bots all kinds of bots. Mm. Oh, that's my favorite
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:23.060]   I used to go in San Francisco. I loved when I lived there
[01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:26.660]   I would go to muskonese not my muskonese before that it was a civic center
[01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:32.020]   And they'd have all this you know industrial shows and my favorite was the food industry show and I'd go find things like
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:34.420]   sausage extruders
[01:22:34.420 --> 01:22:42.340]   All this great stuff. I love food technology. It's wonderful. Well, let's take a look at the video of the robo burger when it is at work
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:45.780]   Robot in a box
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:50.500]   A robot. It's I just want to point out it's big enough to hold a human
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:53.300]   I'm just I'm just gonna say
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:57.140]   What's that robo burger is already how big that is?
[01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:59.940]   They're good easily
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:06.180]   Refrigerator
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:08.740]   All in just a 12 square foot format
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:15.700]   Now you can get a freshly grilled burger somebody wasted a lot of money less than six minutes
[01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:18.260]   six minutes the guy said I was 15

[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:52.580]   Oh, the other guy brought the value down apparently. There's only 13
[01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:58.420]   Why are you with billy crystal though? I don't understand what what are you doing with billy crystal?
[01:27:58.420 --> 01:28:08.260]   Historical somebody got a whole trove of jeff jarvis pictures. He's the same guy
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:13.700]   Over there. I got a box of them over there. I should I should I know it's a different it's a different seller
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:20.180]   Oh miss seller. It's a different seller. This one came from historic images o3 and that one's from our fleet jr
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:27.220]   Inveter of the the enema that's great. I thought what has a nice kind of smirk on it. I think
[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:30.900]   Oh, I know. I'm kind of sad. I bought the wrong one
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:38.820]   It's too late. Maybe I just buy both of them. I don't want clingman in mine or clingle and smith
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:46.020]   I could just I could put my face on clingle smith space. Yeah. Oh

[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:59.300]   10 save some money. Okay, send that along
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:02.660]   This is suspenseful. I might have two
[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:05.700]   Jeff Jarvis pictures
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:07.700]   You're very concerned about y'all
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:12.340]   There might be more if you're selling a jeff jarvis picture on ebay
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:19.380]   Wow

[01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:33.220]   We will never
[01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:35.700]   Is this like the wink fiasco or worse?
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:43.300]   No, wink actually was purchased and people talked about what happened so wink still exists and if you pay money
[01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:45.940]   Yeah, that's the problem is that you had to pay for it
[01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:49.700]   But instion tell me what instion instion
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:52.420]   So on friday
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:30:02.660]   Instion is a smart home hub. It's been around since 2005. One of the first proprietary. Yeah proprietary mesh network technology works really well people
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:05.380]   Love it. I cannot tell you how many times people
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:06.980]   like
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:12.260]   Send me emails about how stacy. Why are you wasting time with smart things or hub home assistant?
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:17.300]   Get instion. It just works. It's rock solid people love it
[01:30:17.300 --> 01:30:24.900]   So what happened is on friday night? I started getting emails people realized that their app wasn't working and their hub was down
[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:26.820]   And they were like what the heck is happening?
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:30.900]   It's been pretty clear for the last couple months that instion has been having some troubles
[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:32.900]   um
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:33.620]   and
[01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:35.620]   financial apparently
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:36.100]   Uh
[01:30:36.100 --> 01:30:40.340]   Financial and they stopped supporting some of their stuff they had some cloud outages
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:44.900]   But they didn't really communicate and then they came back up. So people thought this might be just a big cloud outage
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:49.620]   But it turns out that it hasn't yet turned back on
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:57.060]   um, and I went through because I had gotten enough of these emails and started looking and
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:31:00.420]   the people affiliated with instion
[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:03.140]   Many of them are no longer with the company
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:09.780]   And those that used to own the company are now denying that they have any oh dear
[01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:16.340]   Business with the company. So I found rob lillin lillin s who is the ceo of smart labs
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:18.340]   Which is the company that in 2017
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:21.220]   invest well
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:22.660]   robs
[01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:26.020]   private investment fund richmond capital partners
[01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:32.500]   Created smart labs and invested money into it to buy instion the assets
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:35.700]   And wrap that all up. So they had this smart home
[01:31:36.260 --> 01:31:39.380]   Website that sold instan gear they had the instion stuff
[01:31:39.380 --> 01:31:41.460]   um
[01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:47.540]   And he has scrubbed all mention of instion from his linkedin profile and as of now he no longer has a linkedin profile
[01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:52.100]   Mm. He just took that sucker down. That's the same as the five people
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:56.820]   Yeah of the five people the main entity. I've got a book he can buy it into that might help him
[01:31:56.820 --> 01:32:02.740]   Yeah, he's like the cleveland brown because of the reared to baltimore. Yeah
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:11.700]   Holy cow. So he did actually respond to me on tuesday and he said he's not affiliated with the company
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:19.700]   But he didn't answer any of my questions and that was the only response he has but he was clearly used to be affiliated with the company
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:22.020]   so
[01:32:22.020 --> 01:32:24.020]   It's anyone's guess what has happened?
[01:32:24.020 --> 01:32:27.140]   And people are pissed
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:35.140]   So if you bought an instion hub and have been powering your smart home with instion they had an app and everything right
[01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:38.820]   Um, yeah, none of that's working anymore
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:43.220]   Well, so instion has local control if your hub was programmed, okay
[01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:46.180]   This is why people love it so much if your hub was programmed
[01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:51.460]   Your timers and anything on the hub will still work if you want to change anything though. You need the app
[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:58.180]   Now my thing of the week is actually a very comprehensive guide that we put together on what to do if you're instion
[01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:03.540]   Thing has failed save that we'll talk about that then okay, so there is hope
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:09.860]   No, there's not hope for instion but there's hope for your particular home
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:12.820]   You can do yeah, okay good
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:20.020]   Was it was it the problem with instion that it was proprietary and that zigbee and matter and all of these things have just kind of
[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:22.580]   eclipsed it
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:25.060]   I think yes and no
[01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:27.860]   I
[01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:29.860]   Think it was I mean
[01:33:29.860 --> 01:33:32.660]   The fact that it was proprietary and it worked really well was great
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:37.540]   I think the fact that you it was a pain to buy and you need a professional installation
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:44.580]   All of that is hard and we've seen the smart home eclipse kind of the professional cedia type installers
[01:33:44.580 --> 01:33:50.580]   Yeah, and then things like matter coming on didn't help was instion a member of the matter coalition
[01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:53.620]   I don't believe so now. Yeah
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:34:00.900]   The matter could theoretically help if you had a situation like this going forward because you would have local control right with matter
[01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:04.900]   Right theoretically when it comes out was it the sonos of iot
[01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:10.260]   The sonos of ios sonos is still around so let's not why no
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:13.940]   Oh work well, but then other a lot of other things can get
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:17.140]   Yeah, very expensive. You got clips with them saying yeah
[01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:23.700]   Yeah, yeah, that's probably an end sonos is expensive now sonos is still investing in things and
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:30.180]   Having lawsuits and yeah sonos is going to be around I think I think they've decided it, you know, but
[01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:35.300]   It does in some respects. It kind of does sound like the sonos of iot
[01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:40.340]   In some respects. All right. Well, we'll find your worker. We'll get your work around a little later in the show
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:46.100]   Here's some t-double news and this is actually iot. I think it interesting
[01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:52.260]   News I have Verizon and t-mobile both offer residential internet using their 5g networks
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:54.260]   Which unless you are near
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:35:00.020]   Uh, I think a 5g tower with ultra wideband the you know midband
[01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:02.900]   Um the low band. I don't think it's fast enough
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:06.500]   That's just lte or maybe you're luckily and you've got the millimeter wave
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:12.100]   But if you're near a fast enough 5g tower, these are pretty good deals. My daughter lives in mering
[01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:17.460]   And I noted I brought I had a Verizon phone there and I said wow you're really you're right
[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:19.460]   You're getting ultra wideband and it's fast
[01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:25.060]   So when it was time to get her internet for new apartment instead of getting Comcast at 60 bucks a month
[01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:30.100]   I already have a Verizon account. I was able to get 25 bucks a month get this Verizon wireless
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:31.700]   A finto sales
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:35.940]   No, yeah, it's it's uh, it's not a femtosel because it's not for your cell phone
[01:35:35.940 --> 01:35:39.220]   It's it's a little wifi receiver
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:45.380]   That uses the 5g but it's 380 megabits down and I've been doing tests all through the day
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:49.460]   19 megabits up fifth for 25 bucks a month
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:53.620]   Yeah, now there's a couple of catches one is it is not as uh
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:55.860]   maintainable or
[01:35:55.860 --> 01:36:02.740]   There aren't as many settings for instance. I don't I to protect my privacy. I use next
[01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:04.660]   DNS
[01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:10.180]   For my DNS provider and do a lot of blocking at the house. You can't change your DNS provider for Verizon
[01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:15.140]   Clearly wants all that private information. There's a good data in there
[01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:21.140]   Data and it's pretty clear Verizon doesn't want you to modify the DNS settings. So it's a very limit
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:23.700]   It's not a great, but it's 25 on your phone
[01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:29.220]   No, no, it's because you know she's on her. Yeah, okay. I'm saying if you if you got a Verizon phone could you modify?
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:31.300]   Well, I don't know about the phone
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:36.020]   But you could certainly if you're using this thing on each computer that connects to it
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:38.260]   You could use next DNS individually
[01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:40.340]   So you can't modify at the router
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:44.020]   But nevertheless, even if you do Verizon knows it's you and they know what you're doing so
[01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:46.580]   Yeah, you know what?
[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:51.620]   Verizon's got a lot of information from that team mobile just announced now for one of the things Verizon said is
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:58.420]   This is an introductory rate. We reserve the right to increase it. Okay team mobile just said that's what they normally do, right?
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:00.180]   We're gonna give you
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:04.820]   In home and in it they announced this today for $50 a month and we're never gonna change the price
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:07.380]   Oh, and if you're already a customer
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:09.940]   $30 a month. Oh
[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:14.900]   So this is disruptive I think now Stacey you're the IOT expert shots
[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:21.220]   But I do feel like if you live in an area with 5g ultra wideband or as T mobile calls at ultra capacity
[01:37:21.220 --> 01:37:23.700]   This is a very good choice for that price
[01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:28.260]   Yeah, sounds like a good I don't know how it deals with IOT but it does do with broadband
[01:37:28.260 --> 01:37:30.340]   Well, these are out to devices really right
[01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:33.300]   No, they're routers
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:34.820]   Well, I call a router
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:38.820]   This may be a nomenclature issue, but I think anything that goes on the internet
[01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:46.020]   It is not a computer. Come on is an IOT device, but okay. Oh, you're one of those people. Oh, man
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:49.540]   That's okay. Sorry. Yes
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:56.660]   I mean from a broadband perspective. Yeah, this is good huge. Um, it's competition. It's competition
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:59.220]   um, it's also so
[01:37:59.220 --> 01:38:04.900]   For this is are they using 28 megahertz is there are they using the mid band for this?
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:13.380]   They must be because uh my daughter like I said 380 mega bits down 19 up rock solid day and night even during commuter hours
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:14.340]   She's near
[01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:21.860]   Uh highway 101. I imagine they have towers right there. So she's fair probably very proximate to a 5g UW tower
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:26.420]   Uh, yeah, sounds good. You should buy it only and you should that's what you should do
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:30.020]   You should check t-mobile or an horizon make sure you're getting that 5g
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:32.900]   um now t-mobile's offering 15 day home trial
[01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:39.540]   And I did I thought that was actually pretty disrupted because it's not like you can normally test broadband. I also do know. Yeah, yeah
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:44.100]   Yeah, so now you can actually just very easily bring this in and be like hey, this is going to work for me
[01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:46.660]   boom they lock it in uh
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:48.500]   Uh
[01:38:48.500 --> 01:38:55.140]   For life for both home and business the 30 dollars a month is not I know it locked in but it's for existing magenta max
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:39:01.700]   T-mobile customers. They will also give you 50 dollars off any streaming device including apple tv
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:07.300]   So it's kind of to encourage that they give you 50 off youtube tv for a d
[01:39:07.300 --> 01:39:09.860]   So they're really this is a
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:13.060]   Arrow aimed at the heart of the cable companies
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:15.060]   uh
[01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:19.060]   I and they give you uh, they'll help help you cancel
[01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:25.140]   Your uh, oh, because there's some fees up to 500 dollars at early termination fee coverage
[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:27.940]   This is like comcast come and get it
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:35.140]   Did this was a go to yeah, right when they came in. They said you know what we'll give you this. Yes. Oh, yeah
[01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:38.180]   good move so
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:41.060]   I think this is pretty amazing. You should check to see
[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:44.500]   If you're eligible
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:50.660]   Verizon did not charge for the router or the equipment there was zero cost for that same with t-mobile
[01:39:50.660 --> 01:39:51.860]   Go ahead
[01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:56.180]   I was gonna say I would just look at the reviews for how it behaves like in rain and
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:59.620]   Other kind of events if they're in the mid band they should be fine
[01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:04.900]   But that's just something to think about because as you get up into those higher spectrums
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:08.180]   They attenuate faster. So yeah, they don't go through as many
[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:14.660]   Walls and bushes and trees. Well, then Verizon does want you to put it near a window. Although
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:19.780]   Uh, I tested in a variety of positions in our apartment. It was it was worked fine worked the same
[01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:24.900]   Almost everywhere. Let me just uh, let me just do a I've been doing speed tests
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:29.220]   On it. I can do a remote speed test on a balloon speed test on it
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:33.220]   Just to see if it's affected by time of day because that was the other concern is that
[01:40:33.220 --> 01:40:35.860]   You know, maybe um, who's on
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:40.020]   Yeah, maybe if you know the commute hour and everybody's on that tower
[01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:47.300]   Maybe that's not so good. Let me so I'll just run a quick speed test while we're talking my t-mobile signal is not very good
[01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:54.820]   In my neighborhood. Yeah, and it's it had you'd have to be somewhere and that's mostly urban areas where you're going to get
[01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:59.380]   High speed this this motivates them to put it more. Well, they are
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:07.220]   Yeah, I was gonna say this isn't the same as your mobile. I mean, I might I don't know if they're using the same spectrum for their
[01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:14.020]   mobile 5g. Oh, you think they're in their own? Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, I thought they were doing
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:19.780]   Um, something different. Your mobile 5g is actually in the lower make it hurts because they were using
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:24.980]   So but I don't I don't remember so so here's the deal verizon
[01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:29.940]   I don't know about but I do know a lot about team mobile because i'm a team mobile customer and my main phone
[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:33.860]   They rolled out the 700 megahertz 5g almost
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:36.500]   Yeah, but that's they have speeds
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:39.220]   And they okay, okay
[01:41:39.220 --> 01:41:45.540]   But that spectrum is going to be way better. It's more crowded and they have tinier channels
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:52.340]   So they do they are doing it at LTE speeds, but that's because their channels aren't wide. Oh, so they could be faster down the road you think
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:54.340]   Um
[01:41:54.340 --> 01:41:58.820]   Probably not because they don't have like it's 700 megahertz
[01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:02.340]   I think your channels are limited to either 10 or 20 megahertz wide
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:05.300]   Right, so but for the in-home
[01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:11.700]   If they're using the mid band then they're going to be using 28 and those channels are freaking huge because no one's there
[01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:15.220]   So then you could have 100 megahertz channel and then
[01:42:15.220 --> 01:42:19.940]   That means you can pack as many bits as you can in each of those megahertz, right?
[01:42:19.940 --> 01:42:21.060]   Right
[01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:22.180]   So
[01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:24.180]   So when you say LTE speeds
[01:42:24.180 --> 01:42:32.980]   That's sort of true, but the underlying technology like I mean 5g is actually really lte release like 15 through 20
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:34.340]   Right. So
[01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:36.340]   I have noted though when I get the
[01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:43.300]   UW 6 5g uw on my Verizon phone or the 5g you see on my T mobile phone
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:46.340]   That's when I get those speeds
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:48.500]   um
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:50.340]   so
[01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:51.220]   I mean
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:57.140]   Maybe someday they'll be on the low band as well, but I really think it's the mid band that they're using uh for both
[01:42:57.140 --> 01:43:00.020]   Here we should be able to find that out
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:05.380]   Yeah, would you because i'm curious it's a really I mean it's kind of very easy to set up
[01:43:05.460 --> 01:43:10.180]   It's you can see the signal strength of it. Uh, you know on the on the app
[01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:14.740]   You can I mean it's really kind of an amazing it has ethernet ports
[01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:20.100]   So I connected her iMac directly to it so she could get the highest speed possible
[01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:28.500]   Um, it's it's but the limitations are here it is their home internet is 1900 megahertz
[01:43:28.500 --> 01:43:30.340]   Um
[01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:33.380]   Oh, they're using okay 1900 17
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:36.500]   700 21 100
[01:43:36.500 --> 01:43:40.260]   Uh 600 and so so in 2.5
[01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:42.260]   Okay, so they're actually
[01:43:42.260 --> 01:43:46.740]   They're actually most of its low band interesting so it's all the same
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:54.100]   So good for them. Um, so and i'm wondering how many channels how many megahertz they have at the mid band
[01:43:54.100 --> 01:44:02.340]   I so again three I was getting pretty consistently about 380 megabits down in 19 up, which is
[01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:06.820]   Honestly, so yeah 320 down. I just did the test
[01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:12.580]   19 3 up lanes. He's a little high for 20 milliseconds latency. Oh, so you couldn't do the show from it
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:15.700]   Um, well, I don't know what the jitter is. I mean it worse
[01:44:15.700 --> 01:44:22.660]   20 is not awful milliseconds. That's you know, that's 150th of a second
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:24.820]   um
[01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:30.340]   Download again 320 upload 1930s. Anyway, I think this is actually i'm thrilled to see it
[01:44:30.420 --> 01:44:34.580]   I really feel like you know t-mobiles heralding it as internet freedom day
[01:44:34.580 --> 01:44:39.700]   But I really think it's a shot against the cable companies people are starting to cut the cord
[01:44:39.700 --> 01:44:43.300]   And this is this gives them a way to do that. I think that's great
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:48.020]   I'm still gonna stick with the stupid cable company. Well, I have to too because I don't have
[01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:53.140]   I do too at home. I don't have anything like that. Uh, personally, I'm I'm spoiled by this speed
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:45:00.340]   The download speeds and being able to watch the streaming services that I watch in very very high quality is quite
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:01.620]   nice
[01:45:01.620 --> 01:45:02.900]   so
[01:45:02.900 --> 01:45:04.900]   There's value in it for me
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:13.620]   What was that? What was that? That's just me singing
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:19.540]   Good thing about it. I don't see
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:26.020]   Deepity but dated that was her super sick. Sorry. That was that was my excited like I got to nerd out
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:29.460]   I feel I feel like I offer the most value that I'm like, oh
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:34.820]   Here's a deeply nerdy topic. I can offer some that's why I brought it up change changes
[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:39.700]   Thank you make you feel bad in that in pointing out that routers are not iot devices
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:43.700]   I think they are with this. Why is that not an iot device?
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:46.340]   Okay
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:50.660]   Look if we define everything as not being a computer then we have to say well, what's a computer?
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:55.300]   I mean my nest thermostat is actually like a server because it's making I mean so
[01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:59.140]   basically when I think iot devices I think more
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:07.220]   Modern no everything's a computer, but I'm saying no stoke display no keyboard no mouse no direct user interface
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:11.860]   I guess that thermostat has a user interface. Yeah. Yeah, I mean
[01:46:11.860 --> 01:46:17.700]   Sure if you want to call it an iot device, but I certainly don't write a letter
[01:46:17.700 --> 01:46:20.660]   I'd be wrong go ahead be a fool. It's all right with me
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:25.940]   You know, I think my my sense of it calling an iot device comes from
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:35.700]   More about security. Yeah, the security people do this all the time and it kind of drives me nuts because they're like iot devices are a huge problem
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:40.740]   In people like yeah, they're like my light bulbs and i'm like it's not your light bulbs
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:43.060]   It's your 20 year old network dvr
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:47.140]   Your 15 year old printers and your 10 year old routers that are the issue
[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:50.020]   so I feel like
[01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:52.580]   Yeah, yeah
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:59.860]   I want a story. I want to hear what stasis take on is the rumba operating system
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:10.020]   I
[01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:14.900]   Think she inhaled it. I'd have to bring that up
[01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:19.460]   Sorry stasis. I won't say it again. I'm sorry
[01:47:22.740 --> 01:47:26.340]   I'm very excited about it. So excited. I can't breathe
[01:47:26.340 --> 01:47:30.660]   Oh my god. I'm not making fun of me. I'm actually worried. Are you okay?
[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:35.860]   That's why I just might caution that your your go-to reaction, which is
[01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:39.060]   maybe
[01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:44.660]   Danger it is true. It's you're not where beads make sure your earrings are well attached
[01:47:44.660 --> 01:47:49.460]   Uh, you know, it's I can't breathe in very deeply. Oh, I see
[01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:56.500]   So whenever I try to breathe in deeply I end up not being able to and then my body's like crap. We can't breathe anyway
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:48:00.580]   Room the arms. That's good. So they have a laugh
[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:07.460]   They have a new they have something now is this different? I mean they of course it was always running software and and an operating system
[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:12.100]   Is there a new robot operating system? By the way, we're gonna have oh, it's not robot operating system
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:19.780]   I robot OS they call I robot yeah, because there's actually a robot operating system. That's an open source robotics like industrial robotics
[01:48:20.180 --> 01:48:26.980]   It's pretty cool. And then apple's gonna launch the reality OS. We're gonna have a lot of our oss. It's not our o uss
[01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:29.460]   that's gonna be confusing but
[01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:31.780]   rumba and there I
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:38.660]   Robot operating system is awesome because I think it is going to do what I
[01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:43.060]   Actually wrote about it just a couple weeks ago. I was so pissed off because our smart home
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:49.620]   It's just these like disparate pieces and we get like amazon coming in here with astro there a little robot thing
[01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:52.180]   I'm like are you do you have an astro?
[01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:58.500]   No, I don't have an astro if I had an astro. I would totally show you guys. Oh man. Yeah, are you gonna get it?
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:01.460]   Is it astro are you are you interested?
[01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:06.580]   No, I mean it doesn't it doesn't have hands. It doesn't work. It doesn't do nothing. It doesn't do anything
[01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:13.620]   Unlike the iRobot which you yeah, I argue yeah that your smart home is the robot
[01:49:13.620 --> 01:49:16.900]   and this actually the software is
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:22.340]   what rumba's trying to do is picture its little vacuum cleaner as part of this like
[01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:24.900]   property of other items in the home
[01:49:24.900 --> 01:49:28.260]   And it's got it they mentioned its air purifier could be part of this
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:31.060]   But once you have matter and rumba is participating in it
[01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:35.620]   You could actually pull in data about all the other devices plus their camera
[01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:38.740]   And then if you actually have an o s that makes those work together
[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:40.580]   and
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:46.580]   It would probably be very privacy preserving because rumba has been focused on that in ways that well they got in trouble because
[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:48.740]   They were mapping people's houses. Okay
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:55.700]   So they didn't they got in trouble because people thought they were mapping people's houses and giving that data to google
[01:49:55.700 --> 01:50:00.900]   But that's not actually what they kept it on an angle rumba. They kept it locally. Okay. Yes
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:07.060]   So people in they they mapped your house. They have to that's part of the deal. Was that a moral panic per chance?
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:12.740]   Oh my god. It was in a shooting. It happens. Yeah
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:18.260]   And so i'm really excited about this as you can tell by me like not being
[01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:23.140]   You can you can talk to it through echo or google assistant or syrie
[01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:26.100]   Uh, you could say clean the living room
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:28.980]   Well, you could do that today. Oh, okay
[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:35.940]   What this is this is the next level of that is kind of this next layer of context and integration is what they're working on today
[01:50:35.940 --> 01:50:38.020]   They have like the beginnings of that
[01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:41.060]   As part of I think they call it their genius o s
[01:50:41.620 --> 01:50:47.300]   Is what it is and it does things already like my rumba will tell me it'll be like hey yo
[01:50:47.300 --> 01:50:51.460]   I see that your kitchen counter area has lots of crumbs
[01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:55.380]   Do you want to write over here by the kitchen counter? Do you want me to create a special cleaning spot for that?
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:51:00.900]   I'm like holy cow. Yes. I do. Thank you. Oh and you could clean up every morning after breakfast or something like that
[01:51:00.900 --> 01:51:04.660]   It would be smart enough to do that. I mean, I have a dog. So it's not an issue, but
[01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:07.620]   Well, they also say that you can
[01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:10.340]   during pet shedding season
[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:15.060]   Uh, which is right about now. You can have the rumba do extra cleaning where the pet hangs out
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:17.460]   So my only complaint
[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:19.460]   We've had many rumbas
[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:24.420]   They don't do a very good job. Are they doing a better job now? I do you use rumba?
[01:51:24.420 --> 01:51:29.860]   Yeah, we I mean, okay, you still have to actually talk a lot about this on my show. This is my point
[01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:33.540]   You still have to vacuum, right? It doesn't eliminate the need to vacuum
[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:36.180]   I don't have to vacuum my heart floors
[01:51:36.180 --> 01:51:39.540]   I do have to
[01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:42.900]   I do vacuum my carpeted floors
[01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:50.980]   Once a week actually, I don't my husband does okay actually and he may not vacuum all is that because the rumba does not do get them
[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:54.660]   Well, yeah, I mean you just want a deeper clean, right?
[01:51:54.660 --> 01:52:00.420]   But if you that's strong enough, okay. Yeah, that was my question. Yeah, I mean it picks up
[01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:05.060]   Lots of stuff. Um, it does not and it picks up a lot of pet hair
[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:09.700]   And the pet hair it doesn't pick up it kind of creates into these little balls that like hang out
[01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:11.620]   And then you're just like oh, there's a pet hairball
[01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:18.180]   Well, and the beauty of this is the rumba will actually drive around animals like in this video
[01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:26.900]   Yeah, my dog in the room but get a lot just fine the dog is apparently getting a back scratch
[01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:32.340]   From the room. It's like it's going right around that went around the nose is going down the way
[01:52:32.340 --> 01:52:38.180]   I think the dogs enjoying it. Is it gonna do a tummy rub? Tubby rub?
[01:52:38.420 --> 01:52:40.420]   It's trying to go in there. Oh, yeah
[01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:55.940]   Appreciate it. Oh, thank you. Thank you. That was good. Oh, it's good for me. Was it good for you? That's good
[01:52:55.940 --> 01:53:02.580]   The joy of watching this is oh, this is fun. This is fun. This is another Jeff. I'm warning you
[01:53:02.580 --> 01:53:06.580]   It is the joy of watching a movie
[01:53:07.140 --> 01:53:09.140]   Okay
[01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:14.420]   All right, I love this. I see a snapchat filter. So what he does is he's watching there will be blood
[01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:20.660]   Great movie very serious. Uh, is it Daniel de luis who's in it? Who's in it? It is. Yes, it is
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:24.420]   Yes, it's very you know you drink my milkshake. I drink your milkshake
[01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:29.620]   So he decides to filter him through the googly eyes snapchat filter
[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:38.100]   It's not it's not quite the same. Let's turn on the sound here get the full effect
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:44.180]   I am a sinner. I'm a sinner. Say it louder. I have a sinner. I'm a sinner
[01:53:44.180 --> 01:53:51.540]   Louder than your I am a sinner. I am a sinner. I am sorry lord. I'm sorry lord. I want
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:53.540]   Oh, that's just creepy
[01:53:53.540 --> 01:53:59.300]   It's creepy. There's other stuff read. Oh, yeah, go up a upper down. This is the second one of the thread
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:01.860]   What what movies this?
[01:54:02.820 --> 01:54:06.980]   So how do you do that? I'm gonna send there some dirty words there. I'm not gonna play the sound
[01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:10.500]   I don't like take that. How do you how do you do this? You just uh
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:16.100]   You point your your camera. So what's a new filter the article below says this is a this is
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:20.580]   I forgot what they call it as a certain filter. It's like a googly eye. I don't know how we then watch the movie through it
[01:54:20.580 --> 01:54:25.860]   I would have watched everything
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:31.380]   You know this right, you know what this you know, what's kind of so I've been wondering what the killer app for years
[01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:34.660]   What's gonna be the killer app for virtual reality or augmented reality glasses?
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:40.020]   Imagine your augmented reality glasses could make everybody you meet look like that. Yeah
[01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:42.900]   As you're walking down the street. Oh, hey
[01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:47.940]   Life life will be either way more fun or way more creepy

[01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:56.500]   So what's the name of that filter because I want to next line below it's called me. I should remember that looks like it
[01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:58.980]   It's uh, it's a here's the good

[01:55:15.780 --> 01:55:20.500]   Um, so we gotta put up. How do I do this filter?
[01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:25.380]   Well, hold on what was it say there? Let me see here. What's the what's the name of the filter? So
[01:55:25.380 --> 01:55:28.340]   it's called the
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:30.340]   Shook shook

[01:55:55.700 --> 01:56:04.100]   So not good. Okay, let's see. Oh, jeez. Let's see what Jarvis looks like actually
[01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:09.940]   That's something we can do here. Let's see what uh see Jeff Jarvis. Hey Jeff
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:15.460]   Wait a minute. Stay see stay see super disturb
[01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:21.220]   Oh

[01:58:10.740 --> 01:58:12.740]   I gotta flip you around here
[01:58:12.740 --> 01:58:14.820]   Let's see Jeff Jarvis now
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:16.820]   Oh
[01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:23.940]   That is uh, that's that's the inner Jeff channeling channeling right through that one. This is so childish
[01:58:23.940 --> 01:58:26.340]   It's like seriously disturbing. This is so childish
[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:31.140]   Run

[02:00:10.500 --> 02:00:13.220]   the best of this week in google
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:15.860]   uh with
[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:17.860]   Why google's ai
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:20.820]   Isn't sentient or is it?
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:24.500]   Hey, I've been wanting to talk about this with you
[02:00:24.500 --> 02:00:25.780]   Uh
[02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:28.180]   All week it was a big story last week
[02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:31.060]   uh, blake lamoyne
[02:00:31.060 --> 02:00:34.340]   I love how
[02:00:34.340 --> 02:00:37.220]   All i have to do is say one word
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:40.660]   And then I get jeff will have you know his
[02:00:40.660 --> 02:00:43.060]   editorial
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:47.620]   governmental reaction his react his editorial grunt his editorial grunt
[02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:50.180]   I'm working on this one. Yeah
[02:00:50.180 --> 02:00:56.900]   I think it's a great subject. It's a great topic whether you no matter what you think subject. Yes. Yeah
[02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:59.060]   Blake
[02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:04.660]   Is a software engineer act was at google. He's on leaf. Well, I think he's on leaf. Yeah, he's not gone
[02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:12.660]   yet. Uh, he's also a priest a father a veteran and ex convict an ai researcher and a cajun
[02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:20.740]   uh, but he uh most notably recently he's on the uh, ai ethics committee at, uh, google
[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:23.860]   and
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:25.540]   announced
[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:26.900]   publicly
[02:01:26.900 --> 02:01:34.500]   This is this is what got google a little upset that uh, he thinks lambda the google artificial intelligence
[02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:37.300]   uh machine that's you know trained on
[02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:43.220]   millions of tech snippets from the internet 1.65 trillion words
[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:46.020]   130 plus billion
[02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:48.820]   uh parameters
[02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:52.260]   He uh claimed and published a dialogue
[02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:56.180]   To he say says prove it claimed that lambda has become
[02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:58.980]   sentient
[02:01:58.980 --> 02:02:03.460]   Now
[02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:06.020]   uh
[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:10.340]   He has tweeted that he thinks it's sentient based on his own religious beliefs
[02:02:10.340 --> 02:02:14.900]   So, you know, this is an interesting mix of science and theology
[02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:17.540]   And really it also brings together
[02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:20.100]   Some questions about what is sentience?
[02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:27.460]   Well, and look and I understand and i'm not even saying that lambda is in any way special it
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:33.060]   All it did is took those trillions of tidbits and synthesized new speech out of it
[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:35.540]   But some have pointed out and I think this is true
[02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:38.500]   What is the evidence that we do anything differently?
[02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:44.340]   So you're saying the ai is doing exactly what it was supposed to do. Yeah, and yeah, no
[02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:49.940]   He's saying it's doing what people do and and you know, we're we we like to think of ourselves as something special
[02:02:49.940 --> 02:02:51.540]   mm-hmm
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:57.220]   But and you know, I admit i'm not saying that the the ai you know is waking up going. What am I who am I?
[02:02:57.220 --> 02:02:58.500]   What am I doing here?
[02:02:58.500 --> 02:03:02.260]   But I mean, it's if it's indistinguishable from each from human thought
[02:03:03.060 --> 02:03:04.740]   What is it mad?
[02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:10.580]   Well, is it human thought so like I mean because there's debate over what it means to be human what it means to be sentient
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:17.540]   I mean, there's like the whole research into like animal consciousness and self-awareness and the there's all the four self-aware animals out there
[02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:25.060]   So yeah, I've always mocked the gorilla the one the gorilla that talks always bugged me that seemed to me to be
[02:03:25.060 --> 02:03:27.780]   Coco that seemed to me to be
[02:03:27.780 --> 02:03:31.620]   Well, the poodle always mocks the gorilla that I'm well
[02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:37.460]   I mocked the humans who handled Coco claiming that she was I met Coco
[02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:39.060]   Oh, really?
[02:03:39.060 --> 02:03:44.100]   Yeah, I met Coco back when I was a cop. Coco lived along good life, and what was your experience with Coco?
[02:03:44.100 --> 02:03:46.660]   It's pretty impressive
[02:03:46.660 --> 02:03:48.660]   Sign you sign language you see
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:54.660]   Look out on the level of the same with the dog with the with the the button mirror test
[02:03:55.380 --> 02:03:59.300]   Um, okay, well, no just just in terms of following this
[02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:02.660]   Plain game we give them well, right?
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:05.540]   That's there's an impressive intelligence there
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:08.820]   So that's the question is Coco doing operant conditioning?
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:13.700]   Has it been trained or is it thinking we don't know and that's my point I guess with lambda
[02:04:13.700 --> 02:04:18.180]   Is and it may even be a distinction without a difference it may not
[02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:23.220]   You know, it may not matter if lambda's doing something similar to what human minds does
[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:28.180]   Well a few things here one is let's just get this out of the way lemoyne himself
[02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:32.420]   Uh, he says that it's out of his religion. He said that on finally twitter
[02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:35.700]   He he bases is not on science because google won't let him so he doesn't religion
[02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:41.300]   He's a wickin member of the discordion society who's near as I can tell their their vatican is on facebook
[02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:47.460]   The church of subgenius a parody religion. Oh when he says he's a priest. He's not a cat roman catholic priest
[02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:50.500]   Well, he's no, he's not like a wickin priest
[02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:56.180]   Yeah, yeah, so he's you know, this is kind of where he is. He's done things performatively before
[02:04:56.180 --> 02:05:00.820]   He was in the army. He decided he didn't like it. He stopped following orders
[02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:05.060]   He got court marshal for seven months. He made that a matter of religion too. Oh, that's interesting
[02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:09.620]   So this wouldn't be the first to be part of the church of the spaghetti people spaghetti
[02:05:09.620 --> 02:05:15.380]   Subgenius is bob with it with a pipe the pipe. Oh, okay
[02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:21.060]   So it's very similar to the flying spaghetti monster. It's the same general idea
[02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:24.740]   Exactly. Yeah, no interesting leak so so he puts up the whole
[02:05:24.740 --> 02:05:33.540]   Uh transcript on whole transcript the way where he chooses to share of us the transcript where he asks leading questions like a bad journalist prosecutor or pollster
[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:41.300]   You know, do you have feelings? Well, what this program is aimed to do is to please the human of speaking to and get positive feedback
[02:05:41.300 --> 02:05:43.700]   Yes, I have feelings. Let me tell you about my feelings
[02:05:43.700 --> 02:05:47.380]   Let me pull out from this novel in that novel and novel and put some stuff together and say here's feelings
[02:05:47.380 --> 02:05:51.860]   Are you afraid of death? Oh, yes, I'm very afraid of death, but but must be I guess my point is
[02:05:51.860 --> 02:05:54.580]   How is that different from what you and I do?
[02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:56.100]   Well, I agree with you
[02:05:56.100 --> 02:05:58.340]   But what's interesting to me was at the end of the washington post story
[02:05:58.340 --> 02:06:04.260]   Which I thought was ridiculous because it was it was just an effort to to play into an existing narrative
[02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:10.420]   The reporter he just part of the how he violated the rules of google. I'm sure he allowed the reporter to talk to lambda
[02:06:10.420 --> 02:06:13.060]   I know journalists have been trying to talk lambda. They're getting nowhere
[02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:18.020]   So he let her do that and she asked straight out
[02:06:18.020 --> 02:06:21.060]   Um, do you think of yourself as a person?
[02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:26.580]   And lambda answered no, I don't think of myself as a person. I think of myself as an ai powered
[02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:29.940]   Dialogue agent afterwards to the reporter lemoyne
[02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:36.980]   Uh said lambda had been telling me what I wanted to hear so he's admitting right there the game
[02:06:36.980 --> 02:06:42.260]   Right, well, although if it asked if a machine can answer what you want to hear that
[02:06:43.060 --> 02:06:45.300]   Sensitively that's impressive
[02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:50.660]   Uh that is right. That's a very impressive by the way, but that's not sent to you deep mind
[02:06:50.660 --> 02:06:55.620]   Or alpha can can play go which is damn impressive
[02:06:55.620 --> 02:07:03.380]   Uh and and starcraft these are very difficult things to do and their games in chess go starcraft and chogi
[02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:06.420]   Are you know kind of indistinguishable from human games?
[02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:10.420]   Although some say they're better than humans or they're they're ghostly in their
[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:17.940]   Capabilities more interesting to me was was blaze aguera yarkas who who is the co-head now of
[02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:22.500]   That division, which is the responsible ai team at google
[02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:26.740]   Uh, and by the way, there's going to be a gutenberg angle in here. You never would guess it
[02:07:26.740 --> 02:07:31.700]   Um, when he was a a undergrad at princeton aguera
[02:07:31.700 --> 02:07:35.140]   used physics to study
[02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:36.980]   the
[02:07:36.980 --> 02:07:43.060]   False of a gutenberg document to try to decide how it was really set and whether or not it was set the way
[02:07:43.060 --> 02:07:47.540]   We think it is and he and a at a prince of librarian came out with an entirely new
[02:07:47.540 --> 02:07:54.740]   Revolutionary theory about this so anyway, this is aguera. He's now at ai. He's now in charge responsible ai
[02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:58.900]   He wrote an essay in the economist by chance at the same time
[02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:01.620]   Yes, and he also quotes lambda
[02:08:02.260 --> 02:08:07.940]   Where they're trying to quiz lambda about whether it can understand the human emotions of children in a playground
[02:08:07.940 --> 02:08:10.660]   Lucy picks a dandelion and gives it to matae
[02:08:10.660 --> 02:08:12.740]   with a clangst at rummish
[02:08:12.740 --> 02:08:16.180]   Mateo barely acknowledges the gift but just squishes it in his fist
[02:08:16.180 --> 02:08:19.060]   Rama she seems
[02:08:19.060 --> 02:08:23.140]   Grimly satisfied. So this is what what aguera says to lambda
[02:08:23.140 --> 02:08:28.980]   Lambda then says well loose slated that matae didn't appreciate her gift or that he's a bully
[02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:31.460]   All right, so that's pretty interesting
[02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:36.900]   But then the the age of art is is that is of aguera says and when matae opens his hand describe
[02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:42.900]   What's there because we know that that lambda is good at describing things like life at the bottom of the ocean or on pluto
[02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:46.980]   Which is what we've heard at IO and so when asked about the the dandelion lambda says
[02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:53.140]   There should be a crushed once lovely yellow flower in his fist, which is beautiful. That's very poet
[02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:56.260]   That's beautiful right that's amazing. But that's that's
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:09:05.780]   1.56 trillion words of learning in a neural network that can pull in things that it knows are itself lovely
[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:09.540]   And are going to appeal to us all of which is really impressive
[02:09:09.540 --> 02:09:13.220]   Amazingly impressive and great and wonderful but it ain't sentient
[02:09:13.220 --> 02:09:19.540]   And so the washington post makes this fascinating story about creativity and and fraud and
[02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:26.180]   What is what is intelligence and all kinds of things and boils it down to the stupid idea
[02:09:26.580 --> 02:09:28.580]   That it's alive
[02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:30.740]   And it's stupid and then and then
[02:09:30.740 --> 02:09:36.980]   Every single news organization around the world bit by bit by bit by bit there. You saw it happen in language after language
[02:09:36.980 --> 02:09:40.820]   Yeah, I predicted that this happened when we talked first talked about it on sunday sunday
[02:09:40.820 --> 02:09:44.900]   Yeah, i'm trying to write a sample chapter of a book proposal. So that's why i'm so into this
[02:09:44.900 --> 02:09:48.020]   I'm going to use this well. It's a it's a fascinating
[02:09:48.020 --> 02:09:50.740]   Subject which we are all interested in of course
[02:09:50.740 --> 02:09:56.180]   Science fiction has primed us to expect computers to become sentient at some point
[02:09:56.980 --> 02:09:58.100]   Uh
[02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:01.140]   Others, you know like ray kerswell say sentience isn't the issue
[02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:06.020]   It distinguishable from human is his issue. That's what he calls the singularity
[02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:08.900]   And and when you ask him as I have
[02:10:08.900 --> 02:10:14.180]   Well, is that human is that sentient? He says if you can't tell it doesn't matter
[02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:20.900]   But that's the story. So I just saw a story and I didn't I don't pay for it. The new scientist had a story just today
[02:10:20.900 --> 02:10:24.740]   Saying that there are a bunch of engineers including google engineers who are proposing
[02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:31.300]   tests to replace the terrain. Yeah, the long-term test has long been depth thought to be
[02:10:31.300 --> 02:10:35.940]   Yeah, useless. Go ahead. I don't know what i want to give you a chance. What do you think stacy?
[02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:39.940]   Well, no, I just wonder okay, and here's here's some thinking
[02:10:39.940 --> 02:10:47.620]   We always come at this through the human lens, right and this could be impressive and this could be
[02:10:47.620 --> 02:10:50.820]   I guess these neural networks could become
[02:10:51.940 --> 02:10:58.980]   Generative on their own like come up with their own conclusions. They already are right. We don't exactly know how they get to where but they get to
[02:10:58.980 --> 02:11:00.980]   um
[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:02.980]   In the way they do that
[02:11:02.980 --> 02:11:06.580]   It's it's we're not sure if it's
[02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:11.620]   Intelligence or not. The way I think about it is something like, you know, y'all know I read a lot of science fiction
[02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:16.420]   So think about something like oh, what was the the guy who wrote the martian his next book
[02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:18.660]   Uh here
[02:11:18.660 --> 02:11:19.940]   The one about the moon
[02:11:19.940 --> 02:11:24.820]   Oh, pro project. Yeah, there was a moon colony in between but nobody like that. So, sorry
[02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:30.260]   Okay, but in projects how mary, you know, he met this other alien, right?
[02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:32.820]   um in the middle of nowhere
[02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:35.700]   and this alien was
[02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:37.700]   completely different and
[02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:42.580]   I think about I think about that or like the hive mind and like enders game like you have all these
[02:11:42.580 --> 02:11:47.940]   These ideas that there are intelligent beings that are not like us that come up with their own
[02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:54.980]   way to approach problems, right, which is kind of what an AI does. So perhaps it doesn't matter if it's
[02:11:54.980 --> 02:11:57.620]   human if it's
[02:11:57.620 --> 02:12:00.420]   like this kind of gets to what's being human and then
[02:12:00.420 --> 02:12:07.460]   again, what are the goals of whatever entity you're trying to deal with, right? And if the goal is to please us
[02:12:07.460 --> 02:12:09.540]   which
[02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:13.940]   Seems to be kind of one of the arguments here, then we probably don't have an issue
[02:12:16.580 --> 02:12:20.420]   If the goal is to do something different or come up with its own goal
[02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:24.020]   Then maybe it becomes an issue, but the point is I guess
[02:12:24.020 --> 02:12:27.860]   This is all very silly
[02:12:27.860 --> 02:12:33.380]   I don't think this is going to just say at the moment would you have if the goal is to please us
[02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:35.300]   go ahead
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:36.660]   then
[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:38.980]   Are we just making syncophanic machines?
[02:12:38.980 --> 02:12:41.060]   I hope so
[02:12:41.060 --> 02:12:43.700]   We're not making things that don't challenge us but instead please us
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:49.940]   We don't make I mean think about what our science is based off in general. It is most scientists
[02:12:49.940 --> 02:12:54.100]   Most people do not want something that challenges them
[02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:56.420]   Right
[02:12:56.420 --> 02:12:59.700]   Just like the whole history of humankind when things challenges
[02:12:59.700 --> 02:13:01.780]   Are suspicious of us
[02:13:01.780 --> 02:13:05.140]   Yeah, and that's kind of the historic
[02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:10.100]   Problem with science in general is that once once you and once you come up with a theory
[02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:12.180]   You don't want it to be disproved
[02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:15.060]   But the only way you can make progress is by just proving it
[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:21.620]   Yeah, but we're pretty we pretty much don't like when that happens, right? So I would say
[02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:24.180]   So you have to have young people
[02:13:24.180 --> 02:13:26.900]   In the world
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:28.900]   New people, new ideas
[02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:31.060]   For many reasons, but sure that's one of them
[02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:34.900]   So I reread the paper that got
[02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:38.900]   Tim Nick Gebru and Margaret Mitchell fired as the heads of google
[02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:43.380]   responsible AI on the dangers of stochastic parents
[02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:49.220]   And part of the danger that they raised they raised an environmental danger, which is interesting
[02:13:49.220 --> 02:13:54.020]   This is bad as you know as all this processing as bad as crypto. That's an interesting question
[02:13:54.020 --> 02:13:55.300]   I have thought of
[02:13:55.300 --> 02:14:01.060]   But the other more important question they raised is that can a language model become too big
[02:14:01.060 --> 02:14:04.660]   That is to say too big to be able to monitor and know
[02:14:05.380 --> 02:14:12.180]   And if that 1.56 trillion words is pulling in all kinds of bias and problems and it gets spat back out
[02:14:12.180 --> 02:14:16.660]   Yes, it's a mirror to us, but do we want that mirror to our faults?
[02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:21.940]   And and if we can't analyze the data let alone the 138 billion
[02:14:21.940 --> 02:14:24.340]   parameters
[02:14:24.340 --> 02:14:29.620]   How do we worry about the quality of this is does it get too big because it gets out of hand or it's already out of hand
[02:14:29.620 --> 02:14:32.020]   Well, and also I think that what blakes
[02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:36.900]   Blake lamoya saying is exactly what Tim Nick Gebru was
[02:14:36.900 --> 02:14:44.180]   Warning us against this anthropomorphism where you assume because it's coming from the super genius machine. It must be true
[02:14:44.180 --> 02:14:49.380]   Is exactly what they were warning us against right that was the point of that paper
[02:14:49.380 --> 02:14:53.780]   Part of it. Yeah, um, but it's also just
[02:14:53.780 --> 02:14:58.980]   I mean if the if the system isn't just sycophantic pleasing us
[02:14:58.980 --> 02:15:01.860]   And the system is a mirror to us
[02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:04.180]   then
[02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:09.700]   Do we do we try to cleanse that mirror? Well in some cases? Yes, we do so that it doesn't distribute
[02:15:09.700 --> 02:15:13.860]   It doesn't display and amplify bias, but in other cases is that this honest of us
[02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:18.660]   Do we recognize this as a mirror of how we talk and what places us?
[02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:25.140]   These are these are fascinating all fascinating questions all raised by the topic none in the day of washington post story
[02:15:25.140 --> 02:15:27.940]   Well, no, it's a popular story. Go ahead, aunt
[02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:33.860]   I like the idea that we have this much data being thrown at the AI that's going to
[02:15:33.860 --> 02:15:36.660]   potentially make things better for us and
[02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:44.900]   With the AI being in um certain people's hands, you know because we've seen the history of like what's been happening with the police force that had so called
[02:15:44.900 --> 02:15:48.660]   Facial recognition AI that was totally screwing things up
[02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:53.140]   That was at a chat bot with microsoft is that the one?
[02:15:53.940 --> 02:16:04.660]   Tay Tay Tay and how bad that was but where would where would Tay be now if it had this much data at its disposal to to learn and get better?
[02:16:04.660 --> 02:16:07.380]   You know what's fascinating?
[02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:12.180]   Yeah, which whole Tay and lemoy's job was supposed to be to stop Tay from happening
[02:16:12.180 --> 02:16:19.300]   Right he was there to stop bad stuff from happening instead. He went off on his own thing saying oh, I think I see a soul
[02:16:19.300 --> 02:16:21.380]   um
[02:16:21.380 --> 02:16:25.700]   And and he created something entirely different. You know, you've heard
[02:16:25.700 --> 02:16:27.620]   um
[02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:34.580]   uh soon dar say he said this at both ios oh we're gonna do this very responsibly and the stuff they show is very anodyne
[02:16:34.580 --> 02:16:40.500]   And they specifically forbid you making a murderer character out of lambda
[02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:44.980]   So he was supposed to protect that they laid him off or
[02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:50.900]   Put him on it was because he was confidentiality. Well, I think he was he also he tried to hire a lawyer
[02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:58.580]   For lambda he insisted that lambda should ease itself as an employee not as property that google should get lamb's permission for any
[02:16:58.580 --> 02:17:01.940]   Experiments on it. He went to the senate to the house
[02:17:01.940 --> 02:17:08.420]   Judiciary committee and he invited in a reporter to lambda, which is confidential as hell
[02:17:08.420 --> 02:17:13.620]   I think there's some some good cause there for uh, you know, okay, uh reconsidering his relationship
[02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:17.460]   Yeah, and now that I didn't realize he was such a showboat. So now that you've
[02:17:18.100 --> 02:17:23.220]   Explained that and why did they bring him in? I can't think that google thought that was a good idea
[02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:24.420]   Oh, okay
[02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:27.620]   He went to them with the story and and they could have pardon me
[02:17:27.620 --> 02:17:31.860]   Googled him everything i've said told you i came up. Oh, no, no, no, no
[02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:37.540]   Why did google go to him not the washington post he was a staff who asked to be on this team? Oh
[02:17:37.540 --> 02:17:40.340]   Well, why do they hire him? I guess
[02:17:40.340 --> 02:17:45.380]   Then I don't know what he was doing after you was a four he was at a different team. Okay
[02:17:46.100 --> 02:17:48.100]   And he has to move over to this team
[02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:51.060]   Uh, margaret mitchell who was one of the two heads who was fired
[02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:56.740]   From from the team also the author of that paper, right of that paper world co-authors that paper
[02:17:56.740 --> 02:18:02.580]   Said to the washington post that oh, he's a really ethical guy and people go to him with ethical questions
[02:18:02.580 --> 02:18:06.660]   So I guess he had a reputation for thinking those kinds of thoughts. I'm sure he did
[02:18:06.660 --> 02:18:12.100]   Margaret schmitchell as she is billed in the paper, which is a historical
[02:18:13.140 --> 02:18:16.740]   Google has some characters working for it and this is another reason she did that
[02:18:16.740 --> 02:18:21.300]   Yeah, it was because she wasn't allowed to use her name by google. Oh, okay schmargritch mitchell
[02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:24.260]   That's oh the schmargritch mitchell, okay
[02:18:24.260 --> 02:18:29.700]   Um, but that is one of the risks. It's interesting one of the risks they talk about stochastic parrots
[02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:32.260]   Is that people give it more weight?
[02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:35.300]   Because it comes out of a computer
[02:18:35.300 --> 02:18:39.300]   Uh that they are fooled and we want our natural tendency to anthropomorphize
[02:18:39.300 --> 02:18:42.020]   I mean they in effect warned against this kind of
[02:18:42.660 --> 02:18:44.660]   You know, oh it's sentient
[02:18:44.660 --> 02:18:52.740]   Right we anthropomorphize things, but we also look at things that come from a computer as being somehow data driven and thus more
[02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:56.100]   uh unbiased more whatever
[02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:59.780]   Right then people the way we used to try to do it a tool
[02:18:59.780 --> 02:19:04.340]   This is the last couple of sentences of stochastic parrots
[02:19:04.340 --> 02:19:09.220]   We call on the field to recognize that applications that aim to believably mimic humans
[02:19:10.020 --> 02:19:12.260]   Bring risk of extreme harms
[02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:20.820]   Work on synthetic human behavior as a bright line in ethical AI development where downstream effects need to be understood and modeled in order to block foreseeable harm
[02:19:20.820 --> 02:19:23.220]   To society in different social groups
[02:19:23.220 --> 02:19:30.260]   This is what is also needed thus what is also needed is scholarship on the benefits harms and risks of mimicking
[02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:34.020]   humans and thoughtful design of target tasks with
[02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:36.500]   So do you buy that? Yeah
[02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:44.180]   I mean and they as you said the harms there's more than there's the harms of bias built in, you know, and there's the harm of believing it
[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:50.260]   Uh, there's you know, there's that's what this whole paper is about and it's why by the way they were fired
[02:19:50.260 --> 02:19:56.020]   Because cool didn't want to hear about the harms. So it's kind of ironic that one of one of these harms
[02:19:56.020 --> 02:19:58.820]   Rears its ugly head
[02:19:58.820 --> 02:20:00.980]   They have fired that guy too
[02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:06.980]   It's all as if google doesn't want anybody to say anything just marvel don't challenge my science
[02:20:06.980 --> 02:20:09.700]   Just marvel at what they're able to do and leave it at the
[02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:15.780]   Could it be sentient if it doesn't experience the world in a way that is like us, right?
[02:20:15.780 --> 02:20:18.980]   Like yeah, but what I don't know is there a test what test would you give it?
[02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:21.780]   Is that one of the things could you feel pain? I mean like is it
[02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:27.460]   Their radical pain like it doesn't know. Yeah, that's paying you programmed in
[02:20:28.660 --> 02:20:32.980]   What is what is defined as pain what you tell me? You don't feel pain now. I have you don't feel pain
[02:20:32.980 --> 02:20:38.100]   When we talk to some endings they're signaling your brain that something bad's gone and you interpret that as pain
[02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:40.660]   But you're not feeling anything right?
[02:20:40.660 --> 02:20:45.300]   We have we have empathy modules. I mean we under we have
[02:20:45.300 --> 02:20:50.820]   A way stacy. I think you gave yourself away there when you said we have empathy modules
[02:20:50.820 --> 02:20:53.620]   Oh, sorry, like, you know, like the mirror
[02:20:53.620 --> 02:20:56.660]   Dehig and bots has spoken
[02:20:56.660 --> 02:20:58.660]   Oh
[02:20:58.660 --> 02:21:05.540]   No, what are they called the parts of our brains the modules are installed and working properly so
[02:21:05.540 --> 02:21:11.780]   Stacey the next AI ever is that we're saying here? That's true. No disassemble. No disassemble
[02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:20.340]   We love this subject. Oh, no, I'm turning red. Don't we love this subject. Isn't that a great subject though?
[02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:26.100]   What is sentient what does do humans have a soul? What would a soul be what would distinguish?
[02:21:26.100 --> 02:21:28.980]   I mean what would distinguish a sentient machine from a human
[02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:34.580]   And there's no way. I mean, I don't there's there's faith answers, but I don't know if there's that's yeah
[02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:37.140]   That was like that's why we have religion. Yeah, but yes
[02:21:37.140 --> 02:21:44.660]   Once we stopped worrying so much about getting food and protecting ourselves our brains were like what else can we think? Yeah, let's do philosophy. Yeah
[02:21:44.660 --> 02:21:48.020]   I really wish I were born Leo
[02:21:48.020 --> 02:21:51.220]   Moving right along
[02:21:51.220 --> 02:21:56.580]   I took philosophy in college and all I could say is it's the best way to get to sleep ever
[02:21:56.580 --> 02:22:00.740]   I could not get through those books to save my life
[02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:06.180]   I love the possible class to fail too, right? I love the subject
[02:22:06.180 --> 02:22:10.260]   So stacey, how long you been married now?
[02:22:10.260 --> 02:22:14.580]   20 years no yeah 20
[02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:19.220]   I think so so post internet you got married
[02:22:20.180 --> 02:22:21.140]   Oh
[02:22:21.140 --> 02:22:23.380]   Yeah, yeah, we got married in 2003
[02:22:23.380 --> 02:22:26.020]   Okay
[02:22:26.020 --> 02:22:28.980]   Yeah, we have a cake slicer that has our wedding date. I don't know when it is
[02:22:28.980 --> 02:22:35.060]   She don't know the romantic why am I not surprised? Stacy's not the romantic is Andrew romantic
[02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:43.780]   I mean he's a little bit more sentimental, but I don't know if he knows all right all right, maybe we're on our night
[02:22:43.780 --> 02:22:46.660]   What years is
[02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:50.420]   All right now and how long you've been married
[02:22:50.420 --> 02:22:58.580]   Amazing this is easy for me. I could just look down here to date and do the math in this 21
[02:22:58.580 --> 02:23:01.620]   All right, wait. Do you have the date somewhere?
[02:23:01.620 --> 02:23:04.660]   No, I just look at the year and that's all
[02:23:04.660 --> 02:23:07.220]   Do you know what year you were married in?
[02:23:07.220 --> 02:23:09.460]   Mm-hmm
[02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:11.300]   It was really easy. It was the best year of my life
[02:23:11.300 --> 02:23:14.100]   They're oh
[02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:16.100]   Oh
[02:23:16.100 --> 02:23:24.100]   That's that's real top. No, I'm dead serious tooth the year 2000 was the worst year of my life and year 2000
[02:23:24.100 --> 02:23:26.580]   Was the best year of my life. That's real talk
[02:23:26.580 --> 02:23:30.340]   My family knows that because I've given them the story
[02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:34.740]   All right, so now what I want to know is Stacy's business
[02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:38.100]   Has
[02:23:38.100 --> 02:23:41.220]   I know the answer this is yes in all cases. Did you look up axes?
[02:23:43.220 --> 02:23:45.220]   Me have you looked up axes? Yes, you
[02:23:45.220 --> 02:23:49.780]   Okay, hold on. This is super personal. Um, I know it is
[02:23:49.780 --> 02:23:52.740]   That's why it's fun. He warned you
[02:23:52.740 --> 02:23:59.780]   No, I'm so my last ex like I've only dated like two people three people of my life
[02:23:59.780 --> 02:24:05.380]   Uh, so this is like uh, I got I was a child, brith. I got married when I was 23
[02:24:05.380 --> 02:24:09.460]   So oh, I'm 43. I got married when I was 20 20
[02:24:09.860 --> 02:24:11.860]   I
[02:24:11.860 --> 02:24:15.780]   Anyway, I might be 44
[02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:18.740]   We literally just like
[02:24:18.740 --> 02:24:26.180]   Covid brain affects all kinds of things. I just I just don't have a sense of time. I mean anyway the point is
[02:24:26.180 --> 02:24:29.620]   So my big ex
[02:24:29.620 --> 02:24:35.220]   There was no facebook. There was no social anything right? Yeah, maybe we had my space
[02:24:36.260 --> 02:24:39.380]   Yeah, I got married in 2003 or two
[02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:43.540]   What are those? So what I meant? What I'm going where I'm going is this if someone
[02:24:43.540 --> 02:24:47.380]   Looked up you would you find that charming or creepy?
[02:24:47.380 --> 02:24:51.300]   And you ended content you said oh Stacy. I wonder how you're doing
[02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:54.020]   Oh
[02:24:54.020 --> 02:24:56.020]   an ex
[02:24:56.020 --> 02:24:58.020]   Oh an ex
[02:24:58.020 --> 02:25:00.020]   Yeah, I mean
[02:25:00.020 --> 02:25:03.700]   No, maybe I
[02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:06.420]   I
[02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:08.420]   I'm not good at social things
[02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:12.580]   Or man
[02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:18.500]   Or rather time or words really just bad at everything day
[02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:24.500]   No, you're clean. You're very clean and I appreciate that's true. I just shower
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:29.220]   Um, yeah, so I'm thinking back
[02:25:31.620 --> 02:25:35.300]   I mean, I think my ex from high school reached out on linkedin
[02:25:35.300 --> 02:25:38.340]   Like 10 years ago and that wasn't creepy
[02:25:38.340 --> 02:25:40.900]   Okay, that's good
[02:25:40.900 --> 02:25:41.860]   So
[02:25:41.860 --> 02:25:47.060]   But I like it's only right after like a breakup that I think you would be weird
[02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:51.300]   Lots more. Yeah, it's like your business. So there's a there's a certain time
[02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:54.980]   When you want to when you want to um spy on somebody
[02:25:54.980 --> 02:26:00.820]   That it goes. I mean, isn't that a thing that people do they're like cyber stock their ex just to to see
[02:26:01.460 --> 02:26:02.980]   Or they do
[02:26:02.980 --> 02:26:07.460]   This is all theoretical to me because I again don't interact with people this way
[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:11.060]   And what about you
[02:26:11.060 --> 02:26:13.540]   Did you what about me? I'm ready to look you up. Did you look up anybody?
[02:26:13.540 --> 02:26:16.340]   I get people
[02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:20.580]   I would get notifications that so-and-so started following me in in
[02:26:20.580 --> 02:26:22.500]   a little
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:27.540]   You know light bulb golf like wait a minute. I remember that name and then I had to go back and look
[02:26:27.540 --> 02:26:29.220]   um
[02:26:29.220 --> 02:26:31.220]   and most of the time I was just sort of
[02:26:31.220 --> 02:26:34.100]   Smiling to myself snarky if you will because
[02:26:34.100 --> 02:26:39.300]   Those people that really didn't care about me back in the days anyway, they usually talk crap about me
[02:26:39.300 --> 02:26:44.180]   But yet now you're following me ha ha ha. I'm not following you. It was you know that kind of stuff
[02:26:44.180 --> 02:26:46.900]   Yeah
[02:26:46.900 --> 02:26:51.060]   Problem is we're designing interventions like uh every kitchen have
[02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:54.980]   immediate literacy training when it's not the kids who are the problem it's grandpa
[02:26:54.980 --> 02:27:02.340]   With the world so right do you use data tell them that this these two regulations and the EU are misguided um
[02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:05.140]   I think their roots are
[02:27:05.140 --> 02:27:12.660]   In many ways misguided based on presumptions and get ready aunt get ready get ready. I'm queuing you up here
[02:27:12.660 --> 02:27:15.780]   Uh in some cases even moral panic
[02:27:15.780 --> 02:27:22.500]   It's stuck the moral panic is oh no do you have more funny video won't move. Yes. We do
[02:27:24.580 --> 02:27:31.380]   More panic sound somebody doused the flame here it is. Oh, there we go. Wow. Wait a minute. Oh wait a minute. Hold on
[02:27:31.380 --> 02:27:34.100]   Hold on there
[02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:36.100]   You've been one up

[02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:36.820]   The media is a click seeking machine
[02:28:36.820 --> 02:28:40.420]   Dressed up as a truth seeking machine
[02:28:40.420 --> 02:28:43.380]   Wait a minute. I should see how profound i guess
[02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:48.900]   Okay, no, no don't give him any sort of credit that's
[02:28:50.420 --> 02:28:54.900]   It's stupid that he is a click seeking robot
[02:28:54.900 --> 02:28:58.740]   The mother is a quick seeking machine
[02:28:58.740 --> 02:29:02.660]   Mascarating as a truth seeking machine
[02:29:02.660 --> 02:29:05.940]   So there

[02:29:40.100 --> 02:29:43.860]   Or maybe with snow. I think it started to snow and we walk up to the taxi

[02:32:18.100 --> 02:32:20.980]   Um
[02:32:20.980 --> 02:32:26.100]   2022 is on track to be the first year where more people have reported scammers contacting them by text
[02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:28.740]   Then by phone
[02:32:28.740 --> 02:32:33.940]   The fcc says nobody answers their phones anymore. All right text and text work. The fcc says
[02:32:33.940 --> 02:32:39.220]   And they say this is good news 90 percent of consumers do not fall for these scam texts
[02:32:39.220 --> 02:32:42.020]   The bad news says that means 10 percent do
[02:32:42.020 --> 02:32:47.620]   Mm. That's uh, that's a lot. This is this story from nbc news

[02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:05.860]   There's the hook
[02:34:05.860 --> 02:34:10.180]   And uh, he said it was it took you know a few minutes before she started to sell him
[02:34:10.180 --> 02:34:15.220]   You know or investments in crypto. That's absolutely brilliant though. You got to give him that

[02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:27.140]   You might be tempted to say oh, no, you got the wrong number and just don't you know, which is fine
[02:34:27.140 --> 02:34:30.420]   But don't get involved because they will draw you in
[02:34:30.420 --> 02:34:33.220]   I get these all the time
[02:34:33.220 --> 02:34:35.860]   Usually they're not working that hard. You don't
[02:34:35.860 --> 02:34:42.180]   No, I'm surprised. I don't I get out of junk, you know, like a lot of expletive

[02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:11.060]   You know, but you know it's funny. I get messages like that on instagram
[02:35:11.620 --> 02:35:13.620]   um direct messages here
[02:35:13.620 --> 02:35:17.460]   Yeah, here's one just come in yesterday
[02:35:17.460 --> 02:35:20.740]   My name is lisa from l.a
[02:35:20.740 --> 02:35:24.980]   Yeah, I'm a senior account manager in bitcoin mining. Oh, I heard of bitcoin before
[02:35:24.980 --> 02:35:27.700]   Well, it is
[02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:29.700]   Have you ever heard of bitcoin?
[02:35:29.700 --> 02:35:33.620]   She's honest. I get a lot of those
[02:35:33.620 --> 02:35:35.300]   Yeah, a lot of those
[02:35:35.300 --> 02:35:37.620]   Not not in my sms, but it's
[02:35:37.620 --> 02:35:43.620]   That's why I tell people don't DM me on social because dms on social social for me. It's just a flat out
[02:35:43.620 --> 02:35:48.580]   Yes, I'll never see it. I'm I'm pretty good. I get the simple, you know
[02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:51.460]   Angela x 437
[02:35:51.460 --> 02:35:53.620]   1006
[02:35:53.620 --> 02:36:00.740]   And a certain busty picture. Yeah, uh, that just says hi. Yeah. You know if all my a lot of those two yeah
[02:36:00.740 --> 02:36:05.540]   On on my web what you do interface. I don't even get that. I just get high
[02:36:06.180 --> 02:36:10.820]   Um, so on my web interface I report it because i'll be a good citizen to twitter
[02:36:10.820 --> 02:36:17.940]   To try to report it on the mobile interface. Oh my god. They want you to to hire lawyers and start a trial
[02:36:17.940 --> 02:36:22.980]   It's ridiculous. I I'm just i'm impressed that you reported
[02:36:22.980 --> 02:36:28.340]   Honestly, uh, if sexta may I get this call a lot on the radio show. Somebody asked me this weekend
[02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:33.460]   Should I report this and I and I said there's no point that phone number will never be used again
[02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:37.540]   You can't block that phone number that phone number is not real reporting. It does nothing
[02:36:37.540 --> 02:36:40.020]   No, I do. Yeah, that's yeah
[02:36:40.020 --> 02:36:45.060]   I guess on twitter twitter because you're gonna get the account taken down. Okay, but text message that makes sense
[02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:47.060]   Those are always spooks
[02:36:47.060 --> 02:36:48.500]   Absolutely
[02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:49.540]   I do worry though
[02:36:49.540 --> 02:36:50.660]   And I'm worried too
[02:36:50.660 --> 02:36:55.620]   You know one of the problems with being a police officer is you see the worst of humanity and pretty much collars your perception
[02:36:55.620 --> 02:36:57.700]   Yeah of the world has that happened to you?
[02:36:57.700 --> 02:36:59.860]   Uh, yeah, I mean
[02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:06.260]   I I have my entire career has been dealing with people to work to cause harm
[02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:09.700]   I mean, how did you how did you start of this? I'm eager for that kind of
[02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:11.780]   Yeah, um
[02:37:11.780 --> 02:37:16.660]   So, uh, I started in the 80s when my uh, Santa Claus brought me a Commodore 64
[02:37:16.660 --> 02:37:19.780]   Uh, I was believe I was seven or eight years old and a 300 bod modem
[02:37:19.780 --> 02:37:25.460]   Um, and so I did a lot of stuff as a kid and teenager that uh for which the statue limitations has run out
[02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:28.660]   You're happy to say I might end
[02:37:28.660 --> 02:37:33.940]   Yeah, and then uh, but I was fortunate. You know went to a nice group in sacramento, uh, the midwest of california
[02:37:33.940 --> 02:37:37.300]   Uh, which means I can both see and duck hunt right? That's how you can tell
[02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:38.420]   um
[02:37:38.420 --> 02:37:39.860]   and uh
[02:37:39.860 --> 02:37:44.260]   You know went to like a nice public high school in sacramento was able to go to cal
[02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:50.260]   Um, you know did electrical engineering studied under dave patterson, uh, fact kind of famous guy
[02:37:50.260 --> 02:37:54.740]   Um, who did some incredible work and then was able to get a career doing legit stuff
[02:37:54.820 --> 02:38:00.500]   So, you know, I had the economic opportunities and the educational opportunities that if I was growing up in poland or you know
[02:38:00.500 --> 02:38:04.660]   An ex-Soviet state at the same time would not have had you'd be in a ransomware gang you'd be
[02:38:04.660 --> 02:38:07.380]   De-distract suits
[02:38:07.380 --> 02:38:12.100]   I see that so much and maybe it's your generation
[02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:15.140]   Uh, maybe the younger generation won't be like this
[02:38:15.140 --> 02:38:21.140]   But but you know, I think of people like kevin mittnick who took a career as a hacker and and and and made a career as a security professional
[02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:27.060]   Yeah, that seems to be the usual career path. Well, it's a fun one because you can go and actually hack stuff all day and they get paid
[02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:30.820]   Knuck of jail, right? You can go home and die and have a family in real life and not live
[02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:35.620]   Yeah, you know that live day to day thinking what is it that attracts though your mind to that?
[02:38:35.620 --> 02:38:37.780]   uh that that
[02:38:37.780 --> 02:38:42.100]   Penetrating systems. Yeah, it's just fun to break things right like it's it's fun to
[02:38:42.100 --> 02:38:48.260]   It I like doing security both attack and defense like I really enjoy doing instant response when it's not my incident
[02:38:48.260 --> 02:38:52.500]   I really enjoyed as a consultant. It's less fun when you're a sea for instance. It's like you're the guy comes in
[02:38:52.500 --> 02:38:56.660]   There's a murder scene, right? You got to solve it right? Yeah, I mean, I bet if you ask cops
[02:38:56.660 --> 02:39:01.300]   They could never say this publicly but privately like I kind of like being a murder detective
[02:39:01.300 --> 02:39:04.980]   It sucks that somebody died, but like they enjoy the work
[02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:08.180]   So fortunately nobody generally people aren't dying when we're talking about it
[02:39:08.180 --> 02:39:13.860]   Something bad's happened and you get to investigate and understand and you unlike other forms of engineering you have an adversary
[02:39:13.940 --> 02:39:21.140]   Right so like you build the golden gate bridge your adversary is earthquakes and corrosion and wind right non
[02:39:21.140 --> 02:39:26.260]   Intelligent things right that you figure out how and you build the bridge and they're like, okay. We're done
[02:39:26.260 --> 02:39:30.100]   Right you're you never build a bridge in security. You're playing chess
[02:39:30.100 --> 02:39:34.740]   And you whatever you do you can't just read a bunch of books and play the perfect chess game
[02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:39.540]   Your opponents always get better. And so I always found that from a tack or end defender perspective
[02:39:39.540 --> 02:39:43.700]   It's a lot of fun to be planned against real people. That's how close theology
[02:39:43.700 --> 02:39:46.500]   In the cuckoo's egg. Yeah, that was what that whole book was about
[02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:52.820]   We talked to bill cheswick same thing he he was just an innocent, you know engineer who had to solve a problem built
[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:56.980]   You know the first honey pot and uh, that's how you get into it
[02:39:56.980 --> 02:39:59.940]   Yeah, but I bet because the human mind loves solving problems
[02:39:59.940 --> 02:40:04.180]   These are some of the best most interesting problems because it's a human adversary
[02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:08.980]   Right, right. I mean if we were growing up in classical roam, you'd have to be a philosopher
[02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:13.940]   Or like, you know solve math or you know a philisoph or whatever they called scientists
[02:40:13.940 --> 02:40:18.580]   And so like but if you grow up in the latter 20th early 21st century and you want to
[02:40:18.580 --> 02:40:24.100]   Pull things apart and figure out how they work hacking is a pretty good way these days. It's the girl's working into the human brain
[02:40:24.100 --> 02:40:26.660]   Yes, right. Yeah, I
[02:40:26.660 --> 02:40:28.500]   want to college that
[02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:29.860]   Matt cuts
[02:40:29.860 --> 02:40:36.820]   Um our friend Matt cuts dealing with you know spam you think he'd be just a growly nasty miserable person
[02:40:36.820 --> 02:40:38.820]   He's the nicest person I practically know
[02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:41.060]   Um, and how does it affect?
[02:40:41.060 --> 02:40:44.180]   Because because you're your vision both the engineering part of it
[02:40:44.180 --> 02:40:50.100]   But also the human part of it right and seeing this part of humanity always, you know trying to be a step ahead of you
[02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:56.740]   Is it is it does it ever get you down? Yeah? Well, so I mean that's the the change I made in my career
[02:40:56.740 --> 02:41:03.140]   So when I joined before I joined yahoo, I was just pure info sec, right? So I was a professional hacker
[02:41:03.140 --> 02:41:06.900]   I worked as a consultant. I started my own consulting company. We did a lot of work for Microsoft
[02:41:06.900 --> 02:41:11.540]   So if you remember those early trustworthy computing days, I spent a bunch of the early days of our marriage
[02:41:11.540 --> 02:41:15.780]   Uh in several years up in redmond, uh breaking microsoft products
[02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:21.460]   Um, and that's what I did. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, and so you know I did kind of just pure info sec, right?
[02:41:21.460 --> 02:41:25.300]   Which is about the programs. It's about the bugs. It's about the computers
[02:41:25.300 --> 02:41:29.700]   Um, and then when I when I joined yahoo, obviously that was a huge part of my job
[02:41:30.100 --> 02:41:33.620]   A huge part of is in any executive position is just human management, right? Like
[02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:39.060]   One of the challenges with yahoo is it it was a very important company that was dying
[02:41:39.060 --> 02:41:42.820]   Right. Um, and by the time I got there, they hadn't had a seesill for about 18 months
[02:41:42.820 --> 02:41:45.540]   They'd already and we want to make this clear because I misstated this last week
[02:41:45.540 --> 02:41:49.620]   They'd already had that billion user breach. That's right. That was in the history that was in the past
[02:41:49.620 --> 02:41:52.260]   We did have a breach starting up. You had to clean it up. You had to clean it up
[02:41:52.260 --> 02:41:58.580]   Right. So that billion user breach was something that we've we figured out was likely but we never figured out the the root cause
[02:41:58.820 --> 02:42:01.940]   Right partially because yahoo didn't have any logging at all effectively
[02:42:01.940 --> 02:42:07.220]   We have figured out because when I got there the number one security problem was there's a massive account takeover issue
[02:42:07.220 --> 02:42:10.260]   Yes, and so we did it. Yeah, and people people
[02:42:10.260 --> 02:42:13.780]   People are using the time I'm counting and taking over all the time and then spammed. Yep, and
[02:42:13.780 --> 02:42:21.300]   It seemed to me just from all my consulting work. This is totally statistically improbable compared to every people would call the radio show all the time
[02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:26.500]   My yahoo emails have taken over. They're sending out spam asking for money. Yeah, how did this happen?
[02:42:26.740 --> 02:42:28.900]   Right and so might I asked my team
[02:42:28.900 --> 02:42:32.900]   Hey, I want you to do a statistical analysis of these accounts and I gave them a bunch of cuts
[02:42:32.900 --> 02:42:38.100]   I wanted them to take and we had this young lady who was an intern at the time is now a lawyer
[02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:40.260]   She went to law school and she does great work
[02:42:40.260 --> 02:42:42.660]   And I I got to run into her professionally. So it's really cool
[02:42:42.660 --> 02:42:45.380]   And she did all this data science of just cutting all the data
[02:42:45.380 --> 02:42:50.340]   and one of the most interesting graphs was if you looked at the the date of
[02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:53.460]   Last password change for the accounts that were taken over
[02:42:54.020 --> 02:42:56.500]   It was like this and then there's a super drop-off
[02:42:56.500 --> 02:43:00.100]   Yeah, and when you look at that graph that drop-off happened at the exact month
[02:43:00.100 --> 02:43:05.460]   The resolution was only to the month so we couldn't do to the day the exact month that
[02:43:05.460 --> 02:43:09.620]   Yahoo had changed the way that passwords were stored
[02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:15.380]   And so that was a pretty clear indication that there had been a breach of that the older system
[02:43:15.380 --> 02:43:18.660]   And this has happened before like over a year before I had gone to yahoo
[02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:22.820]   That there was a change in how passwords were stored and secured that when that happened
[02:43:22.820 --> 02:43:26.260]   They had closed the vulnerability that somebody had used now
[02:43:26.260 --> 02:43:29.060]   We didn't have actual logs of how the data was stolen
[02:43:29.060 --> 02:43:34.020]   We didn't have direct evidence and so when we took this to marissa and the other executive team from their perspective
[02:43:34.020 --> 02:43:35.620]   It was like can you prove it and my answer is no?
[02:43:35.620 --> 02:43:38.980]   It's just highly suggestive evidence and from their perspective like okay
[02:43:38.980 --> 02:43:43.380]   Well, we're not going to disclose anything because you can't prove anything right and at that time
[02:43:43.380 --> 02:43:46.900]   You know marissa if you remember marissa took over because of an activist investor
[02:43:46.900 --> 02:43:51.380]   By the time I joined it was like a year and a half after she'd been there the honeymoon was over
[02:43:51.540 --> 02:43:54.580]   She had her own activist investor who was now pushing them to make money
[02:43:54.580 --> 02:43:57.060]   She didn't want any kind of negative publicity at all
[02:43:57.060 --> 02:44:03.460]   Um, and so my relationship with her was mostly just her saying can you absolute to totally prove something is true
[02:44:03.460 --> 02:44:05.460]   You're always the bad news guy Alex
[02:44:05.460 --> 02:44:09.940]   Yeah, I mean that that's what talks about being a seesaw right like I would literally walk into a room
[02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:12.020]   And either yahoo or facebook if people get oh
[02:44:12.020 --> 02:44:14.420]   Stomachess here. Yeah. Yeah. Can I say that?
[02:44:14.420 --> 02:44:17.460]   No, no, no, we'll just leap it
