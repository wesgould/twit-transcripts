[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   It's time for Twink this week in Google, Jeff Jarvis, Ant-Pruet, Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:12.800]   The whole gang is here and lots to talk about, including Twitter's plans to change its entire business model.
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.080]   We'll talk about how the social media and the internet could really be a lot better if we broke down the silos.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.280]   We'll also talk about the sale of TikTok. It's on hold indefinitely.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.280]   And then some of the weird new trends on TikTok.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.640]   And finally, making your own COVID vaccine for fun, but not profit.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.920]   It's all coming up next on Twink.

[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.680]   Ant Pruitt is here, our hands-on photography host.
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.160]   Hello, Mr. Pruitt.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.720]   Hello, Mr. LaPorte.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.000]   I see you every morning.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.800]   Say Gumbatam and Mr. Jarvis.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.000]   Yes, I see every morning on Wednesdays.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.840]   A little bit straight.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.760]   As you're doing Floss Weekly, next week, by the way, a legend if he shows up.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.680]   Yeah, we're hoping for.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.840]   ESR.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.640]   Eric Raymond will be joining the gang on Floss Weekly next Wednesday.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.080]   That is worth tuning in for.
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.560]   Along with, I would say, along with, well, I think he stands along.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.240]   This guy wrote the cathedral in the bazaar.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.640]   He is very important to the open source community and an interesting fellow, a character.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.640]   I was going to say quite a character from what I've been telling.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.320]   So that'll be fun.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.400]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.000]   Also that was, of course, Mr. Jeff Jarvis, the townite director of the townite center
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.600]   for entrepreneurial journalism with Craig Newmark.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.160]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160]   Buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.160]   Hello.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.160]   Hello, hello.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.160]   Jeff's been watching TV all day.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.960]   That's why he looks a little sallow.
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.880]   Mm hmm.
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.120]   My lighting is always off.
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.240]   And fresh as a daisy from the beautiful island, it's Stacey Higginbotham.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.440]   I'm Stacey and I am too.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.440]   Hello.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440]   Hello.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.440]   Hello.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.480]   We were watching commercials before the show.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.480]   Yeah, we were watching Super Bowl commercials.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.360]   You want to start with something fun?
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.320]   Norway answers Will Ferrell on the show.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.720]   We showed the Will Ferrell GM ad where GM is saying, by the way, GM, we should point
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.400]   out I had the first EV, the way back when?
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.960]   That was the, they made the documentary about it and all that.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.960]   Was the EV one, right?
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.080]   I do not remember that.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.080]   Really?
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.240]   Who killed the electric car was the, you should watch it, was the documentary.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.560]   So GM has decided to come back of all things to, to electric vehicles.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.960]   They announced that it's CES and they announced it to the world with the help of Will Ferrell,
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:13.200]   Aquafina and Keenan Thompson, attacking Norway because they lead the world in electric vehicles.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.360]   So Audi of Norway struck back.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.360]   There's three commercials.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.160]   Oh, America is coming for us.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.840]   Norway, Norway is the best country in the universe.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.000]   So this is the big red headed giant who is in Game of Thrones from beyond the wall.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.520]   I've seen him in many other things too.
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.160]   He's, I don't know his name, he's great.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.400]   How could you hate this?
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.440]   How could you hate us?
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.240]   Me.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:54.240]   And remember in the Will Ferrell Super Bowl commercial, he punched a globe and was wearing
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.760]   it through most of the commercial there it is.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:05.120]   He punched a globe.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.520]   You want to punch us in the face?
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.240]   You want to do this to us?
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.160]   To me, and the world.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.160]   Don't hate him a thing.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.320]   We're trying to save the world.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.840]   Save it.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   I love him.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.240]   There's two to you.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.240]   What is ironic?
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.800]   Yeah, we don't.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.760]   What is ironic here is that Audi is part of Volkswagen, right?
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.600]   Yeah, it's VW.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.640]   And Volkswagen had the huge diesel.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.640]   Dieselgate.
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.640]   So they didn't save the world now they're saving it.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.680]   No, but that's exactly why they're doing this by the way is because their settlement
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.800]   in dieselgate, by the way, it also involved a billion dollars to put electric charging
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.120]   stations all over the country with Electra-Fi America.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.120]   Which is VW.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.240]   But Norway had a lot of policies.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.200]   They actually dictated that new cars.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.200]   Yes.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   You had to.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.200]   Yeah, okay.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.520]   Which is something for a country that makes a huge amount of money off oil.
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.520]   That's actually good.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.320]   When I forgot their big oil power.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.720]   That's a state oil.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.640]   I think that they say by 20.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.360]   Which would benefit from climate change because it'd be warmer there.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.520]   They said that that's true.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.680]   It would actually be good for Norway.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.400]   So really they're acting against their own self interest, aren't they?
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.120]   Unless the level rise swabs them.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.120]   Oh, that's right.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.120]   All those fjords.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.120]   All those fjords.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.120]   Can I get the...
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.120]   So flooded fluid.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.120]   No way.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:51.400]   The Norwegian Parliament said that by 2025, in four years, all cars sold in Norway had
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.280]   to be zero emission either electric or hydrogen.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.040]   So you know, good for them.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.040]   Yeah, good for them.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.880]   GM maybe, you know, I don't know.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.040]   So there was a really good thread on GM in the concept of predatory delay.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.360]   Which is basically, look, the tide has turned towards electric vehicles.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.760]   I was really excited when my actually electrified.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.760]   Against them?
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.760]   No, for them.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.760]   For them, yes.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:21.360]   And now it is time to, you know, you better get on now or you're going to be like a laggard.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.200]   And so that's kind of, it was a really good thread about this.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.080]   Who's the predator in that?
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:34.760]   GM basically putting out as much of the ginormous trucks and gas guzzling vehicles for as long
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.120]   as they could and they recognized at this point, they got a flip.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.760]   They created the EV1 in 1990.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.200]   They sold 1,117 units between '96 and '99.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.800]   Well, they didn't really sell them, right?
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.720]   Yes, that's right.
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.840]   But remember then there was an issue because there weren't all those places you could
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.840]   charge them.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:04.760]   I mean, Elon Musk was quite, really quite clever in his plan to make electric vehicles
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:08.320]   sustainable and sensible by, first of all, he said, you got to have the charging station.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.280]   So he did the supercharging network as part of the whole rollout.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:20.360]   So yeah, I think that GM though is also widely considered to be both the, create the first
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.400]   electric vehicle and also be kind of the sort.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:29.680]   They leased it with the option to purchase disallowed by the contractual clause.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.680]   You couldn't buy it.
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.120]   They were dragged out of people's dead hands.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.120]   People didn't want to give them up.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.040]   They loved them so much.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:46.480]   In the first year they only released 288 cars.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:50.120]   So I think it was more a PR stunt than anything else.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.280]   How long between that and the volt?
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   What did the volt come out?
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.360]   Because that's GM also, isn't it?
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   The Chevy Volt?
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.360]   Yes.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.920]   We saw the Chevy Volt as south by southwest six years ago, seven years ago.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.920]   How long ago was that?
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.360]   We went down there, John, you remember?
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.360]   2011.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.360]   2011.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.720]   So nine years ago.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.840]   What's south by southwest?
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   Who wants to tell them?
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840]   I told you.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.840]   Oh, okay.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840]   That wasn't even a problem.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.840]   That was what is happening.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.840]   Well, son.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.440]   Now we also never interested in that event.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.440]   I never was.
[00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.080]   You might also ask, what's the conference?
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:34.000]   I never went until Robert Scoble told me there really is no point for South by it's
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   just a big party.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.840]   And then I went, oh, I'll go.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.640]   That sounds, no, I want to know what served in anything.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.840]   Crowdsurfed, I was at the party.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.520]   So remember that I saw that.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.520]   Reddit had the most oddball ad.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:56.200]   There were, you know, the usual weird ads, but Reddit's ad was the strangest because
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:05.920]   it was a five second still followed by the Reddit, a Reddit test pattern.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:12.440]   And their theory was you would pause and read the still because it went by so fast.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.920]   And if you did, you would see this.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.960]   Wow, this actually worked.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.240]   If you're reading this, it means our bet paid off.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.760]   Big game spots are expensive.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.920]   They were very expensive this year.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.680]   I think $5 million for a 30 second still.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.680]   Still expensive.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.280]   If you only buy five seconds, it's still more almost a million bucks.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.720]   One thing we learned from our communities last week, hint, hint, nudge, nudge, is that
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.960]   underdogs can accomplish just about anything when they come together around a common idea,
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.960]   like shorting game stop.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.960]   So I don't know.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.960]   Do you think that worked?
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.520]   It was certainly clever.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.440]   I doubt they saved much money.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.080]   I talked about, which is the whole point.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.880]   We're talking about it.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.440]   You did that on the VCR.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.440]   You'd have to adjust.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.440]   What was they called?
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.440]   You had to adjust the lines out of the VCR.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.640]   I'm forgetting that vertical hold vertical hold.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.040]   No, no, it was another thing you had to do.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.640]   Oh, the VCR was tracking.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.640]   Yeah, tracking.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.560]   Yeah, you had to adjust the tracking.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.560]   Otherwise, there'd be a line through it.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.840]   So Reddit is doing okay.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.360]   They just raised another round of funding.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.360]   They're valued.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.360]   250 million.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.360]   Yeah, a lot of money.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.360]   I can't.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.360]   It's like, what's their current valuation?
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.360]   6 billion.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.360]   6 billion.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:31.520]   Steve, Steve Newhouse bought that for what do you buy it for?
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.080]   A song.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.320]   Less than they paid for their Super Bowl commercial.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.360]   I'm going to guess.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.560]   But that's something they can write off too, so it's no worse.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.560]   20 million.
[00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.560]   Oh, he paid 20 million.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.560]   Okay.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.720]   So you could have bought three four Super Bowl commercials for that.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.480]   Just as I was leaving the company, he bought it.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.640]   We talked about this on the show before.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   He wanted Dig.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.640]   Right.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.880]   But it was a consolation prize.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.880]   Kevin, Kevin.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.880]   Okay.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.880]   What am I saying?
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.880]   Kevin Rose is doing just fine.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.880]   What's he doing?
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.880]   He's a VC.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.720]   He actually, I think we mentioned this on the show.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.080]   Maybe you weren't here that week.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.560]   He tweeted that he would buy Dig back from its owners because he didn't like what they
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.880]   were doing with it.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.200]   He said, I'll pay you the same.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.200]   You paid for it.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.240]   I'll get your money back.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.360]   I don't know if anybody took him up on that.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:27.000]   But I think he's probably looking at how successful Reddit is because Reddit was even, even Alexis
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.800]   O'Hania and Steve Huffman, the creators admitted a copy of Dig.
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.200]   Oh, it also ran at that.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.640]   Dig was the big guy.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.240]   Reddit was like this.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.240]   And then how the worm has turned.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.120]   Dig has celebrity as well.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.040]   Who is the celebrity of Dig?
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.600]   The, the, oh, just Dig itself.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.600]   And then Alex.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.600]   Yeah, Kevin and Alex.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   Oh, no, the two guys.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.600]   Dig nation.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.600]   Like you are.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.360]   I was about to say, Dig nation, they had a TV show.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.360]   Yeah, potter.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.360]   We call it potter.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.360]   Alex.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.360]   Alex.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:04.560]   Yeah, Alex was on G4 TV and along with Kevin for the, and the attack of the show and then
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.080]   they created a potcaster.
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.080]   Right.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.320]   It was sort of like a TV show.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.160]   Mostly involved heavy consumption.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.520]   Sagan used to be, used to be owned by an organization downtown here in New York, but
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.600]   it's now owned by buy sell ads.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   There you go.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.600]   Ooh.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.600]   There you go.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   I'm wondering what's up.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.120]   Yeah, I don't think they're doing.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.120]   I think it's, yeah.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.120]   But that was, you know, that was probably the, the problem.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.960]   Here's, here's Kevin's tweet from January 8th.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.640]   It's a shame what happened to Dig the site is counting clicks as votes.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.640]   Very odd.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.840]   I'd like to buy it and return it to the old version two before the redesign.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:51.040]   I'll offer you $1 million, which is four times the purchase price.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.840]   Oh.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.360]   So apparently Kevin's doing okay.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.640]   I think he was an early investor in Twitter is as I remember.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.640]   So.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.640]   Do you think?
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.320]   Hey, speaking of Twitter, what the hell?
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.040]   What's going on with the Twitter?
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.040]   So Jack Dorsey.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.040]   I'm studying stuff.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.040]   Do you think, I think it's interesting.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:14.360]   I don't know, I don't know if it's sensible or if he will even do it.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.440]   This was part of Twitter's quarterly results analyst call, right?
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.920]   Or something like that?
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.000]   Okay.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   So Dorsey.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.960]   The second billion dollar quarter.
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:25.960]   They had a good quarter.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:26.960]   Well, yeah.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:27.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.480]   Though they warned that they've had a plateau.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.520]   So growth won't be as high as it was given Trump and COVID and everything else.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.320]   This is the first earnings call after the Trump ban and they did all right.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.360]   They didn't meet the growth expectations Wall Street had, but they, I doubt they ever
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.360]   do.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.360]   It's always been a problem.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.600]   It's not up anyway.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.840]   Um, they are going to add head count more than 20% this year overall and create expenses
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.920]   increasing 25%.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.760]   Um, Mont, this is MDOWs is the new, uh, the new number.
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:10.440]   We used to call DOWs DA used daily active users and there was Mao's monthly active users,
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.400]   but MDOWs are monetizable daily active users.
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.400]   What does that mean?
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   Is there not bots?
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:18.400]   Oh, I see.
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.400]   Oh, I see.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.840]   Are they because it didn't after they bought review, aren't people thinking they're going
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.080]   to try to charge people for access to certain people?
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.080]   Yes.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.320]   But this number, which, you know, this, this is for current earnings.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:34.920]   So would that be like Jeff's monetizable or is that people who pay for Jeff that's monetizable?
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.920]   I know.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:40.120]   MDOWs 192 million daily active users.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.840]   That's below expectations.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.400]   But the most important thing I think about this analyst call was what Jack Dorsey was
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:54.200]   talking about for the future of Twitter, including some interesting subscription revenue
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.800]   options.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.560]   He's, he's talked about paying for the algorithm.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.120]   Jeff, you better explain that.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.520]   And an algorithm app store as well.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.520]   This is blue sky.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.520]   This is blue sky.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.520]   The, the posting layer becomes the commodity.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.520]   The, you make money by adding value by having the algorithm that finds the things you want
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.520]   by recommendation.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:22.440]   I don't know, maybe fact checking.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.480]   I'm not sure what all, but, but there'd be more than one, right?
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.480]   Because it's a store.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.520]   So you could say exactly that, that, that it's a, it's a menu.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.320]   I'll have the Fox news viewer, the world, or I'll have the MSNBC viewer, the world.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:40.640]   I'll have it against not just Twitter, but one presumes some federated mishmash of various
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.640]   social platforms.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.240]   So that's the thing that really, that becomes commodity.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.240]   So this is the problem Twitter has.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.720]   If they're going to make money with their M. Dows, they have to be the sole one and only
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.960]   source for all the tweets, a silo.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:58.200]   But he's understood that that's really part of the problem with social media.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   And it doesn't scale.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   I mean, it scales.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.960]   He scaled, but it doesn't scale to the level the Wall Street expects more that he thinks
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.520]   as possibly there's more conversation to be had.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:13.120]   So Dorsey says decentralization could be the solution also to any section 230 issues
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.920]   that might come from new laws.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.920]   Isn't that the point of Mastodon though?
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.960]   Yeah, that's a, well, I think, yes.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:24.920]   In fact, now you do, you'd be a platform over both, I think.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.400]   No, here's the best of Twitter and Mastodon.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   Here's how I interpret it.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:35.640]   In fact, by the way, the creator of Mastodon, Eugene is on the board of advisors talking
[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.560]   to Dorsey about options.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:42.920]   So clearly Dorsey understands Mastodon as we call a fetaverse, no, not feta cheese,
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   Stacy, as delicious as that is.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.960]   Although I like that so much, I've actually made it a part of our fetaverse at Twit.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.960]   That's social.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.840]   But the idea is I run a server, you run a server, you, you, you, there's hundreds of
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.400]   servers out there.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:00.840]   You join a server of your choice, maybe one that fits your worldview or your interests
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.920]   or just people you like.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.320]   That's your local server.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.120]   You can follow anybody because it's federated.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   That's what federated means.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.600]   You can follow anybody on any of the other servers.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.360]   And what Twitter is saying is we'll set this up.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.360]   They'll be a variety.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.360]   And by the way, there's other things.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:22.520]   There's things like Pixel Feed or Pixel Fed, which is an Instagram, Pixel Fed.social,
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.800]   based on Mastodon the, on the, on the fetaverse.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:31.280]   So it is, is identical to Instagram, but it's, but it's on the fetaverse, which is actually
[00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.920]   really kind of neat.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.480]   I can, I can, I can log into my Pixel Fed.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.920]   I don't do Instagram anymore, as you know, but I do Pixel Fed.social.
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.360]   And that means I have two accounts, one on Twit.social and one on Pixel Fed.social.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.720]   I can log in here somewhere.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.400]   Oh, here it is.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.400]   Looking.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.880]   And you can follow me on both.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.640]   Oh, I got a two factor on this.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.640]   Wow.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.880]   I've taken this seriously when I signed up.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:57.880]   Wow.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.880]   Jeez, I was afraid somebody.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.880]   Such a good man.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.880]   Choose my factors.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:09.640]   So I think what Dorsey is imagining is not that, is that Twitter would be one among equals,
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.480]   but that's not even the value that Twitter adds to the game.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.080]   What Twitter really adds to the game is this algorithm, this curation.
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.720]   So you, you, they want to be the view into the fetaverse.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.720]   Or, or there even a cure.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.560]   No, what's interesting to me too, Leo, is there even the curator of the curator?
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.120]   That there is a, an algo store.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.680]   Because of the store, right.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.120]   And that maybe Twitter runs that.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.120]   Right.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.160]   And Twitter has entries into the algo store as my presumption that it would have certain
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.040]   views from the social world that Twitter offers you, but all those could do.
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.440]   It's just like WordPress.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:45.400]   But WordPress is a commoditized and open source at the software layer.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.120]   It's at the value add layer where money's made.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.760]   Yeah, but honestly, the beauty of the fetaverse is you can do that.
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.480]   I could do that with Twitch social or whatever.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.720]   But you don't control anything.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.560]   And I think that that would be critical to the whole enterprise.
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:07.800]   And I, I worry that Jack is going to have a different vision of what Twitter's role is
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.880]   in this.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.120]   If it really supports the fetaverse, I think this is great.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.640]   So this is, this is another.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.160]   So I should show Twit.social too, actually.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.760]   He's got a bet that he can win an adding value.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.760]   As a curator.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.760]   Okay.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.760]   Rather than a controlling.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:22.760]   It's Twit.social.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.600]   So it looks a lot like TweetDeck.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.920]   By the way, that was another thing Dorsey floated.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.600]   Maybe people will pay for TweetDeck.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.200]   So this looks like a lot like TweetDeck.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.440]   This is the home, which is the people I'm following and my notifications.
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.160]   This is the local timeline, which is everything on our server.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:44.120]   And then this is a federated timeline, which is, this is a little complicated.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:48.560]   Everything that everybody on our server is following on all the other servers right now.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.400]   Bloomberg's bot is spamming it with.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.200]   So it's like a graph, like a social graph kind of thing?
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   That's a good way to put it.
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.600]   Friends of friends, that kind of thing.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.880]   And there is a fire hose you could watch of all the stuff on all the federated servers,
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.720]   but it's quite a fire hose.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   So this is.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.120]   Pretty sure of a flower.
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   Isn't that pretty?
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.520]   So people do this, but see, but then let me show you Pixel Fit, which looks like Insta.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.520]   The flower is the news, actually.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.520]   We will talk about that.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.600]   It's not that flower, but another flower.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.600]   This is, this is what.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.600]   Another purple flower.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.840]   See, they all look alike to me.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.040]   This is just like Instagram, right?
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.400]   But it's also part of the Fediverse.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:32.400]   So my handle on this can be followed on Mastodon as well as anywhere else.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.400]   So I think that this is.
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:39.200]   And then people see your, they see these pictures, but they see it in the format that
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.520]   looks more like Twitter.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:41.520]   They could.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.800]   It's, it's format independent, which is the beauty of it.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:49.040]   But if you look at this, it looks just like an Instagram feed, doesn't it?
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.040]   Sure does.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.480]   Like why has an Instagram suit?
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.480]   Like it looks that much.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.480]   Suit exactly.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.480]   Okay.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.480]   Fine.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.480]   Don't sue them.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.480]   No, I don't think, can you wait?
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.480]   Can you, I don't think you can sue for a design.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.920]   You can sue for a brand.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.880]   You can sue for content, treatment of content, a design.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.920]   I don't think you can sue for.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.760]   I love it that this is.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.280]   That's how H&M operates, right?
[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.880]   This is an open source.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.520]   No, let's say that.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.040]   Fed-rated Instagram.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:18.480]   It doesn't have any of the issues that Instagram has because it's federated.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.920]   Now I'm using the Pixel Fed server, but I could use twitter.social as well.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.520]   So yeah, this is one view.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.680]   This is one view and this is another view, but it's all, and the conversation is very
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.680]   Twitter-like.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:37.200]   Actually, you have 500 characters, which makes it a little better than Twitter, I think.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.600]   So you can really be worthy.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:44.240]   Jeff, you can sue for design under, I think, copyright and maybe some other things, but
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.800]   it's really courts hate it and they tend to block them.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.800]   So you can sue.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   It's just a completely different view.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.480]   Yeah, oh yeah, you can Samsung, Apple sued Samsung over the look and feel.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.800]   It's a big deal in the fashion industry.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:56.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.960]   Look and feel is a little nebulous.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.320]   That's why courts don't like it.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.480]   But a jury can rule.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:07.360]   They can say, no, that's clearly a copy of the look and feel.
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.200]   Sorry.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:15.320]   So I think it's, I hope that he's not just blowing smoke on this.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.800]   I think this would be a really--
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.440]   I think he does that too, but--
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:23.120]   No, I think he's invested in this.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.520]   He comes coming back to it.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.400]   I think he has a vision in his head of what this world could look like.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.800]   And I think it's a way to-- I mean, I was thinking about it a day with a rundown.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:41.960]   I wonder whether is there a world where Jack could suddenly leap over Mark?
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.320]   That's interesting.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.320]   So I would-- I'm going up with him like this.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.320]   What?
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.320]   Like how would you--
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.320]   --how would you--
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   Because he's--
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.320]   Because--
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   Because--
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   Because he's--
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   Because--
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.320]   Because--
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.320]   Because--
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.320]   Because what he sees is that he wants to connect to much more conversation, but find the good in that conversation.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.320]   So Facebook is this closed universe.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:08.440]   And what Jack I think sees is back to internet roots, the value of being open, and you can
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.320]   scale much bigger, much faster.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.960]   And he needs the formula to do that and thinks this might be a formula.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.040]   And then I think that Facebook gets less left in the dust because it won't be federated.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.040]   It won't be curated.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.600]   It won't be seen.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.200]   But your stuff on Instagram and fakeagram and Twitter and Mastodon and everywhere else
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.240]   will be seen through Uncle Jack.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.240]   Wouldn't it be interesting--
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   Okay.
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:35.560]   --Devil's Advocate with all of that openness and this big expansion of everything coming
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:40.640]   out of the silos, is that equate to even more misinformation out there?
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.640]   Ah!
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:42.960]   I'm glad you asked.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.720]   No, this is the beginning.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.720]   Yes, yes.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.840]   And it's raw level, sure.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.560]   The phone book has a lot of people that you don't want to call.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.960]   But I go back-- I'm sorry about this to you.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.320]   I'm sorry, but your glass is ready, folks.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:02.440]   If we go back to Gutenberg, what happened was that, yeah, anybody can print anything.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.760]   We had no institutions to build around finding quality.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:12.480]   It took about a century to come up with the institutions of the editor and the publisher.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.480]   And the critic.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:20.600]   And these ways that we found quality in this tremendous abundance that had not existed
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.600]   before.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.800]   The library, the librarian.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.000]   These were all institutions of quality that were needed to be created.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Well, so now those institutions aren't up to the task of a conversational world.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.600]   So we need to create new institutions, new features, new companies, new functions, new
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.200]   stuff to help us with that task.
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.800]   So yes, Aunt, there'll be a lot more crap.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.800]   But you'll have easier ways of ignoring it and people who will take you to the stuff
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.960]   that you want.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.920]   Now, if you're smart, you won't just want the echo chamber.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.600]   You'll want some view of the world.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.040]   You'll want to see what's going on.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:01.120]   You'll have brands that will emerge, like newspapers did, that will help you find the
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.760]   good stuff among all of the stuff.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.000]   Someone which is bad, but we should ignore the bad stuff.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.480]   There's bad books at every bookshelf.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.480]   That's so what?
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.480]   You don't care because I don't read them.
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   I don't need them.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:14.920]   You could almost say that the silos are part of the, and I think this is what Jack is saying,
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.120]   the silos are part of the problem right now.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.480]   So there's a pool of stuff on Twitter.
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.120]   There's a pool of stuff on Facebook.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.440]   There's a pool of stuff on YouTube.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.600]   You go to those places to see that pool of stuff, but what if you took away the walls
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.760]   and you had a much larger pool of stuff and then the value that was added was not added
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.920]   by creating the silo, but was added on the top by filtering and finding the stuff that
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.400]   was best quality or most interesting.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.400]   The quality layer on top.
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:47.880]   That's just a different place to add the value to the equation.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.480]   And I think Dorsey's smart.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:54.680]   And by the way, the answer to your question, Jeff, is Facebook becomes a, instead of leap
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.200]   progging over Facebook, Facebook is another, if they're smart becomes another part of
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.200]   this.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.200]   Or they close themselves off from it.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.200]   Well, they could.
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.840]   Facebook says, no, no, Jack, we're not doing that.
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.840]   And then Facebook diminishes.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.360]   Do that at their detriment, right?
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.080]   So I think that they may well do that.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.080]   Yeah, they may.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:16.240]   And I think what Jack's plan is if we do this and we invite everybody to participate, that
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.880]   is of its own going to snowball, the network effect is all in our generation.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.880]   It's a new generation.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.680]   And you were saying, but and?
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.440]   I was going to say, but can't one argue that there's still a bit of openness because
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:36.600]   a lot of these posts are shared across multiple platforms because of just being on the internet.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:41.880]   You can post something on Instagram and send that URL to Facebook and it can be viewed there
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.280]   and commented on and people can talk trash about it and say all kinds of things and stir
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.120]   things up and then they can take that same URL and put it on Twitter and do the same thing.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.400]   And they do it for talk.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.400]   So it's not.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.600]   Or another, yes, you're right.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.600]   Or another way is Facebook can say we're going to give you the Facebook algo across Twitter
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.000]   and Instagram and Facebook and MasterDawn and so on.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.720]   So that stuff can be wherever it is originated, but we can create something that goes across
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   all of those.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.720]   It doesn't matter where it originates.
[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:16.080]   So it commodifies the origination and values the curation.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.640]   So you're stepping into the middle of a conversation that's been going on in the show for a decade
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.520]   or more.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:27.760]   And Jeff will remember when Kevin Marks, the fact we should get him back on at some point,
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:30.800]   used to make regular visits and promote the indie web.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.840]   This is the indie web is the same idea from the other from a more open standard, which
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.040]   in fact, this is the indie web homepage.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.680]   The indie web is people focused alternative to the corporate web.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.560]   The idea is your blog is part of the indie web.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:53.400]   That's where you put your content, but there are mechanisms provided by indie web developers,
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:29:02.880]   things like web hooks and pub sub that allow your blog to be part of a larger conglomerate
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:09.920]   and allows people to say use Twitter and say, oh, and by the way, include ants content
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.720]   because I like what ants doing and Twitter find me five.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.640]   And by the way, this is be one of the valuable things Twitter could do.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.120]   Oh, you like, find me five more things like that.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:26.360]   And if Twitter did a good job of content, curation, they could say, oh, I see you like
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.360]   that.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.360]   What about this?
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.320]   I think the Antomself could say here is my record.
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.360]   Here's what I like every day.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.160]   You can see what I see.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:39.520]   So this is indie web has been promoting this for a long time.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.040]   And Kevin Marks used to come on all the time and talk about the homebrew website club and
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.200]   the various meetings.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:50.800]   And if you're interested in the web.org, I hope these guys get pulled into the conversation
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:57.280]   because they've been working on these technologies like microblog, for instance, for a long time.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:00.160]   And they've thought about these.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.720]   And I think that they have some really good ideas about where this is going.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:10.120]   Unfortunately, it's become a little bit of a backwater compared to Facebook and Twitter
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.280]   and YouTube.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.920]   It would be really, I hope Jack is not just blowing smoke.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:24.880]   The problem is he's a public company and some stakeholders might see this as reducing the
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.880]   value of their stock.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.080]   Well, knowing Jack, he'll destroy the third company.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.200]   Well, that's what Ev did, right?
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.840]   So Ev Williams moved on from Twitter and created Medium.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.200]   I could, you know, this is by the way, Blue Sky is the name.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:46.520]   As you said, it is Blue Sky research, but it's actually the name of this thing that they've
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.320]   been working on for the last few years.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.320]   He hired...
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.080]   You know the people who were on his Blue Sky team.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.080]   Do you guys know...
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.080]   Well, I know...
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:00.120]   I know the Mastodon guy for sure.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.920]   But he's...
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.280]   So there's two different groups.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.480]   There's the actual Blue Sky developers.
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   And I think...
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.280]   Let me see here in this story if they said the number.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   I think it's...
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.480]   There are 10 people, I think, working on it.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:20.160]   And then there's 50 more people on a advisory board who are helping them understand.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.040]   Because the thing is, there's a lot...
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:25.040]   I can give you Gutenberg stuff for the advisory board.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.040]   I'll do that.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:31.840]   There are a lot of people been thinking long and hard about this, including Kevin Marks.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.840]   I just...
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.840]   We'll see.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:40.880]   And you know, it may be the irony of this may be that the attacks on Section 230 actually
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.880]   force this along.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:47.400]   You know, that's one of the things Jack's trying to address here is a situation where
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.200]   you're suddenly liable for your content.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.200]   He doesn't want to be in the position.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.560]   Oh, so in this case, you're not the host.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.560]   You're just the recommender.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.560]   Facilitator.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.560]   Well, you may found liable for that.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.520]   In the call on Thursday, Dorsey said, "This could be a way to, quote, address some of the
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:07.880]   problems that is facing Section 230.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.920]   It could collapse how we communicate on the Internet."
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.200]   Actually he said, "Stripping back 230 could collapse how we communicate on the Internet
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.400]   and leave only a small number of giant and well-funded tech firms at regulatory capture."
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.800]   You talk about Jeff, but this would be the reverse.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.280]   It would, you know, let a million flowers bloom.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:32.480]   It's also, Jonathan Zittrain from the Berkman Center has been arguing this to Facebook.
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.920]   I've sat in meetings in Davos where he tried to tell them that they should offer a slider
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:39.560]   and they should say, "Pick your algorithm."
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.400]   He's been saying this to them for years.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.560]   And the app stores are really interesting way to approach this.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.640]   He's happy ones, or give me the far right one.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.000]   If I pick a far right one and I get a crap, that's my choice.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.600]   It's your choice.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.120]   You can do that now on the Fediverse.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:57.080]   For instance, GAB moved to Mastodon some time ago.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:06.760]   And the GAB server is on the Fediverse.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.200]   I choose on my instance to block it.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.400]   Maybe I shouldn't.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:18.240]   So once you start letting crazy into your house, you start, they look less crazy.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:22.600]   You know, familiarity for these breeds, not just contempt, but also just familiarity.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.640]   You're like, "That's not so weird."
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:31.200]   That's an interesting conundrum.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.920]   If you want to follow GAB, you still could do it.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:36.920]   You just can't do it on my server, my instance.
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:39.680]   So you could join some other instance that GAB allows.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   You could even join the GAB instance.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.560]   And then what would you see if I joined the server?
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:45.800]   You'd only see stuff you follow.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.800]   Right.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.480]   But I could follow you still, even though you're not on your server.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.840]   Sorry, I'm not on your server.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.000]   I could still follow you.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.640]   So it's not commutative.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:03.200]   So if you're on the GAB server, unless they're blocking me to its social, you could follow
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.200]   me.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.120]   But if you're on my server, you can't follow GAB because I have unilaterally blocked it.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.280]   But you could follow everybody.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:11.120]   That's the only server I block.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.680]   So you could follow everybody else.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:14.600]   There are sex workers' servers.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.120]   There are, I'm sure, other Nazi servers.
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:20.000]   There are all kinds of servers.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:30.280]   If you're interested, Join Mastodon, I think it's .org, has a directory of servers.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:35.880]   Joininemastodon.org so you could see what are out there.
[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:39.120]   And you can actually, they have a little thing, I think.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.160]   Is it on Join Mastodon?
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.160]   Maybe not.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.520]   But there is somewhere a site where you could say, "I like this.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.520]   I like this.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.520]   I don't want to see that.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.520]   I don't want to see that."
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.720]   And you check those boxes and then it makes some suggestions.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.720]   Yeah, this is it.
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:53.200]   That's not against where, but it's not really where ants going.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:59.440]   And saying that there's more value needed to avoid the crap.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.280]   And you start down that route here, but it's a very rudimentary layer.
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:08.680]   Well, just like Twitter, you only see what you follow.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:14.040]   Although you might be inclined once in a while to open up the sluices and see what else is
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:16.040]   out there as a discovery.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.040]   Yeah, that you might be missing.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.240]   And then you go, "Ooh, that's awful."
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.800]   You can close them up.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:28.760]   There's a lot of content that I don't subscribe to or follow, but yet it always ended up popping
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.760]   into my feed.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.320]   That's the algorithm, man.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.680]   And that's the thing I'm always in vain against.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.880]   Is that Facebook intrudes into you, your feed by putting stuff there.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:38.880]   Not in my list, it doesn't.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.880]   Right.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:40.880]   So that's what people are doing.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.880]   That's what lists are for me.
[00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.980]   I had to fix up lists and put in a bunch of mutes and things like that to make my
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.440]   experience better.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:56.040]   And I'm thinking that making this a much larger highway is just going to make me work even
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:58.600]   harder to try to filter out things like that.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:04.920]   Even though I get, I should be able to have sources and access to all the views of the
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.720]   world, just because I don't need to be closed-minded.
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.920]   But at the same time, some crap I just don't want to see.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.640]   And I don't blame you.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:20.940]   I think you're better off in a fetaverse because it's open.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:27.100]   So you can choose a server that's, and one hopes that somebody would do this, it says,
[00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:31.180]   "Ant, you have absolute control over what you see, and you only see things you choose
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.180]   to see."
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:34.140]   I think that's kind of how it is.
[00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:37.380]   But you could have somebody who's even more aggressive about that.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.260]   To me, what's exactly what's wrong with YouTube and Facebook?
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.900]   Less so Twitter.
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:46.200]   But Twitter, because of retweets, stuff gets into your feed that you didn't necessarily
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.200]   choose.
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.080]   I always see stuff in retweets.
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.680]   So I turn off retweets in the tweet deck, which is nice.
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.160]   That really cleans things up.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.320]   But so algorithms get in the way.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:56.320]   But you could be on it.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.680]   There's nothing to say that you couldn't have software that shows you only stuff you
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.160]   explicitly say, "I want to see," that kind of thing.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.720]   And I think that's what Jack's proposing.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.560]   In the App Store, you would have-
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.400]   So I could buy variations on different recommendations, obviously.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.400]   Exactly.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.400]   I could buy- Now, would I buy an algorithm or would I buy a list of people who've already
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.400]   been-
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.400]   He calls them algorithms.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.400]   He says you're buying algorithms.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.500]   Okay, so then I would find the benefit there is that if someone's talking about something
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:28.240]   that's algorithmic-ly interesting to me, I would see their stuff.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.580]   But maybe I wouldn't have to follow them.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.580]   Yeah.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:32.580]   That could be interesting.
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:36.660]   The whole idea is there's a lot of ways you could do that.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:42.220]   So the first thing to do is break down all those silos so that everything is in a giant
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:43.220]   pool.
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:44.220]   And then-
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.220]   Oh, but is a content creator-
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:51.380]   Yeah, so but as a content creator, trying to participate in the algorithm, would I be
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.100]   tagging or doing anything?
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.900]   Or would it just look at the content?
[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.900]   It could have that.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:56.900]   It could have that.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.660]   It could have all sorts of techniques.
[00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.020]   So that's what we would need to look at.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:06.180]   Would it need- What is the burden on the content creator?
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.180]   It's also an opportunity.
[00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:10.860]   But then someone like as a content creator could- I could be like tagging stuff for the
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.060]   latest quote unquote hashtags, right?
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.340]   Even though it doesn't have a lot of relevance there just because I know they're hot or trending
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.340]   right now.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.500]   So I'm thinking about how I could game the system depending on how it's set up.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.020]   Yeah, that's always a possibility is gaming.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.020]   That's what killed Dig.
[00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.020]   Everything can be game.
[00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:30.780]   But there's another layer here too, Stacey, which is- I talked about before Samir Aurora,
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.700]   formerly of Clam.com, has Sage for experts.
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.340]   He started with 100 experts that he knew were truly experts.
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.740]   So then he went out to their selections and got to 1,000.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:43.700]   And then the system took over and picked the rest and it constantly checked against itself.
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:45.500]   So Stacey, you could start something like that.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:46.860]   You could say, "Here are my IOT experts.
[00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:50.620]   If you really want to follow IOT, you don't need the algorithm.
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.300]   You need the incoming data."
[00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:53.300]   Right?
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.380]   And you could say, "Here is Stacey's worldview."
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:02.060]   And Stacey can prime that pump and Stacey can verify that it's good and keep making sure
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:06.100]   that you have a human check on it, that it's keeping going, and limit the size of it and
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.420]   have checks on it.
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:14.900]   But I can get Stacey's worldview of technology through- I can sell the algorithmic functionality,
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:20.100]   but you sell the input into it that gives me Stacey's worldview, which would be pretty
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.580]   cool.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:26.220]   I think the reason Jack mentions an app store- I'm going to put words in his mouth or ideas
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:30.180]   in his head, but I think the reason he mentions an app store is because that's what made the
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:36.180]   Apple app store so powerful and rich is you say, "Here's a pile of content."
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:41.940]   And now anybody who wants to can on the app store sell a filter, a mechanism, a curation
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.100]   mechanism.
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.740]   And you can, by the way, if somebody starts gaming one, you just choose another one.
[00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:55.500]   So you've got this giant, I mean, this giant universe of content, and presumably you could
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:56.500]   even roll your own.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:01.580]   I mean, that's what I'd like to see is some sort of simple API that lets people, well,
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.460]   it would have to be.
[00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:07.100]   And then some people wouldn't have the skills to roll their own, so they'd go to the app
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:13.860]   store, but I might want to write my own parser or something that chooses what I get to see.
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.660]   I love this idea.
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.820]   I really love this idea.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:18.820]   I hope he does it.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:23.780]   I hope it's not just blue smoke.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:24.780]   We shall see though.
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:31.580]   I think he's smart because there is still a chance to monetize, maybe even a better chance
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:35.860]   to monetize with an app store, but it solves a lot of the problems of the silos.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.180]   I never liked the silos.
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.620]   That was always a problem.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:43.860]   You remember, in fact, really I started getting involved with IndieWeb and Kevin Marks back
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:45.340]   with Bear Hug Camp.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.700]   You remember that?
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:52.420]   In the early days of Twitter, and this goes back probably 2008 or '09, they had a feature
[00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:57.020]   called Track where you could say, "I just want to know when somebody talks about this
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:58.580]   subject, I just wanted to see it.
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:00.180]   I'll have a tracker."
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:04.300]   It was kind of like Google's alerts.
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:09.540]   It was a really nice system, and Twitter took it out.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.500]   I think it was Steve Gilmore.
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.740]   I can't remember who it was who created it.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:14.740]   Somebody created it.
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.900]   I'm going to take it out.
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:22.740]   My guess is because they had plans for monetization.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.940]   It might have been that it was part of the scaling issues that they were having at the
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:26.940]   time.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.060]   This was in the days of the Fail Well.
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.060]   They never put it back.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.500]   It never came back.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:35.660]   It was a feature a lot of us used.
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:41.460]   This is what I imagine with even a larger universe of data we would use.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:47.380]   As if anybody says anything about for Jeff impeachment, I want to see it.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:48.780]   You would get all of this stuff.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:52.980]   It was a great way to use Twitter.
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:58.220]   They created this bear hug camp to try to persuade Twitter to bring it back, but what
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:02.220]   ended up coming out of it was the indie web movement, and this idea that, "Well, we'll
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:05.700]   have to make our own tools."
[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:11.060]   Getting rid of silos and getting rid of centralized controls I think is a really great way to
[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:13.300]   solve this problem.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:20.500]   It was honestly, we were getting there anyway with blogging and the attention.
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.500]   What was the RSS?
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.500]   Yeah, RSS.
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:29.260]   Then what was the thing where if somebody would tweet a response to your blog?
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.260]   A trackback.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.260]   A trackback.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:33.860]   What was the company called?
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:34.860]   It was in moving tight.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:36.260]   David Clamfry was there.
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.260]   Moveable type.
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.460]   No, it was another one.
[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:41.380]   That was the commenting one.
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:44.580]   There was one that just gave you your trackbacks and tracked them all.
[00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:47.380]   I think it was a feature of moveable type in the early days.
[00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:50.060]   No, it was original company, David Clamfry.
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.620]   Oh, yeah, David Clamfry.
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.820]   Anyway, that was the idea.
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:55.820]   Technerati.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:56.820]   Technerati.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:57.820]   Yes.
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.820]   Technerati.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:42:59.820]   It was brilliant.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:00.980]   Oh, it was brilliant.
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:01.980]   It was brilliant.
[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:06.900]   So we had in a way we'd solved all of this.
[00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:11.860]   What happened was the companies that wanted to monetize it built these silos, even as they
[00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.860]   were building them.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.220]   We were using this word silos.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.380]   This shouldn't be siloed.
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:18.380]   We want the open web.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:19.380]   So Axios.
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:20.380]   So Axios.
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.380]   So Axios.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:22.940]   Online 144, sorry about that.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:30.380]   Axios, I think prematurely starts to smell this trend and says that it goes off with what
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.380]   Jack's doing.
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:38.500]   It says also that Shopify as growth is exploded as people move beyond Amazon plus WordPress
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:39.500]   buying parsley.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.260]   I'm not exactly sure how that fits into this.
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:46.300]   The Washington Post doing its SUSE advertising platform for the open web on ads.
[00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:51.300]   Well, on Twitter, Twitter buying the newsletter company.
[00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:52.300]   Review.
[00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.300]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:57.740]   So I think that newsletters are another way of expressing this.
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:01.660]   This is why I say, well, remember, it gets crazy about antitrust the platforms.
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:04.220]   I think that they're going to grow too big and topple.
[00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:07.340]   I think that this kind of stuff, the web will be the web, the net will be the net.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.260]   And I think it will, it can rise again.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:15.860]   That's up to us to use these things and to show that there's a possibility here and to
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.860]   show that there's market demand for them.
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:18.860]   It's funny.
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:23.500]   This article on Axios is by Scott Rosenberg, who has been around through all of this.
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.700]   So it's kind of nice to see that he's reminding people, hey, this one is a little bit more
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:28.700]   interesting.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:31.380]   This was, this was called the World Wide Web when it first started.
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.740]   This is what we were trying to do.
[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.100]   We've been here before.
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:39.100]   Well, and we kind of got sidetracked by these companies like Facebook and Twitter and...
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:42.500]   Well, so we got sidetracked, but it was also easier.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.100]   And that's something we have to think about, right?
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:53.340]   When you make things easy, you buy the nature of making easy, establish defaults and...
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.660]   I think you can make it easy.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:58.420]   I don't think ease of use is going to be an issue here.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.300]   The technology is just to make it easy.
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:09.500]   But what happened was more easy in the sense of, well, is when you go to Facebook.
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.900]   But it could be that easy.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:12.900]   But I think...
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.540]   But trying to monetize it was the thing that went wrong, to be honest.
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.540]   Well, I think that's part of what Stacy...
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:18.540]   I think Stacy's right.
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:23.340]   If you go down that track, you go to Ronald Cose, who was the theoretician about the beginnings
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.340]   of the firm.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.380]   It's about the transactional cost, the cost of transactions, right?
[00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:30.020]   Things became cheaper and easier to get into a large firm, and then they get cheaper and
[00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.420]   easier in networks.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.020]   And the costs have changed.
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:36.900]   The cost of doing what Ant was talking about earlier, getting rid of the crap, has gotten
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:37.900]   very high.
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:42.580]   It's gotten high in having to hire 30,000 people, but it's also gotten very high in the regulatory
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:46.580]   danger and risk to the company and its profits and everything else.
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:52.220]   So the transactional cost that Stacy was mentioning, I think, is exactly a factor that it was
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.700]   easier and was cheaper to go into the big companies.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.300]   Now it's expensive to be a big company.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:59.300]   Expensive to try to do all this yourself.
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:00.300]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.300]   It's no surprise technologies now owned by Cinecore.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.980]   Well, who's Cinecore?
[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:06.980]   Big Cloud Company.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:08.940]   Oh, I was like, "How what?
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.700]   Why is that not a surprise for me, aren't they?"
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:11.700]   Big Cloud Company.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:12.700]   The Borg.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.100]   Yeah, they're the Borg.
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:15.620]   The Borg is a really...
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.820]   So the Borg is the good and the bad.
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:20.500]   Open Web is Borg-like.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.460]   One of us.
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:24.620]   But we don't give up control.
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:29.140]   There's no centralized control, which I think is really where all of this starts is centralized
[00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:30.140]   control.
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.940]   Yeah, it exists.
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:32.940]   It's still around.
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:33.940]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.420]   Because technology was so great because what were the features included?
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.700]   So I could see who all linked to me.
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:40.700]   Right.
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:41.700]   Right.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.060]   I could see who all linked to you via trackbacks.
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.060]   Yeah.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:46.060]   So I got a sense of your graph.
[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.060]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.060]   Right.
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:51.940]   I've contributed way of trying to do this and I think the technology is advanced enough
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:54.860]   that we could probably do a pretty good job of this.
[00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.220]   No, I hope this happens.
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:59.060]   Anyway, I have to take a break because the show's almost...
[00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:00.060]   It was just too exciting.
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.060]   You just got to take a break.
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:05.180]   No, I love it when we get in these great conversations because this really is important
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:06.180]   stuff.
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:10.060]   It's kind of nebulous and hard to understand, but I think we've kind of clarified it.
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:13.340]   And I'm very interested to see if this is what Jack honestly wants to do.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.340]   Give me a hope, perhaps.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.340]   It gives me a lot of hope.
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.340]   It's just a kind of a gentle hope.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:17.340]   It gives me a lot of hope.
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.740]   Our show today brought to you by Uber for business.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:25.900]   You all know Uber, I know, but wouldn't it be nice if you're an employer, a boss, or
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:26.900]   you've got customers?
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.540]   Wouldn't it be nice if you could spiff people a little bit?
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:33.620]   Let's say you're having a meeting and you would like everybody to attend and you just
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:36.900]   say, "Hey, I'd like to buy a cup of coffee or let's have lunch together.
[00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.380]   I'll buy."
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:43.700]   How would you do that in today's socially distanced world, Uber, for business?
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:52.820]   Let's you create vouchers, vouchers for rides, vouchers for free meals, vouchers for a cup
[00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:53.820]   of coffee.
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:56.820]   160,000 companies use.
[00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:58.780]   I didn't even know about it.
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:03.820]   Now I know there's 160,000 companies using it, Uber for business, to improve customer
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.700]   and employee satisfaction.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:11.620]   It's hard to find in these tough times, simple and effective ways to keep your employees
[00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.060]   engaged, your customers happy.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:17.180]   If you're trying to find a way to stand out to your customers and make your employees
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:21.500]   feel extra valued, Uber for business is exactly what you need.
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.740]   You can use vouchers from Uber for business.
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:28.780]   Add $20 to their Uber account so they can order meals through Uber Eats before the meeting
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:33.300]   or offer them a voucher for a free ride when they make their first purchase or spend a
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:34.940]   certain amount.
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:35.940]   Really the sky is the limit.
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:41.300]   Any company can sign up to use Uber for business free and immediately start delivering
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:45.260]   extra value to the people who matter most to your business.
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:47.420]   The vouchers are simple to send.
[00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:48.500]   They're easy to redeem.
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.140]   You get total control over who gets them.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:53.120]   You could set an expiration date.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.460]   You could say how much of the ride or meal you want to cover.
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:58.380]   You could have a hard dollar amount.
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:02.500]   Vouchers are shared via email or text can be redeemed with a single tap and here's the
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:03.500]   best part.
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:08.580]   You don't even pay until they take that ride or order that meal.
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:12.500]   It costs you nothing, send out those vouchers.
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.300]   When somebody cashes in, you pay for it.
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:15.300]   It's so cool.
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:18.500]   In fact, right now we've got a great deal for you.
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:23.580]   For a limited time, receive a $50 voucher when you create your first vouchers campaign
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:25.980]   and spend $200 or more.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:30.180]   Go to uber.com/twig to learn more.
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.300]   UBR.com/twig.
[00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:38.540]   I predict soon as when you do business with a company or you were invited to a company
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:42.420]   to a meeting, you're going to get a little voucher in the mail or via text and you're
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.220]   going to say, "Oh, that's cool.
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:45.500]   They're buying me lunch.
[00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:48.140]   Uber.com/twig."
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:53.500]   It's a great way to spiff customers, colleagues and clients.
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:55.780]   Affordable easy to use uber.com/twig.
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.700]   Some terms and conditions apply for that $50 voucher.
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:06.220]   But start by creating your first campaign, uber.com/twig.
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:09.700]   Thank you, uber, for supporting this week in Google.
[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:14.660]   If you decide to use it, make sure you use that URL so you let them know you saw it
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:15.660]   here.
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:24.860]   Parsley, which is quite a great name, is a content analytics company, WordPress VIP,
[00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:31.860]   which is the enterprise arm of WordPress.com is buying content analytics.
[00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:34.380]   Not number analytics.
[00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:41.820]   This is the first large enterprise software acquisition for automatic.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:43.780]   Do you know what parsley does anybody?
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.700]   Sure, sure, sure, sure.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:46.700]   You're familiar with that.
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:47.700]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:48.700]   No, it's huge.
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:52.980]   It's one of the two large companies that are used by media companies to analyze all their
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:53.980]   traffic.
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:54.980]   What story was big?
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:56.980]   What sources big?
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:51:01.420]   So the media companies use WordPress VIP parsley, then they would be getting part of
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:03.060]   the deal would be even parsley.
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.380]   That makes sense.
[00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:11.620]   In the long term, they're saying automatic hopes to bring deeper commerce insights to
[00:51:11.620 --> 00:51:16.980]   parsley to help WP VIP clients better optimize for commerce.
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:17.980]   Content management.
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:20.700]   Oh, man, everything is turning from content into sales.
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:21.700]   It's bonkers.
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.380]   You look at what MailChimp has done.
[00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:26.660]   What is MailChimp doing in that regard?
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:32.620]   Oh, the last year, they've been really focusing very hard on the CRM and the sales as opposed
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:35.940]   to the content of a newsletter, if that makes sense.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.780]   That's what you use, right?
[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:38.780]   MailChimp?
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:43.380]   Right, but I'm looking for a new platform that focuses less on, because I'm paying for
[00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.900]   so much stuff I don't need.
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:50.060]   This is kind of this as a journalist.
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:55.060]   It is frustrating because your platforms, you want a platform that focuses on content,
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:52:02.140]   but because we don't generate a lot of revenue, those companies need to find ways to emphasize
[00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:06.780]   selling to people because that way they can get a cut of the funds coming in.
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:07.780]   So you see what price?
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:12.260]   Why not do sub stack or review or medium or something like that for yourself?
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:14.660]   Well, sub stacks business model doesn't work with mine.
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.660]   Okay.
[00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:18.340]   So that's why I think- Because you're giving yours away.
[00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.620]   You don't charge- Because I have paid sponsorships.
[00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:21.620]   Right.
[00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:24.980]   You make your money and ads not in selling the newsletter.
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:25.980]   Right.
[00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:26.980]   Sub stacks about subscribing.
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.100]   Let me give my stuff away, but it won't let me sell ads.
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:30.100]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.660]   Because you're supposed to- Oh, is that it?
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:32.660]   Okay.
[00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:33.660]   Yeah.
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.220]   Does medium- I mean- I don't think medium- No.
[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.220]   No.
[00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:44.140]   I talked to medium about starting a publication and it just didn't- None of these make sense
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:47.100]   for me, but they might- Does it depend on me?
[00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.100]   They might make sense for me.
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.100]   Does it depend on me to be person?
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:50.100]   No.
[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:53.700]   You know who we've been talking to and Ben Thompson uses these guys.
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.660]   It's the Patreon people, memberful.
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.420]   Have you looked at memberful?
[00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.140]   No.
[00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:04.420]   But that's actually- It works with MailChimp, but the idea is you- No, but again, it's
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:05.420]   subscribers.
[00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:06.420]   You want to do ad support.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:07.420]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:13.380]   I want to do- I just need a newsletter that is- I mean, MailChimp's gotten real dodgy.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:16.140]   You know, you're not supposed to write in the CMS.
[00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:18.460]   Well, every week I discover why with MailChimp.
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.460]   I don't write in CMS anymore.
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.980]   It does weird things.
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:25.820]   I mean, like, you're like, "I think I saved this."
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:28.140]   And then it's like, "You think you saved it."
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.660]   Actually, it logs you out.
[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:31.500]   And I did not tell you that you're logged out.
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.740]   All of this stuff you're writing doesn't count.
[00:53:34.740 --> 00:53:35.740]   Oh, hell.
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:38.740]   Don't write in the CMS.
[00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.260]   You should know that.
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:41.260]   That's painful.
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.860]   Well, I learned that especially with MailChimp.
[00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:49.940]   But even- I mean, it still takes time to drop stuff in and you still end up tweaking stuff.
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:52.540]   And then you're like, "Gah."
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:56.700]   See I write in the medium CMS because it's such a beautiful CMS.
[00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:59.740]   That's what medium's selling point was for a while.
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:02.420]   Was you'll love using medium.
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:05.100]   They knew people wrote in the CMS.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:09.820]   I signed up from MailChimp because I thought about doing a newsletter because there's a
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:12.260]   lot of people that reach out to me that aren't social media.
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.940]   And I figured it'd be a nice way to do it.
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:15.780]   But I don't know.
[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.700]   Sometimes it seems like, "Dang, that's a lot of work."
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:19.700]   It's a lot of work.
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:20.700]   It is.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:21.700]   The commitment.
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:22.700]   It's hard.
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:23.700]   You're right.
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:25.700]   I used to blog every day.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:29.580]   I tried to put something on my blog at least once a week.
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:30.580]   I try.
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:32.580]   I don't even do that anymore in December.
[00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.820]   I never thought I'd try to put at least something up once a week.
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:37.700]   Stacey, you're a writer though.
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:39.820]   This is your medium.
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:41.340]   I actually hate writing.
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:42.340]   Oh, never mind.
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:43.340]   I am a reporter.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:50.980]   I'm like, writing is just the thing I have to do because- Yeah.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:55.580]   You have to communicate what your research says.
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:56.580]   Somehow.
[00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:57.580]   That's why I talk.
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:54:59.820]   It's a lot of these in writing.
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.820]   You like writing?
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:02.820]   I like writing.
[00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:05.060]   It's- A lot of people do.
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:06.060]   I do.
[00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:11.500]   It's right up there with sitting at my- Sitting in the editing photos of video.
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:13.780]   This just is therapeutic for me.
[00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:14.780]   Yeah.
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.260]   It's your detail right now.
[00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.540]   There's a chainsaw going on behind me.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:19.540]   I don't hear it.
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:20.540]   It's okay.
[00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:24.780]   It's not as bad as Mary Jo Foley on Windows Weekly this morning.
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.780]   She was getting her bricks re-pointed.
[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:28.780]   Oh, it hurts.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:29.780]   Wait, what?
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:30.780]   What is that a process doing?
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:33.060]   Brics, re-point, help.
[00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:36.620]   You take out the- They're re-mortarring the bricks, but they call it pointing.
[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:37.620]   Oh!
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:38.620]   Okay.
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:40.700]   I was just asking each all day, it just turned on.
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:47.740]   She lives in a hundred-year-old New York brickwork building, and they have to renew
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:48.740]   the pointing.
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:50.820]   They're pointing as the mortar joints.
[00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:56.460]   So the way they do it is they- Here's some German masons re-pointing a wall in 1948.
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.140]   They scrape out- Thank you Wikipedia.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:03.340]   They scrape out the mortar.
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:05.460]   Actually nowadays they do it with a drill.
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:09.780]   And then they re-mortar it.
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.780]   So.
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.780]   Why did I say that?
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:16.660]   Oh, because that was a lot noisier than what I'm- I don't hear anything from you, so you're
[00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.660]   okay.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:18.660]   Sorry, Joe's.
[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:22.140]   I actually just put some bar sounds behind it.
[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:23.900]   It was just- Glasses tinkling.
[00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:24.900]   Yeah.
[00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:25.900]   Conversation.
[00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:27.860]   Yeah, we just pretended we were at a- Oh, I miss bar sounds.
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:32.660]   Yeah, we pretended we were at a bar doing the show.
[00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:35.620]   I'm thinking Jeff Jarvis wrote this.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:37.620]   Stupidity is contagious.
[00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:43.060]   Key, my fingerprint was all over now.
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:50.540]   So apparently it's gone so well for the Australian government to demand Google and Facebook
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:56.140]   Pay for News articles that now the EU wants to do it.
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:58.980]   And Canada.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:05.540]   What is the lesson they're not learning here?
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.060]   Who is they in this case?
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.900]   The governments or the- Yeah, the government, EU.
[00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:13.980]   So the EU, and of course it's behind a paywall because I read the financial- I try to read
[00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:15.700]   the Financial Times too often.
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.180]   Jeff's explained this to me.
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:18.260]   Yeah, it knocks you off.
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:19.260]   It knocks me off.
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:20.420]   I can never read anything on there.
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:25.580]   But apparently this is, according to the Financial Times, the EU wants to make, you know, do what
[00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:31.140]   Australia did to Google and ask them to pay for news articles.
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:36.980]   So what's going to happen here is that Europe's going to say, "So maybe you can leave little
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.580]   tiny Australia.
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:40.060]   You can't leave Europe.
[00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:41.540]   We're too big."
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:42.540]   Although.
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:47.820]   And although it's the member of the European Parliament from Malta that's proposing it.
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:49.220]   They could leave Malta.
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:51.940]   They could pretty much leave Malta and never knows.
[00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:54.340]   They could leave Malta with no sweat.
[00:57:54.340 --> 00:57:57.420]   But then I think what's happened is Google is also opening up, I think, as part of the
[00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:00.500]   bribery scheme the publishers have been doing, it's Google showcase.
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:02.700]   And Google would say, "Well, we leave you.
[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:03.700]   We leave the showcase.
[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:04.700]   You don't want to be mean to us."
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:08.580]   And it's a game going on here.
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:11.020]   It's a ridiculous game.
[00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:12.020]   Ridiculous.
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:17.460]   However, Google might have opened the door because a Google spokesperson told the Financial
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:22.340]   Times, "People trust Google to help them find relevant and reliable information from a range
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:23.660]   of websites.
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:28.100]   And this helps publishers by sending them valuable traffic to their sites."
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:29.340]   Okay, fine.
[00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:32.500]   And then we're willing to pay to further support journalism.
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.580]   And we're doing that around the world.
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:38.620]   It kind of gave away the game there.
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:39.620]   We'll pay you.
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:41.980]   They're saying, "We'll give you money."
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:45.300]   So maybe Google isn't fighting this as hard as we thought they were.
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:48.860]   There's a new term, by the way, for this.
[00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:51.340]   The idea of charging for links, they have to fight that.
[00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:53.460]   They have to have to have to fight that.
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:58.420]   So they'll end up paying publishers blackmail money, boxy-sh.
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:04.100]   But they cannot agree to a standard of paying for the privilege of linking.
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:05.540]   That just kills the better.
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:10.180]   And this is the new word for this Google being, Google leaving Australia, they're calling
[00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:11.180]   it Gexit.
[00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:12.180]   Gexit.
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:15.660]   Now, I was going to debate is it Gexit or Gexit?
[00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:17.660]   But in this case, it's Gexit.
[00:59:17.660 --> 00:59:18.660]   I think it's Gexit.
[00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:19.660]   Google gets--
[00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:20.660]   It's a hard G.
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:21.660]   Gexit.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:22.660]   Mercy.
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:23.660]   Gexit.
[00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:24.660]   Google.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:29.820]   It's on the rundown, the same spotly, or I think is important, is now suddenly you have
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:32.140]   businesses in Australia saying, "Whoa!"
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:33.140]   What are we going to do?
[00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:35.380]   This could hurt us terribly.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:36.380]   Yeah.
[00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:41.380]   Economic death for Aussie jobs if Google pulls search.
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:44.620]   This is from Yahoo Finance, Australia.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:51.940]   News and a new analysis from IBIS World, Australia, the small medium-sized businesses
[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:56.260]   that rely heavily on Google's digital presence and the business's ability to be found through
[00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:01.860]   web search means that Google's search withdrawal from Australia could be devastating.
[01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:07.260]   Google's exit or Gexit would disrupt numerous Australian industries which are already in
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:11.900]   a weakened state due to the COVID-19 panic.
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:15.500]   Here's the industries that are most vulnerable to a Gexit.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.500]   Gexit.
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:20.300]   It is fun to say, isn't it?
[01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:23.900]   It's like a Gecko leaves you with Gexit.
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:29.760]   Caravan parks, holiday houses, and other accommodation, restaurants, cafes and coffee
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.820]   shops, hairdressing and beauty services.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:33.340]   That makes sense.
[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:34.340]   That's true.
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:37.660]   You know, if I want to find, I don't go to the yellow pages if I want to find a plumber.
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:39.660]   I Google it.
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:40.660]   Well, that's dead now.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:42.620]   Oh, well, maybe you go to Yelp instead.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.460]   It's good for Yelp.
[01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:45.460]   No.
[01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:46.460]   No.
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:47.460]   You know why?
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.340]   You put it on your mobile phone and Yelp always makes you go to their freaking app.
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:52.340]   Yeah, I hate that.
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:01:08.920]   They don't believe in the
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.920]   office.
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.980]   Apparently there's a way, and I learned this on Reddit.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:18.060]   There's apparently a way to turn off that prompt to open the Reddit app.
[01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:21.580]   I have to go through my Reddit and find it.
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.780]   That should be a tip of the week.
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:23.780]   It should be.
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.420]   All right, I'll tell you what, if I can find it before the end of the show, it'll be my
[01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:28.620]   tip of the week.
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:31.780]   How to get Reddit to stop bugging you.
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.780]   Sweet.
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:33.780]   Drives me.
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:34.780]   Blancas.
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:35.780]   Blancas, man.
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:36.780]   I'll tell you it's Blancas.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:41.420]   Well, before I forget the other competitor to parsley is Chart Beat.
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.420]   Chart Beat.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:43.420]   I know Chart Beat.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:44.420]   We used to use Chart Beat.
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:48.220]   We use Chart Beat at Gigah Omen then parsley at somewhere else.
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.220]   Oh.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:52.660]   I was like, I know both of them.
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:53.660]   Yeah.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:54.660]   Okay.
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:55.660]   All right.
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:56.660]   Okay, Doki.
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:01.340]   I have no idea who CBS interactive used to use.
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:02.340]   No idea.
[01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:04.940]   Oh, I thought you were going to say I have no idea about using these things.
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:08.940]   I was like, that you were not just like page view demands.
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:09.940]   Good man.
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:10.940]   Good man.
[01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:11.940]   No, we don't care about page views.
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:16.780]   See, that's how big media actually ruined the internet is the attention based advertising
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.980]   economy is what ruined everything.
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:20.780]   It wasn't just media.
[01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:21.780]   It's not media.
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:22.780]   So it wasn't just media.
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:23.780]   Right.
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:24.780]   Great.
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:26.980]   It was not them itself, but they created the market.
[01:02:26.980 --> 01:02:32.780]   Because, I mean, Lord knows that Gigah Omen, we paid attention to page views, but we also
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:36.580]   did stories that didn't require great page views.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:38.500]   But.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:44.060]   From Nina's cake cabin comes our picture of the week.
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.100]   That's my pick of the week because it's cake.
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.100]   Okay.
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.100]   So what are we looking at?
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:52.220]   It looks like an Amazon prime box, doesn't it?
[01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:54.900]   From Nina's cake cabin might be something else.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.700]   Let's wait a minute.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:58.900]   Let's cut into that Amazon prime box.
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:04.660]   Oh, it's delicious chocolate cake with raspberry jam and lashings of buttercream.
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:05.660]   Oh my.
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:06.660]   Oh my.
[01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.540]   Is that something?
[01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:11.100]   Now the question is, is that all fondant?
[01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:13.740]   Because if it is, that taste is the cake is nasty.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:19.300]   I don't like fondant, but I think it's just a fondant cardboard box fondant that you can
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:20.300]   then peel off.
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:24.780]   Well, because if you could ice everything and then just use fondant.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:25.780]   Make fondant labels.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:26.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:27.780]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.780]   Fondant labels.
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.180]   Maybe it just doesn't look as good, I guess.
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.180]   I'm not a.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:32.180]   I mean, I'm being nit picky.
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:33.180]   I was.
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:34.460]   No, I'm with you every time I see something like this.
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.420]   I think the same thing.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:37.420]   It's a lot of fondant.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:39.260]   It would ship and fondant.
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:41.180]   I think it's the cake breakers son.
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:42.380]   I think she was promoting her.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:43.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:44.380]   Son and her cake.
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:47.500]   My post about my son's Amazon box cake.
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.500]   Nobody believed it.
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:54.500]   So she had to be she had posted again with a little slice taken out of it.
[01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.500]   She's clearly a professional.
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.500]   You know what?
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:04:00.940]   If I made that cake, I would show it off to I would bring it on twit.
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:01.940]   Yeah.
[01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:02.940]   See it next week.
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.940]   I'd like to show you my Amazon box cake.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.300]   I'd be like, look, y'all.
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:09.660]   I'll ask you this question.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:11.940]   Have you eaten corn ribs?
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.940]   Corn ribs.
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.940]   What are corn ribs?
[01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:16.340]   That's the newest tech talk sensation.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:18.300]   Oh, God.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:23.460]   By the way, we'll show some corn ribs and then.
[01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:31.100]   We tried the TikTok food trends as USA Today.
[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.180]   It's much more fun to eat corn the cob this way.
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:35.740]   So apparently you peel the corn off the cob.
[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:37.900]   No, you cut it in quarters.
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:39.500]   Oh, you cut the cob in quarters.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:41.500]   Oh, so it's ribs.
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.140]   Oh, that's silly.
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:44.140]   Here's the video.
[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:46.140]   It is just disgusting.
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.140]   Unbelievable.
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:52.940]   It does look kind of fun.
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:56.380]   Some people say to hack it a knife with a rolling pin, but A, that didn't work and B,
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:57.380]   it's just way too complicated.
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.380]   You get it.
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:04:59.860]   I found that if you stand it up straight and give it a frame.
[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:01.460]   If you put it in an air fryer.
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:02.460]   Oh, you don't.
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.460]   You have four ribs like so.
[01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:08.340]   In a bowl, add some olive oil, lemon pepper, and I'm impressed that they can get these
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:09.340]   recipes in one minute.
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.340]   I know, it's amazing.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.340]   It makes them brush it onto your corn ribs.
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:17.700]   You can also fry or bake these, but I air fry them at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 10 minutes
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:18.700]   and flipped one halfway.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:20.340]   It should totally let me.
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:23.540]   It looks like nicely seasoned corn on the cob.
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:24.540]   Yeah.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.540]   That's a lot easier.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.140]   It's like Mexican street corn.
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:28.140]   Almost.
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:29.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.140]   Ooh, I love that.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:31.140]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:36.860]   Those ladies and gentlemen, well, the good news is I bring that up to say TikTok has been
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:37.860]   saved.
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:43.340]   Saved hallelujah from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:51.100]   TikTok, sale to Oracle Walmart is shelved as Biden reviews security.
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:55.500]   Trump driven deal had languished as video sharing apps.
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.180]   Chinese owner mounted successful legal challenges.
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:03.020]   You've been following this thing since last fall.
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:04.980]   President Trump, of course, hated TikTok.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.260]   The party and gifts.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.580]   Oracle may.
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:13.460]   So what's actually happening now is a much more reasoned, but still, I think, important
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:21.220]   process where the government takes a look at the risks posed by Chinese tech companies
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:23.660]   collection of data.
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:28.060]   And then according to National Security Council spokesperson Emily Horn, we plan to develop
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:33.580]   a comprehensive approach to securing US data that addresses the full range of threats
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:34.580]   we face.
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:39.180]   This includes the risk posed by Chinese apps and other software that operate in the US
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:40.180]   in the coming months.
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:44.060]   We expect to review specific cases in light of a comprehensive understanding of the risks
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.060]   we face.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:48.940]   So figure out what the risks are, which is a good question.
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:52.260]   And then figure out ways to solve it like.
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:57.420]   And this is something TikTok's proposed, having a trusted third party hold the data
[01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:04.140]   to make sure that Chinese government can't get access to it.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:10.300]   So I think this is a good way to solve it, not to ignore entirely the threat, potential
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:17.260]   threat of TikTok and other Chinese companies, but to come up with a solution that keeps
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:19.220]   everybody safe and everybody happy.
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:23.580]   Because there's a lot of people doing a lot of great stuff on TikTok.
[01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:27.620]   And also there was the issue that Chinese government said you can't sell the algorithm.
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:33.140]   So what was what were Oracle and Walmart going to get anyway?
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:39.980]   So this just is something we saw coming for a while.
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:41.780]   But it's good news.
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:45.340]   What a ridiculous who was next week.
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:50.260]   Another executive order signed by the former president is set to go into effect that would
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:57.180]   ban US transactions with eight China related apps, including Alipay, the WeChat mobile
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:00.940]   payment app owned by 10 cent.
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:05.460]   Unknown, whether the Biden administration will enforce the order or extend the deadline
[01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.820]   or simply rescind the order outright.
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:13.340]   But I suspect this is part of the overall investigation of what are what are the threats
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:16.300]   and how to best deal with them.
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.700]   So a little more thoughtful approach.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:26.420]   And sorry, that means that $5 billion fund for education that was going to be extracted.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.860]   The president, I didn't see this part.
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:35.180]   Apparently, according to the journal, he likened it to key money, which is the extra
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:42.180]   fee that tenants sometimes pay landlords for securing a hard to get property.
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:47.500]   You know, in New York City, you know, you pay a little key money to get into that apartment.
[01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.100]   It's called a graft.
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.740]   Yeah, it's called a bribe.
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.340]   It was a $5 billion bribe.
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:59.500]   And I think it was for the 1776 project, which by the way, when it finally came out,
[01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:03.660]   was kind of maybe you don't really want to teach kids slavery was OK.
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:07.180]   Yeah, I was going to say Walmart's not going to be one part of that.
[01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:08.180]   Either Zoracle.
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:11.660]   They don't need to be now.
[01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:12.860]   They're you.
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:17.860]   Mm-hmm.
[01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:19.860]   You wanted to podcast?
[01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:21.860]   Oh, it was a little funny.
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:24.860]   I'll try to get a little key fee to be on the show.
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:27.260]   Well, that's actually so journalists do.
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:30.220]   So some news organizations do that.
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:32.860]   You can see it in conferences with pay to play.
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:34.860]   I mean, really?
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:35.860]   That's shame for you.
[01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:36.860]   Do you?
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:37.860]   Do you?
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:39.060]   That is a thing that happens.
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.060]   Look at this.

[01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:46.020]   She's going to sing a song.
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:47.020]   A ticktock.

[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:04.020]   Nice to have a famous mom.
[01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:05.020]   Ah, OK.
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:06.020]   That's cute.
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.020]   It's like he wouldn't put her on.
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:10.020]   They wouldn't put her on if she didn't have a good voice.
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:12.020]   No, she sounds good.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:13.020]   Willow.
[01:10:13.020 --> 01:10:14.020]   Sounds very good.
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.020]   Yep.
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:17.020]   That's actually, believe it or not, Pink's first ticktock post.
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.020]   Smart.
[01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:19.020]   It's smart.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:25.020]   If you're going to join Ticktock as an older person, get your kids to do some.
[01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.020]   Oh, the person.
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:27.020]   I don't think...
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.020]   Seriously?
[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:29.020]   Oh, I don't think Pink's...
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:31.020]   I think she's a little older than that.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:33.020]   She's not as old as you, but...
[01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:35.020]   [laughter]
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.020]   She is 41.
[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:40.020]   She's...
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:48.020]   Ticktock and universal music have unveiled their expanded global alliance.
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:50.020]   I didn't know it had one on the first place.
[01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:52.020]   Well, that's one of the reasons...
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:56.020]   That's one of the brilliant things Ticktock did.
[01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:57.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.020]   That's the thing.
[01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.020]   Right.
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.020]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.020]   And it's why people love it.
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:02.020]   Do they have any idea?
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:03.020]   Singing?
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:04.020]   How much do they pay them?
[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.020]   Do they have any idea?
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:10.020]   It's fascinating if you go back to the early days of the copyright fights and Fosta Cesta...
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:15.020]   Not Fosta Cesta, but what was the fight over copyright?
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.020]   Napster?
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:18.020]   No, Fosta Cesta.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:20.020]   There was legislation that Fosta Cesta's the...
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.020]   That's the sex work.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.020]   Oh, Stopa Pippa.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:23.020]   Stopa Pippa.
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.020]   Stopa Pippa.
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:25.020]   Stopa Pippa.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.020]   Stopa Pippa Fosta Cesta.
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:28.020]   You consider that...
[01:11:28.020 --> 01:11:29.020]   Watch out.
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:30.020]   Cover your ears, Aunt.
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:34.020]   When Ratatouille, the Ticktock musical, came out, Disney...
[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:40.020]   ...10 years ago, would have put a thousand lawyers on sending cease and desist letters.
[01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:42.020]   And now they say, "Oh, cool, good."
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:44.020]   And here, Warner Music says, "Smart, cool, good."
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:45.020]   We find new fans.
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:47.020]   Yeah, they finally spark it up.
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:51.020]   And by the way, Ticktock does pay money to recording artists and songwriters.
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:53.020]   I mean, they are paying royalties.
[01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:54.020]   Yeah.
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:55.020]   So it's not...
[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:58.020]   You know, we're not giving you this music for free, but I'm sure it's a much reduced amount of money.
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:03.020]   I'm surprised we don't see more songwriters and singers come on to start a duet thing.
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.020]   Yeah, that would be great.
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.020]   Like the Sea Shanties?
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:07.020]   Who would like us to see Shanty?
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:09.020]   Who now has a recording contract?
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:10.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:12.020]   But the...
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:13.020]   ...by the way...
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:14.020]   The Sea Shanty guy...
[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:15.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:18.020]   The bass who's on his things is phenomenal.
[01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:23.020]   Should we take that as an excuse to play some Sea Shanties?
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:24.020]   No, no.
[01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:25.020]   Let's talk about people.
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.020]   I just do that to tease you.
[01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.020]   I just do that!
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.020]   No, Sea Shanty!
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:32.020]   Get a rise out of you!
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:34.020]   All right, let's take a little break and then we'll do the...
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:35.020]   How about we do the Google change log?
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:36.020]   What about that?
[01:12:36.020 --> 01:12:37.020]   Oh!
[01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.020]   Ha ha ha!
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:42.700]   But first a word from our sponsor ITProTV.
[01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:47.380]   It is a great time to get in the tech industry.
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:52.500]   The COVID crisis has done nothing but improve your prospects in IT.
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:57.140]   The workforce is growing, demand is growing, and there are millions, literally.
[01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:05.140]   I'm not even exaggerating millions of job openings right now in all parts of IT.
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:10.140]   An IT career, and I'll tell you this, can be rewarding.
[01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:13.140]   You can have longevity, it's something you can use your whole working life.
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:19.020]   And at ITProTV, you don't just get IT skills, you get the skills that are in demand.
[01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:24.140]   You also get the coaching to help you choose the IT field you're interested in.
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:28.940]   They tell you where the jobs are, and most importantly, they tell you which certifications
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:31.740]   you need to get that first job.
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:35.660]   But one of the best things about ITProTV, the thing you'll appreciate the most is their
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:36.660]   teaching style.
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:37.660]   They're great.
[01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:44.100]   Seven studios live Monday through Friday because, well, everything changes in IT rapidly, so
[01:13:44.100 --> 01:13:49.940]   they have to constantly update their courses, the questions change in the exam, there's
[01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:51.740]   new versions of software.
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:57.060]   There's so much to learn, but ITProTV can teach it all to you.
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:14:02.460]   With their great experts, their real IT pros, they work in the field, but they're also entertainers
[01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:04.580]   who keep it light, who keep it fun.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:08.780]   And you know what, that's the key to learning, is that it's enjoyable.
[01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:13.100]   One reviewer said, "This site has helped me with two certifications, and also is this
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:16.500]   supplemental material for my grad school classes.
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:17.500]   Give it a try.
[01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:18.500]   You won't be disappointed.
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.860]   I couldn't agree more.
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:24.220]   Get the certs you need to get the job you want all from the safety and comfort of your
[01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:25.220]   own home.
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:27.900]   Learn at your own pace and schedule.
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:34.900]   There are 5,800 hours and always more coming of on-demand IT training.
[01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:37.860]   You can stream it to your big screen TV.
[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.620]   They have Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV apps.
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:43.660]   You can watch it on your computer, on your phone.
[01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:47.340]   This month is Project Management Month at ITProTV.
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:51.060]   There's a webinar tomorrow, actually.
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:55.060]   It'll be on demand thereafter, but you can watch it live tomorrow called Navigating the
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:14:56.860]   Future of Project Management.
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:01.740]   Maybe you're already in IT, but you'd like to step up and become a project manager.
[01:15:01.740 --> 01:15:07.460]   You can learn PMP, ITAL, Service Management, and Agile.
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:10.140]   Get training in Microsoft, Cisco, Apple, Linux, and more.
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:13.740]   They're the only official video training partner for CompTIA.
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:16.420]   That's where you get those A+ certs.
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:19.260]   Did you get an A+ when you first started an IT?
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:21.340]   You probably could get one easily.
[01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:24.900]   I thought about it because it is a popular cert to get.
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:25.900]   It helps.
[01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:30.180]   Security+, Network+, you were able to get the job without doing it.
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:34.820]   I tell you what, a lot of times if you don't have experience, they look at you and go,
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:37.940]   "Hey, you seem like a nice guy, but I need to know you know the stuff."
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:40.420]   That's where the certs are really helpful.
[01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:45.620]   You can also get an ITProTV learning coach along with all the other job resources they
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:48.940]   offer to help guide you on your career path.
[01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:50.460]   Lots of support there.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.620]   Lots of support there.
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:57.140]   There's good free stuff too, by the way, including Don Pezzette's Tech NATO Podcast featuring
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:02.540]   industry guests and IT news recaps a deeper dive into the IT realm.
[01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:05.980]   I'm telling you, if you've thought about getting into IT or you're already in IT and
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:10.980]   you just want to get a better job or learn more skills, there's no better IT education
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:11.980]   than ITProTV.
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:14.700]   I could tell you with absolute certainty.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:18.540]   ITProTV/Twit.
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:21.500]   There's Don himself right there on the screen.
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.300]   ITProTV/Twit.
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:27.820]   The offer code is Twit30 to receive 30% off all consumer subscriptions.
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.980]   As long as you stay active, it's 30% off.
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:30.980]   Could be forever.
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:32.660]   That's a great deal.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:39.420]   ITProTV/Twit offer code Twit30 for 30% off the lifetime of your active subscription.
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:44.540]   It's the same as your ITProTV.
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:50.580]   Build or expand your IT career and enjoy the journey.
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:51.580]   ITProTV/Twit offer code Twit30.
[01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:54.900]   Can I show you one thing that's not Google and then we'll do the change log?
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:58.300]   I just thought this was fascinating.
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:01.780]   This is from a blog called Less Wrong, Less Wrong.com.
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:07.340]   John Wentsworth, he's making his own COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:10.620]   Okay.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:16.940]   He says, first of all, I have a little wet lab experience for my undergraduate days, but
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:19.580]   the skills needed are pretty minimal.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:23.860]   All the materials and equipment to make the vaccine cost about $1,000.
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:27.580]   You do not need any special license or anything like that.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:29.260]   You don't need FDA approval.
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:32.300]   As long as you're not giving it to anybody but yourself and your family.
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:37.300]   The largest majority of the cost, $850, was the peptides.
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:38.420]   You can buy these.
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:40.460]   I had no idea.
[01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:43.580]   You can buy them online in the main active ingredients of the vaccine.
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:51.220]   Short segments of protein from the COVID virus, they're all fewer than 25 amino acids.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.460]   So they can't function as proteins.
[01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:59.580]   They're not dangerous, for instance, as an example, COVID spike protein has 1,273 amino
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:02.060]   acids, so less than 25.
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:04.380]   The whole point of it is it's not dangerous.
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:09.460]   They can't do anything to you, but your immune system looks at it and goes, "Ooh, that sequence?
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:11.500]   Don't let that in.
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.900]   That's what gives you the immunity."
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:16.180]   The peptides are custom synthesized.
[01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:17.180]   I had no idea.
[01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:19.460]   There are companies which will do this.
[01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:24.900]   Any short peptide sequence you want, there are dozens of them online.
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.140]   You can use the cheapest ones.
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:28.500]   You don't need to purify them.
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.780]   They don't need any special modifications.
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:32.380]   You don't need much.
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:38.100]   The minimum order size from the company we used would have been sufficient for 250 doses.
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:43.780]   We bought twice as much because it only cost $50 extra to get double the peptides and extras
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:46.540]   are nice in the case of mistakes.
[01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:49.260]   He doesn't need to give this stuff to anybody else.
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:52.460]   It's just him and his wife.
[01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:58.860]   You need a stir plate, beakers, micro centrifuge tubes, 10 and 50 milliliter vials of pipette
[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:04.380]   in the .1 to 1 milliliter range and pipe-hept tips all available on Amazon.
[01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:06.100]   Here's the other materials.
[01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:08.780]   They're sold as supplements.
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:13.900]   keto-san and sodium tri-poly phosphate.
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:16.740]   They're also maybe a little vinegar and de-anized water.
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:21.340]   You can get everything on Amazon.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.340]   Simple to do.
[01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:23.340]   You just...
[01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:25.500]   This is hysterical.
[01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.180]   You prepare the solutions of each component.
[01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:30.580]   dissolve it separately, stick in the freezer until it's needed.
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:34.260]   Circularize two of the peptides, which means really just adding a few grains of activated
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:37.140]   charcoal to the tube and shaking it for three hours.
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:39.700]   So maybe you need a little shaking machine.
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:42.860]   Then back in the freezer when it's time for a batch, take everything out of the freezer,
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:45.860]   mix it together.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:46.860]   Pipe-hept...
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:48.020]   It's going to be a tic-tac recipe.
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:49.820]   This is hysterical, finally.
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:51.100]   And this is the thing.
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.460]   It goes up your nose.
[01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:55.380]   It's not an injection.
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:20:02.060]   It makes it both less dangerous, but also a little harder to prove that it's working because
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:09.220]   all of the current tests are blood tests for the antibodies.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:15.300]   He is where we're going to get antibody tests to see if it did anything.
[01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.900]   He says on the one hand, putting it in your nose is probably a good idea because that's
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:21.980]   where you want the immunity because that's how the virus gets in.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:28.020]   On the other hand, unfortunately, all the antibody tests or blood tests, so they may
[01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:32.740]   not be that you get immune response or a strong immune response in the blood if you
[01:20:32.740 --> 01:20:34.540]   put it up your nose.
[01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:36.860]   Anyway, it's a great article.
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:39.980]   He's going to stay tuned.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:45.540]   He's going to let us know how the tests work.
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:49.100]   Wow.
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:50.940]   Good on you for trying.
[01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:55.060]   He says you can't hurt yourself because it's because of the way it is.
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:59.140]   It's just not, you know, worst case, it doesn't work.
[01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:02.980]   Well, let's hope that's working.
[01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:08.340]   He says it's a fun project in its own right and it gets dramatically cheaper with more
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:09.340]   people.
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:14.860]   Remember, $1,000 bought enough supplies for 500 doses.
[01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:18.460]   The largest benefit you've been wasting your time trying to make sour milk.
[01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:19.460]   I'm going to do it.
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:20.460]   Yeah, I might do this.
[01:21:20.460 --> 01:21:21.460]   No.
[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:28.420]   I mean, if you do it, just also make sure you get the vaccine later.
[01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:31.100]   What if I vaccinate or you see, it's not a vaccine.
[01:21:31.100 --> 01:21:33.740]   And what if I did this for the whole company, John?
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:36.340]   Would you all, would you all do it?
[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:41.540]   That would be, no.
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:44.020]   I think this would be a great story.
[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:48.540]   Podcast company vaccinates its entire staff using homemade vaccine.
[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:49.540]   Amen.
[01:21:49.540 --> 01:21:50.540]   That's what's.
[01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:51.540]   That's what's.
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.540]   That's what's so cool.
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:55.940]   John is the loyal employee.
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:22:01.180]   That's just what's so cool about mRNA vaccines as opposed to see if this were, you know,
[01:22:01.180 --> 01:22:05.580]   a traditional vaccine, this, I wouldn't do it because you're, you know, it's more
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:09.580]   dangerous, but an mRNA vaccine is harmless.
[01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:13.380]   Now he doesn't, unfortunately, doesn't publish the recipe.
[01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:15.380]   What peptides to get?
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:17.300]   I might have to send him a note.
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:22.620]   So Dr. Momma, I said before the show that I think I got a delayed reaction to the shot
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:23.620]   like two weeks later.
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:24.620]   Yeah.
[01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:25.620]   Did she say with that?
[01:22:25.620 --> 01:22:26.620]   That's possible.
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:27.620]   Oh, wow.
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:28.620]   She said two weeks.
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:29.620]   No, she said you can still get it.
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:30.620]   You know, after the first shot, get a test.
[01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:31.620]   Yeah, you got to get two.
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:32.620]   You got to get two.
[01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:33.620]   Yeah.
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:34.620]   I love this guy.
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:36.100]   Huma, huge ma.
[01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:40.100]   I can't be how he pronounces his name.
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:41.100]   Huge ma.
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.980]   He works at Airbnb as a software engineer.
[01:22:43.980 --> 01:22:46.820]   It was so, he was trying to sign up his mom for a vaccine in New York City.
[01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:47.820]   It was so complicated.
[01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.180]   He decided to develop a site.
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:57.700]   He did it in two weeks, cost him $50 called TurboVax that went out and went to all the
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:00.540]   different sites because apparently there are many, many different sites to try to find
[01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:06.580]   an appointment in the city and state official systems.
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:07.580]   Do it yourself.
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.540]   It's what all the kids are doing now.
[01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:10.780]   You got the tech skills.
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:12.980]   Make your own vaccine.
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:14.660]   Make your own website.
[01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:18.780]   Yeah.
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:21.260]   We talked about it yesterday on security now.
[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:24.300]   The hacker that tried to poison Florida's city water supply.
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:27.420]   Oh, I had a guest on my show talk about that too.
[01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:28.420]   Yeah, not a good.
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.420]   You said that a little too lately.
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:31.420]   Whoa.
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:32.420]   Oh, we talked about it.
[01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:33.420]   Well, you, okay.
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:34.420]   No harm, no pal.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:38.140]   There were lots of really good things in that story, actually.
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:39.140]   I don't know.
[01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:40.140]   So, yes.
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:43.340]   Well, what's the moral of the story would you say since you've interviewed them?
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:45.940]   What is the moral of the story, Stacey?
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:49.020]   Oh, okay.
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:53.980]   The moral would be configure your remote access software correctly.
[01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:56.020]   Don't put redundant systems.
[01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:59.140]   Don't bind your IT and your OT together.
[01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:03.820]   Don't put your freaking water systems on the public internet.
[01:24:03.820 --> 01:24:04.820]   Nope.
[01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:06.820]   It would be a start.
[01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:08.060]   That's the lesson I take.
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:10.820]   Steve Gibson said, "It's very simple.
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:12.780]   You don't give people access to it.
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:17.740]   If they need access to it remotely for some reason, you have to call the operator and
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:18.740]   say, 'Give me access to it.'"
[01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:23.060]   So, the reason a lot of companies have done this though is because of the pandemic.
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:24.060]   Right.
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:25.980]   And so, that's unclear if they did that here.
[01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:30.620]   But what they did is they, I mean, a lot of companies, this is not isolated to this one
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:35.660]   water treatment plant, a lot of companies sent their employees home in the manufacturing
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:37.620]   and in the world of things.
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:38.620]   Yeah, but...
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.620]   Why are OT?
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:44.780]   Don't put team viewer on the machine that controls the water supply.
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:45.940]   So, it's not...
[01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:50.020]   So, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:55.180]   that's so the guy who has to deal with that and monitor those systems can do it remotely
[01:24:55.180 --> 01:24:56.180]   from home.
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:57.180]   Yes.
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.180]   And...
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:00.420]   You see though that that's probably not a good idea.
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:05.660]   So if you do something like that, you have to configure it differently.
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:10.420]   And what happened is people were in a rush and you're like, "Ah, ah, ah, but it's okay
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.580]   because they have backup systems in place."
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:17.020]   And there was a guy sitting there watching the mouse mover at him do it.
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:22.220]   And he said, "And to their credit, it doesn't take effect for at least a month or something."
[01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:23.980]   Yeah, it was in a holding tank.
[01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:24.980]   It was up...
[01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:31.500]   Upping the amount of lie in the water by a hundred times, which would make it early.
[01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:32.500]   Okay.
[01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:33.500]   Yeah.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:38.260]   And who this hacker is because it feels like this is like...
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:42.380]   It feels both incredibly obvious, like more like a, "Could I really do it?"
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:43.380]   You know...
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:44.380]   Yeah, it was one of the best friends.
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:45.380]   He was priced as anyone else.
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:48.260]   If you were a real bad guy, you'd might wait till three in the morning to do it.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:51.820]   No, I was probably that kid Levi in Sanford, Florida.
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:52.820]   Who's that?
[01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:56.780]   I don't know, just some kid named Levi.
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:57.780]   Oh, okay.
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:58.780]   Some kid named Levi.
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:25:59.780]   It was a hacker.
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.780]   I'm like, "You know exactly."
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:02.780]   Wasn't an adult.
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:03.780]   Wasn't kid.
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:04.780]   Yeah.
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:08.220]   But he knew enough to know where to go to change the levels.
[01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:12.860]   Well, he was there before, so he was looking around.
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:14.500]   Second time visiting.
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:15.500]   Yeah.
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:16.500]   So, again, I was...
[01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:18.540]   Maybe he was like, "Oh, why?"
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:19.540]   Yeah.
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:20.540]   Maybe this is just a water treatment plant.
[01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:23.140]   Let me look at how I can do this.
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:24.140]   How I can do this.
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:25.820]   For people who run these systems.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:26.820]   Maybe...
[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:27.820]   I don't like that stuff.
[01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:29.820]   I feel like these people know this stuff.
[01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:32.740]   Like, they know this is a danger.
[01:26:32.740 --> 01:26:33.740]   I didn't catch it.
[01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:42.700]   They're any legal ramifications for, like, were they able to trace back this person?
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:47.100]   They haven't found who it is yet, or they haven't said that they found who it is.
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.100]   It is a felony.
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:49.100]   Yeah.
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:50.100]   So...
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:51.100]   Should be.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:52.100]   I hope so.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.100]   I hope so too.
[01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:56.340]   Yeah, if you watch the press conference, they talked about it being, you know, the charges
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:58.740]   that could go against it, or her.
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:00.700]   They assumed it was a man.
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:01.700]   It might be a woman.
[01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:03.580]   Did I mention this last week?
[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:05.620]   Generally good odds it's a man.
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:11.900]   Did I mention last week the governor of Nevada's plan to create innovation zones in Nevada to
[01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:12.900]   jumpstart the...
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:13.900]   No, you mentioned on Twitter.
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:14.900]   Yeah, you were there.
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:19.980]   To jumpstart the state's economy by attracting technology firms.
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:22.420]   Seems like a good idea.
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:25.980]   Remember when Larry Page said we should have a Google island where there's no regulations
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:26.980]   and we could do what we want to?
[01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:27.980]   Yeah, this is stupid.
[01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:28.980]   Yep.
[01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:30.700]   Now we could do it in Nevada.
[01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:31.700]   The zones...
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:32.700]   16 tons.
[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:33.700]   What do you get?
[01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:37.420]   Another day older and deeper in data.
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:38.700]   Instead of giving tax breaks...
[01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:43.060]   In Nevada's breaks, California has not really been kind to a lot of these businesses.
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:44.740]   They're looking for a place to go.
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:46.780]   And listen to what you get.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:47.820]   Listen to what you get, Ant.
[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:49.180]   This is great.
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:54.580]   You don't get a tax benefit, but if you buy a large amount of land, like for instance,
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:55.580]   Elon Musk has done...
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:58.580]   I think Leo's thinking of moving into Nevada right now.
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:00.060]   I'm going to buy a large amount of land.
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:02.540]   He did it for the Gig Effect or the Battery Factory.
[01:28:02.540 --> 01:28:05.020]   So here's what you get to do.
[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:10.180]   You get to form your own government carrying the same authority as counties, including...
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:13.620]   And I presume not limited to...
[01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:20.740]   The ability to impose taxes, form school districts, have your own courts and your own
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:22.660]   government services.
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:23.660]   That's a lot of power.
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:24.660]   It's really Leoville.
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:25.660]   Leoville.
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:30.660]   I feel like the court system would be fascinating to see how...
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:34.860]   I mean, because you've got Google Court in this...
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:38.740]   So obviously, how do you bring jurisdiction?
[01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:40.060]   Those are really interesting questions.
[01:28:40.060 --> 01:28:46.020]   And then when you appeal, do you appeal to your next higher court, then goes back to
[01:28:46.020 --> 01:28:47.740]   the state level, I assume.
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:48.740]   Oh, interesting.
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.740]   Maybe.
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:50.740]   Who knows?
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:51.740]   Maybe there is no appeal.
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:57.780]   That's the institutional revolution, talks about how things worked before the modern days.
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:02.300]   And in England, the aristocracy, you own the property, you own the...
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:03.300]   That's right.
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:04.300]   You had the courts.
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:05.300]   That was feudalism.
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:08.860]   Justice was private.
[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:15.380]   If Leo robbed from Ant, it was up to Ant to go arrest Leo and Ant to take him to the
[01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:19.100]   Lord and try to get the Lord to say, "Would you pay Ant back?"
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:20.100]   Right.
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:22.100]   He would have made it to the Lord.
[01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:25.100]   He would give bodies with the Lord.
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:26.100]   Oh, Lord.
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:30.260]   He would waste for the Lord.
[01:29:30.260 --> 01:29:32.980]   So already they got to take her, by the way.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:36.300]   The governor proposed this in his state of the state address.
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:39.740]   Legislator has not taken it on, but already there's a company that says, "As soon as the
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:46.020]   legislation is passed, we want to develop a smart city in an area east of Reno."
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:55.940]   And I think I would trust a company named Blockchains LLC to run my smart city.
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:56.940]   Nope.
[01:29:56.940 --> 01:30:02.260]   This is like, this is a libertarian island nightmare.
[01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:03.260]   This is what happened.
[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:05.380]   This is my nightmare of cyber-brillage.
[01:30:05.380 --> 01:30:06.380]   What was it?
[01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:07.380]   Gulch.
[01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:09.540]   What was Anne Rand's something Gulch?
[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:10.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:10.540 --> 01:30:11.540]   Oh, right.
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:12.540]   Right.
[01:30:12.540 --> 01:30:14.860]   Surely our chat room knows.
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:20.060]   So it's not, look, it's not, you got to have some resources.
[01:30:20.060 --> 01:30:23.940]   You have to own 78 square miles of undeveloped, uninhabited land.
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:24.940]   Gulch.
[01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:25.940]   John Gulch.
[01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:26.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:27.940]   John Gulch.
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:28.940]   Who is John Gulch?
[01:30:28.940 --> 01:30:29.940]   Yeah.
[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:30.940]   Undeveloped, uninhabited.
[01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:31.940]   Gulch, Gulchville.
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:33.940]   Let's call it Gulchville.
[01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:34.940]   John Gulchtown.
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:40.340]   78 square miles of undeveloped, uninhabited land within a single county, but separate
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:42.940]   from any city, town, or tax increment area.
[01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:47.420]   You have to have at least $250 million planned to invest at least a billion dollars over
[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:48.420]   10 years.
[01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:50.420]   So it's, you know, it's going to be a big...
[01:30:50.420 --> 01:30:51.420]   You said Bitcoin?
[01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:52.420]   Hmm.
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:56.260]   The zones would have three members, a three member of a supervisor board with the same
[01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:59.660]   powers as county commissioners.
[01:30:59.660 --> 01:31:02.140]   But the business gets to appoint the board members.
[01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:03.820]   There's no, there's no elections.
[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:04.820]   That would be silly.
[01:31:04.820 --> 01:31:05.820]   Sentation.
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:10.420]   So if you live there and it's a literal company town, do you say, I mean, because like, I
[01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:15.180]   have rights guaranteed to me by the Constitution?
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:17.220]   I would guess this is unconstitutional.
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.740]   I'm going to guess.
[01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:24.540]   I mean, like, I mean, depending on how you implement this, it feels like...
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:29.220]   I mean, the legal ramifications of this are really fascinating.
[01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:30.220]   Absolutely.
[01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:32.860]   But I'm like, I would not want to live in Google town.
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:33.860]   No.
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:34.860]   No.
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:35.860]   Even if they give me, you know.
[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:36.860]   Oh, no, no.
[01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:37.860]   I would live on Google Island.
[01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:39.660]   Leo said years ago he'd live on Google Island.
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.660]   I'd live on Google Island.
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:41.660]   Not anymore.
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:42.660]   I don't like...
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:44.860]   No, dude, if you're old, I don't think you can live on Google Island.
[01:31:44.860 --> 01:31:45.860]   That's right.
[01:31:45.860 --> 01:31:47.340]   After 35, they push you out.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:49.380]   Well, that was my great story when I met...
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:52.780]   I was a guest at a meeting of a Google strategy group.
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:56.180]   I told a story years ago, and I had a senior moment.
[01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:57.180]   I forgot something.
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:31:58.740]   And I turned to the room and I just said, "Oh, don't get old."
[01:31:58.740 --> 01:32:03.220]   And one of them said, "Without missing a beat, we're working on that."
[01:32:03.220 --> 01:32:04.220]   Yep.
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:09.100]   Speaking of which, you know, all that spit you sent to 23 and me?
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:11.100]   Now Richard Branson owns it.
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:13.100]   That's the source.
[01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:15.340]   Richard Branson's got you spit.
[01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:20.940]   23 and me is a SPAC, which means effectively that...
[01:32:20.940 --> 01:32:21.940]   Spits back.
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:22.940]   Spits back.
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:23.940]   Spits back.
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:28.340]   It's virgin groups going to be renamed 23 and me.
[01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:29.340]   New stock will be...
[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:30.340]   They're going public via SPAC.
[01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:31.340]   Yeah, via SPAC.
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:35.500]   Three and a half billion dollar company.
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:38.260]   And we'll just keep putting 25 million.
[01:32:38.260 --> 01:32:41.420]   Richard Branson put in 25 million.
[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:44.380]   Yeah, public.
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:46.740]   ME is the stock ticker.
[01:32:46.740 --> 01:32:47.740]   And now...
[01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:50.020]   So is there a documentation of this?
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:51.620]   I mean, do we know what the cap table looks like?
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:52.620]   Do we know anything?
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:53.620]   Now that it's a public...
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:55.820]   Do you have to do a cap table with a SPAC?
[01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.820]   No, I think that's a beauty of the SPAC.
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:32:58.820]   Yeah.
[01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:02.820]   So you don't get it until the first quarterly things?
[01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:05.020]   You get it then, though.
[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:11.620]   I think so, unless there is SPAC with lots of companies and then you don't.
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:12.620]   SPAC.
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:13.620]   Oh, that's a point.
[01:33:13.620 --> 01:33:14.620]   Ten case.
[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:15.620]   Yeah, which is a holy company.
[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:16.620]   Yeah.
[01:33:16.620 --> 01:33:19.940]   VGAC is becoming 23 and me.
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:22.980]   So I don't know what happens to this bit.
[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:27.580]   I guess Richard Branson's got it.
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:28.580]   They've got my SPAC.
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:29.580]   They have mine.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:30.580]   Oh, I got...
[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:31.580]   They got two vials of mine.
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:32.580]   I did it twice.
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:33.580]   They don't have any of mine.
[01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:34.580]   I'm fine.
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:35.580]   What is it they're going to do?
[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:37.140]   What are they going to do with it?
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:38.140]   I'm fine with them.
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:39.140]   I think it was true that.
[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:40.140]   You could see later on that.
[01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:43.820]   You could see discrimination based on your genetic predispositions.
[01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:51.500]   And also, their assumptions about your health based on their genetic research is very incomplete,
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.780]   but we don't really know about that.
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:56.140]   So I think it's a slippery slipper.
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:57.140]   It's a slippery slipper.
[01:33:57.140 --> 01:33:59.580]   I found out that I found out my name should be Riley.
[01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:00.580]   Riley?
[01:34:00.580 --> 01:34:01.580]   You should be Irish.
[01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:02.580]   You're not a Jervis.
[01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:03.580]   You're a Riley.
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:10.580]   My grandfather was illegitimate if the gentleman who wasn't a gentleman had made my great-grandmother,
[01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:16.940]   an honest woman, as they used to say in those days, an obnoxious phrase.
[01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:17.940]   My name would be Riley.
[01:34:17.940 --> 01:34:18.940]   Oh.
[01:34:18.940 --> 01:34:19.940]   Thank you, Mr. Riley.
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:22.980]   Oh, well, now because it's 23andMe.
[01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:23.980]   Combined with...
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:24.980]   Really?
[01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:25.980]   They tell you that stuff?
[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:26.980]   I don't think they tell you.
[01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:27.980]   No, no, no.
[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:29.980]   We attract back certain members of the family between that and that's what's been figured
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:30.980]   enough.
[01:34:30.980 --> 01:34:32.780]   Ah, put it all together.
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:33.780]   Oh my gosh.
[01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:39.300]   I am on a 16-page document from Deloitte on the auditing and tax implications and public
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:40.300]   accountability things.
[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:42.100]   This is what Stacey Celts is about.
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:44.100]   I'm so glad that you're doing the research.
[01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:46.100]   Get back to us on that, will you?
[01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:48.100]   Yeah, we have it.
[01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:56.820]   Meanwhile, this picture, this picture from the Wikimedia Commons has caused a little
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:35:05.580]   bruhaha at Wikimedia because it's been downloaded some huge number of times by servers in India.
[01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:09.540]   They couldn't quite figure out what was going on.
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:16.220]   It's so much so that 23% of their image requests from Wikimedia Commons were coming for this
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:18.060]   one image.
[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:27.540]   90 million requests a day from various internet service providers in India.
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:29.260]   There's a daily traffic pattern.
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:34.260]   They figure there must be some mobile app that's used in India that uses it maybe as
[01:35:34.260 --> 01:35:38.140]   a splash screen.
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:41.620]   Was that image created by our very own Mr. Doc Searles?
[01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:43.260]   He has a lot of images.
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:44.260]   It could be, wouldn't that?
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:45.940]   You have to ask Doc.
[01:35:45.940 --> 01:35:46.940]   Is that your picture?
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:52.900]   It's a picture of an aster flower.
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:56.580]   Isn't this an advance in the internet's culture, I would say?
[01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:00.100]   Because the most downloaded thing we used to talk about, was it Cine Margolis?
[01:36:00.100 --> 01:36:01.100]   Yeah.
[01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:04.060]   It was the most downloaded one of the internet.
[01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:05.780]   So now it's a flower which is good.
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:08.220]   Now it's a flower which is a nice advance.
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:09.220]   Progress.
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:10.220]   That's what you're saying.
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:14.220]   What's great is the community got together and they seem to have figured it out.
[01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:18.180]   It's coming from a popular mobile app in India.
[01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:20.780]   They're talking to the app developers.
[01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:24.900]   They're going to block the request until they figure it out.
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:30.820]   One app, 10 million requests a day.
[01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:32.420]   That's deep blinking, baby.
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:33.420]   Wow.
[01:36:33.420 --> 01:36:34.420]   That's deep.
[01:36:34.420 --> 01:36:35.420]   So the answer is yes.
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:38.380]   They will have to file 10 case.
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:39.380]   Bingo.
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:41.380]   What were we talking about?
[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:42.380]   How much?
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:43.380]   Spats.
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:45.980]   Y'all are so mean to me.
[01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:47.620]   These are not mean to you.
[01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:48.620]   This is good.
[01:36:48.620 --> 01:36:49.620]   You love that stuff.
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:50.620]   You're so good.
[01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:53.980]   You went through a 100 page PDF and the time it took.
[01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:54.980]   I'm 16 pages.
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:55.980]   16 pages.
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:56.980]   16 pages.
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:37:00.220]   The time it took for me to talk about a flower.
[01:37:00.220 --> 01:37:01.220]   Let us...
[01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:02.220]   I don't know what the purple comb flower.
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:03.220]   I didn't realize...
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:05.020]   Well, I'm just looking at the name and the title.
[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:06.580]   It might not be an aster.
[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:07.820]   I don't know what it is.
[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:09.340]   No, no, I'm sure it is.
[01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:13.900]   After nov-bel-g flower.
[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:17.540]   I don't know.
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:18.540]   Now I've requested it twice.
[01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:21.460]   They're going to cut me off.
[01:37:21.460 --> 01:37:27.100]   We keep getting this request for this flower picture.
[01:37:27.100 --> 01:37:31.220]   Let's do, shall we, John, the Google change log.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:38.220]   The Google change log.
[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:40.220]   It's in the code.
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:42.660]   Google, not Google.
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:52.740]   Google is going to use in a future version of, I guess, Google Fit, their health app.
[01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:56.860]   This will require a Google Pixel camera starting next month.
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:38:03.780]   You'll be able to use the camera on your Pixel to measure your heart rate.
[01:38:03.780 --> 01:38:06.980]   Without a sensor, you can get respiratory and heart weight.
[01:38:06.980 --> 01:38:12.380]   You open the Fit app, not the Fit app, which is a Google official app.
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:13.900]   You tap the cards on the homepage.
[01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:19.860]   They're guessing your rate of breath by looking at your movement of your chest.
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:22.420]   So you have to hold the camera so it can see your torso.
[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:28.300]   Meanwhile, it uses tiny changes in color under your skin to calculate your heart rate.
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:31.300]   What does a big skin do to you?
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:32.900]   I want to see this in action.
[01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:35.220]   To do that, you'll have to place your finger on the rear camera.
[01:38:35.220 --> 01:38:38.860]   It actually Samsung did this years ago with their camera.
[01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:40.300]   It did work very well.
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:41.300]   No, it didn't.
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:44.620]   It insists they have tested it against many skin colors.
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:46.700]   Yes, that's important.
[01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:49.740]   That's pretty cool.
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:50.700]   They might be able to do this.
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:51.700]   I don't know.
[01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:53.220]   We'll see how accurate it is.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:39:00.980]   If you have a Pixel, remember the Galaxy S5 had a sensor on the back below the camera.
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:08.540]   I had an app for a while where if I put the camera and the light on my finger, it would
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:11.860]   imitate a pulse oximeter.
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:14.740]   It did work very well.
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:22.260]   Google has added a new out-to-play memory collection to Google Photos.
[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:26.860]   I actually like the collections on Google Photos.
[01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:28.420]   Those are really a fun reminder.
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:33.220]   Of course, June 1, you're going to lose your free storage on Google Photos.
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:35.660]   Until then, you can upload everything.
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:36.660]   It'll stay free forever.
[01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:39.900]   Upload all your pictures right now.
[01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:44.460]   This new thing out-to-play is one of the memories you get, the highlights of the story.
[01:39:44.460 --> 01:39:47.900]   It's a collection of moments of kids playing out in the sun.
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:55.900]   I presume kids you know a memory of better times when kids used to...
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:40:00.740]   Well, I mean, this has nothing to do with COVID.
[01:40:00.740 --> 01:40:02.300]   Kids used to play in the street all the time.
[01:40:02.300 --> 01:40:03.300]   Can't do that anymore.
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:04.820]   Then they used to play in front of the house.
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:06.420]   Can't do that anymore.
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:09.820]   Now you have to play in playgrounds, but you can't do that anymore.
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:12.860]   But the memories, the memories live on in your Google Photos.
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:18.180]   So look for that, a new out-to-play memory collection.
[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:23.500]   By the way, as you're using Google Photos, there is a new pinch to zoom for videos.
[01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:27.860]   You could pinch to zoom, I think, for stills, but now you could do that with videos, which
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:28.860]   is great.
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:31.580]   It's frustrating because it's a reflex and you couldn't do it.
[01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:32.580]   Yeah.
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:37.380]   I often want to get a zoom in on the video, see some detail.
[01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:38.380]   If you had...
[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:39.380]   It's CSI level.
[01:40:39.380 --> 01:40:40.380]   Yeah.
[01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:42.380]   Center, focus, zoom, enhance.
[01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:43.380]   In hands.
[01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:44.380]   In hands.
[01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:48.260]   What was that license plate?
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:53.220]   If you were using Google Play Music, presumably by now, you've pressed the button that converted
[01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:54.740]   over to YouTube music.
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:41:00.940]   I hope so, because later this month, they will delete your Play Music Library.
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:03.940]   So look for a final warning email.
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:04.940]   Goodbye.
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:06.660]   My email yesterday.
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:09.580]   Now you moved it over to YouTube music, I presume, right?
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:10.580]   No, sir.
[01:41:10.580 --> 01:41:11.580]   Oh, you didn't.
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:12.580]   So they just...
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:16.820]   I don't even know why they even bothered with me because I dumped it for Spotify a long
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:22.460]   time ago because it just got really, really bad on the user experience.
[01:41:22.460 --> 01:41:28.140]   And tried YouTube music and gave it a whirl with the rest of the family and they all
[01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:29.140]   cussed me out too.
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:30.140]   And it's like, no.
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:31.140]   Yeah.
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:32.140]   We're just going to...
[01:41:32.140 --> 01:41:34.580]   My kids refuse their Spotify all the way.
[01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:35.740]   Yeah.
[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:39.180]   So it's not just the music, the Cloud Locker music.
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:43.100]   I did, I uploaded 50,000 songs and a huge number of songs.
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:49.100]   But it's also purchases, playlists, stations, albums, all of that stuff, likes, dislikes.
[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:53.140]   So all of that will be gone if you don't move it over to YouTube music.
[01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.900]   You can use Google Takeout and download.
[01:41:54.900 --> 01:41:56.580]   It doesn't take out, I thought.
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:42:00.140]   Yeah, but you're going to get some big XML file.
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:05.420]   You have to write a parser just to understand what you've got.
[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:08.220]   So look for that email.
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:11.660]   Google is rolling out a firmware update.
[01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:22.700]   I saw Florence Ion on all out of Android yesterday talking about how her Google TV device, the
[01:42:22.700 --> 01:42:27.060]   new one that she'd gotten, was on a boot screen and apparently it got an update.
[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:34.420]   But there's also updates, new cast firmware, 1.52 for your Nest Hub Max, your Nest Hub,
[01:42:34.420 --> 01:42:35.820]   your Nest Hub Max.
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:40.100]   There's a new alarms UI, there's sunrise, there's zoom.
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:43.740]   So your Nest Hub and your Nest Hub Max are going to get a lot of new features with this
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:44.900]   new firmware.
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:46.700]   I am a Nest Hub fanatic.
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:49.020]   I have three of them.
[01:42:49.020 --> 01:42:52.940]   One in the kitchen, one in the bedroom, one in my office.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:54.260]   And I really like it.
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:42:56.220]   So lots of new features.
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:57.540]   Zoom integration is fantastic.
[01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:01.700]   I could take those Zoom meetings on the Nest Hub.
[01:43:01.700 --> 01:43:04.460]   I've been using Google Meet and Duo on it.
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:06.620]   It's really great.
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:11.780]   So unfortunately, though, according to the Google Support document, Zoom support is only
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:15.260]   available to a limited number of users, whatever that means.
[01:43:15.260 --> 01:43:23.180]   There's a new family tab, kid-friendly functionality on one screen like sticky notes, a school
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:26.340]   bell schedule and interactive stories, the family bell.
[01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:29.060]   Do you use the family bell at home, Stacey?
[01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:34.460]   No, my daughter, like, thank God, because she is on top of her schedule.
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:37.540]   Like, I don't even know when she's supposed to be places, but she does.
[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:39.580]   You'll know you have it when you hear the new cast tone.
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:42.500]   This is the old tone.
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:44.220]   This is the new tone.
[01:43:44.220 --> 01:43:45.220]   Ah.
[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:46.220]   So...
[01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:48.220]   Well, what a difference.
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:49.220]   Okay.
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:51.620]   From that to that.
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:52.620]   And there's a...
[01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:53.620]   It's so different.
[01:43:53.620 --> 01:43:55.220]   It's not a minor to major.
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:56.220]   Yeah.
[01:43:56.220 --> 01:43:57.220]   Yeah.
[01:43:57.220 --> 01:43:58.220]   It's a little higher.
[01:43:58.220 --> 01:44:03.420]   Finally, Jeff, you should get your Google Pixel Buds back.
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:05.420]   There's a new firmware update.
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:06.420]   Did they fix it?
[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:07.420]   Did they fix it?
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:08.420]   I don't know.
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:10.420]   553, let's see what they fixed.
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:15.420]   Stability during calls, auto recovery after losing connection, that sort of fixes it.
[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:17.060]   Well, I don't fix it.
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:21.340]   Improved media playback stability for phones that have software audio encoding and one
[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:24.340]   earbud failing to connect after case removal.
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:27.860]   Dude, they should just kill them.
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:29.700]   Oh, and that should have been that the box, right?
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:31.740]   Yeah, out of the box, yeah.
[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:35.660]   I love the design, but boy did it suck.
[01:44:35.660 --> 01:44:36.660]   That's two in a row.
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:39.460]   That's two strikes for Google on those Pixel Buds.
[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:41.340]   I gotta tell you.
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:46.220]   And that is the Google Change.
[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:48.460]   You know what comes after the Google Change log?
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:52.060]   Our picks and tips and our numbers.
[01:44:52.060 --> 01:44:54.860]   And then after that comes snacks.
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:57.460]   No snacks till we get your pick of the week.
[01:44:57.460 --> 01:44:58.460]   Okay.
[01:44:58.460 --> 01:44:59.460]   In fact, let's start with our...
[01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:00.460]   What is a snack?
[01:45:00.460 --> 01:45:02.460]   You're picking the week where a snack.
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:03.460]   That could be.
[01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:04.460]   You could eat it.
[01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:05.460]   It could be.
[01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:06.460]   It could be.
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:07.460]   We could keep going another hour on the show then.
[01:45:07.460 --> 01:45:08.460]   Then you'd be happy.
[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:09.980]   What is your favorite Super Bowl snacks?
[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:10.980]   Stacey Higginbotham.
[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:17.300]   Oh, I don't watch the Super Bowl.
[01:45:17.300 --> 01:45:18.300]   I'm sorry.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:19.300]   Guacamole.
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:20.300]   I like guacamole.
[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:21.300]   I like guacamole.
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:22.300]   Peas.
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:23.860]   Who puts peas in guacamole?
[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:26.180]   The New York Times put peas in their guacamole.
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:27.180]   What?
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:29.180]   That's not a guacamole ingredient.
[01:45:29.180 --> 01:45:31.540]   That was controversy from like three years ago.
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:32.700]   I'm looking for a thing.
[01:45:32.700 --> 01:45:33.700]   That was...
[01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:34.700]   What are you doing?
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:35.700]   I'm the tinsuit of the guacamole.
[01:45:35.700 --> 01:45:36.700]   What are you doing?
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:37.700]   She's looking for a thing.
[01:45:37.700 --> 01:45:39.540]   I'm looking for a pick of apples.
[01:45:39.540 --> 01:45:40.540]   And I...
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:41.540]   Here's where Stacey looks for her thing.
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:43.340]   She can't find the thing.
[01:45:43.340 --> 01:45:44.340]   She's lost her thing.
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:45.340]   You know, the thing.
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:46.340]   Ding, ding, ding, ding.
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:47.340]   Where's the thing?
[01:45:47.340 --> 01:45:48.340]   We need to be super-imposed.
[01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:49.340]   That's kind of fun.
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:50.340]   That's kind of fun.
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:53.500]   Here's where Stacey looks for her thing.
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:56.620]   She's looking everywhere to find that thing.
[01:45:56.620 --> 01:45:58.100]   She's got her thing.
[01:45:58.100 --> 01:45:59.100]   It was up there.
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:00.100]   All the time.
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:01.100]   What is it?
[01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:02.100]   It's a white thing.
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:04.100]   Oh, it's blinking.
[01:46:04.100 --> 01:46:08.020]   It's a motion detector from Shelley.
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:13.820]   This is a Wi-Fi motion detector that went on sale starting today for $39.95.
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:16.340]   Mine is doing like the disco dance right now.
[01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:19.700]   So it's a text motion, but then what happens?
[01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:24.500]   Then it can alert you on an app or it will alert you via voice.
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:27.020]   And there is a Shelley Cloud effect.
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:29.220]   Madam A or Google, I believe.
[01:46:29.220 --> 01:46:30.820]   I sense motion.
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:33.060]   Oh, a one-year battery life.
[01:46:33.060 --> 01:46:34.060]   That's neat.
[01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:35.660]   Well, here's what's neat about it.
[01:46:35.660 --> 01:46:37.660]   It's rechargeable.
[01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:41.380]   So right here is the...
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:42.380]   It is a...
[01:46:42.380 --> 01:46:43.780]   Well, I don't know if it's a one-year battery life.
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:44.780]   Type C.
[01:46:44.780 --> 01:46:45.780]   Type C.
[01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:46.780]   I like that.
[01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:47.780]   Yeah.
[01:46:47.780 --> 01:46:48.780]   It's a mini USB.
[01:46:48.780 --> 01:46:49.780]   No, it's a mini USB.
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:50.780]   Micro...
[01:46:50.780 --> 01:46:51.780]   No, why is it micro USB?
[01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:52.780]   Why?
[01:46:52.780 --> 01:46:53.780]   Shelley, why?
[01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:54.780]   We all have a good jillion of them.
[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:55.780]   Yeah.
[01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:57.540]   Two little dots.
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:00.700]   One of them is the reset button, but you have to use a...
[01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:01.700]   Paperclip.
[01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:02.700]   A pinned.
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:06.420]   A paperclip to get in there to press it, which is kind of sucky.
[01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:11.380]   So could I use if this is that or something else to do something when it senses motion?
[01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:13.660]   Shelley, does Shelley work with IFT?
[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:15.860]   It works with Madam A and Google.
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:16.860]   Okay.
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:17.860]   Shelley...
[01:47:17.860 --> 01:47:21.240]   So what I'd like is when I come into the room that it would play my theme song.
[01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:22.240]   Could it do that?
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:24.420]   A hold of the chief, eh?
[01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:30.060]   Tada, tada, tada, tada, tada.
[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:31.060]   I'm trying to...
[01:47:31.060 --> 01:47:32.780]   I don't know if they have it with IFT.
[01:47:32.780 --> 01:47:35.900]   So this is the thing that comes with every burger or...
[01:47:35.900 --> 01:47:37.560]   Oh, but you can use MQTT.
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.340]   So if you just want to get super nerdy.
[01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:40.340]   What's MQTT?
[01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:45.780]   Oh, you can pull that into something like Node-RED and then you could have it like a...
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:51.660]   So MQTT is a communications protocol for IoT devices.
[01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:54.940]   And so you could use that into...
[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:59.900]   If you want to do something like Node-RED, if you've ever used that, it's a GUI.
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:04.220]   So I could put something on a Raspberry Pi that would get a message from this thing that
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:05.220]   would then do something.
[01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:06.220]   Basically, yes.
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:08.100]   Turn the temperature up when I come in the house.
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:09.100]   Things like that.
[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:10.100]   But I'm trying...
[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:11.100]   I feel like Shelley...
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:13.180]   I thought it's supported IFT, but I can't find that way.
[01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:15.580]   It's nice and it's how much?
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:19.020]   It's $39.95, which is not bad for a Wi-Fi sensor.
[01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:25.340]   No, and I have, of course, my home, my SimpliSafe system has motion detection.
[01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:29.500]   And it even has a light I can tell that it sends to me coming down the hall.
[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:35.740]   So I have actually two of them, two different hallways, but that doesn't connect anything
[01:48:35.740 --> 01:48:36.740]   else.
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:37.740]   It's just the alarm system.
[01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:39.740]   You can connect it to IFT.
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:40.740]   Yay.
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:41.740]   So...
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:45.580]   So, Ian will give you motion detected, motion detected in the dark, motion detected in twilight,
[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:46.580]   motion detected in bright.
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:47.580]   Oh.
[01:48:47.580 --> 01:48:49.220]   So, motion detected.
[01:48:49.220 --> 01:48:51.180]   It also has a tamper alarm, which is nice.
[01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:53.660]   And then end of tamper alarm.
[01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:54.660]   This is good.
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:55.900]   So, I'm using it.
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:49:02.580]   I'm setting it up normally to sit by my dog door, because I'm actually curious if my...
[01:49:02.580 --> 01:49:05.580]   I don't think my dog ever goes outside to pee.
[01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:07.140]   It's very upsetting to me.
[01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:08.140]   Yeah, where does it appear?
[01:49:08.140 --> 01:49:09.140]   I'm gonna track this.
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:11.140]   Well, because the poor dog knows what she wants to do.
[01:49:11.140 --> 01:49:12.140]   I don't know.
[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:13.140]   I just don't know what she does.
[01:49:13.140 --> 01:49:14.140]   But you're not.
[01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:15.140]   No, she...
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:16.140]   I'm not watching her pee.
[01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:19.660]   I'm just watching her leave the house, but she doesn't leave the house very often.
[01:49:19.660 --> 01:49:21.660]   She knows you know that she knows what she's doing.
[01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:23.060]   No, she knows what's on the privacy.
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:26.260]   You think you want a lot of them to stand up for privacy for a nice dog.
[01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:27.820]   So, this is interesting.
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:29.820]   This really looks like...
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:30.820]   Oh, the poor!
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:31.820]   Hello, drinking.
[01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:34.420]   We're talking about my dog, and I was looking for it.
[01:49:34.420 --> 01:49:36.380]   She like popped up right behind me.
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:37.380]   Oh.
[01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:43.380]   Do you think there'll be a whole lot of companies making just individual devices like this?
[01:49:43.380 --> 01:49:44.940]   I mean, this is kind of cool.
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:45.940]   This...
[01:49:45.940 --> 01:49:46.940]   So, he has a whole cloud.
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:47.940]   Oh, here's your...
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:52.460]   Is there a subscription for this, or is it just...
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:53.820]   What buy it once in a while?
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:54.820]   No, you buy...
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:56.580]   So, the cloud thing runs on your...
[01:49:56.580 --> 01:50:00.540]   Sorry, the Shelley cloud runs on the cloud, and then it runs on your phone.
[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:02.180]   It's actually a pretty big app.
[01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:05.860]   So, there is local control there.
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:09.260]   And it's a company called Altrico Robotics, which you may have known because they used
[01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:15.940]   to build apps for carrier stores, and then they got into smart home a couple of years
[01:50:15.940 --> 01:50:16.940]   ago.
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:18.100]   They also make...
[01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:19.100]   I can show you...
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:21.100]   I have to put the dog back down.
[01:50:21.100 --> 01:50:22.100]   Oh, don't.
[01:50:22.100 --> 01:50:24.700]   Oh, this is cool.
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:30.180]   So you can have scheduling so that if you go in the kitchen late at night, it doesn't
[01:50:30.180 --> 01:50:31.660]   turn on the lights.
[01:50:31.660 --> 01:50:35.020]   Yes, it is actually a very good home automation platform.
[01:50:35.020 --> 01:50:36.020]   Nice.
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:38.180]   So, this is a Shelley 1PM.
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:46.660]   This is a module that you would install behind your light switch.
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:49.300]   So, these...
[01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:55.100]   So you have to use their app, but is there a subscription fee involved?
[01:50:55.100 --> 01:50:56.100]   No.
[01:50:56.100 --> 01:50:57.100]   Okay.
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:58.860]   Unless you want to connect it to IFTT.
[01:50:58.860 --> 01:50:59.860]   That's a nice looking app.
[01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:01.340]   And it doesn't need an app.
[01:51:01.340 --> 01:51:04.180]   I mean, a hub, I should say.
[01:51:04.180 --> 01:51:06.020]   The phone is the hub, basically.
[01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:07.580]   The phone is the hub.
[01:51:07.580 --> 01:51:12.060]   And then you have a cloud if you would like.
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:13.060]   So if I...
[01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:16.940]   Obviously, I don't want my phone to be the only hub because then it would only work
[01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:19.460]   when I'm home.
[01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:21.140]   Or maybe that's one thing you would want.
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:25.100]   But if you wanted to work when you were at home, you'd have to tie it to the cloud.
[01:51:25.100 --> 01:51:27.060]   Is there a subscription fee for that?
[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:28.060]   No.
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:29.060]   No, well, that's good.
[01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:30.060]   All right.
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:32.940]   And you could build your own hub with a pie if you want to.
[01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:36.620]   Or do a thing with the MQTT and the Raspberry Pi.
[01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:39.380]   Do a thing.
[01:51:39.380 --> 01:51:44.620]   My tip of the week is how to stop Reddit's annoying app download prompt.
[01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:45.620]   You found it.
[01:51:45.620 --> 01:51:47.740]   Or did somebody in the chat call for you?
[01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:48.740]   No, I found it.
[01:51:48.740 --> 01:51:51.180]   This is from the next web.
[01:51:51.180 --> 01:51:52.260]   Let's see how old this is.
[01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:56.100]   That's a couple years old.
[01:51:56.100 --> 01:52:01.940]   If so, first press the hamburger menu in the top right of your screen.
[01:52:01.940 --> 01:52:06.980]   And tap, tap, ask to open an app so it says off.
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:08.980]   So this is on the website.
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:15.780]   This is actually a setting on Reddit that says don't ask to open an app.
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:16.780]   That's it.
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:17.780]   That's so easy.
[01:52:17.780 --> 01:52:18.780]   Wow.
[01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:19.780]   Let me try it.
[01:52:19.780 --> 01:52:20.780]   Wow.
[01:52:20.780 --> 01:52:22.580]   Because that's one of the big annoyances.
[01:52:22.580 --> 01:52:28.180]   Oh, man, I shouldn't open my phone.
[01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:30.020]   Larry Flint has died.
[01:52:30.020 --> 01:52:31.820]   Oh, no.
[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:34.260]   No, nobody cares about that.
[01:52:34.260 --> 01:52:40.060]   But all right, let me see if I go to the Reddit, but I got to go to the Reddit website.
[01:52:40.060 --> 01:52:41.580]   I won't do it right now.
[01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:43.900]   But look in these settings.
[01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:49.500]   And there is a ask to open an app and you can turn that off.
[01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:50.500]   There you go, Stacey.
[01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:55.740]   You asked and you shall receive your number of the week, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:52:55.740 --> 01:52:57.940]   Oh, oh, oh, right.
[01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:59.420]   Oh, oh.
[01:52:59.420 --> 01:53:03.460]   Well, TikTok released its trend report.
[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:05.500]   TikTok trend report.
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.500]   TikTok trend.
[01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:15.220]   And so we find out that the number six top growth content category is livestock and poultry.
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:18.420]   I have no idea why.
[01:53:18.420 --> 01:53:21.340]   The chicken dance, of course.
[01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:22.980]   Perhaps.
[01:53:22.980 --> 01:53:26.780]   Then they have a country by country rundown of things.
[01:53:26.780 --> 01:53:30.980]   And there's something I'm going to beg you not to play because it really sends me crazy.
[01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:35.540]   But Korea, the top trending thing is something where people eat as much as they can and as
[01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:38.140]   loudly as they can while interacting with the audience.
[01:53:38.140 --> 01:53:39.140]   Oh, that's disgusting.
[01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:40.140]   Oh, yeah, please don't.
[01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:43.060]   Oh, no, Mukbang, we've talked about before.
[01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:45.180]   We've talked about Mukbang before.
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:47.380]   Yeah, we even showed Mukbang.
[01:53:47.380 --> 01:53:52.500]   So it used to be Mukbang content on YouTube was just you gave people a lot of food and
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:58.060]   they ate it like voraciously on camera and it was a big thing.
[01:53:58.060 --> 01:54:01.300]   It's the biggest thing in TikTok in Korea.
[01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:05.380]   Yeah, it was a big thing on YouTube for a while too.
[01:54:05.380 --> 01:54:06.540]   Oh, well, okay.
[01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:07.940]   So United States, what's the appeal?
[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:09.420]   And we talked about it on this show.
[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:10.420]   Really?
[01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:11.420]   I don't remember that.
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:14.420]   What's the appeal of Mukbang?
[01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:19.900]   People eating delicious food or or grossing people out.
[01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:21.700]   I think it's probably a bit of both.
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:24.900]   Is it like the Nathan's hot dog eating competition?
[01:54:24.900 --> 01:54:25.900]   Is that considered the same thing?
[01:54:25.900 --> 01:54:26.900]   Yes, I think so.
[01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:27.900]   I think it's of the same.
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:36.500]   Well, no, Mukbang is where like you just make a lot of food and you.
[01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:37.500]   So weird.
[01:54:37.500 --> 01:54:38.500]   The internet is so weird.
[01:54:38.500 --> 01:54:39.500]   I just don't understand.
[01:54:39.500 --> 01:54:41.500]   It was not the internet.
[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:47.460]   The US home and garden and rail renovation is up 156% trying to change the subject really
[01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:48.460]   quickly.
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:49.460]   So nobody plays any of this crap.
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:56.460]   Because I was about to.
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:58.580]   No, don't.
[01:54:58.580 --> 01:55:01.180]   So it's eating a lot of food as fast as possible.
[01:55:01.180 --> 01:55:03.460]   Yeah, let's turn off the sound.
[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:04.460]   That's disgusting.
[01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:05.460]   I think it's disgusting.
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:08.460]   I don't know if it has to be as fast as possible.
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:12.660]   Well, that's a lot of food.
[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:14.460]   This is riveting TV.
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:16.700]   Well, you only get a minute, right?
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:19.300]   So she has to eat an entire meal in a minute.
[01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:22.940]   Oh, see, that must be like a TikTok.
[01:55:22.940 --> 01:55:23.940]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:24.940]   I guess that's a TikTok.
[01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:28.100]   You know, YouTube, you have many minutes, but huh.
[01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:30.500]   Oh, that's disgusting.
[01:55:30.500 --> 01:55:31.500]   Okay.
[01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:32.500]   All right, so that was that.
[01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:34.500]   I've got no number of mugs.
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:35.500]   Mukbang.
[01:55:35.500 --> 01:55:37.500]   Which is the china.
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:45.100]   You can't say, oh, whatever you do, don't show it and you know that I'm going to show
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:46.100]   it.
[01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:47.100]   But there's a good time.
[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:52.140]   No, for this, for you doing this, I get a gift.
[01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:54.100]   I get you to play.
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:57.580]   I gave you a gift.
[01:55:57.580 --> 01:56:01.100]   I had 12 Facebook stories, which I did not do.
[01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:04.220]   That was a gift to me.
[01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:05.220]   The voice.
[01:56:05.220 --> 01:56:06.220]   Thank you.
[01:56:06.220 --> 01:56:07.220]   Luke, the voice.
[01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:08.220]   The voice on TikTok.
[01:56:08.220 --> 01:56:09.220]   Mine before.
[01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:10.220]   Amazing.
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:11.860]   Yes, TikTok, stolen TikTok.
[01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:15.700]   This is the big phenomenal, I'm so jealous of his voice.
[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:18.300]   Is this the, oh, wait a minute, somebody's still eating.
[01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:21.820]   Oh, stop.
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:24.260]   Is this guy Luke Taylor, Luke the voice?
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:26.700]   Yeah, he's the he's the base.
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:28.860]   We have all heard the tremendous deep voice.
[01:56:28.860 --> 01:56:29.860]   Oh, wow.
[01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:30.860]   Nice branding.
[01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:35.780]   Some cool stuff with this microphone that toner Mike sent me.
[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:37.420]   So I could do it.
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:42.300]   Yeah, you know, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to funky town.
[01:56:42.300 --> 01:56:43.300]   Oh, right.
[01:56:43.300 --> 01:56:45.300]   You were going out, I put one in there.
[01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:47.180]   Oh, this is just bad.
[01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:48.180]   Vio.
[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:49.180]   No, it's not.
[01:56:49.180 --> 01:56:50.180]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:51.180]   you're not playing the one I want you to play.
[01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:52.180]   I put it in there.
[01:56:52.180 --> 01:56:56.580]   This is the problem with the damn spreadsheet is that it doesn't update.
[01:56:56.580 --> 01:57:04.500]   By the way, there is nothing new in the world because as you may remember, this.
[01:57:04.500 --> 01:57:05.500]   Oh, man.
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:12.660]   14 years ago was a big hit because here's a young guy.
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:17.180]   Some stay dry and others feel the pain.
[01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:19.180]   I'm a baby.
[01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:21.020]   Where is he now?
[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:22.020]   Tays on day.
[01:57:22.020 --> 01:57:25.020]   I keep seeing him every once in a while.
[01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:27.020]   The school.
[01:57:27.020 --> 01:57:29.020]   It can be here again.
[01:57:29.020 --> 01:57:30.020]   Chocolate rain.
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:32.020]   The prisons make you wonder where it went.
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:33.020]   Chocolate.
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:34.020]   Okay.
[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:38.500]   And speaking of chocolate rain, apparently Stacey's got brownies.
[01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:45.380]   Oh, did your daughter make those or did your husband make those?
[01:57:45.380 --> 01:57:46.980]   Yeah, she just says she just.
[01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:47.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:57:47.980 --> 01:57:49.540]   I won't make you try to speak.
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:50.540]   All right.
[01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:51.540]   I'm going to find the link.
[01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:53.140]   I'm going to find the link.
[01:57:53.140 --> 01:57:54.140]   Where is it?
[01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:55.140]   What line is it?
[01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:58.940]   I think I got the right of this line.
[01:57:58.940 --> 01:57:59.940]   84.
[01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:02.780]   I don't know how I missed line 84.
[01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:05.460]   Luke, the voice, the incredible tick-tock space.
[01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:06.460]   It's not a T-Shanty.
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:07.460]   I don't know.
[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:09.060]   Well, this is the same thing.
[01:58:09.060 --> 01:58:10.060]   Where is it?
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:12.300]   That's what the spreadsheet does.
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:14.900]   So which one of these?
[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:15.900]   Hold on.
[01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:18.900]   Here's the one where he's a C-Shantying?
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:21.740]   I don't know.
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:26.740]   The queen from her bed.
[01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:30.740]   And found her in her bow.
[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:35.140]   The fact that he can do that on an iPhone microphone is what's the reason.
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:42.140]   That's why he didn't get the right.
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:45.300]   I love that voice.
[01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:46.700]   How's it going?
[01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:47.700]   That's pretty good.
[01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:49.700]   And that good?
[01:58:49.700 --> 01:58:50.700]   Yeah.
[01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:51.700]   He's amazing.
[01:58:51.700 --> 01:58:52.700]   Luke, the voice.
[01:58:52.700 --> 01:58:53.700]   Here's another one.
[01:58:53.700 --> 01:58:54.700]   So it's a new year and it's time to recognize our favorite tick-tock.
[01:58:54.700 --> 01:58:55.700]   This one's weird.
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:56.700]   Don't do that one.
[01:58:56.700 --> 01:58:57.700]   Okay.
[01:58:57.700 --> 01:58:58.700]   He doesn't really sing.
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:58:59.700]   So cowboy hat?
[01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:03.100]   I was trying to find the one that...
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:04.300]   Is it the real thing?
[01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:05.300]   Is it the fantasy?
[01:59:05.300 --> 01:59:06.300]   He was singing that.
[01:59:06.300 --> 01:59:07.300]   Oh, the queen.
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:08.300]   Yeah.
[01:59:08.300 --> 01:59:09.300]   Bohemian Rasset.
[01:59:09.300 --> 01:59:10.300]   You went queen.
[01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:11.300]   Yeah, queen.
[01:59:11.300 --> 01:59:12.300]   Is this it?
[01:59:12.300 --> 01:59:13.300]   Okay.
[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:17.780]   So me and my friend Mateo, we're just sitting in this part.
[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:18.780]   Okay.
[01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:19.780]   Me and my friend.
[01:59:19.780 --> 01:59:21.380]   Me and my friend Mateo.
[01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:23.180]   We were sitting there.
[01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:24.180]   Okay.
[01:59:24.180 --> 01:59:26.220]   Here's a baseline.
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:28.020]   All right.
[01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:29.580]   Anyway, I get the idea.
[01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:32.620]   Everybody should go follow whatever this guy's name is.
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:34.260]   Damn you, Google.
[01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:37.020]   The Google sheets.
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:41.860]   So some stuff in my opinion is great on tick-tock.
[01:59:41.860 --> 01:59:43.660]   Some less so.
[01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:47.700]   They said that about Twitter too.
[01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:48.700]   Ant?
[01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:49.700]   Yeah, you can.
[01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:50.700]   Ant, what's your pick of the week?
[01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:51.700]   Yes.
[01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:53.860]   Yeah, we work with ants.
[01:59:53.860 --> 01:59:57.060]   My original pick was one about the...
[01:59:57.060 --> 01:59:58.220]   I'm not a cat.
[01:59:58.220 --> 01:59:59.220]   Well, you know what?
[01:59:59.220 --> 02:00:00.700]   That's why I didn't steal it.
[02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:01.700]   We should do it.
[02:00:01.700 --> 02:00:02.700]   We should do it.
[02:00:02.700 --> 02:00:03.700]   I love it.
[02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:05.900]   We should do it so hard at that one I saw.
[02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:06.900]   Yeah, we should do it.
[02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:07.900]   It's great.
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:09.940]   I played it for my wife this morning.
[02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:11.100]   We enjoyed it.
[02:00:11.100 --> 02:00:13.300]   I hadn't laughed at anything like that in a long time.
[02:00:13.300 --> 02:00:15.220]   So I'll play the video basically.
[02:00:15.220 --> 02:00:22.020]   And by the way, this guy, this county attorney in Presidio County, Texas, is a checker cast.
[02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:23.900]   He's kind of a loser.
[02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:24.900]   Rod Pontin.
[02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:26.700]   I added that in.
[02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:33.660]   Apparently, he was on a Zoom call with the court on what was, they say, a routine.
[02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:41.340]   A financial hearing in Texas' judicial court.
[02:00:41.340 --> 02:00:44.180]   But he had trouble with his Zoom.
[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:45.700]   I'll let you watch.
[02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:53.740]   Mr. Pontin, I believe you have a filter turned on in the video settings.
[02:00:53.740 --> 02:00:55.740]   You might want to...
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:00:57.740]   We're trying to...
[02:00:57.740 --> 02:00:59.740]   Can you hear me, Judge?
[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:00.740]   I can hear you.
[02:01:00.740 --> 02:01:01.740]   I think it's a filter.
[02:01:01.740 --> 02:01:02.740]   It is.
[02:01:02.740 --> 02:01:05.220]   I don't know how to remove it.
[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:06.620]   I've got my assistant here.
[02:01:06.620 --> 02:01:08.620]   She's trying to.
[02:01:08.620 --> 02:01:12.980]   But I'm hard to go forward with it.
[02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:13.980]   I'm here live.
[02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:16.900]   I'm not a cast.
[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:18.860]   Was free.
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:20.860]   Was free.
[02:01:20.860 --> 02:01:24.700]   Watch Jerry Phillips the whole time.
[02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:25.700]   Yeah.
[02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:26.700]   The attorney in the...
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:28.860]   Well, I don't understand.
[02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:30.260]   One guy seems like he's sleeping.
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:31.260]   Is he sleeping?
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:32.260]   Jerry Phillips?
[02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:33.260]   I don't know.
[02:01:33.260 --> 02:01:35.100]   Jerry's trying his best not to prejudice.
[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:40.020]   But then the other guy puts on his glasses and says, "I can't believe what I'm seeing."
[02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:41.020]   He's a restrictive...
[02:01:41.020 --> 02:01:42.860]   That's the judge.
[02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:44.020]   That's the judge, Judge Bauer.
[02:01:44.020 --> 02:01:45.020]   He's trying to...
[02:01:45.020 --> 02:01:46.020]   He's saying, "What the hell?"
[02:01:46.020 --> 02:01:47.020]   Oh, man.
[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:48.020]   That's a filter.
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:54.100]   Well, the filter is so great because the cat's eyes and this guy's voice all comes together.
[02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:55.100]   Oh, boy.
[02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:56.900]   I'm prepared to follow him.
[02:01:56.900 --> 02:01:58.900]   That's so hard to take.
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:01:59.900]   I'm here live.
[02:01:59.900 --> 02:02:00.900]   That's not...
[02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:02.900]   I'm not a cat.
[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:03.900]   Oh, my God.
[02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:11.820]   I was thinking we should do a show.
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:15.820]   We should do a show one week where all of us just use filters, the whole show.
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:16.820]   Oh, God.
[02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:17.820]   I would not wear well.
[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:18.820]   Oh.
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:19.820]   I would not wear well.
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:20.820]   That's funny.
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:21.820]   That's funny.
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:22.820]   Oh.
[02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:23.820]   Yeah.
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:24.820]   I saw it.
[02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:25.820]   What would you be in?
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:26.820]   I needed that laugh.
[02:02:26.820 --> 02:02:31.460]   Apparently, he was using his secretary's computer during the incident.
[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:34.460]   He told the New York Times he was mortified.
[02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:37.380]   He sure looked like it.
[02:02:37.380 --> 02:02:39.580]   We've all been there.
[02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:41.580]   We've all been there.
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:44.300]   Oh, man.
[02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:50.380]   My other pick is a shout out to Ms. Erica Joy Baker.
[02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:56.060]   I met her many, many, many years ago over Google+ and then was able to meet her in person.
[02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:58.060]   Oh, I knew that's why I know the name.
[02:02:58.060 --> 02:02:59.500]   I remember here from Google+.
[02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:00.500]   Yeah.
[02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:01.740]   She used to work at Google.
[02:03:01.740 --> 02:03:02.740]   That's right.
[02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:09.820]   She was part of all of that madness with the wages, being all out of whack for people.
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:10.820]   Yeah.
[02:03:10.820 --> 02:03:15.140]   She's just been on an upward trajectory ever since and I'm so happy for her.
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:17.820]   She was recently on Jeopardy.
[02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:19.180]   Reading one of the categories.
[02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:23.900]   I love it that the Jeopardy folks thought it would be good to have her read the engineering
[02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:24.900]   kit questions.
[02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:30.420]   By the way, it's an awareness for females in STEM.
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:32.420]   Ken Jennings hosting Jeopardy.
[02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:33.420]   Yeah.
[02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:34.420]   Engineering for 400.
[02:03:34.420 --> 02:03:36.140]   Here's Erica Joy Baker.
[02:03:36.140 --> 02:03:41.340]   Early street lights turned into his and Flickr until the problem was solved by Hertha Marks-Ayrton,
[02:03:41.340 --> 02:03:45.700]   a pioneer in this branch of engineering, abbreviated EE.
[02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:46.700]   Electrical engineering.
[02:03:46.700 --> 02:03:47.700]   Electrical engineering.
[02:03:47.700 --> 02:03:48.700]   That's right.
[02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:49.900]   Well, I think that's neat.
[02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:53.700]   Erica Joy Baker got to be on Jeopardy.
[02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:56.300]   If you're going to be on Jeopardy, that's the way you want to be.
[02:03:56.300 --> 02:03:57.820]   I would love to host Jeopardy.
[02:03:57.820 --> 02:03:58.820]   Would you like to host Jeopardy?
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:01.900]   I feel it's time for a female host of Jeopardy.
[02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:02.900]   I agree.
[02:04:02.900 --> 02:04:03.900]   Who loves it, trivia?
[02:04:03.900 --> 02:04:07.140]   You'd be great at it.
[02:04:07.140 --> 02:04:10.620]   And they could bring you brownies in between rounds.
[02:04:10.620 --> 02:04:11.620]   Yes.
[02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:16.020]   Jeopardy recordings are very short, so I would not have to eat in the middle of them.
[02:04:16.020 --> 02:04:18.260]   Unlike other things you've mentioned.
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:20.380]   Unlike something else.
[02:04:20.380 --> 02:04:21.380]   It's not that long.
[02:04:21.380 --> 02:04:22.740]   We're wrapping it up right now.
[02:04:22.740 --> 02:04:23.740]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:04:23.740 --> 02:04:25.060]   Go enjoy your brownies.
[02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:28.260]   I love your gloves you're wearing.
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:31.100]   Oh, it's so cold.
[02:04:31.100 --> 02:04:32.100]   I'm having a scrivener.
[02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:33.100]   I'm having a scrivener.
[02:04:33.100 --> 02:04:34.100]   I'm having a scrivener.
[02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:36.580]   She's Bartleby the scrivener of our show.
[02:04:36.580 --> 02:04:40.580]   She will be back with fiber next week.
[02:04:40.580 --> 02:04:42.060]   Not all brand fiber.
[02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:43.060]   You had a new suit?
[02:04:43.060 --> 02:04:44.060]   She'll be back.
[02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:45.060]   I would.
[02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:48.100]   Oh, I had the same thought, Ann.
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:49.100]   I'm sorry.
[02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:50.100]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:55.380]   Stacy on IOTs are website, Stacy on IOT.com.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:04:57.020]   Her newsletter is there.
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:04:58.020]   Events are there.
[02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:02.060]   And of course her podcast with Kevin Tofol, the IOT podcast.
[02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:04.260]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:08.460]   Katie Couric apparently is going to be hosting Jeopardy next.
[02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:09.780]   So there will be a woman.
[02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:11.580]   Well, all right.
[02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:12.580]   All right.
[02:05:12.580 --> 02:05:14.380]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:05:14.380 --> 02:05:21.180]   Jeff, of course, is the Leonard Tau Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark
[02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:27.140]   Graduate School of Journalism at City University of New York and blogger buzz machine.com,
[02:05:27.140 --> 02:05:29.740]   the author of what would Google do?
[02:05:29.740 --> 02:05:35.860]   Gutenberg, the geek, geek sparing news and all of that stuff.
[02:05:35.860 --> 02:05:36.860]   Books.
[02:05:36.860 --> 02:05:37.860]   Books.
[02:05:37.860 --> 02:05:38.860]   Remember those?
[02:05:38.860 --> 02:05:39.860]   Dead trees.
[02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:43.820]   And a former TV guy, critic Frank Sinatra once called him a bum.
[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:49.780]   That pruit, the host of Hands on Photography, twit.tv/hop.
[02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:50.940]   Also a man about town.
[02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:52.940]   We appreciate everything you do for us.
[02:05:52.940 --> 02:05:54.700]   Anything you want to plug, aunt?
[02:05:54.700 --> 02:05:55.700]   You're very--
[02:05:55.700 --> 02:05:56.700]   Sure.
[02:05:56.700 --> 02:05:57.700]   You're very good at--
[02:05:57.700 --> 02:06:03.340]   Plug the show as usual and go check out my latest YouTube video because it alludes to
[02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:09.220]   next week's Hands on Tech, not today's Hands on Tech, but next week's Hands on Tech where
[02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:12.420]   I got to play around with some canon love.
[02:06:12.420 --> 02:06:14.420]   Oh, I'm so jealous.
[02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:18.180]   So jealous.
[02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:21.940]   Aunt Pruit is at YouTube.com/antpruit.
[02:06:21.940 --> 02:06:22.940]   That's a great open.
[02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:24.260]   I love that open, by the way.
[02:06:24.260 --> 02:06:25.700]   That's really awesome.
[02:06:25.700 --> 02:06:29.660]   So you got the cameras and you're going to show us what you could do with that slot.
[02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:31.420]   You've got to play around with that foot.
[02:06:31.420 --> 02:06:32.820]   Make it just pop.
[02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:33.820]   Yeah.
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:35.540]   Because it doesn't pop otherwise.
[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:37.820]   It's kind of bland otherwise.
[02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:39.420]   That's right.
[02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:40.420]   Thank you, Aunt.
[02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:41.420]   Thank you, Stacy.
[02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:42.420]   Thank you, sir.
[02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:44.140]   Have a wonderful day.
[02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:46.540]   We'll see you next Wednesday.
[02:06:46.540 --> 02:06:54.020]   We do this week in Google Wednesday afternoons, 2pm Pacific, 5pm Eastern, 2200 UTC.
[02:06:54.020 --> 02:06:58.020]   I only mention the live times because you can watch us live if you want.
[02:06:58.020 --> 02:07:03.300]   Our website, twit.tv/live has live audio and video streams.
[02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:07.020]   You can-- this is where we look at the YouTube stream right now, but you can pick the stream
[02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:08.020]   you like.
[02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:11.180]   Oh, I understand what you-- I couldn't figure it out last week.
[02:07:11.180 --> 02:07:12.180]   Nicely done, Jammerby.
[02:07:12.180 --> 02:07:15.340]   Yeah, you got a picture and picture over the actual stream.
[02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:19.220]   Because otherwise it would be delayed and then you'd see that mirror effect.
[02:07:19.220 --> 02:07:21.020]   Nicely done.
[02:07:21.020 --> 02:07:22.020]   Clever.
[02:07:22.020 --> 02:07:24.020]   That dude is awesome.
[02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:26.700]   Clever.
[02:07:26.700 --> 02:07:29.780]   You can also, of course, watch us on YouTube.
[02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:33.140]   We have a whole YouTube channel devoted to this week in Google.
[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:35.660]   You can download shows from our website.
[02:07:35.660 --> 02:07:39.260]   There's the chat room if you're watching live, by the way, RC.twit.tv.
[02:07:39.260 --> 02:07:47.460]   The website has all the shows from today and years gone by at twit.tv/twig.
[02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:50.660]   You can also subscribe and your favorite podcast client.
[02:07:50.660 --> 02:07:55.780]   In fact, I encourage you to do so that way you'll get it the minute it's available.
[02:07:55.780 --> 02:07:59.180]   That concludes this edition of this week in-- uh-oh.
[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:00.180]   Uh-oh.
[02:08:00.180 --> 02:08:01.180]   Uh-oh.
[02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:04.780]   I'm a picture and picture.
[02:08:04.780 --> 02:08:05.780]   That was good.
[02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:07.620]   Let's do that from now on.
[02:08:07.620 --> 02:08:11.300]   But when I'm living in Barbados, you can do that, okay?
[02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:12.300]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:17.540]   We'll see you next time on this week in Google.
[02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:19.180]   Bye-bye.
[02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:22.940]   If you like Android with a heavy dose of fun and entertainment, then you're gonna love
[02:08:22.940 --> 02:08:24.380]   all about Android.
[02:08:24.380 --> 02:08:28.860]   It's me, Jason Howell, along with my co-hosts Ron Richards and Florence Ion.
[02:08:28.860 --> 02:08:33.540]   Every Tuesday we discuss the news items that matter most, the hardware and devices that
[02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:36.700]   are running Android and the apps that run on top of them.
[02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:41.540]   Plus, we answer your email each and every week that's all about Android on twit.tv.
