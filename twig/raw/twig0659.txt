[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.760]   Hi, Stacy from the Pacific Northwest from
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.000]   Somewhere near the Trump golf course in Bedminster, New Jersey. It's Jeff Jarvis
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.480]   From buzz machine calm, but you may know know him better as the Leonard tau professor for journalistic innovation at the
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.640]   Craig
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.920]   Newmark graduate school of journalism at the City University of New York hello Jeff
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.400]   Hello, and to fill in for mr. Pruitt. We've got somebody who's actually I think his ears have been burning over the last week
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.640]   It's been the talk of the town a good friend Kevin Marks mr. Andy Webb is here from the UK
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.160]   There nice to see you all again just up the road from warmsby Hall in
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.080]   It's great to see you Kevin
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.560]   You you got the hill you got hacker news
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.880]   and then some for your blog post about
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.040]   Twitter's
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.040]   decision to edit
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.040]   tweets and in fact
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.600]   Your post it was Twitter at Twitter edits you and we talked about this now
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.300]   I think Twitter's changed their tune about what's going on so what's the latest on this?
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:36.360]   So well, do you need to explain what happened in the first place or yeah better because otherwise the fix won't make any sense
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.000]   Yeah, so what Twitter and for a long time Twitter's have this ability if he's been better tweeting in your web page
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.040]   Which you could do you could always do by cutting and pacing the text or by screen shotting but Twitter didn't want you to do that
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.480]   Yes, so well this was Ben wall came up with this in 2011 and it basically gave you a
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.960]   Little thing you click in the top right corner of the tweet that says embed tweet
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.840]   And then it would give you a block of h2 mod to put in your page
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.640]   Which was a block quote with with a tweet in it a link to the tweet
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.040]   and then as a link to some scripts that would take that and flesh it out into
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.880]   Oh
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.300]   And he's frozen we'll never know here's the block here's the block quote
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:27.360]   With the block quote would have the text of the tweet in it. Yes, if you've got the text of the tweet in it right here
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.800]   We're working on it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I couldn't Twitter says a little bit confusing because Twitter and Twitter, right?
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.040]   Yeah, but you'd also get the link the a tref
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.080]   But but most importantly you'd get this little bit of JavaScript
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.160]   Yes, so it's going to ask a double question. Yes. Yeah, it's a double question before you go on
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.400]   So that's when you embed
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.840]   Which you know if I'm doing my my WordPress blog in the old days with code
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.320]   I would embed the code there now with medium and WordPress you just put in the address
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.440]   Does that call on the embed code or is that a bed differently?
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.880]   Yes, now that basically what the what they do is effectively do the same thing. So what they do is they think they they actually cool the
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.820]   The o embed API that's what it provides which will give you that block of got it
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.980]   H2M to put in your page is basically a shortcut to this
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.160]   Yeah, yeah, I mean it's best. It's the same
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.960]   We're going to say the same problem. Yeah, Kevin is about to describe and Twitter wants you to do this because
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.080]   For what they see you get the traffic they control the content of the tweet and the functionality of the box is there too?
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.400]   You can click on yes, unless you retweet it and reply and copy and do stuff
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.440]   Also, the other thing is this sort of it's a it's a neutral benefit thing because the other thing it
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.020]   Them sort of fleshing out the tweet into a real looking tweet is them saying yes
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.880]   This is an actual tweet that somebody posted Kevin didn't just make it up put it in the page
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.360]   Which is you know fairly straightforward. You know if you were just doing screen. It's it's verifiable. Yeah
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.120]   Yeah, so then they're saying yes
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.920]   This was posted at the time by this person and if they got a tick mark
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.840]   It's that it is the person we verify so they're putting a certain amount of validation
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.640]   Onto the tweet that you're quoting when you do this now the problem was what happens when you delete the tweet when the tweet is deleted by the
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:17.560]   By the poster or Twitter suspends their account or they go private or Twitter goes down or whatever
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.160]   so what happens if there isn't
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:26.320]   If Twitter can't verify it just falls back to the HTML and it shows you
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:33.160]   Effectively the plain text of the tweak block the block quote there would appear with the account the link to the date
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.280]   But it will be styled whoever that HTML to style on your side
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.760]   Which is up to you. This is this is what it looks like and it's
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.080]   It's still a trip to the date. Yeah
[00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.800]   Yeah, and it's you know, it's getting a yellow box because that's why I do block quotes
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.680]   You know so that yellow is provided by you not by Twitter. Yeah, yeah, so this
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.480]   I could style that I to look more tweet live if I wanted to right that's it
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.040]   That's an CSS thing, but the bit the a ship I keep it fairly plain on my side
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.120]   So what would happen was?
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:13.760]   That would be the full-back case, but recently they changed it so that if you if the tweet was deleted you'd get a
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.000]   Big white box
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.040]   Instead like kind of like this
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:28.360]   Which has the Twitter logo has a button to go to Twitter, but has no it has a bunch of great stuff to say
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.960]   There was something here
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.240]   Which is not in the opposite. I'm not quite sure what message that's supposed to send. I mean the
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.640]   Here
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.480]   It's like but you know you're
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.680]   You're saying that there isn't a tweet there, but you're not actually saying what I've quoted
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.840]   So you what it basically does is it's rewriting the text of my post
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.480]   And if you write a long post where you create a bunch of tweets to make a make a case
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.480]   They will disappear and the text that you've pasted in has gone and you just get white blobs
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:05.160]   I have to I have to point out I was looking for an Instagram post when you post embed an Instagram post on the web
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.640]   But you have the image this is what you get now you get a
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:16.400]   Big old piece of your page gone where the image would go and a simple link that says view this post on Instagram
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.320]   and
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.480]   this is Instagram's kind of hostile. Thank you meta way of
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.720]   Taking away that ability to embed a an image from Instagram that happens
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.040]   If you want to view it you actually have to log in sometimes to your actual Instagram account. Yes
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.760]   Really hostile
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.920]   I haven't seen that one because I've basically haven't embedded in strands like that, but yeah, that's it's a similar thing
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:45.000]   It's them saying oh no, this is I now under our control. Yeah, and you know the response from Twitter was that
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.440]   We're doing this to better respect with people of chairs and delete their tweets and it'll have better messaging soon
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:56.600]   According to the mpm who was involved with it who hasn't tweeted since so I hope she's still okay
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.600]   I'm
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.680]   Geez, maybe she's just worried. He'll I'm gonna get wind of her. She's hiding
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   But the but the challenges the thing that gets tricky is when you've got if you're running a long article where you're quoting some tweets and talking
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.640]   About them and going back and forth it really messes that up. I'm sorry
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.360]   I had an example of an old blog post I wrote about it, but also if you go and look at
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:23.400]   new stories about the former president whose tweets are all now invisible or
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.760]   If you go to like BuzzFeed, which regularly quotes help you disappear
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:34.720]   You what you find is basically Twitter is leading white holes all over the web or what yeah
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:41.760]   And that's a real important if you're doing a news story about the president former president's tweets and
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.400]   Just as you point out calling James Comey a slime ball and the tweets are gone
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:51.320]   Because he's been deleted or or you go and like you want to write a book or like
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:58.600]   I mean Twitter is a is it a first source Jeff you might know this but like if you're actually like sourcing things officially for academic or
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.080]   Right it could be a primary source if it's yeah a primary
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.920]   Footnotes with
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.080]   With tweets of them. I have in fact. I added Jackson because it was part of the book. I'm working on yeah
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.160]   Yeah, but also they I mean they made a big fuss about
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.560]   I'll call it the Library of Congress and things, you know, that's right
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:24.400]   We were talking about that when we were talking about your article we said but doesn't the Library of Congress which has the firehose
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   Don't they have it all?
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   And what should they still do so?
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:34.040]   That's the challenges you then you're gonna find somewhere else to our and there are sites that archive the will archive things for you
[00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.040]   There's archive dot pH and archive org
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.040]   Both you know archive or call crawl things
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.600]   Optimistically, you can also say please archive this and archive dot pH was explicitly designed for you to
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.160]   Preserve a tweet in case it was deleted so you can link to that copy
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.440]   So there are sites that will do that but you have to sort of proactively do that at the point you're
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.760]   I'm about to put it in your site rather than just going to the Twitter to do it because because Twitter is
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.120]   Well, it really says users can delete their tweets, which is basically fair enough the Twitter can also delete your account on you
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.720]   And then then they tweet disappear
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.600]   But also even if you take your account private then the then these tweets then the tweets will no longer appear as embedded
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:18.000]   But this was our debate last week, which is an interesting debate is what is Twitter's responsibility is Twitter is Twitter a primary source?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.440]   Is it a social media of record or is it like just you know in a femoral spot where things come and go and
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:31.480]   And it's changed because it was originally a lot more ephemeral because
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.920]   They came in as text messages
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.920]   the the archive
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:41.040]   On the site didn't show many of them and the search wasn't very good and then it got better at that and so now they are
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.120]   Now people will go back and find your tweets from 15 years ago and say what need you were
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.040]   There's an author of a tweet
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.200]   Don't you feel like you have you should have the control to kill it and it stays killed?
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:12:00.120]   Well to some extent, but that's the point so the compromise that they had was they wouldn't validate it if I deleted it
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.480]   so they would just fall back to the
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:08.520]   You know Jeff says Kevin said this and you just see the quote you wouldn't see the verification by Twitter
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.080]   Kind of like I'd copied and pasted it or done a screenshot
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.760]   Yeah, so basically but I could have edited it, you know
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:19.320]   It's yeah, it's straightforward enough to make someone sweet say something else you can just you know change the text
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.840]   Chrome and edited yeah
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.520]   Do you see you're in a puppet? No, I was just gonna say I mean
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:30.840]   I look at Twitter like if you would look to talking to a journalist, right here on the record
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.920]   I mean, there's nothing secret about tweeting right
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:42.120]   So I feel like once you say it as a user you may want to disavow having said that at some point, but you said it and
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.480]   It's a trade-off
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:52.600]   You know, it's a standard boy's context collapse problem as well because a lot of the time once we do you're talking to some people
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.600]   And you're not really thinking about you're talking to the world
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.880]   And yeah, those of us who work in media are sort of more used to the idea of being on the record and so on
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.560]   But a lot of times people are just responding and going back and forth and then suddenly find that their tweet has been
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:10.320]   Made into a core celebrity or been sent a pile on by somebody with a bigger account
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.760]   Who didn't like them and they're gonna get abuse for the rest of the day and so on so they're right
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:21.040]   Yeah, there are some messy issues with it and certainly people should be able to hide their tweets and hide their accounts and so on
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:28.480]   and that's that's it get that's part of what gets tricky as well because Twitter now because Twitter has blocking and
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.560]   Semi-party counts and also you can delete your account and then under-litre again
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.600]   There's three or four states you can put Twitter into that will mean people can't see your posts
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.120]   You know, I'm I'm blocked by Chris Dixon because I argue with him about web three or whatever he calls it this week
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.760]   Which means if I want to read his post I have to go and open the minute incognito window to work out
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:53.040]   What he's complaining about so on so there's there's there's sort of these trade-offs like that that you hit all the time
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.120]   and
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.120]   then there's
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:04.520]   so there's this and then there's the nuance of how to read this place the conversation itself because there will sometimes show you conversations with bits missing because
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.640]   someone's blocked you or
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:12.320]   Someone has blocked the person who's quoting them and that gets a bit like bits gets a bit ambiguous as well
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:18.880]   You know, I will sometimes see Chris Dixon's post if someone I follow us some I follow has quoted them, but only sometimes
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.080]   So it is they haven't fully
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:27.280]   You know, it's sort of solve the problem because it's actually solving problem is hard in transclusion is hard is a hard problem
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.920]   So, you know, I've got something to be with Twitter for trying to deal with this
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.840]   but I think the original thing that they did the bended years ago of
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:43.840]   We'll give you the text the tweet is a block quote that will be in your page and that you know
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:49.000]   If Twitter breaks or a thousand years time, it'll still be there
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.600]   It's not just Twitter if I embed a YouTube video and that video is deleted. I'm gonna have the same problem
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.720]   We've shown you Instagram. They actually do that stuff that hasn't been deleted
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.520]   Now that's that's true
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.120]   I mean the thing about Twitter the Twitter is Twitter is released initially was
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.120]   Text and you can quote the whole thing straightforwardly
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.120]   It's harder these days because there are big there are there may be large images embedded in some as well
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:17.320]   And you don't get those in the block quote. They'd have to give you a lot more stuff to paste in for that to work
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:20.640]   so
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.220]   It you know the the environment Twitter has changed since this was first invented so you
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:32.480]   Way a battle over what Twitter is a debate over what Twitter is yeah
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.960]   So your complaint was that it was the debate of what the web is as well. Yes
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:42.280]   Yes, so Twitter was saying okay, we can the bargain we made with Twitter
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:49.520]   When they put this out and there's still quote on their website is what happens when all to delete their tweets
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:56.040]   The Twitter which is described just it will not display a fully rendered tweet the tweet in long resist on Twitter the full back block quote
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:01.360]   Ten tweet information we've has won the page and that's what they that's what the how to use this thing says
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.160]   So that's been the sort of the contract if you like
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.160]   And the reason to use this for a long time and if you are doing a sort of
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.880]   You're doing a BuzzFeed compilation or if you're doing a sort of here's what six people say about this thing
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.560]   And here's what I think about it and doing those kinds of you know quote response type posts
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:25.840]   Then that that the quotes will still be there for you in your text even if that even if the tweet has gone away
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.840]   Which is which is I think that's the right compromise. That's the compromise that
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:36.240]   It's so it makes sense at the point they said it and that's what Ben Ward told
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:43.600]   Ariel Waldman 11 years ago when she asked him the embed code is a block quote containing the tweet content
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.840]   This is from your page if it's deleted or 1,000 years in the future
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:55.520]   Note the text remains so there is kind of a promise explicit promise
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.400]   It's true that one hasn't been fresh now. It's fresh start for me
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.520]   Maybe you've got the other things you may have a script block that was blocked. Oh, I do
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.240]   I have lots of script blockers on yes
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:07.240]   Nothing nothing works well on my site in fact. I don't see your images or anything
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.600]   I don't know what you're doing on your page. I can't see a nice internet
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:17.440]   But if you if you yeah, so on the right hand side of my post I've got I've got I've got the I've got
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:26.040]   You might expand the I did I'll shrink it down to a normal size. You see all these tweets no images nothing
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.360]   That's the blocker. It's great
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.120]   That's it's hot linking the Twitter profile images directly in there. Yeah
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:38.960]   So which is you know, it's a third part. I think my scripts are blocking third party embeds probably something like that
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:45.000]   Yes, well, I know you probably I think probably especially probably some of them because the stat scriptures is third party in bed
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   - but I'm maybe I'm directly injecting it, but yeah, so I've got those comments on the side are
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.380]   Web mentions that I'm embedding in the site
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:59.800]   Through some indie web things and they are coming from Twitter through bridge. Let me turn off you block origin and maybe we can
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:05.560]   We can get this page to do it. I thought I thought you were slash dotted
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.960]   I thought the hacker news had had destroyed your your page
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:14.680]   No, it's still not a show you my version. No. Yeah, that was you block origin. So Firefox might be doing it
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:20.000]   I run a lot of protection. Yeah, there's lots of there's lots of ways you can block it
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.520]   I mean, yeah, I can show you my version if you want to know I believe you
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:27.960]   Didn't look that it's like I can build a web page y'all
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.920]   Let me show this is but that's what's interesting
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.440]   This is what in indie web is all about and all of these protective things that I have going on are because
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   People are doing nefarious things with stuff that should really be the kind of foundational
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.360]   capabilities of the web to interlink
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.960]   But I guess against it unfortunately
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.720]   This is also the issue we have with web mentions as well
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:53.120]   So with web mentioned when someone links to you and comments on your site
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:59.320]   They can send you a mention to say I've done that and we can I can pull their their quote in and put it on my side
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:05.200]   But we also have a way for that to deal with deletion to so if they delete it they could web mention me again in return of 410
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.920]   Which is h2bog for for gone or HTTP for gone
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:15.400]   And then then it's up to me to delete it from my site as well or if they edit it that we can show the editing version so we have that
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:21.800]   mechanic in indie web as well and a dynamic way for removing the content so
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.560]   Potentially we may hit a similar issue with people are starting to edit pieces out
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.960]   But the point of web mention is is more that
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.560]   we're explicitly
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.480]   They're explicitly pulling in this the response to our thing rather than actually quoting it
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:43.720]   So I think there is a distinction between I'm quoting something here and therefore I've editorially found it written written down
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.520]   What it says as opposed to I'm dynamically pulling in a response to my my poster here
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:55.240]   We are I've reloaded it in chromium and it works just fine. So fire fire fox
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.360]   I had strict blocking you had to do things like yeah
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:03.560]   So basically you can see I've got some lights at the top and I've got some responses here and these are these are any web mentions
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:08.960]   Is the anywhere mentions but they are mostly pull from Twitter? I think okay, but here's the hacker news
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.800]   Yeah, there's all the bots that I love web mentions. I've been trying to get it to work forever and day
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:23.480]   So yeah, this looks there that okay now. I'm seeing now. I'm seeing you see with what's going on. So the good
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.800]   Go ahead
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:33.640]   So yeah, so you know you should see bends and areas quotes back in flesh down. Yeah in actual Twitter style. Yeah
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.640]   This makes a lot more sense
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.120]   So the good news is but I wanted to feel nicely and it did in a way
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.120]   I just didn't have the images and I didn't have the
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:49.280]   Yeah, so you were getting the fall back the fall back case that you were meant to get right
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:54.160]   We which was the other point of this is like if JavaScript fails whatever you still was a useful text there
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.640]   Yeah, you're reading it in links or something or a screen reader the text is still there. Yeah
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:04.440]   So yeah, so what happened was I wrote about this
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.680]   How can you use road about it that the Verge wrote about it?
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.680]   Tech meme wrote about it and so on and so it's got some circulation to pick up
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:18.480]   And I think some of the media always actually started asking Twitter about it and Twitter were like oh
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.920]   Yeah, that's more complicated than we thought it was
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.200]   And then mark mark jacketh built a tool to
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.640]   Fix it. So basically some scripts you run that would
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:36.080]   Stop Twitter removing them from your page as well. So I've embedded that too and then over the weekend
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:43.920]   I'm under I spoke to Tech News weekly about it on on last Wednesday in fact. Thank you for embedding that on your page
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.920]   And I promise we won't delete it
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.600]   Here's his interview at the bottom with the tech news with Micah
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.720]   This is only get this pace up long isn't it? Yeah
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:59.560]   It's a certain our race between whether my column on the right and the column left gets long
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.280]   When I bet this show we will see if you can't see it
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:09.160]   Anyway, the point that but the point is over the weekend they suddenly say they said oh no we've changed the online
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.240]   We've reverted that they didn't mention it to me. I just noticed that the poster appears again
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:20.200]   But the Verge got them on the record to say yes, we've changed our mind on this and we may do something else in future
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:27.320]   So that's good is is good. Okay, is this how it's supposed to work?
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:32.600]   It's good in that they've gone back to what I think with the right answer is and yeah
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.120]   I've potentially had more influence on Twitter than you know must did this week, which is fun, but
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.160]   In terms of actually changing how it works
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:47.720]   But the it is a is a thorny problem and they need to think about it a bit more and sort of as a first pass
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:52.640]   Leaving white blobs all over the internet is not really a no an ideal way of approaching it
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.040]   So if they want to try something else I'm very happy to talk to them about it
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.640]   There's ways you could do this and again
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:04.440]   We have the web mention model for for effectively sending edits and deletions around
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:11.320]   But this is a slightly the embed thing is slightly tricky because you don't actually want to
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.800]   You don't want to delete the text of other people's web pages, right?
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:23.240]   Is the issue that edit button or I mean it happens even if you delete an account or you or you
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.640]   Go private. Yeah, I mean edit button
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:30.600]   But it will also add some perplex to this as well because if you can edit the tweet then which version of I'm betting the one
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.720]   I saw at the time or the one that right appears later
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.960]   So it really comes down to this again this question of is is Twitter a primary source?
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:46.920]   That should be preserved historically because people say things or is it just is it water cooler conversation?
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.920]   Then nobody should be held accountable and
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:55.840]   And that's kind of Dana Boyd's issue and I think others have talked about this is that it's like a water cooler where stuff gets preserved forever
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.840]   It's kind of worse to both worlds. Yes
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:04.800]   Is that a function of Twitter or is that a function of people just not understanding how to use it?
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   I mean part of this I feel like
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.960]   Well, I mean I feel like I know exactly when to use Twitter and how and why and what I mean
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.360]   I never casually approach it and I'm like, oh, let me just say my whatever
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.000]   so I feel like
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.360]   It's incumbent upon us to teach people
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:27.880]   The rules of the new space if it's a new what is it this?
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:36.520]   Town Square, you know, we have to develop the rules that in people understand and agree upon the rules that work in that town square and
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.920]   I think but the challenges there are different
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.760]   But there are there it well they've changed over time
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:50.160]   This this is this is part of it because originally the sort of the rules of Twitter were very different initially because
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:56.000]   They didn't have they didn't notify about replies. They didn't put replies under the posts
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.720]   And there was a whole sort of range of things that have changed over time and also that they didn't preserve much of a history
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.040]   You couldn't scroll back very far on Twitter. It would just yeah time hadn't fail on you
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.040]   So that so the notion of it as
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.480]   Assistant is something that has that was built up later
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:19.040]   And then the new is the place you go and shout out people is also a thing that build up over time as well
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.040]   It's so it's both
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:25.480]   It's the void you scream into and sometimes it screams back and if you're the president of the United States
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.520]   You get you get the best benefit of both
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.000]   It is a thorny thing and I think it's part of the problem
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.200]   I don't know. Can this be solved? Is this just a sociological problem and ultimately can be solved?
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.680]   It's not a technical issue. It's a sociological issue, right? Yeah
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:47.040]   Yeah, it's indeed and it's a sort of community management issue and collective action issue as well. Yeah
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:54.960]   And it's are you happy that they reverted should they stay the way they were I mean your what's nice is your your blog post now works
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.880]   Where you know you post I had to go in the I'd go and change to explain what was what I was saying because
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.400]   Look at this one look at this big black white hole. It's not being a whole
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:11.360]   Yeah, honest
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:19.760]   All right, yes, but that's the thing I know I think the what they've done is better than what they did
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.800]   There's potentially they could do something more subtle
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:27.680]   But we want Twitter to be what do we want Twitter to be?
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.880]   Stacey what should Twitter be should it should it be the water cooler should it be the the
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.600]   Journal of Records. What should it be? I?
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:42.000]   Think it's I think it is kind of the town square. So maybe it's the water cooler, but it's the water cooler work
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.640]   So you need to be aware that people who overhear you are not going to be your best friends. Does that make sense? Yeah?
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.440]   But there's also the additional
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.800]   Issue which is that everybody's Twitter is different depending on who they follow and for some people
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:05.360]   You know you always bring up Jeff black put black Twitter Twitter is a cultural phenomenon of its very own that's completely independent of other
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:11.280]   Twitters, right? And I so I think Stacy's right that we this is about a norm
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:14.080]   We've got it. We got a sudden expectation and and follow
[00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:19.280]   I think if you had a Facebook post and you couldn't delete it people would go back s, right?
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:25.360]   Yeah, but of course Twitter's architecture is different and it's out there in the world and people do delete their tweets regularly
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.520]   There are services to do so they get rid of all their tweets from the last year some fools like I don't know
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.200]   The host of a famous podcast just puts Twitter every once in a while
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.920]   And and I think you need to have I have come right to do that. I have however
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.720]   It comes to a detente with Twitter. Yes, you have
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.400]   But as Stacy said if somebody overhears that
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:50.000]   That it's out of your control. So if I whether it's by a screen grab or me
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:54.640]   Quoting or and re typing or whatever if I hear it that knowledge is now mine
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.880]   You can't kill that out of my brain or what I say
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:02.000]   You can kill the substantiation of it on Twitter and I think you should never write to do that
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.320]   Like you should never write to kill your blog or write to kill anything else you've done
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.520]   But if I've heard it
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:14.880]   And either by re typing it in my blog or by having a service hello Donald Trump that pulls all the tweets
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.680]   You've done so you can't kill them from public record
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.840]   That's that's hey, you said it in public that that is the breaks
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.480]   So I think there's a combination of both where you have to be
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:29.440]   Talked to be aware that once you said it you've said it people have heard it
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.840]   You shouldn't put anything on the internet. You don't want to be in the in stone forever
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.320]   That's the deal
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.840]   But your substantiation of yourself on Twitter you should have some control
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.480]   Yeah, this gets more complicated though when we get to the edit button
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.640]   because
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:51.440]   If I also think that I can change a tweet that's now out in 25 different places
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:55.680]   You can gaslight me you could say oh you didn't read that tweet
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.640]   This is what I said or or on the other side of it
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:04.560]   I think as an author of the tweet that I'm I'm updating and correcting the tweet
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:11.520]   And I am doing so on twitter.com, but not everyone maybe i'm not on your client or somebody else or in your mind in your
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.680]   in your mind
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.920]   Jeff remembers when you said originally yeah
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:22.160]   It's a really it's a it's a challenge, but this is a good example of how the internet
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:28.960]   Internet norms are still in flux and we don't really know i'm sure elon must would have fixed all of this
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.880]   You know, we're gonna get to that three hours. We're gonna get to the big elon
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.760]   Uh, i'm really glad you're here kevin by the way
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:41.200]   It was firefox strict mode that broke your site if I put firefox in standard mode
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.960]   Uh in its privacy that makes sense because i'm using the third party scripts to do these things. Yeah, yeah
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:53.440]   And I generally run in strict mode which breaks a lot of surprisingly large number of things in the world
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.240]   so uh
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.240]   paranoia doesn't pay
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.440]   No, it pays fine. It just the not gonna see things is
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:05.360]   Your world is black and gray and not very pretty
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.880]   Uh
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:14.400]   Stronger protection. It's like by the way last week when when we ended up making fun of the of the twitter version of that the bear twitter
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.600]   I don't know if you saw the foundry kevin who thanked us for the attention
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.120]   That's exactly what I want is I want the boring twitter. Yeah, so that's leo's
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:26.720]   boring twitter boring twitter. It's my new uh pick of the week bear dot
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:32.320]   Uh tw twitter without all the stuff
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:38.720]   Just that's leo's world. That's my that's how I want in fact can I get rid of the images as well?
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:43.600]   I want to get rid of the images. I know like it's so so rude. That's spark of color
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.880]   Well, you will be the exotic class
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:53.280]   Of the other reason for that as well. I'll show you that later. Well, I this is this is of course there is
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.800]   Yeah, I'm sure there is absolutely I could turn off those images, but this is uh
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:05.120]   As I mentioned last week bear dot tw uh which is supposedly just the just the tweets man nothing but the tweets
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.680]   uh just the facts and uh
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:13.600]   They mocked me. They mocked me. You're missing some cute dog photos. I'm missing all the cute every single one
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:19.440]   Uh, but I do have an eel dash and paul graham and that's all I care about let me take a break
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.120]   We're gonna come back. It's so good to have kevin marks here. Love having you
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.200]   on the show whenever uh you can uh sitting in for
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.240]   uh, amp pruit kevin is a
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.720]   As you've probably gathered by now strong proponent of the open web
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:42.320]   And indyweb.org is a great place to read more about that and i'm always trying to uh to live the indy web life
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:48.240]   And as blog is kevin marks.com our show today brought to you by new reva
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:54.640]   You know we're coming back to work. We're in this new hybrid work situation where some people are in the office
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:01.920]   Some people are at home. We still have to have meetings that means that huddle room that conference room suddenly is a mess
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:09.120]   Is a mess because you you want people at home to not feel disenfranchised you want them to be able to hear the conversation
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.520]   We want to be able to hear them
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.760]   Do you bring in some fancy av company to put in cameras and
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:21.920]   Big screens, you know big sisco systems and spend thousands of dollars and have wires and microphones
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.360]   And and it's you know an inflexible mess that has to be
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.920]   configured and
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.920]   Calibrated constantly no
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.240]   No, you don't need that traditional system
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:38.000]   Because we've got a better way great audio simplified with nareva and you are
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.240]   eva
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.840]   They have a patent
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:48.160]   on something they call microphone mist technology with this patented technology all it takes is one or two
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.240]   Integrated microphone and speaker bars. They look like sound bars if you go to the website. They look exactly like sound bars on a
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.480]   on a wall
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:01.520]   They can fill the room with thousands of virtual microphones nose no dead zones
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:04.560]   Everyone everywhere in the room can be heard clearly
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.040]   meeting participants
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:14.880]   Class members can talk can move naturally in the space can face any way they want can socially distance if they need and still be heard
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.800]   by remote participants and vice versa. It's remarkable and
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:22.240]   Not only is it much less expensive than those traditional systems
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.200]   It's much easier to use continuous auto calibration means your rooms are always
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.400]   Instantly ready with optimized audio. You don't need to bring in a technician to calibrate
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.520]   In fact your it department gets a console
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:41.680]   That makes it very easy for them to monitor manage and adjust your rooms no matter how many you have
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:48.000]   From anywhere no need to go to from room to room and the installation well if you've ever put up a sound bar
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.200]   It's literally that easy a 30-minute diy job
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:56.640]   That's incredible big savings on time cost compared to traditional systems
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.440]   But you are going to love it and if you're still using that spider that sits in the middle of the conference room table
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:08.720]   Please stop just stop the suffering stop the insanity go to nareva.com and you are

[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.160]   com
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:37.120]   What do you use for your website kevin? What is the uh, what is the engine?
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:45.040]   Up you're muted. Do we mute him did he mute him now? I muted myself because I was pouring water he muted um
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:50.160]   I it's just plain h2m. Oh, I mean wait what
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:53.760]   You edited a notepad
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:59.760]   I did visual studio code now, but yeah
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:04.160]   You edit you edit and vs code it's not even markdown. It's just
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.000]   I would use markdown as that's HTML Wow
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.200]   Wow, so if I've used source, it's gonna look exactly like it looks to you
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:21.040]   Yep, that's that's marvelous. Wow. I mean I've I've got it. It's served through heroku static pages
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.920]   So I was thinking oh, I'll do something dynamic whatever do so. Yeah, it's just a bunch of handwritten niche. No. Wow
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.560]   That's old school man
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:34.880]   And then I've got it so it's in it's in get how by checking into get how and that redeploys it so that I can edit it locally and then
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.400]   hit
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:43.040]   I'm thinking um, I use a static site generator called hugo, but uh, so I'm right now. I
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:48.960]   I like hugo's good. I like that because I'm static and then it's just it is it's generating the HTML for me
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.280]   But it's static and I actually do I check it into github so github can serve it too
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:36:00.400]   Uh, so that I mean I mean I I keep meaning oh, I should go I should convert this to hugo rather than keep anything
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:05.440]   By hand because then I'd get like tag pages and things but um I tend never quite get around to it
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:09.360]   And for your web mentions do you use bridgy? What do you use for your web mentions?
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:15.680]   What are you so web mentions is web mention dot herokuapp.com which is written by vox pelly
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:21.120]   Um, and it's it's an app that I link in and I said that as my web mentioned target
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.200]   And then it injects that right sidebar
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.680]   And they put some this is really sweet
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:31.120]   So instead of a comments if people mention you on hacker news or on twitter
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.880]   Uh, looks like some other places as well. They'll go right here
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:41.040]   Some direct sites they turn up there so there some of these are uh, sort of actual pure web mentions most of them come from twitter
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.960]   Which comes with bridgy. Yeah
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:48.720]   And that used to pop up in the comments of your sites, right? I mean, I like it as a sidebar here. It's kind of cool
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:52.960]   I like it as a sidebar too. I just was like that's something that we used to rely on a lot
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.200]   Um, yeah, no, you can't replace this
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:56.720]   So
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.960]   Yeah, there's I mean there's there's what there's ways to do it
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:01.120]   But what we what the web mention model is
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:07.040]   Um, if I write a post on my site and link to you, I then send a web mention you to say i've linked to you and it can appear there
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:09.440]   um
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:14.960]   And what we've done with um bridge e bridge e will check twitter for links to that url
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.880]   When it finds one it'll add it to the page as well. So that's that's that's a trick
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.880]   So you can see that they've all got
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.800]   They've must come on twitter edits you in there or so on. Yeah, it's actually a bit more subtle because if I
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:30.480]   If people reply to a tweet with i've posted the links to it, it'll come back there as well. So you get no
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.360]   I recently
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.760]   switched to uh
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.000]   Using mastodon as my comment
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.400]   System so it's similar to that except as if using twitter it uses the you know
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.040]   yeah, i'm
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:49.120]   And twitter and twitter is um mastodon is marked up with microformats too
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:54.400]   Right, so if you can if you send a web mention from the mastodon post it will show up properly in here
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.520]   But it doesn't send them by default. So yeah, you'd you'd have to call the API to put them in yeah
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.160]   It's uh, yeah
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:07.760]   I'm just i'm only I I am such a strong believer in the free and open web. I just feel like
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.240]   Whatever we can do to kind of preserve that
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.720]   Uh is is great
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.560]   Um, so let's catch you up
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:21.040]   On the saga of a little old elan musk
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.040]   There should be a ballad the ballad of elan musk
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:29.200]   Sit right back while i tell you a tale to tell you of a billionaire
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.760]   wanted to own twitter
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.600]   So he as you know if you've been paying attention
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:41.680]   uh over the first three months of 2022 has been slowly they say paying cash
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.120]   which sounds like he's actually like
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:50.800]   Licking his thumb and spitting out bills for shares of twitter got himself all the way up to 9.2
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.960]   percent
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.920]   Delayed mentioning that by the way now he's being sued
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:04.080]   Because the sec requires when you get to five i think five percent five percent you have to five percent. Yeah, you have to report
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:10.800]   He got to five percent by march 14th, but didn't file the april force
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:18.000]   And so there's a an investor lawsuit saying and I think the sec should probably also do something
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:25.520]   I think they're investigating saying hey you essentially kept the price artificially low by not telling everybody you were buying up twitter
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:30.000]   Of course as soon as he filed an april fourth twitter stock price went up 27 percent
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.080]   Right which proved the point proved the point that better evidence better receipts than that. Yeah
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:39.280]   Uh, so anyway, uh, he is now a 9.2 percent shareholder
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.800]   Which at that point gave him i guess enough stock that twitter said well we better out a listen to this guy
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.360]   Even though he's kind of obviously a troll offered him a board seat
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.000]   Now this is where it gets interesting
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.960]   And invited him to speak to the staff for an ama the ama has been canceled
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.400]   And so has he lones board seat
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:07.120]   But we're not clear on what happened
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:11.120]   It's exactly why I didn't want him on the board in the first place
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:15.840]   He's just a troll who runs around doing his own thing and with rules getting the way he
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.080]   backs off and
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:23.600]   This is exactly what we thought would happen. So there I mean, I think you're it could be
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.600]   I don't know. Do you think agro agro agro wall said
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:33.840]   Now never mind. Do you think elon said no never mind or did some lawyers what I hear what I mean?
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:39.520]   What do you hear as lawyers said, uh, you just can't you can't do these days. You have a fiduciary
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:46.400]   fiduciary responsibility and you can't go around telling the public what's gonna happen with the company without knowing it or before it's known
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:52.560]   He did delete a bunch of tweets over the weekend that were offensive stupid childish
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.360]   That's nothing
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:59.040]   I mean, I think he realized someone probably said him aside and said look
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:03.360]   You can do all this when it's your own companies when you come in and do this to other companies
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.200]   This is a problem. And then I think also twitter's lawyers probably were like, y'all really?
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:15.440]   Is this really what we want? And I think probably everybody woke up next to each other and was like, oh
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.000]   Yeah, no, this isn't right
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.800]   He was putting up polls
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:28.560]   It's kind of facetious polls at one point. He said should twitter delete the w and twitter for its name
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.080]   Which is just perfect for his like a nine-year-old joke
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.720]   I'm for a joke by a fourth grader
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.560]   uh
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.440]   It turns out according to the timeline from the washington post that on saturday morning
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:45.280]   He told twitter he would not be joining the board
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:49.920]   Now though there's another thought I had because remember when we said
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.640]   Maybe one of the reasons I think you stacey said keep your friends close keep your enemies closer
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:59.920]   One of the reasons twitter offered him a board seat is because board members are not allowed to own more than 15 percent
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.280]   go
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.440]   Yeah, but also is that then then they have fiduciary duty so he would have to
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.040]   Examine it's a kind of products. I'm about yeah
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:17.040]   No, because because you're given non material information and therefore if you percent publicly you have our let's never stopped him in the past
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.040]   And the sec has barely slapped his wrists for these things
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.520]   No, I'm not yeah. No, but that's you know the
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.400]   When is that it's my question?
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:32.560]   Well the pussy because he has beneficial entry with his own company so he's not going to sue himself where his twitter could sue him for doing
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.320]   Yeah, okay
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:40.560]   So so the lawyers said elon you're gonna have to uh muzzle yourself. He said i'm not doing that
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:45.680]   Uh also elon you can't buy any more shares past 15 percent
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.080]   I still think elon he has that though
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.720]   He's got the money if he wanted to buy twitter, you know just do a
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.120]   Hostile takeover he could buy a 51 state. I'm sure
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.480]   Where he is friends good. Yeah, yeah, I was like he doesn't have to buy the whole 50 tier tilde by
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:07.440]   Another 15 percent. What would be the first thing we would do is invite president trump former president trump back
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:13.840]   Probably do you think yeah, I think that's what the I suspect that's why the uh
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:17.440]   Staff is is nervous. Well explain the stock market
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:22.640]   Response to me because all right so when he bough buys that much the stock goes up because ooh
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:28.000]   It could be in play or whatever right he leaves the stock went down, but then it went back up again
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.320]   The market is confused. What we want to do with elon isn't it?
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:36.000]   The market's confused was be probably sufficient in that sentence. Yeah
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:44.080]   I don't know what the market what the market's thinking uh, there's certainly some people in the
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:47.760]   But shares when elon was a massive
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:54.320]   Shareholder just because why do you buy shares if you you know if you're a speculator because you think they're going to continue to go up
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.720]   So buys some shares there's going to be up to move to buy more shares
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.240]   Sorry about that. What is it now?
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.960]   39 to 50 on april 5 and right now it's at uh 45
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:09.440]   85 45 85
[00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:11.600]   So it did go back down a little bit
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.320]   Yeah, that's not uncommon. Yeah, yeah, yeah you buy what is it?
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.520]   Buy on the rumor selling the news
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:27.040]   I don't know what the news or the rumor was it's still way above. It's april first price of 39 31 before the elon announcement
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:31.920]   So it's still up a significant amount up 38 in the past month
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.440]   That's that's still some good money
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:42.160]   So I would say overall the stock is is bullish on twitter the stock market is bullish on twitter with elons involvement
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:45.680]   I think they're just bullish on the fact that
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.560]   There's chum in the water
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:54.880]   like I I feel like I feel like being a stock market investor now is based solely on like
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:45:00.800]   Stunk behaviors. I guess I just don't even know anymore
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:09.520]   Oh, I think you're right. I mean so traditionally the vast amount of stock movements come from institutional investors
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:14.000]   pension funds things like that people who presumably you know are are
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:19.360]   Solid and steady and and informed investors
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:25.840]   I even with even though robin hood and public comment all these I was just gonna wonder if it becomes a robin stuff
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:30.720]   I don't think I don't think that do they move the market enough to really make a difference?
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:36.640]   Elon behaves that way and can move the market. So that's what it feels like to me
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:42.480]   I feel well, we know his tweets. I mean basically are pumping dumps sometimes when he says, you know, I'm going
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.800]   We're taking tesla private four and twenty dollars a share financing secured
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.560]   Then it turns out that was a lie stock market loves it buys it up
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.640]   There's a lot of nihilism makes it like running around
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.560]   He is now the richest man on the planet except for poutine
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:04.640]   Yes, so pudence just to be hundreds of millions stock is going down
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.960]   at one point
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.960]   He was because of his you know, basically
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.920]   Secret ownership of gas prom and all of the other Russian enterprises
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.960]   He was thought to be by far the richest man in the world
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.680]   well, anyway
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:24.640]   Elon's 300 billion nearly 300 billion fortune puts him pretty much at the top of the list
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.120]   um
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.120]   So it worked
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.760]   Whatever whatever he's up to is working
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:38.160]   And well, by the way, the gas price is going through the roof helps tesla their sales are through the roof
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.920]   They're they can't make them fast enough now
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:47.040]   Well, that's behind the war. Wow, isn't it? Yeah
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.200]   Well, that's up even more. I think I saw 26 increase in orders
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.000]   over the last few weeks
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.200]   Wow, well, that makes sense. I mean, I'd want an electric car down too plus there's I mean everybody's
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:06.480]   Honda just did their announcement to not produce gas power cars. I mean sure it's by 24 times of choices. Yeah
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:08.880]   Yeah, we're basically hitting the
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:12.400]   inflection point for electric vehicles and
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.360]   Do electric car right now, which would you buy?
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:24.400]   I really don't know I like I'm I'm waiting for things. I look at the Audi maybe
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:30.800]   But it's pretty expensive and I really want a Subaru. I want the electric Subaru that doesn't exist yet
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.280]   So you Toyota Subaru one
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.040]   There there isn't one Subaru is not making. Well, there's going to be a car yet
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.760]   With yes, the Toyota
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:45.680]   Stupid name car is going to be a Subaru too. So wait a minute. What now I'm confused. That's two different companies
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.180]   Yeah, Toyota. I know that but the Toyota. Yes, the Toyota B4 Z
[00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:54.480]   1 5 6 8 whatever their stupid brand is for it is a super
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.200]   B4 Z is also going to be a Subaru
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.200]   The all electric let me say
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.880]   Not a super a Subaru Subaru
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:10.720]   Oh, yeah, you're right the brs. E is it Toyota? It happens. I can't be right. Super well. It happens
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:17.040]   Okay. Yeah. Oh, it was okay. Well, there you go. There you go. Um, the BZ
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.120]   Brand
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:21.200]   Yeah, well
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.240]   Toyota owns 20% of Subaru
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:27.440]   It also is five to five percent Mazda
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:35.120]   So Tesla I was wrong. I I underestimated Tesla its estimated has seen a hundred percent increase
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.160]   In orders in some areas of the us as gas prices
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.960]   So
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:47.040]   So that's how lived yeah, whatever Elon's doing he's doing doing it right
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:53.600]   But there's still a huge waiting the market wait for those isn't it? Yeah. Oh, yeah, the weights getting longer and longer and longer
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.680]   Uh, that's all right, you know, uh, they're taking the orders
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:02.720]   Uh, okay. So elon now is back to being a private citizen
[00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:09.360]   I think it's a great is he gonna buy twitter is he gonna do what you think or is he gonna get no?
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.160]   He's bored already. He's already bored
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:15.920]   I guarantee you we should check his tweets
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:21.040]   Yeah, yeah
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.160]   Twitter lives and dies though by these guys right when trump was big
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.640]   Twitter on twitter that made twitter's
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.640]   For four years twitter was the place to go to find out what's going on
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:35.840]   But I go I go back to my black twitter example. It's it's the longest of long tails
[00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:40.800]   Um the most popular person on twitter is it's any proportion? Oh, this is interesting
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:45.200]   Elon has not tweeted in four days. Is he dead? Is he okay?
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:53.760]   His last tweet was april ninth right before the news came out that he wasn't going to be on the board saturday
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:56.880]   Um very
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.160]   Interesting. He hasn't uh tweeted at all since then
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:06.320]   Not to talk about dogecoin not to talk about spacex not to talk about tesla
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:10.320]   How often does he tweet normally like a hundred times a day
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.720]   You want to see all the tweets from the last day he tweeted? This is april ninth
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:20.000]   Okay ready april ninth april ninth april ninth ninth april ninth april ninth april ninth april ninth april ninth april ninth
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.760]   ninth okay, yeah, but what he's not on a weird pump and dump scene april eighth
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.400]   April eight april eighth eighth
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:27.760]   seven
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:28.800]   eight
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:33.920]   Seven i guess i'm always tweeting in two different time zones. This is my this is my favorite one
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:37.920]   This was the one i bet i'm gonna guess got him boop bounced from the board
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:42.400]   We talked about this on sunday twitter's next board meeting is gonna be lit
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:46.240]   He tweets with a picture of him smoking a blunt on joe rogan
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:57.040]   All i have to say is it's so frustrating to see people act like this when i know that as a woman if i wandered around
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.440]   Acting like this no one would take me
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:02.560]   Motley seriously or they give you a reality show called
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:10.080]   No, they wouldn't they it just drives me. What's what's the cartagians reality show?
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:15.920]   Uh, meet the car got a new one. Yeah, I know they they retired and now they're back
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:19.040]   yeah
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:22.880]   Meet the hagan bothoms. I think it would be good
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:29.520]   They don't treat the cartagians are still a running joke in the culture whereas elan musk can get
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.400]   They may be running joke in the culture, but they're rich running jokes
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:35.200]   Keeping up with the hagan bothoms
[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.920]   Not something necessary at all
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:52.320]   All right, let's move on to more serious matters the war in ukraine rages on
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.040]   Apparently thanks to eset as security company
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.160]   One of our sponsors and microsoft
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:03.600]   Uh, I think they do something in the technology sphere
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.240]   Uh, the ukraine and power grid
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:11.600]   Which was going to be taken down any minute now was with stu to russian cyber
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.080]   attack using
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:18.880]   They believe it's sandworm a russian military group using kind of an old school
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.680]   malware
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:27.840]   Uh, but microsoft and eset discovered it the electrical allowed outages were going to be friday evening
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.800]   Uh, but having discovered it. They were able to pull down. I guess the botnets
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:39.680]   And to avert the blackout that would have taken power out for two million people in ukraine
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:46.000]   So this this cyber yeah yay good guys good guys win
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.760]   uh
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:51.520]   Researchers at cyber security companies eset and microsoft identified and neutralized
[00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:54.160]   The malicious software used in the attack
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:01.760]   And it was it was a new software just done by an established agency correct. No in destroyer
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:06.800]   Which was a malware used in 2016 to do the same thing knock
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:11.200]   Substations off a keve for about an hour remember that
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:17.520]   And we thought this is a little probe a little test of uh of their capabilities. So that was the mama
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:22.160]   That uh created the variant that they were going to use this time
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:24.720]   dubbed in destroyer two
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.680]   Oh, okay the conjuring
[00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:30.320]   uh sandworm is a
[00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:37.200]   Part of the gru the russian military intelligence agency. It's also accused of causing blackouts
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.040]   uh
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:42.640]   In uh, I think 2020 or 2021 in ukraine
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.760]   so
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.760]   And here is the wanted poster
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:58.080]   Gru hackers destructive malware and international cyber attacks conspiracy to committed offense against the united states false registration of a domain name
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.480]   Oh, man. That's got to have a penalty
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:08.320]   Uh, conspiracy conspiracy to commit wire fraud wire fraud intentional damage to protected computers and aggravated identity theft
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.520]   So these guys better not go in a u.s post office anytime soon
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:17.280]   I I think they're safe
[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.320]   um, so there's also this is interesting a
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:27.600]   There's also a malware called catty wiper
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:33.520]   Being spread around uk ukraine designed to delete data on infuted infected computer systems
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:42.080]   This uh, wiper was also used to disrupt the u.s satellite communications provider via sat on the day of the invasion you may remember
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:47.360]   Anyway, so though so even though there haven't been any catastrophic cyber attacks
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:51.200]   It's a it's going on right now back and forth back and forth
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.560]   And that makes sense. I mean you wouldn't expect
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:57.360]   I mean they're losing the
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:02.160]   The war on land or they're struggling. I wouldn't say losing
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:07.600]   Yeah, I don't want to say anything about it. Uh, except that it's horrific
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.880]   Yes. Yeah. Mm. Mm
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:16.240]   Okay
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.880]   Like tech that isn't gonna make us tick tock
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:24.480]   Tic tock that doesn't make you sad. Well, wait a minute tic tock. Oh, here's the problem
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:29.680]   This is so we've been talking a little bit about sanctions and how they're not necessarily in some cases
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:33.120]   It's to make the company look good rather than to further ukraine's
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:35.200]   uh
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:36.400]   welfare
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.400]   tic tock
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:39.280]   Uh
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:41.280]   kind of band
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.920]   Uh, in a way band russia
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.720]   Suspended new video uploads and live streams
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.760]   from russia
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.160]   Um
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:54.720]   And walled off this is the thing they did they walled off
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.440]   Russian users for seeing posts from outside the country including ukraine
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:04.720]   And according to the post effectively creating a second censored version of its platform
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.680]   But as a result
[00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:10.800]   Uh
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.840]   Because the block on russian content has not been effective
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:18.240]   A lot of what's on tic-tac in russia now is pro-government propaganda
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:23.680]   They're not seeing the story of what's going on outside of russia
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:28.960]   So this is a this is an example of sanctions going wrong. I think
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:33.440]   Yeah, but I mean these are blunt tools and so it makes sense that
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.040]   We're gonna have to figure I mean in a in a sense
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:40.320]   You'll see actually there's another story. I think on algo speak
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:47.120]   People have to get creative people will get creative, but I mean when you're oh, I love this story. You want to talk about this?
[00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:49.920]   Yeah, it's just
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:54.720]   This is tail and lorence doing great stuff. This is she's doing freed from the what new york time
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:57.360]   She's doing great work. Yeah, she's now at the post
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.920]   um
[00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:02.480]   Uh, i was looking forward to doing this story
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.320]   Uh
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:10.080]   So if you use tic-tac, you know that uh the tic-tac algorithm looks at things you're saying and so
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:14.960]   In order to get around the tic-tac algorithm and talk about what you want to talk about
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:18.800]   Uh tic-tac creators have started to use
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.120]   Um
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:28.080]   But that what she calls it algo speak but euphemisms for instance instead of a vibrator you might have a spicy eggplant
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.920]   Uh instead of saying dead you might say unalive
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:39.440]   Uh, she's got a whole a whole series of stuff when tic-tac started started banning
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:46.160]   Uh, covid-19 misinformation people started referring to covid-19 as the backstreet boys reunion tour
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:49.200]   Or calling it panini
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.760]   Or the panda express
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:55.680]   When young people began to discuss struggling with mental health they talked about becoming unalive
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:59.840]   Sex workers call themselves accountants
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:02.960]   And instead of using the word
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:07.840]   Instead of using the word pore and they use the word corn or the more better yet the corn emoji
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.560]   So if you see an accountant who's into corn
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:14.800]   And anyway, what you think it is
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:20.000]   We've all become chinese, right? This is this is all the tricks that the chinese had. Oh, that's why winning
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:23.040]   Years that's why winnie the poo
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:27.680]   That's why they banned winnie the poo. Yeah, they caught up. That's the promise
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:30.880]   That's a bit of a chiff. Yeah, yeah, but this is this is this is
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.240]   Dana Boyd again was expanding how
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   Teens have been doing this. Oh, it works for you. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:44.640]   Yeah, it's very much like you you use an idiolex that other people don't understand to talk about what you want to talk about
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:49.920]   POS I remember when you were when we my kids were doing I see q they'd write POS
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:53.760]   And I didn't know what it meant. It stood for parents over shoulder
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:56.560]   And it was like
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:58.560]   Who is also a POS? Yeah
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:05.360]   Any vaccine groups on facebook do this too. They changed their names to dance party or dinner party
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:07.360]   Uh
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.840]   Vaccinated people were referred to as swimmers
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:19.840]   I just it's a great story just because I love I so for instance instead of saying lgbtq
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:22.240]   um
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:26.400]   They use they say they're members of the leg booty community because
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.560]   apparently
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.880]   Uh, that's what the voice synthesizer turns up p g t q into it's like
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:36.400]   That's hilarious. I didn't realize that
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:46.480]   Instead of nipples can't say nipples obviously nip nops
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:49.760]   Um
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:54.960]   If you're going to talk about crackers, you can't say crackers because the algorithm thinks you're talking about
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.600]   Soot white southerners crackers. So you have to say saltines, which is really ironic
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.920]   Yes, me
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.200]   Twitch considers the word cracker a slur it is a slur actually
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.720]   Uh, wow. Thank you a tale of Lorenz for
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:15.200]   Oh, yeah, this is that's also here's another one the tick tock's text to speech
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.440]   Uh
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.040]   You can't say lesbian
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:25.120]   So what they write is le dollar sign b i a n which the text to speech pronounces lud dollar bean
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:30.080]   So they just started writing lud dollar bean
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:38.080]   But you're right. This has been going on. It's probably going on since uh, you know, the surf saw that the lord coming said p o l
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:42.960]   Yeah, well, it's kind of fun because i'd be very curious to see how quickly
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:50.320]   It spreads with social media, right? So like that's true. How long what's the longevity of your much faster?
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:55.200]   Laying or your what did you call it idio dialect idio dialect? Yes
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:01:00.960]   So yeah, that would be a fun thing to research in is it different on different platforms
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:06.720]   Where older people are, you know versus where younger people are I just don't know, but it's super fun
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.520]   You read gretchen mccallocks book on this
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.200]   No, that's really good. Um, I'll probably leave it. Hang on
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:18.080]   I think it's a I think yeah, I think it's on my list from uh from uh jeff
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:25.120]   I'm like jeff do you read all the books on your books shelf back there or they just because because internet is called
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:28.880]   Because it is what a great name for a book
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:33.680]   Understand the new rules of language. Yeah, and it's really good because you basically she's a she's a linguist
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:38.720]   And she goes through and talks about all these different linguistic constructions that's in a different groups and subgroups
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.960]   loves and also things like
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.760]   Different ways people use punctuation depending on
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.720]   Um, oh, yeah
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.840]   My kids mocked me using punctuation on my text messages
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:52.560]   Oh my god, these things were all yelling at her
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:57.680]   If I stop it's very rude. Yeah full stop. Yeah, yeah, like
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:02.240]   If I put a period and she's like they're yelling it and I was like, no, no people are age
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:08.720]   Just think the best with periods the right way to write and she's like no, it's so harsh
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:14.080]   So we used to think it was typing in caps right now. It's not typing caps is simply using punctuation
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:21.920]   Yeah, don't use punctuation. That's the morning. Come only so I've got a question for you all. Yeah, so at a journalism school, right?
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.440]   We we taught
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:30.560]   Proper grammar and the ap style book and all that and if we take what I say about serving communities where they are
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.640]   um
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.840]   We I think need to accept and value
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.000]   many different
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.280]   Uh linguistic styles even in a journalism school, of course. Yeah. Well, I think that's
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:49.520]   Although in some quarters. Well, so I think it also depends on your your platform
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:53.200]   So like in the new york times or in a print paper
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:58.640]   I feel like there's probably you know, like you use eighth grade level english when you're writing for
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:04.720]   You know, your local daily right where as you may do something a little more highfalutin for a magazine
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:10.880]   And maybe for the tiktok account you're using different language and emojis and I don't think that's weird
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.520]   It's unreaded a lot. There are a lot of non-english speakers
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:18.960]   So I often you know cut all some slack to people but there's a lot you see this a lot. I seen
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:24.320]   I seen the waymo or I see a cruise car be pulled over by the pd. I seen it
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:30.080]   And at first i'm going well, that's just you know ignorant and ungrammatical and now i'm realizing no
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:34.880]   I have to be less judgmental. That's just that's language evolves, right?
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:39.920]   So I was editing a chapter of the Gutenberg book yesterday and I came across this section that I actually wrote
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.560]   I forgot I've written it
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:48.240]   It occurred to me that that when montane wrote his essays
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.040]   He raised the bar
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.760]   On being able to join in the conversation because you had to be a writer. Yes literally
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:02.400]   Yes, we've all how many people do we know who are scared of writing whether it's a memo. It's kevin mark's fault
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.880]   I can't keep up with his public school
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:07.680]   Ponzi education exactly exactly
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.960]   Thank you very much
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:16.240]   Heavens are you man
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:24.960]   But never you but you would you adopt different, you know, you adopt different edilics, but you're talking to you you you have
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.520]   It's code switching as well, but it's also
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:34.640]   You you I would speak differently to you guys about stuff because we've got a bunch of shared vocabulary and context and I would speak to
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.840]   You know my sons about it or or or or someone I mean the street because yeah
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.000]   It's just a question of what shared what can we done?
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.600]   But the the questions was interesting because she says a lot of it does show up in we're think
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.160]   It's just shopping with things like punctuation. She says you can tell old old people because they always put um
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.480]   ellipses in their texts for some reason I love ellipses
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.880]   You're old
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.080]   Yeah
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.680]   And the end dash like I'm just looking at my tech my texts from my kid
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:07.440]   And they are definitely very different than my text. I have to look at my texts for my kids now
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:12.160]   See my daughter who's 30 is probably more older than
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:15.840]   Old now, right? She doesn't she doesn't count
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:23.920]   Oh, yeah, no capitalization. No periods. No, no, there's no punctuation. Just a lot of exclamation marks
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.040]   Exclamation marks. Yeah, tons of yeah
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:33.680]   Same thing with my son the capitalizes the first letter of the sentence probably because apple does it for him
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:36.320]   Exactly
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:40.080]   That's the last time it's capitalized. Wow
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:47.840]   And lots of in ironically mine doesn't maybe it's because she's on an android phone, but she doesn't use a lot of emojis
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.920]   She just uses um
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.120]   No, no, Henry uses no emojis
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:59.200]   And and abby does use emojis quite a bit. So that's just maybe what is a call when you use the letters
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:01.840]   Is it leap? No, not leads me
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:06.240]   Metacons a motorcom. There we go. Now your old forget ellipses a motor cons
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.000]   Hey, shruggy guy. Hey, yep
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.960]   No, they're not that complicated
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:19.760]   They're like the little but she does she does the little hearts and the I think it's fascinating. I love language
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:23.120]   I love I'm gonna I've just added the mccolic book to my um
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.720]   My audible. Oh, no, I recommend everyone to read that book. Yeah, it also it helps a lot when you're
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:33.840]   You're reading other people's section like oh, right. Yeah, they're running this style. Okay, I get very judgmental
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.920]   I'm not sure I can write in those times, but at least I can read them
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:42.400]   Yeah, and I have to train myself, but kevin mcwarder's been great on that too, which you introduced me to uh jeff
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:49.760]   Uh, he's really been good on on showing me that you know, he's linguist as well. It's just you know, it's it's like that's how language evolves
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.920]   It's normal. This is where part me gutenberg moment. This is where print came in is that is that
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:58.160]   I think it's a barrow echo who said that uh a
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:02.640]   Dialect is a language without an army. Oh, I love it
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:06.880]   And and so when print came in a whole bunch of dial
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:12.720]   I mean when luther chose to publish in german that was a momentous decision the vernacular
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:17.360]   It was then speaking to a public number one and number two he started standardizing german
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.760]   and so a national identity
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.480]   Long before the nation was created a national identity of german's
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:29.200]   Was created from that moment and so so the technology had a huge impact
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:34.640]   So now we come around and and and and now you don't have to be montane. You don't have to be
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:37.440]   um literate in the sense of your grandparents
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:42.000]   You can change the language and in fact use things that aren't in our view language
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:47.520]   You can use emoji and you can use memes and other non verbal non textual things
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:52.000]   And I find that very exciting but it scares the hell out of people who defined literacy
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.880]   Around the text that they did the rules they knew
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.160]   It's a form of ignorance
[01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.120]   And you know when my kids were growing up, they would always say
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:06.480]   Me and my friends did something. Yeah, and I would always say no no it's your friends and I
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.720]   It just bugged me or but I really hated what people say but between
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.840]   You and I
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:18.640]   Oh, that versus witch drives me crazy. Yeah, have you been a copy of those all kinds of things?
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.560]   But that's just terrible here. That's just we're just that's just terrible. We're terrible people
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.640]   intolerant
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.160]   intolerant
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.200]   Uh
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.560]   You have just posted in uh in our uh irc
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.440]   mr. Uh kevin marks robis shizzes piece the mystery of
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:44.480]   Unico a Unicode character of unknown purpose, which looks like a uh a line graph gone wrong
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:50.240]   Is what it looks like to me where the arrow is off the axis is pointing left and down
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:57.120]   Lightning bolt on the on the right axis. Yes. Yeah right angle with downward zigzag arrow is the unico
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:59.760]   description of it
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:00.960]   uh
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.800]   Do they ever figure out what the with them?
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.480]   Jonathan Chan set out to uncover its mysterious purpose
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.160]   Uh, here's Jonathan Chan's blog
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:13.520]   It's a Unicode two three two three seven c
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:21.200]   And it's the opposite of the the gartner upper right cordon. Yeah. Yeah, it's not a gartner quadrant
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.840]   Anywhere but the gartner quadrant is where things are go wrong. Yeah, uh
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:31.520]   I like those days. Wow. This is a fascinating. Oh, did you read the the Chan article kevin? I don't
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.720]   Yeah, no, I read I think I read that the original article
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:38.640]   Well, I read I saw it through twitter and it's like where did where did this where?
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:45.280]   What is the similar where it come from and it's been copied from like list of symbols and this is symbol so nobody knows actually what it's for it comes from
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:52.000]   It's inherited from the association for font information interchange af II
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.480]   Which has was long dissolved in favor of Unicode over their glyph registry
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.720]   um
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:06.560]   Anybody at the time could register a glyph with the af II for a fee of five to fifty dollars
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:09.120]   Oh, I missed the opportunity
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:17.040]   And then when when unico came along, they just absorbed them even though there was no it was somebody paid five bucks to put it in there
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:23.440]   Well, yeah, unico had a initially unico was like, okay, we've got lots of space now. We're just gonna. We're create everything
[01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.840]   um, and then
[01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:27.840]   It's it's niggas a bit more
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   organized now and you have to make a case for things because there was a
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.200]   Was the interro bang a late addition to Unicode or was it something that came along in that in that clump?
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:40.240]   I'd have to have a look. I mean there's there's you can
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:45.360]   You can go back and look at the history, but I mean there are symbols that look a bit like that for angles and things but
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.000]   um
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.240]   Yeah, but that one was apparently added at some point
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:55.840]   Even though no one ever used it for anything. I'm gonna start putting it in all my text messages and my kids see what they say
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:00.960]   but there's there's also there's there's a there's a there's a siggle um a
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.440]   A magical symbol that looks a bit like it. Ah thinking siggle
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.400]   Which has been um
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:13.600]   As that is is this where it came from did someone put this in as a it could be a magical
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:20.640]   You say siggle. I say sigil you say jeff. I say I say gift. I don't know which is right, but uh, yeah
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:26.320]   Yes sigil are there are lots of mathematical symbols that are very strange. Yeah. Yeah
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.360]   It you know it could well be some you know
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:33.840]   Some Satanists put it in there a long time ago. Yeah
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:38.560]   Did you know yes from the second century to the seventh century?
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:42.960]   All scribal text had no spaces say there's a mistake
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:45.520]   Script right now that yeah
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:46.560]   Yeah
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:51.040]   And it makes no sense until somebody it's one of the books I read said the guy who wrote a whole book about the space
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:55.840]   Uh said that you know if you're a child you don't put spaces in it's just a continuous sound
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.920]   That's why um my like my daughter's when she was in
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.240]   Kindergarten. They actually taught them first to write in cursive
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:10.320]   And they would just her writing was in cursive and it was just all never ending right? Yeah
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:18.720]   Fascinating. Let's take a little break. So now she's like the only what is it 15 year old who knows cursive? Good for her
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:22.160]   Good for her. She can communicate with y'all
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:28.240]   How's her handwriting stacy is typing ruin that or is it held up decently? No, she she has
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:32.560]   I mean her cursive writing is atrocious, but I mean she learned it when she was five
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:35.200]   But her print is fine
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.240]   Hey, at least she learned it. That's all that matters
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.800]   She can read mine
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.560]   All right, let's take a little break. I want to talk to you. Let me show you. I'm so proud of this
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:50.960]   Lisa, you know every morning she says what's your sleep score and I have to say oh 60 50
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.520]   40 let me show you my sleep score
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:59.920]   Today that's uh you see that 90 cheating. No, that's the real day on 93 percent
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:04.720]   And uh, I owe it all to see the name up there my eight sleep
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:09.280]   Magical eight sleep mattress cover the pod
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:15.200]   Pro I first learned about eight sleep from uh, Kevin rose who said have you tried this? I said in it. What is it?
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.800]   He said well
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.000]   So what we had for a long time we had a mattress
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:25.280]   Electric mattress pad that would heat the bed up, but that's it was one direction was heat the bed up
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:29.280]   He said no no no this doesn't heat the bed up it alone. It cools it down
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:36.160]   It can range from in the 50s to in I think the hundreds so has this huge range
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.680]   And it turns out this is
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.080]   Evolutionarily
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:44.080]   What our bodies want?
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:49.760]   So imagine if you will way back when you're sleeping in a log hunt or something
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:53.040]   You go to bed put the fire out. It's warm you get in bed
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.400]   Maybe you use one of those I used to have one of those colonial bed warmers
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.760]   You put the coals in a bronze pan on a stick you you rub it around and you're you get in there nice and toasty cozy
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:07.200]   But over the night it gets cooler and cooler and cooler your sleep gets deeper and deeper and deeper
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:13.840]   And then in the morning you wake up. Well, that's exactly what my eight sleep does actually it has a modern advantage
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:17.520]   It starts warm. It's toasty cools off through the night
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:21.200]   So I sleep deeper and then I've said it to wake me up at 8 a.m
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:26.080]   It gets warm and warms me up and I get it's nice and toasty. I jump out of bed. It is incredible
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:31.040]   Good sleep is the ultimate game changer. It's nature's best medicine
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.680]   Consistent good sleep can reduce the likelihood of serious health issues
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:40.320]   Decrease the risk of heart disease lower your blood pressure
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:47.360]   There's even studies that says it reduces the risk of Alzheimer's and yet so many of us struggle with sleeping well, especially as we get older
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:53.280]   More than 30 percent of american struggle with sleep temperature one of the main causes of poor sleep
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.280]   Well, I could tell you I've got the proof right here
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:58.640]   From from the low 60s to the upper 90s
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:03.200]   I am falling asleep in record time. I love getting in bed. It's cozy
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:07.120]   Fast than I ever have before all thanks to my eight sleep
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.640]   Pott pro cover after kevin told me he
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:15.520]   It was a show with amy web was on she got it. She said she's keeps saying get that pot
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.760]   So I finally got this we got this some months ago
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:23.520]   It there's you can get a mattress from eight sleep, but I think for most of you who have a mattress you love I do
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:31.360]   Uh, the pot pro covers a great solution. It just goes on it pairs dynamic cooling and heating with biometric tracking
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.200]   So let me i'll show you this screen again because this is this is kind of cool
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:42.240]   Uh, it's got autopilot on here and the calibis has calibration complete. It's actually monitoring
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:47.840]   It's monitoring my sleep and it's changing the temperature based on what it observes
[01:15:47.840 --> 01:15:52.800]   So if i'm restless, it it turns the temperature down. So the autopilot is on
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:59.200]   And it's automatically calibrating. Let's see what my sleep was yesterday. Let's say we can go back in time
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.400]   My sleep fitness score
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:05.920]   Uh, let's see 93 was that yesterday
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.120]   Let's get the graphs
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:15.520]   day before 98 look at that day before that 100
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:20.560]   So I have to say I have never felt better
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:25.040]   You can go as cool as 55 degrees as hot as 110 degrees. You get two
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:28.720]   Temperatures so we're you know, Lisa and I are sleeping in a king bed
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.800]   She she likes it a lot hotter than I did last night. She said i'm turning it all the way up
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:34.320]   I'm about 10
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.080]   So really it's gonna be kind of warm. She loves it. She loves it
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.240]   It kind of soothes her muscle aches and stuff
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:44.400]   Uh, I don't like to start so hot and i'm but I have to say
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.360]   As it cools down my sleep gets deep
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:53.040]   The temperature of the cover just east side of the bed based on your sleep stages on it does biometrics
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:59.200]   It also checks the bedroom temperature and reacts intelligently to create the optimal sleeping environment
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:04.240]   Eight and by the way, I I really think so right now it's still cool out
[01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:10.400]   But it's starting to get warm. This will be the thing to have in the hot some of those hot summer nights where you sleep sticky
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:14.560]   It's awful imagine. It's basically air conditioning for your bed
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:19.440]   Eight sleep users on average fall asleep 32 percent faster
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:26.000]   And reduce sleep interruptions by 40 percent overall get a more restful sleep. I've never had a 100 percent sleep score
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.440]   That's amazing
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.440]   With 30 percent more deep sleep
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:36.560]   I know i'm feeling better my body and mind are moving through all the sleep stages the rim the deep sleep
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:41.120]   vital for physical recovery hormone regulation mental clarity
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:48.000]   I love my eight sleep and you're gonna love it too go to eight sleep.com spell it out eight

[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:12.240]   Uh, I admit I was a little skeptical. You remember when I put it on I told the story of putting it on backwards do watch the video
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.360]   They tell you how to put it on
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:20.640]   I just i'm one of those, you know, I just I guess I can do this. I don't need to watch the video. I could clearly see how this works
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.000]   And then was wrong
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.040]   Uh, so watch the video you put it on it doesn't take it takes me an hour to get it all set up
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:31.680]   It it uses water actually what runs water through it's not a water bed
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:38.400]   But it but that conducts better so it uses water and it's just incredible eight sleep dot com slash twig
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:43.520]   Honestly, there's you don't have to wear any sensors cjs asking how to get the biometrics
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:47.760]   It's in the mattress. It's got centers set or in the cover. It's got sensors in the cover
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:53.840]   So you're right on it so it knows your heart rate it is it knows when you're moving and tossing and turning and knows when you get up that kind of thing
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.480]   And it adjusts and i'm not sure there's there's a describe it i'm sure in the app, but
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.440]   It somehow it adjusts and it's great
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:07.840]   It's great. Love it. What does 100% sleep even mean? I don't know, but I just know i've ever gotten there in my life
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:12.400]   It's the first time ever
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:17.600]   Uh, I didn't actually when I went back I had not looked at this so I did not know so i'm
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.280]   You know your heart rate looks really low. Yeah, you must be
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.400]   Yeah, that's yes
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:30.160]   I it's incredible. I i'm a i'm a you noticed that did you you noticed I did yeah
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:33.760]   Seven hours 43 minutes a sleep
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:39.200]   Uh wake up consistency was uh was a little low i'm working on it 99
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:44.080]   Time to fall asleep 14 minutes times to get up five minutes
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.720]   It's uh, it's this thing works. That's all I could say
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.440]   The statistics prove it
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:56.400]   All right, uh, and we go with yeah, you're in a better mood these days. Have you noticed? I'm not
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:01.120]   Maybe it's because i'm not sitting on the saddle with a stick that that has a pull. Yeah, that's
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.880]   Yeah, Kevin
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:07.600]   I got this seat that's supposed to make you like but it's really just like a bicycle seat on a stick
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:13.280]   And so it's extremely uncomfortable. It was the shortest show we ever did ever
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.600]   It was like an hour and a half and if you
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.640]   You know, everyone said well they picked me up and i'm like i can't try to anyway
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:24.560]   Yeah, that's the opposite of an eight sleep for your butt. That's the complete opposite
[01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.680]   Complete opposite don't don't i don't recommend it
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:31.120]   Peggy noonan is still around amazing
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:36.000]   Was she a speechwriter for reagan nixon nixon? Oh
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.800]   Nixon jesus nixon so she's a hundred years old. Hey, hold on. Hold on
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:46.080]   I was reagan that either way might be right. Um, so
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:52.400]   Wall Street journal opinion piece how to protect children from big tech companies
[01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:59.360]   Lawmakers are way out of their depth, but a good place to start would be a simple age limit
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:02.160]   She says if you're under 18
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:09.840]   Get off the internet. Can you believe it? Say if you're under 18 delete their stuff from the internet
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.920]   Don't read the wall street journal
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:14.800]   I was gonna say if you're over 70 get off
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:18.320]   newspaper, but that'll be decent enough
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.000]   And out of congress
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:30.080]   Why can't we put a straight this is really rosanne rosanna dan is it is why can't we put a strict age limit on using social media sites
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:35.440]   You have to be 18 to join tiktok youtube instagram why not you're not allowed to drink it 14
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:39.680]   Driving 12 you can't vote at 15 isn't there public interest here
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:45.040]   Applying such control would empower parents who face all the other kids are allowed with an answer
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:49.440]   Because it's against the law. Yeah, that really stopped us from smoking pot for all those years
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.800]   This is your brain on youtube. Oh wow
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:56.160]   Oh wow, here's a story
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:01.280]   A mother of a large Virginia family who raised her kids closely and would limited a use of social media
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:04.000]   The mother took her children to shop for food
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   The woman at the checkout counter who had been observing the family asked the mother
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.560]   Do you homeschool your kids?
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:15.360]   The mother mother wasn't sure of the spirit of the question but said why yes, I do
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:21.280]   Why do you ask the checkout woman said because they have children's eyes
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:29.040]   Not the thousand yard stare of the young always scrolling on their phones. That's peggy newtons proof
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.200]   Proof people should not be on the internet
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:41.200]   I actually think so again. I'm just gonna go from the limited sample of my child and her friends
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:48.240]   She's been aware of the internet, but she's also we do it. I think we do an okay job talking about
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:56.000]   We've done a good job talking about what it means to post online and we also did a really good job of not posting
[01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:02.800]   Stuff of her online as well. So and we talked about all of that and I feel like she's actually pretty
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:09.120]   She doesn't spend a lot of time on social media and she seems no, I was really worried about
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:11.920]   Henry and video gaming
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:17.200]   Uh, but at the same time I wasn't gonna stop him because his peers did and he was gonna do it when he went over there
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.720]   And I thought this is the culture he's growing up in so i'm gonna let him do it
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:25.600]   He doesn't do it anymore and he didn't do it to access now some kids will of course
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.640]   But but
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:32.240]   I didn't make it a big deal that he couldn't do it. I didn't say limit your hours
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.880]   And he naturally regulated
[01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:39.680]   Uh, of course he's a tiktok star now so his attention span is about this one
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:45.120]   What do you make a living out of it? Maybe that maybe that's not the best example
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.360]   He's got to edit those videos down. Yeah
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:51.200]   Some of those tiktok have some tremendous 30 second tiktok might take him eight hours
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:56.240]   Absolutely to cook and to cut and all that stuff content creation is not for the week
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.560]   Yes
[01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:02.480]   Uh here is pecking newton's understanding of how the internet works by the way case you're
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:05.760]   Okay, I don't know how old how old is she jeff she wrote for rig?
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:09.120]   I think I think I thought about she well she must have been very young when she wrote rig
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:14.480]   She was she was she's 71. So many. Well, she's not that old. She's only five years older than me
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:17.840]   but she sounds like this for some reason so
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:20.880]   So
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:25.440]   I would have to really be careful about my ageism. I'm suddenly realizing this isn't gonna work
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.440]   This is gonna play so well
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:31.120]   Uh, she says all right. This is her and this is her understanding
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.880]   of uh of how a big tech works
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:38.560]   Uh
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:43.360]   The nature of the beast is opaque and fluid. How do you audit an algorithm?
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:48.240]   It's a moving river changing all the time and the algorithms are proprietary
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:52.560]   But constructive regulation must be based on clear information true dad
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:56.000]   Speaking as a child as a young person word
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.360]   I asked a speaker if I was thinking correctly when I imagine algorithms
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.480]   I see them as a series of waves
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:15.840]   Not necessarily in sequence difference in size pushing my small skiff in this direction or that
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:20.000]   It's not a terrible. I mean that's actually not a bad okay
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:24.640]   analogy algorithms are like the waves pushing you along the ocean
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:30.240]   In different. I mean that I mean she's describing basically dark patterns or just patterns sure
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:33.520]   But she was wrong apparently the speaker said no
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:40.400]   The algorithm isn't the wave. It's the water. It's the thing upon which you sail
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:44.720]   To go to a site is to choose to cast off
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:50.160]   She's she's this is all aimed at her group. Uh, who apparently are avid sailors
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.240]   Uh
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:59.200]   They're all wearing it. It's very top ciders and polo shirts and uh, they understand this they understand this and uh, that's
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:03.440]   She's an opinion columnist. You don't go to opinion columnist looking for yeah
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.200]   Yeah
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:11.040]   I don't credibility. Here's the problem. You take kids off the internet until they're 18
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:14.160]   Uh, they are disadvantaged
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:16.320]   If you ask me
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:16.880]   Oh, yeah
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:20.720]   If they're disadvantaged because they'll figure it out, but I I do think
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:28.320]   I do think it's ridiculous to say I mean that it's just a silly idea to lock children off from the internet
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.560]   That's not going to happen. So I mean it's kind of like let's have some faith that our kids
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:40.640]   Yeah, I think people just don't want to have to deal with this. Yeah, this is related to our conversation about uh, linguistics earlier
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:46.240]   Uh, it's very easy for us of a different generation to say well, that's that's no good
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:51.040]   That's not how I grew up go outside and play by the way does your daughter go outside and play?
[01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:54.800]   Um if we push her to
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:57.040]   I
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:03.600]   The other day I was walking around pedaluma and I saw something I almost never see which is about five or six kids outside playing
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:07.200]   And I I thought wow home school
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.680]   Yeah, they must be homeschool
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:14.800]   No, I thought that is weird. You don't see that anymore and that's because you know stranger danger or whatever
[01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.880]   um
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.080]   But I can't judge kids growing up today
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:25.280]   According to the way I grew up because the way I grew up was was repugnant
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:30.480]   To my elders. They didn't want to ask to watch too much tv. I can only watch half an hour a day
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:36.560]   You know, that was ridiculous. I'll never forgive them for an i had a tv in my room. That's why I became a tv critic
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:42.480]   By the way, I had a tv in my room and I never watched it. I had said there's a reason they were outside playing their internet was down
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.200]   I
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.480]   Don't do kids go outside to play anymore. What's it like in the uk
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:59.040]   You schedule play date you schedule play dates you go over. Yeah, I mean we used to send her outside and she goes walking and good for her like she goes two places
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:03.760]   Yeah, yeah, but we also I mean like
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:10.160]   There's not a lot of places you can send your child outside a lot of people feel like and so
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.440]   Well, it used to be you'd go out in the street
[01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:18.640]   And you know play catch. I know I've seen leave it to beber. I get it
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:22.400]   In my day
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:25.200]   You've had little oris canazion, right?
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:29.440]   I don't know the name a free range kids. She wrote. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.360]   No
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:34.480]   No, I don't think maybe Megan did Megan liked to do a lot of that stuff
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:40.800]   Gilbert god freed passed away at the young age of 67 way too young
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.800]   Yeah, very disturbing
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.880]   He had a serious illness
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:50.160]   You remember him of course is the loud math comic, but not many people remember him from this
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:57.760]   Microsoft office before you do it Leo. Do you have a Gilbert god freed boys? I don't really don't go but god freed
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.960]   I just know it's gravelly and shoudy
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:08.160]   That's the closest I can get I haven't worked on it here. Here's the real Gilbert god freed playing
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:10.480]   Microsoft's
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:12.480]   favorite mascot
[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:21.760]   This is actually a flash video Microsoft put out in the 90s when office xp came out
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:23.120]   Why hello there hello?
[01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:29.840]   I'm leveraging real time legacy compliant collaborative micro branding to complete the most important project in my company's history
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:33.680]   As soon as I finish this proposal I it looks like you're lighting a lot
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:36.240]   Do you like help?
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:38.240]   You you little metallic
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:41.280]   You little metallic
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:49.120]   Try rephrasing your query for example print multiple copies of a file will lead to stop
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.960]   Listen
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:57.440]   Next to microsoft bob you are the most annoying thing in computer history. You know bob he's a friend of mine
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:29:59.360]   Get lost
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:03.680]   Didn't you hear this is when microsoft decided to to get rid of
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:08.480]   Clippy, but the best god freed like moment is your toast right here
[01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:12.160]   I'm gonna need you to back out of the cubicle. Oh really?
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:17.600]   Office xp yeah, well, we'll just see about this hey you
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:22.240]   It looks like you're writing your letter wouldn't you like beat it hey you
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:27.600]   anyway
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.360]   Everybody who's who knew gilbert godfrey said he was a very generous sweet
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:37.680]   Guy and spoke with said one nap obituary spoke with a baritone off state. I'm sure he didn't talk like that
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:44.560]   Yeah, same thing with bobcat gold twaty isn't talked that way. It's not unusual. Yeah, it was a character. He was playing
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:47.840]   um and the voice of clippy
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:55.840]   At least in that one promotional at they picked that was that was microsoft produced that yeah because they were get finally
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:58.480]   Getting rid of clippy. Yeah
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:03.440]   And and so they think the most annoying they recognized how hated he was the most annoying
[01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:06.960]   He was hated and it's not much missed
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:15.440]   Uh big tech pouring a lot of money. This is an article I saw today in the Atlantic into carbon removal
[01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:18.960]   This is interesting. This is uh, basically investing
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:23.760]   Google and facebook more than 900 million dollars into a technology that doesn't exist
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:28.800]   With the hopes that if they pour all this money into it that somebody will invent it
[01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:36.000]   Like an nft. It's kind of an nft yesterday an alliance of prominent silicon valley companies google meta
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.640]   Shopify stripe
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:42.720]   announced it's purchasing nine hundred twenty five million dollars in carbon removal
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:45.120]   over the next
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:48.400]   Eight years. That's a huge amount of money
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:53.840]   Uh the the purchases will be made by a new stripe owned company called frontier
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:58.560]   Is the largest ever almost a billion, uh dollars
[01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.440]   Uh, but
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:06.320]   As you may or may not know car carbon removal right now is kind of a pipe dream
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:11.360]   Uh, so there are a lot of carbon removal projects
[01:32:11.360 --> 01:32:16.240]   14 different startups that will be funded by this including carbon built
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:22.080]   Which is trying to sequit trying know at the word to sequester carbon by capturing it in concrete
[01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:28.640]   The future forest company which seeks to accelerate the natural process of rock weathering
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:32.640]   I don't know. Is that me? I don't know. There's a link
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:38.720]   Project vesta which wants to line beaches with a carbon capturing mineral called olivine
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:43.440]   Um, there is there is a kind of a
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:51.120]   Uh, a precedent for this in 2010 the atlantic says a set of donors committed one and a half billion to buy doses
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:55.760]   Vaccine for streptococcus pneumonia before it had been invented
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:02.960]   It's called an advanced market commitment and it spurs in you know if it works the rapid invention and deployment
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:06.560]   Uh of a product in this case a pneumococcal vaccine
[01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:10.240]   Which has since saved 700 000 lives worldwide
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:13.120]   So it worked in that case
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:19.680]   But um, I've I've been writing about carbon sequestration since I was in college working like an internship at business week
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:23.680]   So some of these are like, I'm like, yeah, sure maybe one day
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:26.320]   Um, you know
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:32.160]   They've got a lot of money to spend. This is a big deal. I mean, no, the government's not funding
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.200]   It might be
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:35.920]   I mean, it might be real. Yeah. I mean that we need to do it
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:40.000]   federal budget going into a lot of this stuff and I think
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:47.360]   I mean, would I like a more organized response than like private companies finally deciding that this is what they should do
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000]   Yes, but we don't have that so
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:53.280]   This is different from carbon credits
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:59.200]   Or I guess it could be a kind of carbon credit. I don't know if that qualifies. We buy frances at twit
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.720]   We buy every month
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:06.320]   Carbon credits to offset the carbon we use with our lights and you know all the all the power we use
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:07.760]   um
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:12.800]   From a firm called I can't remember the name of it, but uh, actually I think I have it here
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:15.200]   terra pass
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.560]   Terra pass
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:21.600]   And so I think they do a variety of different projects
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:28.800]   To offset carbon whether it's plant trees, although that's often been
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:34.400]   Carbon credits are a little bit of a scam. Yeah, well, I know there, but I want to do something
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:39.040]   You know, I mean, maybe I should buy you know, maybe I should buy these carbon sequestering
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.760]   Technologies, I don't know
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.600]   I mean
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:48.480]   Who knows how we're gonna get there right? We feel like we at least and I feel like we've got a you know
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:52.960]   This is the least we can do it might be literally quite literally the least we can do
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:58.720]   Um, it's more than plant trees though. They do local projects. They have a large variety of things that they
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:05.120]   They do I picked this one because the uh Yale school of forestry recommended it. I figured well, okay
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.000]   You know, they must they must know
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.720]   Or they must have gotten money to recommend them. No, no, no, no, it wasn't it wasn't in a
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.360]   Context like that. It was actually
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:20.320]   An interview with somebody in the forestry department. They said well, what do you do to keep the world green?
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:21.680]   She said well most of us
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:26.800]   When we travel we'll buy carbon credits from terrapast and they mentioned another company I think
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:30.640]   Um, so hey, these are foresters
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:37.760]   Um, they do uh this company does a lot about it, but it's at the same time. I I understand completely and it's like
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:42.320]   A drop in the bus try it all. Let's try everything. Let's do everything
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:48.880]   Do stuff man. It's why lisa and I drive all our vehicles or we could we could stop doing as much
[01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:52.160]   We could stop buying as much stuff. Well, I agree the best thing
[01:35:52.160 --> 01:35:57.360]   To do would not be to have personal car ownership for instance. That would be a fantastic solution
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:00.000]   but uh
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.760]   Intel has said we're gonna have
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.760]   well sort of
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:10.720]   uh net zero carbon uh by uh, well, let's see 20 20 40 with that
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:18.960]   Is that okay with you? The problem is it does it only affects scope one and two which is raw materials and manufacturing
[01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:24.160]   It is not going to affect scope scope three emissions, which it turns out are the biggest source
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:28.800]   Of carbon pollution footprint of of chip that big pretty bad
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:34.880]   Water depends on what you're measuring. Yeah, there's the water asked but there's a lot a lot of bad chemicals
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:41.440]   Oh, so it's like it takes a lot of mining to make pure silicon as well, right? Yeah
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:48.880]   Uh the chemicals that are integral to intel's process include perfluorocarbons. Those those are not good
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:50.880]   I remember that you have sees
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:54.960]   And other gases that warm the planet thousands of times more than carbon dioxide
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:58.320]   The problem is uh, they they still need to make chips
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:03.120]   And and they don't yet have a way to do it without perfluorocarbons among other things
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:10.880]   We're still waiting on those those what room temperature superconductors. Yeah one day. Yeah. Yeah someday
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:14.160]   That's coming when we get carbon sequestration all all wrapped up. Yeah
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:21.200]   All right. Yeah, let's cheer up. Let's cheer up because finally we have free v
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:25.840]   Amazon is renaming imdb tv, which is way too many letters
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:28.960]   And I didn't even know it existed. I know
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.160]   You know what I threw this in
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:37.920]   Because there is a large contingent of our audience that says you never talk about free tv
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:45.920]   Solutions like to be and pluto and imdb tv. These are ads btv is fun to say by the way. I am dbtv
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:48.880]   I am dbtv. I get rid of that. I am dbtv
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:52.880]   I like the free v though. I don't know free v's got a kind of like
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:56.800]   The whole idea is you get television ad supported television
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:59.680]   Uh over the top over the internet and that's why amazon
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:04.560]   Probably is interested and then they're gonna move it's called a vaud
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.680]   advertising supported video on demand
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:11.360]   They're gonna move a bunch of uh
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:15.200]   Stuff that's done well on an amazon prime over Bosch legacy
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:19.280]   sprung the home design series hollywood house lift
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:27.680]   Okay, so it's another revenue stream for their content. They put on prime video first. So it's like window wing
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000]   That's actually a pretty sad right right
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.280]   Yeah, okay
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:37.600]   Uh amazon hasn't released an active user metric for free v according to tech crunch
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:47.200]   But in may they reported they have 120 million monthly active users across all the ad supported content imdb tv twitch.tv
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:49.600]   live sports
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:52.400]   Uh, so that's a lot 120 million mau's
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:56.240]   ain't bad you know who doesn't have a lot of mau's
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:59.120]   CNN calm or cnn
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.760]   Sorry, not seeing it plus cnn plus
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.360]   They're not doing so hot
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:14.720]   Uh, but yeah, it's not a good suspicious beginning. So, uh, they're saying now 10 million daily active users
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:20.560]   No, that can't be right. Is that right? No, there was 10 000 10 000. That's a difference
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.520]   There is a difference a few extra zeros
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:28.400]   Yeah, 10 000 we actually have more than that
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:32.960]   That's actually what I was thinking. I was like, oh, we've been here
[01:39:32.960 --> 01:39:34.960]   Yeah
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:36.480]   We have a significant
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:43.200]   Significantly more than that 10 000 daily active users. How much are they spent so far? It's a huge 300 million
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.800]   It's like quibi
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:53.040]   Uh, well, but this one I think they're in for the long haul because they realize they they've got to do something right streaming
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:58.960]   Uh, or they've got it. They're they're they're they're now part of the discovery thing
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:40:03.440]   Yeah, they're gonna cut the heck out of it with a new boss
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:05.520]   I bet because it was the old boss's idea
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:10.160]   This is axios's story hundreds of millions of dollars expected to be cut from the original
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:14.560]   Investment total they were going to invest about a billion over the next four years
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:22.480]   Uh, the new company's leadership team has yet to decide the ultimate fate of cnn plus chris licht who is the new boss starts may first
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:25.920]   Uh, is that is that he's replacing?
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:34.880]   Uh, what's his name from zucker zucker from cnn? Okay. Yeah, so zucker was forced out because he was dating a subordinate
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:38.160]   Um
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:43.440]   Hiring has been frozen at warner media for the past six weeks
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:47.120]   There is uh, this is all axios is reporting
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:53.840]   There's a sense of confusion internally as to why cnn did not push back the launch of cnn plus until after the discovery
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:58.640]   merger the other problem i've heard from people saying but it doesn't have live news on it
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:01.200]   Yeah, you can't get cnn
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:06.000]   Yeah, because that was piss off the m the msos the cable companies. Yeah
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:12.560]   There what is that the innovator innovators dilemma right there. Yep in a nutshell. Yeah, yeah, sacy right right
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:14.480]   um
[01:41:14.480 --> 01:41:19.280]   They much they say much of the subscriber opportunity should come from international markets
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:22.640]   So in other words, they don't piss us off the uh, us msos
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.320]   Yeah, but I mean if you don't have news, what is cnn?
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:29.840]   Right. Well, it's a bunch of shows. Yeah
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:33.040]   It's cnn. Yeah, yeah
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:36.000]   Okay
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.960]   It's cable network
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:46.880]   Without news, it's just the cable network in the us yesterday cnn launched on roku one of the largest smart tv companies in the country that might help
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:49.520]   It wasn't on roku. Okay
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:53.120]   Um, but yeah, there's a big there's a lot of flux happening
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.200]   at the top so
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:59.520]   And that's the other a lot of flux happening in trooper in general. Yeah
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.320]   But yeah, but who watches those shows? I know
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:07.360]   Well only 10,000
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:11.040]   I don't know who watches watch this see it in just in general
[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:18.080]   I mean like i mean by the way was in my mind because that's how many subscribers disney plus gotten in its first few months
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:20.800]   10 million so 10,000
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:24.720]   60 bucks a year. Yeah, that's five bucks a month right? Yeah
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:31.520]   Up to 12 daily and weekly shows each day so they do have live but they're more like talking show things
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:35.600]   Interactive q&a's with experts via the interview club
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:38.400]   For free on the ministry. It's a podcast
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:45.760]   On demand original series and films live news coverage
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:51.200]   And that's some reporting so they'll have some kind of have as any of any of you sampled it
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:58.400]   I haven't and I watch CNN every night. I go home and I don't watch news shows. I'll be honest. So I'm not great
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:01.920]   I think i'm sivis. He's gonna be the same trap because now now
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:04.480]   um, rachel meadow
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:09.600]   Is gonna go to monday's only for some limited period by the way until she goes off and does other projects
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:14.400]   Oh that explains it. I tuned in and she was on. I thought what are you doing here? I thought you'd left
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.880]   Not quite okay. She's she's got one foot left in the door
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.760]   It's like it's a slow roll
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:25.040]   Um
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:31.600]   Here's an this is this I hope these aren't your numbers of the week. Did you do the security cost of security corporate?
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:35.680]   No security. I did you to see it in but that's okay. Okay. You still have one. I won't touch it
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:38.160]   Yeah, I won't touch that last one
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:43.360]   So it's apparently I didn't know this mark zucker burgola gets paid a dollar a year
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:48.320]   Okay
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:51.360]   But his security is 27 million dollars
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:57.600]   Of course he doesn't get any of that unless well given the coverage about him. I gotta say oh, it's worth it
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:01.440]   Every penny of it. He's the most expensive
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:04.400]   uh security
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:11.840]   CEO actually his number two shale sandberg's nine million dollars sinner apache I only cost 4.3 million a year

[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:31.920]   Is it a function of location or how much they travel or jeff bazors 1.6 million
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:37.840]   They don't what they don't know he's tough. He's talking about anybody. He could protect himself
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:41.600]   He wears Jarvis

[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:03.440]   um
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:06.160]   That includes a private aircraft of course
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:12.480]   So let's see
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:16.080]   the filing attributed the higher cost to purse regular personal travel
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:18.720]   covid-19 protocols and
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:22.160]   Uh the increased expense for security personnel
[01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:28.080]   I wonder if it was because he did that thing around the country was that last year? No, that was two years ago, but yeah
[01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:34.480]   This is up over over that now Stacy. Yeah everything two years ago. Life was two years ago
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:40.400]   It's coming back. I bet you I bet you elon's got some pretty
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:41.920]   hefty
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:47.920]   Security although he's got a lot of children. He's got eight kids. Hey, yeah, and he doesn't have a home
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:55.440]   He's homeless. He's not homeless. He's living in somebody's mansion in Austin couch surfing does not count
[01:45:55.440 --> 01:45:58.880]   Okay, the person does a home live there
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:01.840]   Oh, the whole city where his spaceship's on
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:08.960]   That's true in boca chica. He probably has a rather large bachelor pad and boca chica
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:13.760]   I mean he's still sleeping on the floor of his factory sale. Come on
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:18.080]   That's why he's not so
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:20.480]   Oh, we should I should hustle this along
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:24.240]   We gotta do the change log and all that stuff. We're not even close to done
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:30.720]   You know, I have so much fun talking with you guys. I we only we rarely get through all of our stories

[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.680]   What we chose

[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:40.320]   Stacey growl

[01:46:58.080 --> 01:47:01.520]   I did I did all my birthday stuff. I went on a hike over the weekend. Nice
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:04.320]   So because yesterday it snowed
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:11.600]   What? Jesus, I know I was like hello. It is snowing. It's like snow. That's a uh, elana smore set song, right?
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.600]   It's like snow on your birthday
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:18.560]   I'm pretty sure it was rain on your wedding day. Okay, then close. Thank you. Thanks elana
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:24.400]   Let's do
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.400]   The google change log
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:31.120]   Kevin, this is where I pretend to care about things googles up to
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:36.720]   We haven't had a lot of googles. Yeah, they made me do this google quietly launches
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:43.200]   It's a weighted switch to android app for iOS. Have you been awaiting this? I don't know how
[01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:48.720]   Uh, it it promises waited a decade. Yeah
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:53.280]   Yeah, apples had a switch to iOS forever on android
[01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:58.880]   Uh, the app promises right you can write suffer friend right apple when you should be on. Oh, there you go
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:03.680]   That's a good point. I wonder how they got this past uh past apple
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:09.680]   The uh, worry about antitrust. Oh, yeah, you know what that's exactly what this is
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:11.680]   That's why finally
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:16.640]   It promises to make the transition between mobile platforms easier to manage. You know what the number one feature
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:23.520]   It instructs users how to turn off apples iMessage so that you can get text messages on your android device
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:27.840]   It's not easy kids
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.760]   Uh, not easy at all
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:32.000]   I
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:37.120]   There was a switch to android website, but it doesn't mention the app and the company has not officially
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:41.280]   Announced the app so I think they're trying to sneak in under apples radar
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:45.040]   Don't tell anybody
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:50.400]   Uh, here's a a gallery of images for you just
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:54.160]   Just to make you I don't know what desire this
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:57.600]   I you know people do this all the time. I guess right
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:03.120]   Switch to android. I could google is prepared. This is some guy talking mostly
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:09.120]   All right, that's enough. I don't care about you google phy has dropped its prices. Yay
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:14.640]   I'm a phy customer on my pixel six for unlimited plans. It's adding more data
[01:49:14.640 --> 01:49:17.280]   uh mobile plans
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:23.280]   Now let's see the simply unlimited plan has gone from $60 to $50 per line
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:27.440]   $40 for two lines $25 for three per line
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:30.000]   $20 per month for four lines
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:35.600]   That includes 35 gigs of high speed data, which is a big increase over the former 22 gigs
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:38.640]   And includes five gigs of hot spot tethering
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:42.720]   I I think google finds a good a good deal
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:50.240]   It is I keep pausing mine because I used it for international, but the fact that you can is another reason to use it, right? Yeah, yeah
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:59.520]   Um, you do of course you get throttle if you go past 35 gigabytes, but uh, google says only 1% of phy users every hit 35 gigabytes a month
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:03.840]   And you can even then buy more at $10 a gigabyte
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:06.640]   so um nice
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:11.040]   Nice if you're a phy a phy user
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:16.000]   a phy fan phy phy pho fum
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:20.400]   Google now let's you search for things you can't describe
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:31.360]   I laughed at this, but I was also like well. Yeah, that is what I need so sure. Yeah, I found this thing in a drawer
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:37.840]   What is it? Yeah, I'm trying to remember that book I read three years ago with the lady in the the dinosaur
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:40.960]   What was it? What something that looks like um?
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:43.440]   Yeah
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:48.320]   It's kind of that way like the example that the verge gives is you like this dress, but you want it in green
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:54.720]   So yeah, that happens, right? And then you there's a like there are dresses like that dress
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:57.200]   But in green
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:00.240]   it's a google lens features sort of too you can uh
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:04.320]   She's so she's she's taking a picture of a notebook
[01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:08.160]   That has nice leaves on it and she's searching for
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.560]   Wallpaper
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:12.720]   Drapes could I live around that notebook?
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:18.880]   That's kind of interesting or like I would type a house. I want that I want my house to look like that
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:23.360]   So this is an interesting addition to search. These are AI models. I guess
[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:28.480]   That have to oh did we talk about uh dolly dolly too dolly
[01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:33.040]   Dolly put on the link to dolly there last week. I tried it, but that that make I can't find it
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:36.160]   We'll get there. You can actually do it. That's not a change log. Please. Let's stick to the
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:42.640]   Sorry, sorry, sorry. Oh my bad. Please. Let me do it. Yeah, that's a compliment to this, isn't it?
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:46.240]   Yeah, it's the side talk is what makes it so exciting
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:50.720]   Google no really is actually
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:55.280]   Google joins him. It's definitely not your delivery. It's not my delivery. Ho ho
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:59.840]   Google joins Samsung and working with iFixit on a self repair program
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:08.800]   You repair your own phones? I have my pixel uh for I told you that I got an iFixit battery and
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:12.240]   spudger and all that and do it myself just just for the experience
[01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:16.160]   That's the sci-fi
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:19.360]   board board voice. I read a whole article on this
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:23.120]   uh that apparently it's taking over in sci-fi
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:28.880]   This uh this kind of like you this voice like at the beginning of her
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:37.280]   uh the way uh walking phoenix is kind of down is is a way of expressing that you're in a dystopia
[01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:45.120]   They use as an example uh the voice the google change log aka the twig dystopia
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:47.360]   dystopian yeah you know you're in a dystopia
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:51.360]   When you hear my voice and I'm
[01:52:54.560 --> 01:53:00.560]   the latest android 12 qpr3 beta includes a fix for dirty pipe
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:07.520]   on pixel 6 dirty pipe is an exploit that you probably will never encounter
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:12.400]   that gives an attacker full control of any linux based device including chrome books and android
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:12.880]   phones
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:19.920]   um you have to have a fairly recent version of the gert well it's kind of interesting
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:23.520]   you have to have a recent enough version of linux kernel to be subject to it
[01:53:23.520 --> 01:53:25.840]   but not the most recent which is fixed
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:33.040]   unfortunately uh the pixel 6 and the s22 from samson are vulnerable so fixes are going out
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:36.640]   they spent some time talking about this yesterday on all about android
[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:44.000]   samson says they patched the dirty pipe uh in the galaxy s22 in the april update i just checked
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.480]   this morning just now in fact right before the show i i do not have the april update yet so
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:54.000]   come on and get me hackers my dirty pipes are open
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.800]   and that's the google change log
[01:53:58.800 --> 01:54:09.360]   dali this is from open ai d a double l dash e2 what is dali
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:17.760]   we just did the entire change log yeah sorry i got what she was doing it dali
[01:54:17.760 --> 01:54:22.960]   you complain about my voice but you're not listening i was looking i was making i was making
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:31.920]   corgis and top hats um on dali i hope yes so dali can make realistic edits to existing images
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:38.480]   from a natural language caption so is that what you were doing yes so you give it an idea of
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:42.880]   something you would like to see and it makes it so you know corgis and top half i tried last week
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:48.960]   to do squirrels fighting and it didn't work what did it give you now i want to do squirrels fighting
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:54.800]   weird weird shapes i should have saved it i absolutely so here's the girl with the pearl earring
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:58.800]   uh i don't know it doesn't say what what they did to
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:05.440]   it's just it's just dali just changed it to a different girl with the pearl earring yeah it's a
[01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:11.200]   it's in the style of the girl with the pro style of veneer here's the here's the here's the kiss
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:15.920]   good stuff climped famous painting and here's somebody else kissing it looks like an
[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:22.240]   sleeping bag uh here's a bunch of ratatouille style rats and here's some more
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:29.600]   oh look at an afternoon in the park with george still pointless but the trees now are apple trees
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:36.640]   and instead of dogs they're pigs with muzzles so that's fascinating so that's so that's one of the
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:44.400]   things it does is it just takes images and modifies them uh you could you could text description create
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:49.840]   like if you write an astronaut writing a horse in a photorealistic style you'd get this
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:56.480]   if you say teddy bears mixing sparkling chemicals as mad scientist as a 1990s saturday morning cartoon
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:01.680]   well that's pretty good but these are that's why it's fun these are all the examples so where do i
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:08.160]   get to do it you have to turn it down oh yeah that they had it up in the story of a lot of people are
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:14.880]   playing with notes down they put it on a wait list uh but you can see a lot of people's efforts with it
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:21.120]   and they're they're super fun yeah polar bear with a base guitar uh kind of a mandrian painting
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:29.920]   it's all e2 this is their video i guess i mean it's it's basically you know with like gpt gpt
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:38.400]   gpt yeah it was so it's a general it's sort of a general ai taking a dog and making it a cute cat
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:43.760]   that's pretty good i don't trust these examples though
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:50.560]   here that's why i did it it was really it was like the way that they they show me pick the good ones but
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:55.680]   like all of these things yeah yeah by the text writing ones as well okay well if one of you gets
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:57:03.440]   into the uh the you know the trial let me know so we can play with it that'd be fun here go to let
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:12.480]   me see if this will give you something um okay go to this one here copy where do you want me to
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:18.880]   stick this link put it in the chat room i rc yeah i rc all right doo doo da da da da da da
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:27.600]   less wrong dot com less wrong playing with dolly devor who got access to this
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:31.840]   he said just uh golden doodle puppy in play position that's pretty good
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:37.760]   i don't know what you i don't know what the purpose of it is oh there's something wrong with that one
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:43.760]   yeah but i mean it never this never existed right this isn't clip art this never existed
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:50.160]   right so in a sense kittens you could illustrate your blog post perfectly
[01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:59.280]   or you could create really weird stuff um moral panic about deep fakes uh counting down 10
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:05.760]   nine feet oh and then you can add to it so you could say in a surrealistic style
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:10.560]   oh that's interesting yeah see so you like if you scroll through all these dogs playing
[01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:18.240]   dogs playing poker by rinwar in the style of rinwar not really that doesn't look like a rinwar
[01:58:18.240 --> 01:58:25.680]   especially with the doggo wearing a trench coat in a heroic pose through digital art nice i mean
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:31.600]   i didn't know i wanted to see that but here's a poem about the singularity written in a seraph
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:34.480]   font stiny snitty griffy
[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:40.240]   i don't think it looks more like text than a lot of these things look like text so that's what it's
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:48.080]   yeah a poem about the singularity in the back wall of a gymnasium interesting well i like the idea
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:55.840]   i can't wait to play with it i mean yeah it's it's just it's a good way to explore and people have
[01:58:55.840 --> 01:59:00.960]   already been exploring like a ceo and it shows only white men or a nurse and it shows only asian
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:08.800]   women right you know so there but it's it's a good way to show like where our biases are oh look at
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:11.120]   oh this is the one you like heroic potato
[01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:14.480]   yeah that's good
[01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:21.120]   uh combined this with wolfram alpha you could get some interesting uh
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:27.120]   effects this is interesting i like this i'd like to play with it you know what it's just a matter
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:31.360]   time before this becomes better and better and better i would look see here's here's stock art
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:35.360]   hello world printed on a computer screen yeah my favorite is hellward
[01:59:38.480 --> 01:59:40.800]   the new the new hello world look at that
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:50.240]   so he's which is nice uh in this blog post at less wrong.com he's putting a whole bunch of the
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:53.840]   images that generate it instead of cherry picking the one that's that's great right
[01:59:53.840 --> 02:00:00.720]   right and that's what gpt always has been you know you if you ask it to write some prose you pick
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:06.720]   you know one out of twenty samples oh this is cool and outback australian landscape with t-rex
[02:00:06.720 --> 02:00:12.400]   dinosaurs being chased by ducklings these are better than every single nft i've seen i know
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:19.600]   i know that is what you take on uh web three kevin i i really like to know
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:23.760]   let's have a look can we brew a cup of tea for this i feel like we've got to sit down
[02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:27.760]   get some tea this is good sit down well i can give you the short version of it i mean it basically
[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:34.000]   is not the web so go away um it's that's good i like it the web doesn't have version numbers um
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:41.920]   web two was a was a um a mistake or rather uh it was a it was a sort of marketing thing
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:46.400]   web three is we turn and break the web we're trying to make the web not the web we're trying
[02:00:46.400 --> 02:00:51.600]   to turn it into some weird financial nonsense and it's all hand waving there's nothing that
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:57.280]   there's no there there and it's basically dixon and coa a 16z trying to bump and dump things
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:05.440]   and yeah like this nft vending machine in the manhattan financial district
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:11.440]   the prices of nft's range from five dollars to four to twenty dollars you put in money and
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:18.960]   nothing comes out you get a qr code to scan is uh actually something apparently does come out
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:22.880]   well this is like quite atm's and never give you any money they just take it
[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:27.200]   yeah i'd rather go to my burger what a good design is that right that's a great design
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:32.320]   they give you a qr code you scan it now with the bitcoin is in your wallet though right in syria
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:40.880]   but they've got the dollars yep okay good that's my take on it too thank you the web three the
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:44.880]   web three is not the web three is going great to start to read about it which i'm sure we've already
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:51.200]   covered right yeah yeah i mean it's andres and horris horowitz's attempt to you know make money
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:56.640]   that's their job i don't blame them yeah yeah no it's basically speed running financial crises
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:04.000]   oh that's a good bomo like that here we go there's our new title i'll tell you what
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.760]   kevin's better than uh dolly
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:14.080]   kevin is artificial pop in a coin give him a concept epigram
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:20.640]   craig new mark has put 50 million dollars into complete this sentence
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:30.000]   chavis chav chavas no no no no no no sibil cyber civil cyber secure cyber civil defense
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:39.040]   yeah he's worried yeah what is it so what is so uh he's going to focus on expanding cyber
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:44.400]   security education and literacy this is all through aspen institutes aspen digital program
[02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:49.120]   opening career opportunities in the cyber security field in an inclusive manner there are certainly
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:53.600]   plenty of career opportunities right now in that field and developing security tools and
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:59.440]   services for protecting individuals and small businesses it's kind of a vague uh portfolio but
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:05.840]   okay is aspen institute good i mean uh will they yeah it's also it's run by a friend of ours a
[02:03:05.840 --> 02:03:11.280]   new viviancial or the digital piece is run by a friend of his and mine named viviancial it feels
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:16.560]   so fancy though like how are you gonna get the right people there the aspen institute yeah well
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:23.120]   they do the do ski don't you stay safe well i've i've done it i've done aspen
[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:33.600]   i've done aspen well so even the dogs get facelifts and aspen for that but whatever whatever you do
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:36.800]   in aspen do not if you're a dog
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:45.440]   hang around a rumba here it is it finally happened ladies and gentlemen i give you
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:54.320]   the vacuum that eight buddies tail i watched that ten times you did really jeff did you put this

[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:04.800]   was like any other like doesn't there no are you serious and i don't put things in there at all so
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:11.920]   you knew it was me uh then you must have also put in audiobook narrators as a tik-tok thing this is
[02:04:11.920 --> 02:04:17.920]   interesting i thought uh ten audiobook narrators you need to follow on
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:22.640]   oh on tik-tok see i know a lot of these guys because i listen to audiobooks religiously
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:29.360]   so they all do something different getting back audio corrections the mistake says you said
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:36.560]   bluish instead of blush you know what i probably did let's see
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:42.960]   i nod my head as some of the bluish dissipates
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:52.400]   that's really good that's Kelsey d Navarro okay uh here's Cindy k uh i don't know if i could play
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:57.840]   this one she's narrated the empress of salt and fortune the mermaid from jju and scattered all
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:02.400]   over the earth there's another bloopa does bit bad words bad words okay we'll skip that one michael
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:07.280]   lee i've listened to some of her books actually lisa has the red palace mark of the empress
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:15.680]   snow roses today's narrator trip up is i arrived at an abandoned encampment
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:22.080]   can you say it in one try i arrived at an abandoned encampment it's not easy i don't add an
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:26.080]   add an abandoned yeah they give me stuff like that all the time yeah
[02:05:26.080 --> 02:05:31.440]   Chelsea Stevens narrator Chelsea on the tik-tok she's done uh cathar and and porter's pale horse
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:36.560]   pale writer Montessori the science behind the genius and many other books here starting new
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:42.880]   audiobook get coffee get cozy get reading i'm gonna look up any words i'm not sure of any accents
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:47.200]   any pronunciation this is more like a language how she does it so i can ensure correct pronunciation
[02:05:47.200 --> 02:05:53.520]   then when i'm all done with that i'm gonna get water and lots of water and vodka and even more water
[02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:57.680]   well she just she doesn't go to a studio she doesn't hope yeah i imagine a lot of people do
[02:05:57.680 --> 02:06:02.080]   that's a lot of water when it's time to record i'm gonna grab my most inspirational cup
[02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:11.200]   get some lovely tea and then get see these tiktoks they get too long now natalie nautis
[02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:18.000]   uh i know 30 seconds and i would have just barely i don't only women who do is it mostly women who
[02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:23.040]   do audiobook no but apparently that's mostly women who do audio narration on tiktok tiktok
[02:06:23.040 --> 02:06:27.760]   today i just don't know audiobook narrator who's got a nice voice absolutely nobody
[02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:32.000]   nice it is day four million of winter break it feels like my children are never going back to school
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:38.320]   i get them outside i do some stretching aka contemplate existence for a little bit drink some tea i like
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:43.120]   her voice she has a voice she's pretty chilly outside the barn cat has come into warm her toes
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:49.200]   is she lives up i would listen to her books here's a guy ronnie butler jr he's narrated
[02:06:49.200 --> 02:06:55.520]   peng shepherds the cartographers how long till black future months and rebound let's listen
[02:06:56.320 --> 02:07:01.440]   all the while her inner muscles had clenched him okay we can't do that that's pornographic
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:08.560]   i was not prepared for that i was like i've i've read how much one future
[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:15.120]   i don't think that's from black future months i don't think so i give it a listen to one right now
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:18.800]   where whatever because because one of the hard things for audiobook is when you get a quote but
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:23.600]   you don't say quote how you signal that it's a quote yeah usually just a little i'm doing like
[02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:31.280]   dubbing god free well the one i must do now goes into a higher level whisper and then back down
[02:07:31.280 --> 02:07:37.040]   yes then a higher level the real challenge is when it's male readers doing female voices is yes
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:45.840]   yes sometimes comedic yes yes okay i've returned audiobooks which audiobooks you do
[02:07:45.840 --> 02:07:51.440]   couple if you don't like the reader if the reader if it's like a book about germany and they can't
[02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:58.240]   pronounce any German drives me back yeah that's sorry john and i'm ready oh i hear that all the time
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:03.200]   do you say now kevin marx you're probably an authority on this i'm going to ask you kludge
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:10.400]   as in you know a kind of ugly programming trope what how do you pronounce that um i i'm not sure
[02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:14.240]   because i i think it's one of those words i read before i've heard anyone say it so i would have
[02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:21.280]   said cludge yeah i think it is cluji it's cluji yeah i've always said cluji and then uh i listen
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:28.080]   to one of my favorite readers uh doing uh microcosm which is one of my favorite books about the
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:35.840]   technology revolution and he called it a cludge no no no no i thought hmm maybe that's uh maybe
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:41.280]   that's a british pronunciation that's why i didn't know i think it's riffle through things but apparently
[02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:46.960]   that's how thing like audiobooks have been like an iopter riffle not rifle riffle riffle it's called
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:52.880]   to us i read i have two lives it's riffle like riffle ball it's not a wifle ball
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:58.640]   i just you know you can rifle through things too that that's a that's a sort of parallel meaning
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:03.760]   i've heard rifle but is that the same meaning as riffle now that's more like sort of
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:09.520]   more violent somehow like yeah you know rifle if you're rifling through somebody's
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:15.520]   belongings you're kind of throwing them around rifling is like flip flipping the pages
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:21.760]   here's grammar girl by the way who has rifle versus rifle yes they don't mean the same thing
[02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:29.360]   yeah okay so there you go i recommend two audiobooks to you real quick yeah so how to be perfect
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:37.200]   that's by the creator of i could have written that uh michael sure the creator of the good place oh
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:42.480]   it's fun okay it's it's it's it's it's and then allow me to return a black guy's guy to the
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:47.200]   constitution by alie nistal you have to listen to the audiobook version of it it's he's he's on a
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:52.240]   listen to you all the time he's yes i saw him talking about that and i was put that on my list to uh to
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:56.560]   be listening to it's it's it's it's amazing how to be perfect the correct answer to every

[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:25.200]   extra stuff we are going to be debuting some uh club only shows soon uh some things i think
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:29.600]   you'll be very excited about it club because uh you know when you're launching show you don't
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:34.000]   it's not big enough to get advertising so we're kind of you you do it as a law law sometimes for
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:39.520]   years the club gives us the opportunity to do that without the law so we put it in the club only
[02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:42.960]   we can grow these shows that's what happened to this week in space we did i think five or six
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:48.800]   episodes and then put it out for public consumption so the club really is has been great as a
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:54.400]   experimental spot as a social group uh i just i'm couldn't be happier with it if you want to join
[02:18:54.400 --> 02:18:59.200]   it seven bucks a month it's nothing it's month to month cancel anytime if you're not happy i go to
[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:07.360]   twitta tv slash club twitt let me just like google phy just like google phy except you don't have to

[02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:16.000]   because lisa would not wear this stuff either but and stay see uh i would be aware of it wear of it
[02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:25.680]   because i i know it's because i like fashion um so you follow me i kind of try to i follow fashion
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:32.400]   information i guess yeah this stuffs look at this this dress is eleven dollars

[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:50.640]   it's not free uh three ninety nine and there's free if you order forty nine dollars so it's free
[02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:54.640]   probably because everybody's are gonna order them and you can get a mommy and me dressed to match for
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:58.960]   only seven dollars i don't think anybody who's buying these close-ass children do they
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:03.280]   oh i bet they do well look at this woman has gray hair
[02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:13.920]   she's 28 but she's got gray hair she probably dies at gray come to think of it look at it yeah yeah
[02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:19.920]   it's a very hot color it's like it's like a man wearing a number people die their hair gray oh yeah
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:26.400]   super well actually i should admit it i do too uh
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:35.440]   wow wow uh let's get a so that's your pick a hundred your number is a hundred billion dollars
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:41.360]   i'm just fascinated i've never heard of me isn't it wow and it's this phenomenon and and and so
[02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:46.160]   when you think that the internet everybody sees all the same stuff this is a huge company
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:53.040]   an old front like me never saw it well it's a huge company because young women love it and
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:58.800]   you know doing well tend to mock and not pay attention to what young except for those of us
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:07.760]   with our fingers on the pulse of tiktok or not not sweeping fast enough that's not
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:13.440]   yeah that's why you see it right by it right ladies and gentlemen i give you the wonderful
[02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:18.240]   Italian and kevin marks when did you when were you when when did you first appear on our shows
[02:29:18.240 --> 02:29:25.040]   you've been part of our family for a long long time wow back yeah um we're i wish to get you on
[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:32.400]   more i just love having you on i met you kevin in 2008 wow there we go yeah that sounds but that
[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:37.120]   sounds plausible that's about right yeah yeah yeah that's probably when he started appearing on
[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:41.440]   our show how did you know that yeah off the top of your head because i i met him he was one of the
[02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:45.200]   first people i met after i joined giga and i joined giga in 2008
[02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:51.600]   ah so and i remember because then you came to san francisco and i was like great let's just
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:56.480]   let's check yeah yeah and i was like oh my god i'm eating kevin marks yes i was the same
[02:29:56.480 --> 02:30:03.120]   it was it was kind of kevin has worked every week uh he's worked at apple he's uh we've interviewed
[02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:09.040]   him on triangulation back in 2011 that was but i think we would had john even on the day that
[02:30:09.040 --> 02:30:15.920]   steve jobs are right yeah oh that's we were talking to you when that happened yep oh wow
[02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:21.120]   november 30th 2011 you're absolutely right i remember we had to interrupt the show but fortunately
[02:30:21.120 --> 02:30:28.080]   you had it having worked at apple you had lots to say too uh oh wow i forgot about that yeah
[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:34.800]   wow so what's your pick of the week this week um so this is a sign that i've been
[02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:42.560]   um i looked at and i now look at it all the time it's the electricity map um and what it shows you is
[02:30:42.560 --> 02:30:48.160]   um effectively you click on an electricity organization you can california that'll be like
[02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:54.400]   green so if you click on it it gives you information about what is generating electricity and also
[02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:58.080]   how it changes over the day and over the night oh this is great if you if you if you scroll up the
[02:30:58.080 --> 02:31:03.840]   left hand side a bit you can see a um yeah a graph of when it's when it's when it's green when it's
[02:31:03.840 --> 02:31:09.840]   brown yeah you just click on somewhere very brown when you yeah that's turlock but if i go back to our
[02:31:09.840 --> 02:31:13.280]   area the california independent system operator yeah so you can see it's green at the moment because
[02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:18.960]   you've got a lot of orange sun there right um and but there's a bit of there's a lot of purple
[02:31:18.960 --> 02:31:23.760]   gas that takes over at night and so it goes brown at brown right night interesting fun
[02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:28.640]   and it's and it's great and the other thing if you look in you can look around the world and see
[02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:35.440]   europe and different um countries as well so look how green kebek is holy cow yeah so the
[02:31:35.440 --> 02:31:40.000]   northern ones of their rest of the all hydrophiles they got oh yeah yeah yeah really good and then the
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:46.720]   there's uk very green no no sorry uk is sort of muddy brown muddy brown i was that was confused by
[02:31:46.720 --> 02:31:51.360]   Scandinavia Scandinavia is really green because it's it is mostly hydro with with some geothermal
[02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:59.440]   of things yeah the uk is let down my gas um yes we can't really do solar um we can do a lot of wind
[02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:06.880]   um but we we fill in with gas and we and our nuclear has been declining so but and france is
[02:32:06.880 --> 02:32:11.200]   extremely nuclear that's for it's very green so but it's the fascinating thing is you do see the
[02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:14.400]   difference conversation with different countries and how basically the natural experiments what's
[02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:19.520]   going on so yeah that's basically france is more than half nuclear whereas germany is
[02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:25.360]   they've decommissioned almost all their nuclear yes because they're fools and they've they're
[02:32:25.360 --> 02:32:30.560]   mining more coal and potent is very cold and they're using more russian gas yeah interesting
[02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:35.760]   yeah interesting but anyways this is this is one of those you know i'm paying attention to
[02:32:35.760 --> 02:32:40.960]   environment and electricity and this is this is just it's very interesting to look at it and
[02:32:40.960 --> 02:32:45.120]   look at it over time and look at it every day so it's just something like pay attention to so i was
[02:32:46.080 --> 02:32:53.520]   i really like this electricity map.org very interesting and it shows you where the power
[02:32:53.520 --> 02:32:59.200]   comes from it shows you carbon intensity over time um it also shows you flows if you click on one
[02:32:59.200 --> 02:33:04.800]   of the if there's if they're feeding power to other areas you can see arrows between them as well yeah
[02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:10.480]   really interesting oh this is fascinating thank you yeah no this is this one of these things you
[02:33:10.480 --> 02:33:14.560]   just keep i just keep looking at it but as we talk more about the energy stuff and things about that
[02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:19.120]   you look at that and you start to think about it yeah my my reaction to it was looking at it was
[02:33:19.120 --> 02:33:25.120]   yeah it's great to get you know sail is great if you're in the right part of the world wind is
[02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:29.840]   great if you're in the right part of the world like the uk is but the challenge is what you do when
[02:33:29.840 --> 02:33:35.120]   it's it's dark or the wind's not blowing and the thing that actually would make sense there is
[02:33:35.120 --> 02:33:40.960]   pump-tide rope which the uk does a bit of but if you if you if you it's it was designed to do
[02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:46.240]   intraday smoothing um it was originally designed to move um because you run coal and nuclear powers
[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:50.400]   for blast it was designed to you you pump the water uphill at night and then never out during the day
[02:33:50.400 --> 02:33:56.800]   um but if you scale that up um and pump the water with the solar in the in the wind when you have
[02:33:56.800 --> 02:34:00.800]   it and then use the water when they're not there you could use a lot less gas because the moment
[02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:05.360]   everyone is basically burning gas to to fit in all the gaps between the variability of everything
[02:34:05.360 --> 02:34:13.200]   else fascinating and you see the difference between the you know eastern south america and western
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:18.320]   south america and i guess that's governmental policy uh primarily it's fascinating yeah
[02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:25.920]   and yeah i mean you see australia is like just all coal oh nah nasty oh actually not in south
[02:34:25.920 --> 02:34:33.440]   there you know just uh just south australia but it's yeah and tasmania's doing great good on you tasmania
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:38.800]   tasmania is hydro again yeah but it but you know it really is you see the the boundary between the
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:44.160]   different organizations and and what they what the choices they've made yeah yeah fascinating
[02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:53.040]   so i i'll electricity map.org and of course we want to promote indie web and the hombre website uh
[02:34:53.040 --> 02:34:59.280]   trying to save the web one page at a time oh this this is this is another thing this is a little
[02:34:59.280 --> 02:35:03.520]   bonus one this is something something made this this week it's basically um it gives you a random
[02:35:03.520 --> 02:35:08.080]   indie web page oh nice put on a button and you get an information it's stumble upon for the indie
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:15.040]   web yep i like it you'll probably get something about programming there we go a lot of geeks yeah
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:20.800]   but it's that's quite fun is it a web ring will i find another button at the bottom no it needs
[02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:26.000]   to be a web ring oh we know it uses the we've got an indie web ring it uses that as well oh okay
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:32.960]   that's cool that's really cool so random um blog posts what makes you an indie web blog
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:39.600]   um we've we've only got a loose definition basically if you if you have if it's you own your
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:43.760]   own side right um we've got a set of things that you can add to it we've got all these different
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:49.040]   protocols like web mentioned and uh micro carbon so on that that make it easier for you but the
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:52.960]   basic thing is have your own website right there's lots of ways to do that and we're not you know
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:57.920]   we're a catholic about that or agnostic about that depending which way you want to look at it um
[02:35:57.920 --> 02:36:03.040]   we will because there's lots of ways to do it but the point is if it's if it's a website that you
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:07.040]   you have control over that's important it's i mean that makes sense and if you're looking for a
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:13.680]   group of people who are working uh along these lines the uh homebrew website club which is on the
[02:36:13.680 --> 02:36:21.040]   indie web.org page has its meetings next meeting tonight in about an hour yeah in the Los Angeles
[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:26.480]   time zone but it's it's virtual so everybody could go right yeah yeah yeah very nice yeah no I mean
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:31.120]   we we we used to them in person basically would have them in person um San Francisco and Portland and
[02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:36.800]   and London and Brighton and so on and now we've been doing them online with time zone grouping
[02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:41.120]   for a while now it's a great community lots of really neat interesting people like Kevin
[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:47.200]   um big big supporter and i i'm going to throw in your third link which you've put kind of hit away
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:51.680]   but i think it's great web3 is going great.com which is sarcasm
[02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:58.480]   it is a collection of articles about all the horrible things happening
[02:36:58.480 --> 02:37:07.040]   in crypto NFTs and web3 yeah yeah especially this this camera that I round up scammer the day yep
