[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.560]   This week in Google, the show that covers the Google
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.840]   verse, the cloud verse, and any other stuff
[00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.680]   we want to talk about, including Glee.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.720]   And here she is, our chief clique, Gina Tarpani.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.040]   What's up?
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.120]   From smartawear.org.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.160]   I'm high for marching and dancing session.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.760]   You're just fortunate that Jeff and I
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.400]   happen to share your passion.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.680]   I am very fortunate.
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.560]   Because otherwise we just be going, oh, come on.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.040]   I know.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.520]   I'm so high-loved being with men who are not
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.640]   eye-rolly about my show.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.400]   Your passions.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.600]   I love the show tunes.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.680]   Yeah, well, I love the view.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.560]   So there.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.920]   Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.760]   He is with Buzzmachine.com, and Blogger in the--
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.240]   Maybe it's cold outside.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.840]   Oh, it's cold.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.080]   And all of you.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.000]   We, you and I should do it.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.800]   Maybe it's cold outside.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.320]   I love it.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.760]   You can do like a tab versus iPad duet.
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.560]   Like the unboxing, the musical version of the unboxing,
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.880]   or the reboxing.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.280]   See, we need to hire a promo director that would do this
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.680]   kind of stuff and say, OK, we're going to get Jeff.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.240]   We're going to get you.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.160]   And then does all the work.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.360]   Because I don't want to do the work.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.920]   Jeff's book, What Would Google Do We?
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.800]   Is she the tab?
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.320]   Huh?
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.680]   Sorry.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.040]   Is she in the tab?
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.080]   Have I seen the tab?
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.000]   No, finishing the tab.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.400]   I never mind.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.240]   It was a sondheim joke.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.680]   Never mind.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.080]   Oh, or too far.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.960]   You live in New York.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.200]   I just hear out in California.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.800]   We don't have any culture out here.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.640]   I thought you were talking about the Galaxy tab, which
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.200]   I have seen.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.800]   And I like a lot.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   In fact, I was really prepared to think
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.880]   that the Android tablets were going to-- because Google
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.760]   kind of lowered the expectation, didn't they?
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.920]   When they said, oh, no, 2.2 is not a tablet OS.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.560]   Waitel 2.3, gingerbread.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.640]   And now actually they say, now waitel, honeycomb 3.0.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.320]   I would disagree heartily.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.040]   The tab, which is a seven inch display.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.240]   And Steve Jobs said nobody wants seven, is great.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.160]   Because it's smaller than the iPad, a little more portable.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.920]   And great boy, Galaxy tab, the Samsung screen,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.680]   is not an AMOLED screen, but it's the best LCD I've ever seen
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.880]   much better than the iPad.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.080]   I'm sure it's similar technology, but I really
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.880]   think they did a nice job.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.160]   Very bright, very crisp.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.400]   And this was the issue.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.320]   I think a lot of people said, oh, no, the apps don't scale
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.000]   properly.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.520]   I've run into very few apps that don't scale.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.040]   Angry Birds looks great on it.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.360]   It's just the right size for Angry Birds.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.440]   It must be a really good Angry Birds player.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.360]   That's for sure.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.320]   Well, that's all we need.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.280]   I don't know what else you would want.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.440]   So do buttons and tabs and things just sort of expand to fill?
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.440]   And it looks exactly.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.160]   And do they lose the designers in the room?
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.520]   I'm going to say they lose clarity or crispness
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.400]   in the expansion?
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.400]   Those guys already hate the way Android looks.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.640]   Look, guys, they're not even looking at the--
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.720]   We've lost the Groobers of the world a long time ago.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.080]   Annie and Naco said--
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.960]   he said on a Mac break weekly yesterday,
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.000]   Android looks like they just threw all the elements out
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.040]   onto the table and they just are kind of any--
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.680]   I disagree.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.920]   I think it's very intuitive.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.840]   I don't think it's ugly.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.240]   It's the same thing Mac people used to say about Windows.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.480]   It's not as precious.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.320]   That's good.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.720]   I like it.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.840]   I'll say that to Amy next time.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.720]   A good glee word, yeah.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.640]   It's not as precious.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.440]   It's functional.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.480]   It comes with a swipe keyboard.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.880]   And I think a little more space, it's a lot easier.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.640]   It's not as easy.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.120]   It's not like the iPad where you have almost a full-sized keyboard.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.920]   You can't do touch typing on a new keyboard.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.080]   But you can because it's narrow enough,
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.280]   you can do thumb typing.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.720]   And you can even hold it in one hand almost.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.040]   This is another one.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.880]   This is an Arcos.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.560]   This is the 70 internet tablet.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.240]   This has Android 2.1 on it, I think.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.880]   But I imagine they'll push 2.2 soon.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.120]   Not as good a screen, in my opinion, as the Samsung.
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.920]   Which is new for Arcos.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.200]   It is a capacitance screen.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.640]   They do a lot of resistive screens.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.280]   I think Arcos has done a very nice job as well though.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.120]   And this is cheap, 275 list for a Wi-Fi.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.520]   And this is one of the things, Jeff,
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.440]   I know you really wanted Wi-Fi only.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.400]   Because you don't want to pay--
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.840]   Now I get Wi-Fi only and then I get a Wi-Fi.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.240]   Get the virgin $40 unlimited Wi-Fi.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.480]   Why pay for the carrier penalty?
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.920]   The one thing I was thinking about, though,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.080]   is the T-Mobile one does give you Wi-Fi capability.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.920]   Yes.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.640]   And it's like--
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.280]   And it says the sprint.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.040]   I have the sprint one.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.120]   It also has tether.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.920]   So I get that.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.520]   But then am I really going to haul it--
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.920]   if I need my laptop on, am I going to haul out the tab
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.160]   to turn on the Wi-Fi for my laptop?
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.920]   Versus just having that little tiny Wi-Fi thing.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.080]   Well, I don't know.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.720]   I mean, at 275, this is a Wi-Fi only device.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.080]   It's almost half what the Wi-Fi only iPad is.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.800]   And I think that while I was initially skeptical
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.400]   about the size of the screen, I think it's actually very useful.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.960]   I think you could do a lot of the things you do with the iPad
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.920]   with this.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.880]   Now some of the widgets are-- as you can see,
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.080]   like the Google widget is weird because it's so small.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.440]   Right.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.600]   So it doesn't stretch to the screen.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.040]   It doesn't stretch.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.560]   Although that's possible.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.040]   And really, that's an issue, in my opinion,
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.440]   that's an issue with the desktop, the presentation manager,
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.360]   because I know I use a third party one that
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.920]   allows me to stretch widgets.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.880]   Now is this the pure Android experience?
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.160]   You said this swipe is installed.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.840]   Is there a skin?
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.400]   That looks very much like my Nexus One.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.480]   This is not the same song.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.080]   This is the Rcos.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.200]   And I think the Rcos is-- I don't think Rcos
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.040]   has done any customization.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.480]   But it doesn't have the by Google or the Google stamp,
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.240]   because Google hasn't blessed any tablets yet.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.520]   No by Google.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.200]   Right, right.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.600]   And by Google.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.240]   It also has the buttons down here.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.120]   Look at that.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.240]   Yeah, it's just the right size for Angry Birds.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.480]   I have to say.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.880]   There's the Glee app, Dan, but where's the Glee app?
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.760]   Well, there's an-- there's a Glee app on the iPad.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.400]   There's a Glee app on the iPhone.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.200]   Those bastards.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.840]   I think that-- now this is, again, this is not the Samsung.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.040]   This is the cheaper Rcos that doesn't require a 3G.
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.200]   So this is really-- Rcos is doing some interesting things.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.240]   But I love the Gams stems on Galaxy Tab.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.800]   I have the Sprint one.
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.960]   The Sprint speed is great.
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.000]   It's just weird, because it feels like you should be able to make phone calls.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.520]   I know it's big.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:49.560]   I did.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.280]   It's Sprint.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.600]   But that's just what I got a loaner.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.120]   OK.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.560]   So these are all-- I should say, these are all owners.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.560]   I know people don't like it when I take loaners.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.280]   But I was frankly skeptical.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.320]   I didn't want to buy an Android tablet.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.520]   And now I'm absolutely convinced.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.200]   Now, by the way, the Rcos comes in a lot of form factors.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:09.920]   There is a 10-inch.
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.240]   That was the 7-inch.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.920]   This one is a 4.3-inch.
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:22.720]   This is the same as the Evo or the Droid X. I don't know.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.920]   It's another it is.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.920]   This one, it doesn't seem-- it's not a very-- these are cheaper screens.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.480]   I think that's where they save money.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.480]   But boy, if you want a Wi-Fi Android device, this is the 4-inch screen.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.560]   Now, get ready for this.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.480]   This is basically iPod touch size.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.000]   This is a 3-- I think a 3 and 1/2.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.360]   There's even a smaller one than this.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.520]   Where's the on button?
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.120]   This is one problem with these.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.120]   I never know where to turn them on.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.000]   Maybe there isn't an on button.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.200]   Oh, there it is.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.040]   This is a resistive screen.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.920]   But it looks-- you know, it looks-- by the way, camera looks
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.360]   almost as good as the capacitance screen.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.720]   And I'll tell you, when I started using it,
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.240]   I felt like, well, boy, that's a capacitive screen.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.400]   And he said, no, no.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:08.520]   That's a resistive screen.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.240]   Thanks to Charbacks, by the way, for brandlies all by.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.880]   So does that look so tiny because you just
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.160]   have the 7-inch in your hand?
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.200]   Or is it actually really tiny?
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:15.680]   It's tiny.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.200]   Yeah, OK.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.200]   OK.
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.000]   I'll put the Droid X next to it.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.240]   It's small.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:19.840]   Yeah, OK.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.840]   OK.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.360]   It's an iPod touch competitor, basically.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.960]   But with a full OS on it and a full browser on it
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.480]   and get ready for this, $99.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.520]   No phone, though.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.160]   No phone.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.600]   This is like a touch.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.680]   It's touch, OK.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.240]   But pretty capable.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.960]   These are all ARM-based processors.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.320]   You know, I'm working with somebody on a project
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.640]   that might require handing out devices to somebody
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.840]   when they come into an environment.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.200]   Right.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.720]   You could buy those things in bulk.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.080]   Sure.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.840]   Amazing thing.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.040]   Sure.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.600]   I have to rewind this video.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.000]   See, when it gets this small, you can't--
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.640]   I can't quite--
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.000]   I can rewind it.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.840]   Oh, well.
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.520]   Yeah, for $99.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.120]   Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:10.960]   I don't-- what is that?
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.320]   Is that GPS?
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.320]   Oh, tethering.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:13.960]   Tethering.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.200]   Look at that.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.680]   So you could have USB or Bluetooth tethering, because it
[00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.320]   doesn't need the tether to get the connectivity.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.160]   So anyway, the point is that all these form factors
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.440]   are made possible because it's an open source OS.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:30.640]   And I think choice is great.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.920]   And I think these are all surprisingly capable.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.520]   I like the Galaxy Tab a lot.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.840]   Yeah, those look really interesting.
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.240]   It's interesting they came out so soon.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.680]   I'm being a little bit of a purist.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.320]   I don't want to get an Android tablet until I have Google's
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.840]   blessing of like, yes, this is what the tablet should be.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.600]   I guess that's why I kind of stuck with the Nexus 1, too,
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.720]   is I like to see Google's--
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.680]   You want to pull Google.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.440]   --prescription of what it should be.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.840]   But that's really cool.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.680]   And it's tempting.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.880]   That's how to be playing Angry Birds on that big screen
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.400]   is definitely tempting.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.560]   This is better for Angry Birds even than an iPad.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.720]   I think it's just the right size.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.360]   The iPad might be a little too big.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.880]   It's also $1,69, which means it's appropriate for video
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.320]   in a way that the iPad really isn't.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.800]   Do you travel to New York with the iPad only, right?
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.000]   Not I.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.960]   Andy Ma, somebody did.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.680]   So I'm trying to imagine where this fits in.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.480]   Is this going my briefcase in your pocket?
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.600]   It's a little too big for a pocket, right?
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.760]   I mean, this seems like the ink rub.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.280]   Well, this looks cool.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:27.800]   I can take it in my pocket.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.680]   This is the size of a Kindle.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.680]   Exactly the size of a Kindle.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.800]   So if you put the Kindle software on here,
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.800]   in some ways, it kind of is a Kindle.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.880]   Oh, I bought this on a Kindle on a second.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.640]   Yeah, it's a little more expensive, obviously.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.840]   But it's a lot more capable.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.200]   It's color.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:44.840]   Touch.
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.440]   I would say the tab, if you didn't mind the 3G cost
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:51.040]   or you could find a Wi-Fi tab, would be a very good alternative
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.800]   to a Kindle.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.000]   Yeah, it might just broke, so I gave you an excuse.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.100]   Yeah.
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:56.600]   Honey.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.600]   Honey.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.240]   So now you know why, by the way, Amazon dropped Kindle prices
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.720]   for $230.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.280]   It didn't help me in my cost, I know.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:12.120]   Given the choice, you can only buy one iPad Galaxy tab, which
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.200]   is it?
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.680]   Oh boy, that's tough.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.080]   Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.680]   I think because of the range of software,
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.040]   you're still going to want the iPad.
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:23.040]   But--
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.520]   OK.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.840]   I don't know.
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.640]   It depends what you're doing with it.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.160]   I'm an Android fanboy, as you know.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.760]   I really like the Android OS.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.400]   And I'm baffled by all my Mac and iPhone friends who say,
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.240]   oh, it's just not as elegant.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.040]   It's not as the fit and finisher.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.840]   It's not as good.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.200]   It just doesn't-- to me, this--
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   maybe it is kind of the Windows versus Mac.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.760]   It's the same thing as I said as a Mac user to the Windows
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:53.400]   people.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.400]   Oh, you just wouldn't understand.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.080]   You don't have any taste.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.160]   But to me, this is a--
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.240]   look, if we'd seen this product two years ago,
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.960]   we'd be falling all over ourselves at $2.75,
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.240]   falling all over ourselves.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.680]   I'm talking about the Arkos now.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:18.120]   Yeah, well, that and the fact that you can go get a tiny
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.080]   computer for what now?
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:20.800]   What's the lowest?
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.200]   The $99 box on that little one.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.240]   That's just incredible, a computing power
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.000]   that is now in hands.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.760]   And I think that because these are multi-touch OSs
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.040]   from the get-go, I think that there is a difference
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.280]   between this and a tablet PC or a laptop.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.800]   I mean, these actually--
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.800]   I think this is a mature product at this point.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.440]   And it works pretty well.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.600]   This is the case.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.960]   And those other products try to do this for--
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.840]   I forget the name of it-- for education.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.200]   But every student in this country
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.800]   should have a device like that.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.000]   Yeah, it should be studying.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:59.120]   I'm actually wondering if--
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:01.200]   I mean, this--
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.760]   I wouldn't want to do a lot of word processing,
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.840]   but then I don't want to do word processing on my iPad either.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.400]   I mean, to be honest with you, I'm
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.280]   happier with the MacBook Air because it's
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.120]   got a real keyboard and it's light and it's portable.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.640]   And so that's what I want if I want to do that.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.560]   I don't want an iPad.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.600]   And iPads weigh too much of a compromise for me.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.960]   So maybe an Air and a tab.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.520]   It does feel like--
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.040]   I got to say it ought to have a phone in it.
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.800]   Because then I could eliminate the phone.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.040]   Well, let me just ask.
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.560]   You can't use--
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.240]   You can use Skype.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.520]   A headset and Skype?
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.880]   You can use Skype.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.720]   Presumably, Charbacks is in our chat room, by the way.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.920]   So if you have other questions for him, he's a guy.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.040]   He's from Denmark.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.360]   He was here for the ARM conference
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.200]   and brought all of these Arcos devices.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.640]   Thank you, Charbacks.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.200]   If you were content with Skype or Fring or Google Voice
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.840]   to make your calls, I think it'll work.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.840]   I think it'll work fine.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:59.000]   I think that that's not--
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.040]   Well, I guess--
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:00.800]   would it be an attic?
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.320]   I guess it would.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:05.360]   I mean, Google Voice is what rings on all my devices.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.880]   You have the headset?
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.080]   Yeah, I guess you're right.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.200]   And the thing is, why carry a phone to call with Google Voice
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:13.680]   and the headset?
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.680]   I mean, one of the reasons--
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.400]   One of the reasons I carry the Android X
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.720]   is because it's as big as I can get and still have a--
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.440]   we talked about it, a breast pocket, a phone.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.520]   But I might be willing to.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.000]   Yeah, you wear a blazer, right, Jeff?
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.720]   Usually, yeah.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.160]   If you wear a blazer, this is fine.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.960]   This is a perfect pocket size.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.440]   If you don't wear a blazer, I guess
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.360]   you have to carry a man purse or something.
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:41.160]   Wait, now, you can't receive Google Voice calls just over Wi-Fi
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.840]   yet through the app, right?
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:43.760]   No, you cannot.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.680]   I don't think so.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.360]   OK.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.440]   Yeah, that's the only--
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.040]   Why are you saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.040]   incoming?
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.960]   By the way, in Europe, they have hacked--
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:55.520]   or they actually can get the tab with phone support.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.200]   In Europe, some of the European carriers do it.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.600]   And somebody in the chatroom saying,
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.760]   you can't hack the tab in the US to make it phone to phones.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.760]   Because you have a phone number.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.640]   It's 3G.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.280]   Yeah, it's a little big.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.240]   But you don't do that.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.680]   You put a headset in.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.040]   Yeah, you put a headset in.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.880]   OK.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.440]   That makes sense.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.640]   Well, part of the problem is you're buying a $40--
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.520]   I think what's the $40 maximum account for the tab?
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.240]   You're not putting in the $80 a month--
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.160]   Right.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.600]   --7 for a voice account.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.440]   That's right.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:30.920]   How long before we do everything over VoIP?
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.880]   We don't need to carry.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.560]   We don't need to sell carry.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.720]   We just need bandwidth.
[00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.240]   Then these devices, take your pick of the size
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.040]   you happen to like, are kind of everything you need, right?
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.000]   We're there now.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.440]   And then--
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.240]   We're very close.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.200]   So the next thing you want-- I spoke to a bunch of phone
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.400]   executives, and I begged them to have
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.240]   an account with multiple sims.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.400]   One account, multiple sims.
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.480]   So when I go into my car, there's a sim in the car.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.160]   That's my phone.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.600]   When I'm home, there may be a sim in the network.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.360]   That's my phone.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.040]   When I'm out with a phone, I don't care.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.840]   That's how Google Voice is meant to operate.
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.920]   The problem now, of course, is that they're forcing us
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.040]   to buy five accounts.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:09.040]   And that's--
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.560]   You know, I can see them saying that's nice wall of the last,
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.360]   but it makes no sense.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.240]   Eventually, they've got to-- maybe not.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:15.640]   Who knows?
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.160]   I mean, who knows what these guys.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.760]   But you would think eventually they'd
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:22.880]   have to give in a consumer demand.
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.360]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.720]   We're talking about Google, the Google,
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.240]   with Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.440]   We thank our sponsors who make this show possible,
[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.040]   including the folks at Carbonite.
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.520]   If you're going to go to the cloud,
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.880]   you should consider backup in the cloud, too.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.080]   A lot of people are use Google Docs for backup,
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.200]   because you can upload files.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.040]   But it's onesie-tuzzie.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.320]   It's not automatic.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.200]   Think of Carbonite as doing that automatically.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.880]   $55 a year for unlimited data, all the personal data
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.040]   on your internal drive, and the ability to restore it
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.640]   anywhere you can log in, including a free iPhone app,
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.560]   a free BlackBerry app.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.560]   Now you're getting an idea what Carbonite is.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.840]   Carbonite is backup done right.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.960]   It's just awesome.
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.480]   I want to encourage everybody who
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:05.960]   listens to this show to give it a try.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.560]   You're already kind of in the cloud, I'm sure.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.680]   So Carbonite just makes a lot of sense.
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.600]   It's perfect for something like this MacBook Air.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.920]   Immediately put Carbonite on it.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.200]   So now, any time I'm online, even if it's
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.440]   at an insecure hotspot at the local cafe,
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.920]   because it's using 128-bit SSL, it's completely secure.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.640]   Backing up all the time doesn't tie up my computer
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.560]   or my bandwidth only when I'm not using it.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.720]   And boom, everything is safe and secure
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.160]   and available for restore or download
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.920]   anywhere I can get online.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:34.960]   Just a few clicks of the mouse.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.800]   Mac or PC, $55 a year.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.480]   But I can tell you how you can get it cheaper.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.680]   You could try it for two weeks free.
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.480]   If you go to carbonite.com, use the offer code twig.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.920]   And I do like you to try the free trial of all our products.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.840]   It's one of the reasons we make a big point of it.
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.720]   All our sponsors have free trials.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:52.600]   Well, except Ford.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.280]   Actually, Ford does.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.440]   You can test drive, right?
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.320]   So even Ford, they don't give you it for a month.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.040]   But you get on.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.080]   And the reason is, I think really,
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.480]   this is our advertisers and our way of recognizing
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.560]   you're smart.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:06.920]   We don't have to trick you into this.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.520]   Just try it.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.280]   See what you think.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.040]   If you don't like it, no problem.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:10.960]   No harm, no foul.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.960]   But if you do, now you know this is what it does.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.000]   This is how it works.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.200]   So try it free, please.
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.160]   Carbonite.com offer code twig.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.720]   If you-- no credit card needed or anything.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.760]   If you decide to sign up, do use the offer code twig
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.960]   when you sign up for two months off.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.480]   They're already low.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.520]   55 bucks a year.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.600]   Carbonite.com.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.720]   You got it back and up to get it back.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.280]   So do it right with carbonite.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.480]   So Google got through.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.440]   Did you see this?
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.240]   The iTunes store, Google Voice for the iPhone.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.720]   Yeah, speaking of, Google Voice.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.360]   They did it.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:42.040]   And it's great.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:42.520]   I used it.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.320]   It does everything.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.120]   When you make a call with it, it calls a Google number.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.680]   Like a weird 916--
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.000]   first I thought, wait a minute.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.400]   That's not-- I freaked out.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.120]   I said, what are you calling?
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:52.680]   Stop.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.880]   I don't know them.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.160]   And then I realized it called the 916 number.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.480]   Using--
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.360]   But then routes you.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.400]   And then routes you to the other call.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.200]   Using your cell phone minutes.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:00.480]   Yes.
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.080]   So this is probably why it's OK, right?
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.880]   Yeah, well, I mean, the Google Voice app
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.240]   uses your minutes on Android devices too.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.320]   But the Voice app on Android devices
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.920]   kind of masks that intermediary number right now.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.600]   It didn't used to.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.320]   But in the beginning, it is a little confusing.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.800]   And for a while, I was using Google Voice.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.720]   And I had two numbers.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:22.800]   I had people's Google Voice number, which is that unknown 916.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.760]   And then their actual number.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.480]   And that gets a little confusing.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.880]   So it sounds like-- I haven't tried the iPhone app,
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.120]   but it sounds like it's pretty good.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:29.840]   It's complete.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.960]   It's feature complete.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.000]   But I heard that it doesn't synchronize the inbox.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.560]   And then it doesn't quite integrate with the dialer
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.200]   exactly the same way it does in Android.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.400]   But it sounds--
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.680]   besides that, it sounds really good.
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:41.560]   I didn't know what that meant.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.480]   Synchronize the inbox.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.320]   Well, the inbox gets updated and downloaded.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.040]   Maybe-- well, I have that problem on Android too.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.160]   I'll delete something from the inbox on Android.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.800]   And then it comes back and gets it again and puts it back.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.920]   Have you ever had that happen?
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.400]   Interesting.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.640]   That might just be a bug in Google Voice.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.880]   Yes, so I'm looking at-- I think
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.800]   it was Google operating system said--
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.040]   Google Voice or iPhone doesn't beat the Android app,
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.880]   because it doesn't integrate with the standard phone app.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:04.800]   It doesn't integrate.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.280]   Right.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:05.800]   Yeah, right.
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.200]   Doesn't synchronize the inbox, and doesn't offer advanced options
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.920]   for notifications.
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:10.400]   Right.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.240]   I don't know when it's not.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.800]   But that's not the limitation of the iPhone.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.320]   Right.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.680]   And that's an iPhone limitation, yeah.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.480]   Sucky notifications on the iPhone.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.600]   And it doesn't integrate.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.440]   Of course, Apple would never let it replace the visual voicemail
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.040]   that AT&T provides.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.320]   But that's one of the reasons I use an Android phone
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.400]   is the tight integration.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.360]   I thought there was something interesting here.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:29.680]   This is the Google Voice.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.840]   And Google made-- the screenshots that Google included.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.240]   I think this is a little slap to Apple.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.800]   The date of them?
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.400]   July 6, 2009.
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.800]   That's how long we've been waiting for acceptance.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.840]   They didn't update those.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:44.320]   They thought we--
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.320]   From John Lately.
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.520]   Oh, I didn't notice that.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.760]   John made that problem with your coincidence.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.880]   Oh, I don't think so.
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.320]   I bet there's other stuff in here, too.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.480]   That's interesting.
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.800]   Well, there's one thing Google has.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.600]   It's a sense of humor.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.200]   So it wouldn't put it past it.
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:03.920]   Yeah, not at all.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.080]   Anyway, that's good news.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.400]   There may be some features.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.520]   Apparently notifications are supported in some of the third
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.720]   party Google Voice apps.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.240]   So maybe there are some reasons to take a look at those.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.320]   But the official Google Voice is out free for the iPhone.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.000]   Hallelujah.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.800]   Google Voice is awesome.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.280]   I love it.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.400]   I use it all the time.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.480]   I really love it.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.400]   I text from my computer a lot more now.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.200]   It's trained me.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.360]   I text with people while I'm at my desk.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.720]   I live in Gmail now because my phone's there.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.960]   My SMS, I use the SMS extension.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.200]   Chat's there.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.200]   It's like your--
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.200]   Yeah, it's a thing.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.200]   --so it is Zuckerberg going to lure you away.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   Wow, so that's interesting.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.200]   Yeah, that's a question.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.480]   What do you guys think?
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.960]   The new Facebook messaging--
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.640]   and they're very clear not to say email-- messaging system.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.320]   I got a question first.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.800]   Does this mean that it's another place that people I don't
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.960]   want to hear from can bother me?
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.160]   Yes.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.160]   Yes.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.000]   No, but in theory, I guess it's kind of like priority inbox
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   in the sense that there will be an inbox that's just your
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.440]   friends and then there's everybody else.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.440]   That's what it sounds like.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.680]   It sounds like the people who are super active on Facebook and
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.720]   who have a lot of interactions.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.800]   So Facebook can figure out whose most important to you.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.120]   We'll have the best experience with this.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.000]   The negative of it is that it's going to mix every-- there's
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.640]   no subject.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.560]   So it threads everything from one person as if it all came
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.560]   the same way.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:27.000]   So there's IAMs mixed in with messages mixed in with chat.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.280]   It's all-- or whatever it is that-- you know, it's all mixed
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.280]   together.
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.920]   It's all around people on topics.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.800]   Right.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.760]   Which is the Facebook way to look at it, right?
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.120]   Do you think Facebook wants to replace email or thinks this
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:39.920]   is an adjunct?
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.520]   No, I think-- let's go back to, oh, dare I say it, wave.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.880]   Oh.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.120]   I knew this was going to happen.
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.800]   I'm sad.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:54.280]   I think for all these guys, C is that email is broken horribly
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.760]   and not fixable.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.400]   And so they're trying to figure out what's next.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.000]   So wave was one effort to do that on a collaborative basis.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.880]   This is a way to do it on a social basis.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.240]   As communication, why is it so broken?
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.720]   Forget spam for a minute.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.520]   Even with-- I think I said this on the show last week.
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.480]   I die for the busy signal.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.480]   I die for something that says, Jeff's busy, you can't talk
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.000]   to him now.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   And instead, everybody thinks that, oh, all I need is three
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.520]   minutes.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.360]   Why the hell didn't you respond to me, you bozo?
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.360]   I just needed three minutes.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.600]   It's OK.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.800]   And that's what our world is now, is everybody's getting a piece
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.880]   of you, and you can't escape.
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.880]   You sound like an old man more and more.
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.400]   I do.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.520]   You get a piece of me.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.560]   Did you ever remember what Andy Rooney--
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.560]   I'm right there with you, though.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.080]   I really wish that I could have just a global do not disturb
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.000]   sign every once in a while.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.880]   Especially when I'm coding or writing.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.920]   I'm with Jeff.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.080]   I have a full rant about this.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.600]   I just ignore him.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.200]   But--
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.160]   I'm at that point, too.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.640]   Fred Wilson put a post up that said that he only responds to you
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.800]   if you end up in the priority inbox.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.560]   And I realize--
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.080]   That's a bad thing to say.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:05.480]   I don't know.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:05.760]   It is.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.280]   Because I said Fred and me, I'll invite him to come as he
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.920]   comes once a year to my class.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.120]   But I don't bother Fred, because I know Fred doesn't like it.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.640]   That means that I'm now under-prioritized.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.680]   If I'd been bugging Fred and he sent me email back saying,
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.080]   bug off, I'd be higher up in his email.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.240]   Right.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.880]   I get disincented from leaving him alone.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.320]   Yeah, but all he has to do is mark
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.400]   who's important once.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.440]   I have those people who know that I just
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.880]   get inundated with email and send me
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.920]   a one good important email every once in a while.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:38.480]   And you just have to be like, OK, that's important.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.000]   So he's still got to be training it a little more.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.120]   But I agree.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.600]   I mean--
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.240]   Well, he's an Addery.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.200]   He can't stand me and hates me and doesn't want to talk to me.
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.320]   And that's OK, Fred.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:47.820]   Why?
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:49.760]   It's funny, because we've been trying to get Fred on, too.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.800]   I guess we're probably in that box with you.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.480]   We're not in priority inbox either.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.360]   The thing that we've tried to solve was group emails.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.040]   It was like that horrible thing that happens
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.760]   when you have 10 people replying to all and branching off
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:03.960]   in different threads.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.480]   Facebook messaging is about, I want
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.240]   to see the first message when I ask my significant other
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.960]   out at a date all the way up to the point where I'm telling her,
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.840]   I got to go pick up the kids at soccer today.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.880]   This idea of having this entire record of history
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.360]   between two people, which is interesting.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.880]   It's interesting.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.400]   And I kind of feel me about it.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.520]   I'm probably not going to use it.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.440]   My family members who still use their AOL email addresses
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.160]   and who are very active on Facebook probably will use it.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.320]   It makes a lot of sense for the platform, I think.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.800]   But I just don't trust Facebook to respect
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.600]   that archive of communications for me
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.640]   to give it all up to them.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.920]   But you do trust Google?
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.080]   I guess in some way-- yeah, I mean, I guess in some ways,
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.880]   I feel a little suspicious of Google the more
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.840]   that they know about me.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.160]   And we'll talk about later with one of their launches this week.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.640]   But yeah, the products are so compelling and so good
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.640]   that, yeah, I guess I have sort of decided to trust Google.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.040]   You started buying dresses on boutique.com?
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.960]   No, I don't want to take away Leo's tool all the week.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.440]   Boutique.com, is that a new Google--
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.440]   Oh, yes.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.840]   You haven't seen it.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.760]   Deal.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.720]   Google started boutique.com.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.440]   There's no Google branding on it anywhere.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.120]   It's basically a search around fashion, celebrity, and taste.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:24.520]   And so you go on and you go to Anna Pakwin's page.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.440]   Is this it?
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.000]   Is this it?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.240]   This looks like a farm bill.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:27.840]   No, that's not it.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.840]   No, no, no, that's not it.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.720]   Did I spell boutique wrong?
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.800]   It's plural.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.600]   Boutiques.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.280]   Teaks.com.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:33.800]   Oh, sorry.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.040]   Boutiques.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.560]   So Anna Pakwin tells them-- if you scroll down,
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.400]   you'll see Anna's page.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.120]   I like Anna because I like--
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:41.920]   She's great.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:42.280]   Succini.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.440]   Delete your thoughts.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:43.880]   Succini.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.360]   Succini.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.240]   No, true blood and glee.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.960]   Different ends of the same spectrum.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:49.960]   Indeed.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.600]   One blood and death, the other shows.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.440]   Where does walking dead fit in that?
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.520]   I don't know.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.960]   So Anna tells them what she likes.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:02.040]   And then Google comes back and says, well, if she likes this,
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.520]   and you like that, you'll like this.
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.040]   And it recommends all kinds of things.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.320]   And it abstracts her what forms she like,
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.280]   what colors she likes, and she likes on the platform.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.360]   So I can follow her.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:12.960]   You can follow her.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.960]   I can follow her.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.800]   And so this is an entirely--
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   I smell Marissa Meyer on this.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   So she's got--
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.760]   But now when I log in, it's because it's not a Google property.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.160]   It's not going to create a new account.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.160]   There's not a Google--
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   There's not a Google brand on it anywhere.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:28.680]   You can't find it.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.600]   I mean, they did take credit for it on the blog.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.480]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.560]   Why wouldn't they use the Google login?
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.840]   It's very weird.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.880]   I mean, you feel like you're shopping at Macy's.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.960]   Like, this is what-- it looks like the Macy's website.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.840]   There's no Google brand anywhere.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.040]   Are they really?
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.160]   Do they have guy stuff?
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:43.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.480]   Nope.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.720]   It's just women.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.480]   Yeah, this is for the ladies who are into fashion.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.680]   Well, I'm into fashion.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.600]   I can tell you.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.000]   Oh, I can tell.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.720]   I think I'm going to follow Jennifer.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:00.360]   And Debbie Maiser, I don't know.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:01.360]   This is interesting.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.680]   It's all movie stars.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.840]   Nobody on there from Glee, huh?
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.000]   Not that I can see.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.800]   Jennifer Goodman is on--
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.880]   I like her a lot.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.440]   I like her a lot, too.
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.920]   Carrie Mulligan.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.600]   This is kind of a weird launch, but this came out of the I Like
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.440]   acquisition.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.080]   I like the--
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:22.920]   Like.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.040]   Like.com.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.160]   Right, which helps you kind of algorithmically associate
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.960]   patterns and colors and things.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.760]   I am a fashion idiot, so I don't know what's going on here.
[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.040]   The three of us use grandimals to match our word robes.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:41.160]   I was like, what t-shirt should I wear today?
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.560]   You know, before the show.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.040]   I used to work a conda to ask.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.240]   I keep the episodes.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:46.800]   There you go.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.920]   This, I would guess, is what we're seeing here is--
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.120]   in fact, I think Eric Schmidt alluded to this at Web 2.0
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.080]   or somewhere recently.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.960]   We're not really doing Google Me, like an all-in-one Facebook
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.600]   site.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.600]   We're just going to put social everywhere.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.080]   Right?
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.200]   That's what they're doing, right?
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.880]   So here, by the way, you can have your own boutique.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.160]   You can go on, make your boutique.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.920]   It's social shopping.
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.840]   T-shirts that you don't like because they found what you like.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.120]   I will fill it with binky t-shirts.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.040]   But this is brilliant because--
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.280]   but what really I find most interesting
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.240]   is that Google did not attach to it.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.320]   And I can only think that's because they think it would
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.560]   scare people off.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.280]   It's also inappropriate for the brand, right?
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:27.440]   It's just a top-wave brand inappropriate.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.480]   Oh, I'm not going to buy--
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.400]   I'm not going to go boutique shopping with geeks.
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.360]   Right.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.000]   And it shows you that Google knows how they're perceived,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.160]   I guess.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.080]   They're not perceived as a fashion-like brand.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.120]   I mean, look at it another way.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.440]   Shouldn't Apple have done this?
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.080]   But would Apple-- I think Apple would have the same problem.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.520]   I don't think Apple would want to brand it either.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.120]   No, I get what makes this work is number one search
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.520]   and understanding how to abstract concepts to make search
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:56.720]   work.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.080]   And then number two, you're right, Leo.
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.360]   They're adding in the dash, the soup sole of social.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:02.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.600]   Following, and you can create your own thing.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.280]   They've got popular.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.120]   So these are the popular ones.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:11.880]   And here's the other interesting thing to me.
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.320]   I was at this meeting a week ago about the US Postal Service
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:16.160]   I mentioned.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.400]   And there was an expert there from the catalog world.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.440]   And as we were talking, she asked people,
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.560]   what does this mean for catalogs?
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.280]   And I realized that the function that a catalog provides
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.080]   of curation is no longer necessary in that form,
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.600]   where they have a warehouse filled with stuff,
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.520]   and they go buy it and merchandise it.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.000]   Because I can now use Best Buy as an API.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.920]   Do you know this, Leo?
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.720]   No.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:40.240]   You could create tomorrow.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.680]   I could see Trit Store on top of Best Buy's back end
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.320]   and fulfillment.
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:48.040]   I don't know that.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:48.960]   That's interesting.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.760]   Isn't that cool?
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.160]   So Leo is not letting you do that, too.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:51.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.040]   I'm just sharing these boots with my wife.
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:53.400]   Because--
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.480]   Oh, you have to log in to share.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:01.600]   I got to create an account.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.840]   Well, she wanted boots like this.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.840]   She's been looking for--
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.600]   Such a good husband.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.320]   Oh, honey.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.080]   Well, actually--
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:09.920]   Awesome.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.200]   Curious.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.000]   She won't know the Google Connect or anything.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.120]   I'm going to watch carefully her reaction to this.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:16.920]   Like, does she like this?
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.000]   Does she get it?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.840]   Would she, for instance, get her friends
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:24.000]   and create followers and do all of that?
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.560]   So you can imagine the exact same thing with home decoration.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:27.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.600]   Window treatments, though.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.120]   Oh.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.120]   Oh.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.120]   Oh.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.120]   Oh.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.120]   Oh.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.200]   You know, tile and other home building stuff furniture.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.760]   And anything with taste.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.520]   So what this means is can Google get into taste
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.840]   and his social and search the path there.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.880]   And then on the economic side, what it means
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:52.360]   is that it's exactly like media.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.320]   And eventually entertainment is you skip by the old curators,
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:59.440]   the old channels, the store.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.240]   And now Anna Paclin has a store and a store
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.080]   from 100 different brands and designers.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   Right.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.160]   And the only thing that I didn't look at enough,
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.760]   I doubt you could probably do one checkout.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.760]   Oh.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.680]   Oh, well, that would be nice if you could do that.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.000]   And of course, there's revenue opportunity.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.720]   But maybe they don't want to even bother with that.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.720]   Well, because I know what I helped start,
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.320]   believe it or not, style.com.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.280]   You did?
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.120]   Yes.
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:25.440]   That's good.
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.440]   My wife doesn't know that.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:26.960]   You can tell.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.800]   Of course I would.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.480]   So here, somebody in the chatroom pointed this out.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.520]   This is kind of interesting.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.640]   The only way you could figure out
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.600]   there's Google in this anywhere.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:39.280]   It doesn't say it at the bottom or anything.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:39.760]   You could.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.600]   I bet if you went to a bat, let's see if about us.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.440]   No Google there.
[00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.640]   But if you go to the help, it pulls you to a help page.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.280]   It says copyright 2010.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.840]   What's a Python file?
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.840]   You get a Python help file.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.840]   Woo hoo.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.840]   Help that pie.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.240]   Help that pie.
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.360]   Oh, that is aesthetic whiplash, isn't it?
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.560]   Ow.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.720]   Don't ask us for help, man.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.440]   There goes the soup soil style.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.160]   This is it.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.680]   Topic top pie.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.840]   This is really bad.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:12.760]   OK.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.040]   Well, Marissa, you could work on that.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.520]   I'm sure you'll meet.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:17.080]   Very busy.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:17.880]   It's interesting, though.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.720]   I mean, they really, even in the about us,
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:22.000]   it doesn't show Google.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.360]   Honestly, Marissa would be a perfect kind of spokesperson.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:24.920]   Here you go.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.920]   But that's our thing.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.360]   Terms-- no, no, no.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:28.240]   It's a personal thing.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.320]   She's in the fashion.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.600]   Always, she ever is a dresser.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.680]   She's beautiful, inexpensively.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.840]   Boutiques.com is operated by Google, Incorporated.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.520]   So you can, but you got a dig.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.040]   I don't think that's obvious at all.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.520]   You know, it's all kinds of interesting things, not
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.200]   to jump around here.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:45.080]   But Amazon did a thing today where they basically
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:51.600]   become kind of a movie packager where you can submit
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.960]   your movies to Amazon.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.040]   Amazon will have kind of a contest.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.680]   Then Amazon has a year and a half, first refusal
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:34:59.120]   rights, to take it to Warner Brothers.
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:00.320]   Really?
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:03.520]   Yeah, so you just see all these opportunities now
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.720]   where you cut out all the old little--
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.220]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.440]   What happened in newspapers is going
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.040]   to happen to every other middleman out there.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.400]   Right.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:13.680]   So you think everyone's going to have our kind of personal stores?
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.840]   Like, Leo and I think are one of the most popular people
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:20.520]   on appbrain.com, which is an Android app kind of curation,
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.120]   I think just because we mentioned it on the show,
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.480]   kind of when it was early.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.320]   And Mozilla is building into--
[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:28.560]   they're building kind of an app store, web app store,
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:30.520]   where people can kind of set up-- like, life hacker could set up
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.520]   like a list of recommended web apps.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.960]   It sounds like this is kind of the same thing.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:35.840]   But just--
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.760]   Here's the best story, Gina, that I can give you.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.960]   I talked to Philip Kaplan from Blippi--
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:42.960]   Pud.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.960]   A Pud.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.880]   And he told the story-- and maybe he
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.560]   told it on the show before, if so I apologize.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:53.400]   But Pud said that Matt Cuts came in and bought that scale
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.560]   that you have, Leo, that--
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.640]   Well, Matt Bodders first.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.520]   He gets credit.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.560]   But he gave Matt credit for the takeoff for the hockey stick.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.160]   And so that within a very short amount of time
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.200]   after Matt bought it, sorry, he did mention you, Leo,
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.160]   and said you didn't cause the virality.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.480]   100 people bought the scale.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:11.320]   Right.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:11.640]   So now--
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.120]   I sold a few of them.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.440]   Maybe he didn't know through Blippi.
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.320]   You'd be bitter.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.200]   But if you look on Twitter, there's
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:23.840]   a few scales that I might have inspired.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.840]   That's fine.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.320]   I don't need credit for some weight loss.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.320]   That's all I'm fad.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.320]   Scale for me.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:38.400]   Blippi-- I think Blippi is not going to take off.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.680]   I think it's something that, whether Blippi takes off or not,
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.440]   I think that Pud is on to something really important.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:50.040]   And he went to the next level of what B can want it to be
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.160]   and what, in a sense, Google's trying to do now.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:55.120]   There is truly social shopping.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.000]   So for people who don't know, it's kind of a Twitter--
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.800]   it's a Twitter where your credit card is doing the tweeting.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.040]   Or your Amazon, your Apple, iTunes account, your eBay.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.200]   So you sign up and you attach your accounts.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.640]   And I've been posting here without even knowing,
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.160]   frankly, because it's all automatic.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.000]   Really?
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:13.960]   Oh.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:16.520]   Oh, see, I just bought Google Voice.
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:19.640]   So I could say, yes, I recommend that.
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.160]   And there you go.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.240]   And I could publish that.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:29.920]   You tie Blippi into the Best Buy API, say.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.040]   And you can have a store going without even having
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.400]   to merchandise it.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.920]   What you buy, you are recommending to others.
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.560]   And others will say, oh, I'll buy that too.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.040]   And you get a cut of that.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.560]   Yeah, that would be nice.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.240]   There's a company I invested in called CoVestr by a guy
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.240]   named-- they're wonderfully named Ricky Tata.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.160]   Isn't that a great name?
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.920]   Yes.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.800]   So Ricky--
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.600]   You know Ricky Tata and his nickname is Tots?
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.320]   No, I just said Tots because of Glee.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:37:59.840]   Oh, OK.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:01.840]   Good to tell you.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.320]   Sorry, sorry.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.160]   There's a Glee connection to everything.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.680]   We're going to have to have a Glee bring down.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.240]   In fact, our next story, there's a Glee connection.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.320]   But go ahead.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:13.480]   So what this does is that if you're a good investor, Gina,
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:14.960]   you can go on to CoVestr.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.600]   And again, full disclosure is not invested,
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.800]   but it's a friend of mine.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.280]   And you'll do whatever you want to do.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.840]   He set up the structure so that I can put my money at my broker
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.360]   and it just follows you.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.800]   It does whatever you do.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.120]   And because of that, you make a cut.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.000]   That my money never-- you never touch my money, actually.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.280]   But you make money from basically becoming
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.960]   a one-woman mutual fund.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.360]   Well, that's just a pyramid marketing, right?
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.680]   No, it's not because what's happening there
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.720]   is that Gina never touches any of my actual funds.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.160]   Are they stay in Schwab or whatever?
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.200]   I'm following her.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   I'm literally following her.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.880]   So when she buys Google, I buy Google.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.240]   When she sells Google, I sell Google.
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.120]   And I don't have to do a thing.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.320]   Because she's publicized herself as really good.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.120]   Is somebody doing this?
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.440]   Because this is brilliant.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.680]   CoVestr.com.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.560]   Shoot.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.080]   Ricky Tata.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:06.400]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.440]   Very interesting.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.240]   And so now, take that--
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.840]   Now there's money to be made.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.120]   Now I can-- I mean, for the follower,
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.480]   there's a reason to do this.
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.360]   Now you do the same thing with Leo's electronic store.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.040]   Yep.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.680]   Right?
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.040]   Or he just Leo's app store.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.000]   Every time Leo installs an app on Android,
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.360]   I would love to just get a push down to me.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.360]   And I'd love to get $0.10.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   Right.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.080]   Here you go.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.160]   Haching.
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:31.080]   Well, and we've done this.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.240]   And this is that Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.280]   No one wants to make lists.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.320]   We've done this kind of-- we have Twitter recommendations.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.480]   And it uses our Amazon affiliate code.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.000]   It's too much work.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.160]   And that's why Blippi and I would guess CoVestr
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.280]   and all these are smart because they're automatic.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:44.920]   Right.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.040]   So you can start to follow-- the whole idea
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:49.080]   of following that was so important.
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:49.600]   Right.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:50.320]   Really takes off.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.360]   So that's where Pudd is on to something I think.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:56.560]   So whether it's done at Blippi or not, well, what should
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:58.320]   happen here is it's fairly obvious,
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:00.560]   isn't Zuckerberg should buy Blippi?
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.040]   And--
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:05.440]   But does he need Blippi?
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.720]   Does he doesn't really need Blippi?
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.240]   No, he doesn't.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.760]   The problem is with his privacy headaches of the past,
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.880]   that's going to be a really touchy thing.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:17.000]   Oh, you got to trust Zuckerberg with your credit card?
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.160]   Right.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   So somebody's going to get that.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:22.660]   And--
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.160]   He's beacon.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:23.660]   You're right.
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:24.840]   This was the whole idea of beacon.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:25.340]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:27.480]   And when I interviewed him, he said,
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.480]   I said beacon was just really-- he said, no, beacon was
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:29.960]   a mistake.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:31.560]   We did wrong with it.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:36.040]   And he said that Blippi, you're choosing to do it there.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.040]   I think that's the big lesson he learned.
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.320]   Well, but I think that's also why Blippi is not
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.800]   going to catch because I think it--
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.080]   people are too many people saying, no, I ain't doing that,
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.920]   even with Blippi.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.240]   Who would you trust that data with?
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.600]   No one, not Google, not Apple, not Facebook,
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.360]   not any big player.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.240]   Well, I trusted to a stupid credit card company and bank
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.400]   and the banks are all corrupt.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.280]   Well, and that's why Gina and I ended up saying, OK, mint's
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.080]   OK because we know that it's the same intermediary
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.280]   that the banks use, though they already know all that.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:08.960]   But all right, so mint--
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.680]   Ah, that's smart.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.640]   Mint should do it.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.040]   Should buy Blippi.
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:14.240]   Mint should buy Blippi.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.000]   There you go.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.480]   Because they already have all the information.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:22.320]   And then I can export my recommendations from Nipley
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:25.800]   to Nipley, Twitter, or Facebook, or wherever I want.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.280]   Because it's in my interest now because I'm
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:30.000]   going to make $0.10 every time you buy this wonderful shirt.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.360]   That's the key is you got to make money for people
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.000]   because they're not going to give you that information
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.880]   unless they see a real value to it.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.880]   Sure, this stuff about giving over your information
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.760]   to get free content.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.040]   Hell with that, give over your information.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:43.800]   Make money.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.480]   It's a big money.
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.080]   Give me some money.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.480]   Of course, the problem is it then makes you suspect.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.840]   Leo keeps shilling for blank.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.920]   And that's a good point.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:52.920]   That's a good point.
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.000]   That's a good point.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.080]   Then I'll stop buying.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:58.360]   I'll stop following you.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.080]   Yeah, I also want some degree of creation.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.240]   Like, just because I bought something doesn't necessarily
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:04.640]   mean that it's proven-- like, I would like kind of a list
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.400]   of stuff that I bought.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.640]   I'd be like, yes, I did like this.
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.600]   No, I wouldn't have bought that kind of thing.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.320]   Well, that's what Blippi's asking for.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:12.440]   They're very big on getting reviews of everything you bought.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:13.240]   They're reviews later on.
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.800]   They bug you until you review it.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.640]   Well, the other thing important thing about Blippi
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.840]   is that it creates a transparent pricing marketplace.
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:22.360]   The opacity of pricing is over.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.560]   You just can't do that anymore.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.560]   So that you're going to have to--
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.800]   companies are going to have to compete on quality and service.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.000]   This I like.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:28.840]   And so on.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.800]   But Blippi definitely tells you, at a minimum,
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.760]   this is what 100 people paid for this item
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.840]   and where I can go get it.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:41.800]   So when that happens, that has a drastic impact
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:45.960]   on commerce and the economy.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.880]   Well, Gina, I think the other thing you could do
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.480]   is you could have queries back.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.360]   It's kind of like Quora.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.920]   Gina bought these 10 things.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.600]   I'm about to--
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.080]   Gina bought this expensive thing.
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.200]   I then get to query you and say, did you like it?
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:01.000]   And if you've got enough people querying you,
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.080]   you'll go to the trouble maybe of answering.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:07.080]   And then that ups the credibility of that recommendation.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:07.920]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.440]   I mean, that happens manually all the time.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.600]   People say, oh, you bought this phone?
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.200]   What did you think?
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:11.960]   Did you got the tab?
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.960]   What did you think?
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.440]   Yep.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:13.960]   Yep.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.480]   Well, Google's--
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:14.480]   Because--
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.920]   Well, Google buys everything.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.280]   I do.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.280]   So I'm not as good as--
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.520]   in fact, that's what I said in the chat room.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.560]   Gina is very careful.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.080]   Right.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.600]   So when Gina buys--
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:25.440]   when Gina buys the tab, I'm buying that.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.280]   You want somebody who's very frugal.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.520]   Cheap, I think, is really worth that.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.680]   That's the way I was looking for.
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:33.120]   That's the way I was looking for.
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:34.120]   Hey, look at this.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.480]   Google goggles is trying out ads.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.440]   Here's another way Google's looking at making money.
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.440]   What's the story here?
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.760]   You can take a picture of an ad for certain advertisers
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:44.680]   that they made a deal with, and then it
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:49.880]   brings up the web stuff, which is kind of funny in two ways.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.000]   One is, do you all remember the Qcat?
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:54.880]   Qcat was this incredibly stupid thing.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.960]   It was a barcode radio.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.320]   Radio Shack gave them away because they wanted people to use them.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:02.080]   You were supposed to read your newspaper next to the computer
[00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.840]   wired in your computer.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.920]   And Scan, why were you doing all those trouble?
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.240]   Because URL's worked just so hard to handle.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.560]   I'm like, hey, Amazon.com.
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.160]   And the other thing is--
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:15.280]   so that's why it reminds me of Qcat.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.480]   And so I got to get that on my head.
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.480]   But the second thing is, I wonder whether this corrupt search
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:20.800]   in a way.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.680]   Because if I use Google goggles purely,
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:25.100]   I could take a picture of a Buick ad
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.400]   and say, I want to make a search of Google for that.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:29.920]   I don't want to go to the ad.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.800]   I want to say internet.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.160]   What do you know about the Buick?
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.440]   And that's how Google goggles is.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.720]   It's a pathway to search.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.800]   And now, if somebody can kind of--
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.320]   what you're doing is you're buying a search result.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:42.640]   Buick is buying a search result.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.680]   And I don't know if I like that.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:44.720]   Right.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.640]   And it's not quite the same as a page of search results
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.400]   where there are sponsored links at the top, which are clearly
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:49.960]   marked.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:54.560]   Isn't this just like a less geeky QR code?
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.560]   I mean, this is just recognizing something
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.080]   that doesn't look like a box full of static.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.480]   I'm trying to understand how it works.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.360]   It's a marketing experiment.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.120]   Let's listen in.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.280]   I want to tell you about an interesting experiment.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.920]   Well, let's not listen in.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.680]   OK.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.520]   I have a very short attention spin.
[00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.000]   So you take a picture of a book--
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.520]   this is goggles-- and then goggles will say, oh, here's
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.040]   the book.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.960]   Here's where you can buy it, Amazon, and so forth.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.960]   So that's traditional.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.280]   That's how goggles has worked all along.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.000]   Now you take a picture of an ad.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.520]   It says, oh, it finds all the things in the ad,
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.000]   including the T-Mobile G2.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.320]   Whoa, that's interesting.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:34.960]   Well, that's OK.
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:35.160]   All right.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:35.920]   Well, that's OK.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:36.420]   OK.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:38.840]   And then, oh, look, I found a G2.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:42.400]   And then what?
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.960]   So it is just like sponsored links.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.320]   So it's pulling you--
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:47.400]   I thought you went to the ad.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.440]   OK, we are wrong.
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.800]   It pulls you to a sponsored link for T-Mobile.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.240]   T-Mobile's going to pay you--
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.280]   pay you, right?
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:57.920]   --so that when you take a picture and you see a G2,
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.600]   the first hit is an ad.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.600]   I saw some promotion for it that looked like a bit
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:03.320]   straight to the ad.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.320]   OK, it skips a step.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.920]   OK, so I just took a picture of a Buick.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.480]   And it's searching.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.720]   And it takes you to Buick.com.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:12.840]   Oh, that's the ball.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:13.360]   OK.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.360]   It looked like you had a choice there.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.480]   And the director of advertising promotion at Buick
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.240]   says, we like this a lot.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.760]   We need to then get a deal of what we're--
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.440]   What a C is to recall on the Buick
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.560]   and all the things in the Buick.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.480]   It's an interesting use of Google goggles.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.960]   I mean, that's not like--
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.560]   that's a little bit different, right?
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.240]   It's not perverting search.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.320]   Well, but isn't it, Leo?
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.800]   If Google goggles is just a visual search.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:38.560]   But it's not now.
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.600]   We're saying, well, what if it's not?
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.760]   What if I take a picture of Tron Legacy?
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.760]   Or and more.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.720]   Uses are conducting visual searches
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:48.240]   to explore the world around it.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.440]   They just call it a visual search.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.800]   And they're about to know you're not the most meaningful
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.800]   and relevant visual search.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.400]   And the most valuable to us.
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.320]   I want your algorithm, not your sales
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.280]   guide to tell me what's being called.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:00.000]   No, I agree with you.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.080]   Interesting.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.800]   Watch it, Google.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.160]   Watch it.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.960]   Well, they do say it's an experiment.
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.160]   Why am I going to take a picture of an ad?
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:08.600]   I guess--
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   No, I mean, I guess people are doing that.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:12.800]   Well, I don't know.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.760]   Do either of you use goggles very often?
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.800]   Silence, shaking them ahead.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.320]   Negative.
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.840]   No, no use for it.
[00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.320]   I have it.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:24.120]   I mean, if I saw QR code, I'd pull it out.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:24.800]   But we're an nerd.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:26.280]   So we know what a QR code is.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.800]   And we know what to do with it.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   But OK.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.800]   Google, by the way, I want to clarify this.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.600]   It says, you can enable push notifications
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.160]   in the Google Voice app on the iPhone for voice mail
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.600]   and text messages.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.360]   So I'm not sure what that review that you're reading was meant
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:43.440]   when it said you couldn't.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:47.160]   So just to clarify, we're going to move along here.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:50.240]   Oh my god, Gina just fell off the face of the earth.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:50.760]   Well, why--
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.680]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:52.680]   Come on, Gina.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.120]   Come on, Gina.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:56.960]   Well, Gina, well, we attempt to recover Gina,
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.080]   the black hole into which she has tumbled.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.800]   I would like to talk a little bit about our friends
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.920]   at Ford and the incredible Ford Edge, which
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:08.040]   is the most technologically sophisticated Ford on the lot.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:08.800]   And I mean it.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.120]   I drove it at Blog World.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.040]   It was so much fun.
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.640]   Great design, beautiful aerodynamic exterior,
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.240]   but a very slick interior.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.680]   In fact, it reminded me a little of my Mustang.
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:20.640]   I could see that the same designers had worked on it.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:26.600]   It was very clean, sleek, spare.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.400]   It has my Ford touch, which means there
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.560]   are two screens behind the steering wheel on the dash
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.800]   that can be changed.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.560]   So it was a tachometer and the music application,
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.920]   but you could change them.
[00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.760]   And then it's got a great big screen.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:43.840]   I think it was a 7 or 8 inch screen in the center console
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.280]   that your GPS and your other controls,
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.200]   a 8 inch touch screen in the center stack, which
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.880]   is just fantastic.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.640]   We should not ignore the engine and the fuel efficiency.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:56.320]   It's got that great 3.5 liter TI-VCT-V6 engine.
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.600]   285 horses under the hood.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.120]   And yet, 27 miles--
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.720]   highway miles to the gallon, according to the EPA.
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.640]   You could also get the sport with more horsepower, 305
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.720]   and 280 foot pounds of torque.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.960]   I love the my Ford touch.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.520]   It's kind of Ford's sink on steroids.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.320]   It's just really so great.
[00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:15.160]   Take a look at the edge.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.520]   If you're in the market for a larger car,
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:21.280]   we have good friends who are a self-emitted Ford family,
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.480]   which I love.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.200]   I didn't even know it.
[00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.520]   It's funny, until we started talking cars,
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.760]   I had no idea.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.680]   And I said, oh, you're right.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.760]   All you ever drive is a Ford.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:29.480]   That's all I ever see you.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.840]   And yeah, we just got the edge.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.520]   We were looking for a car with great second row legroom.
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:38.560]   And there is no car in its class with better second row leg
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.080]   room.
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.400]   It's just very comfortable for the people in the back.
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:44.760]   The Panoramic Vista Roof is an option.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.320]   You can have it both in the front and then
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.400]   the fixed rear skylight.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.520]   So the back seat folks get a little bit of light too.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.240]   I love the edge.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:52.840]   Take a look at it.
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.160]   If you're in the market for--
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:54.760]   what do you call it?
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.880]   Is it a sport utility vehicle?
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.360]   I guess it is.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.240]   Take a look at the Ford Edge.
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:01.360]   This unfortunately now, my wife took a look at it.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.040]   And now that's what I have to get for.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.480]   Already.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:06.120]   She's amazing.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:07.680]   All right, Gina's back.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.240]   Sorry about that.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.800]   Not at all.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:11.240]   I scared you away.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.240]   Internet.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:13.080]   Internet.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:13.920]   Internet.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.360]   So you won't like this.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.400]   Here's the Glee story.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:21.360]   So we've got a complete set now of networks that won't appear
[00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:24.400]   on Google TV, including Fox.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.000]   Good bummer.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:25.480]   Bummer.
[00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:28.240]   Now Schmidt has a rationale or as a--
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.640]   I don't know if rationales are right word.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.920]   He has something to say about the fact
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:35.360]   that a lot of networks now-- in fact, all the major networks
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.360]   are blocking Google TV.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.800]   He says, guys, you're cutting yourselves off
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.640]   from greater revenue potential.
[00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.320]   With Google TV, consumers would watch more of your programming.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:49.080]   I guess that's true, right?
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.640]   It says the way to get more revenue
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.000]   is to create more revenue sources.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.520]   The way to do that is through things like Google TV.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.560]   He says, we don't draw on a drive television revenue to zero.
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.200]   We want to make the revenues larger.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:07.120]   So why is it the networks are so afraid of putting their internet
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.640]   content on the television?
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.440]   It's what we talked about last week.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.480]   We're disintermediating the networks.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:17.400]   We're going to get to our shows around networks.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.240]   The networks right now still have the clutch on it,
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:26.560]   but it's not a big leap at all to see somebody of note.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:28.640]   Can you hear that support Lee right now?
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:29.400]   No.
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.920]   Could it support Howard Stern?
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:31.880]   Yes.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:36.040]   Could it support an inexpensive sitcom?
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.200]   Yes.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:41.120]   And so they can go directly to viewers around the networks,
[00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:43.520]   giving the networks not a cut of it at all.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.920]   And the more and the habit we get of that,
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.520]   the better off the producers are and the worse off the networks
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:48.880]   are.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:50.320]   So I don't know if these are numbers of viewers,
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:54.520]   but the US consumers pay $70 billion a year in cable
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:59.120]   and satellite fees, $70 billion.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.520]   So that's what's kind of at stake,
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:03.320]   because I guess you could just buy cheap internet instead
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:07.000]   of buying the expensive cable and satellite.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.480]   He says Google's talking with the industry.
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:15.120]   They're sharing data to help persuade broadcasters, ABC,
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:20.600]   CBS, NBC, and now Fox to unblock Hulu is also blocking, right?
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.560]   Hulu Plus doesn't work on Google TV.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:26.600]   I got a boxy box because I wanted to compare it.
[00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:29.640]   It doesn't have anything either.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.280]   Do you think this is YouTube blowback?
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.080]   Like, do you think this is the networks being like,
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:36.640]   oh, well, you don't help us pull down
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:38.200]   pirated content from YouTube fast enough
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:39.600]   or you did it for a while?
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:40.720]   And they do.
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:42.160]   They do too much, right?
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.600]   Well, yeah, they pull us down.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.040]   I think they'll pull us down already for some of the things
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.480]   we've done on this show.
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.880]   I still don't know how they're doing it.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.440]   CBS has put his bump there.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.120]   It's pretty amazing, isn't it?
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.520]   I mean, what is it?
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.360]   I saw the new number, something like 34 hours
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.640]   a minute of videos being uploaded to YouTube.
[00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.000]   It's another huge number again.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.520]   And somehow they mechanically go through everything
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:07.040]   looking for some sort of watermark.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:08.120]   I would guess--
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.560]   I don't know, Gina, you're a programmer.
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:11.000]   You might know better than I, but I would guess
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.040]   that the networks provide signatures of some kind.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.800]   Oh, for them to figure out how to--
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.640]   I was saying, how are the networks blocking?
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.040]   I mean, they're not using the user engines.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:20.840]   How do they block it?
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:21.800]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:23.400]   Yeah, they're not using the user engines
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.080]   because you can change it and it still doesn't go.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:25.680]   Right, right.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.600]   I'm curious about that.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.440]   I mean, they're differentiating between screens.
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:31.320]   You know, like the screen in your living room isn't OK,
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.320]   but the one in your office is OK.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.960]   So it's strange.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.000]   I mean, it's just Chrome.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.960]   And then you could tell it, I'm Chrome running on Windows XP.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:41.960]   Right.
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:42.640]   I mean, this is--
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:43.640]   I'm just curious about--
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.640]   There must be something.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.920]   There must be something.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:48.480]   Anybody in the chat room?
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:51.400]   They say it's based on the version number of the Flash
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.880]   plugin.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:55.120]   Oh, well, that seems like something
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.720]   that would be easy to spoof.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.680]   I know that this isn't the point, but--
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:03.320]   That can't be right.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:04.880]   They say it's the Flash plugin.
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.080]   The Flash plugins have user agents.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.560]   So the same thing happened in Android.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.320]   And you just hack it.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.600]   It's just not as easy to hack Flash, right?
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:18.440]   It's easy to change the user agent in Chrome.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.360]   It's a menu command.
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.880]   But you can't do it quite so easily.
[00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:26.160]   However, well, see, Adobe doesn't--
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.840]   Adobe's going to continue to do that.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:33.160]   They don't mind this, or do they?
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.200]   But you know, the other thing is that the publishers
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.520]   complain that when Google sends them audience--
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.680]   it's Rupert Murdoch says it's worthless audience
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.720]   because it's out of market terms, one stop wonder, whatever.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:49.800]   When Google TV sends a viewer to a show, it's great audience.
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:50.520]   But it's right.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.680]   It's exactly targeted.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:53.800]   This is somebody who wants to watch the show.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:56.360]   And no, sorry, not because you came from there.
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.760]   Your friend Google recommended you.
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.040]   Oh, I don't trust you.
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.880]   And also, they get so much more information
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.320]   about the viewer when you view it.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.760]   Yeah, that's what Eric's trying to say.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.800]   He said, we're sharing the information
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:09.480]   we know about our audience with them.
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:11.360]   All right, location, IP address.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.840]   Right, right.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:15.240]   One word, antitrust.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:16.200]   Oh, boy.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.800]   I mean, this is the networks acting as one.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:19.600]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.920]   That is colluding, isn't it?
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:21.760]   It is.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.800]   And Google, Google's the victim.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.600]   Everybody's scared of being old, bad Google.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.200]   But Google's the victim in this case.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.080]   And thus are we.
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.640]   Eric also showed off the new Nexus S.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.400]   This is a replacement for the Nexus One, which
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:36.280]   is an HTC device.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:39.080]   This one is from Samsung, right?
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:39.920]   I think so.
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:43.360]   Yeah, it kind of has that Galaxy S feel to it.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.680]   It will be a true Google phone.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:48.440]   It'll be running on-- or he was running it on T-Mobile.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.840]   It has NFC features, which is kind of interesting.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:56.280]   In fact, Schmidt says he thinks these phones will eventually
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.520]   replace credit cards.
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:02.440]   So tell me, what's the difference between NFC and Bluetooth
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:06.880]   or any sort of-- it's just a short range, kind of wireless--
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:08.440]   Well, my gosh, ID, isn't it?
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:12.320]   It's like an active RFID that can actually send data.
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:12.840]   No.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.080]   OK.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.840]   Don't know.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.480]   You're saying that you could tap the phone,
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:20.000]   and you could pay for something that way.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.280]   And it is sort of like RFID.
[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:22.760]   I guess with Bluetooth you have pairing.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.400]   But that's basically-- that's the idea, right?
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:28.720]   Yeah, but it's shorter range.
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.960]   Bluetooth is 30 feet.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:34.600]   NFC stands for near field communication.
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:35.640]   Let me look on Wikipedia.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.400]   They say it's short--
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.760]   I like those cards on the subways.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.720]   You guys wouldn't know what subways are here in California.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.600]   But on the subways, I'm man of the people.
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.600]   You can just tap now.
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:47.600]   No, I've heard the people ride around on the hole in the ground.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:49.600]   And they're not too late.
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.000]   Come on.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.240]   The Bronx is up and the battery's down.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.080]   10 centimeters.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.280]   It's only 4 inches.
[00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.000]   That's the big difference.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.840]   And that's important, because if you don't have something
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:06.160]   with Bluetooth, that means everybody within 30 feet
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:07.600]   can receive your signal.
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:11.800]   This you have to actually tap it or get it within 4 inches.
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:14.040]   So let's do things like bump, right?
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:17.480]   It is, in fact, related to RFID.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:20.280]   So now go back, pardon me, to Blippi, right?
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:22.840]   Now your phone is your credit card.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.680]   It's how you're buying everything.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.560]   And it has an internet connection.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:27.600]   And it has an internet connection.
[00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:28.960]   And it has this kind of connection
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.160]   so that you can try to say, I want to tell the world about that.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.840]   I want this delivered there.
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.440]   I want that-- forget the stores.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:36.940]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:37.680]   The stores are called.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.360]   The stores are toast.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.520]   I went to Des Moines some time ago
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.760]   and was just amazed downtown.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.640]   There were no stores.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.680]   Wasn't it depressed downtown?
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.120]   Just there weren't any stores.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:48.560]   And it--
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:49.440]   That's depressing.
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:49.920]   --that's a impressive idea.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:50.960]   What was that?
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.520]   A lot of restaurants?
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:53.400]   No, even that.
[00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:56.120]   Just kind of boring office buildings and a few drug stores.
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:56.560]   It was it.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.960]   It was weird.
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.520]   But that's the future, I think.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:00.840]   And--
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.440]   Because you can't--
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.120]   The risk you have to go through to hold on to inventory
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:07.720]   in many, many locations is going to be very, very hot.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:11.120]   We're going to turn into those fat slobs and wall-y.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.120]   Oh.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:15.480]   Riding around our little hover carriages.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.040]   Like so--
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.320]   The virtual reality glasses on.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:20.120]   Now you see the ad.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:22.520]   You tap the billboard and say, I want--
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:24.480]   [GASPING]
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.080]   You don't even have to get out of your hover chair.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.160]   No.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.400]   Schmidt also said that it clarified anyway.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.240]   And I guess we knew this.
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:32.880]   Android is for touch devices.
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.200]   Chrome OS will be for keyboard devices.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.160]   So that's why it's netbooks.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.160]   Oh.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:37.920]   That makes sense now.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:38.920]   I get it.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.520]   I think that's because he articulated that difference.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:42.360]   I mean, it was obvious.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.920]   So they just made it up.
[00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.760]   You know, when Jobs said that you don't interact--
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.000]   you know, touch devices, you can't interact with them
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:51.920]   kind of standing up.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:52.600]   And that's why--
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.240]   Arms links.
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:55.480]   --the airs are OS 10.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.680]   And that makes sense.
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:57.920]   That was the difference.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:58.440]   I guess I got it.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.600]   Apparently, Apple's made the same distinction.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.720]   That's what iOS is versus OS 10.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:02.560]   Right.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:03.640]   Right.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:07.160]   Um, I guess you've got somebody here on Twitter,
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.680]   fur, $9.99.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:13.160]   $99 said, Jeff, Fox held out for $150 million in cable vision.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:15.840]   Why would they let Google have their content for free?
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:17.560]   Did Fox get $150 million for--
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:18.080]   Yeah, they did.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:19.560]   This is the whole retransmission crowd.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:20.680]   Oh, cable vision.
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:21.600]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:24.440]   And cable vision tried to hold out.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:26.160]   You know, they couldn't forever, but they tried to.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:27.840]   And there's a difference.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:29.120]   But yeah, there is a difference.
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.200]   Because that was the only way those people in Long Island,
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:35.240]   Connecticut, and New Jersey could get Fox 5.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:39.040]   But Google TV is just one of a lot of choices, right?
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:39.800]   Right.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.160]   And--
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.160]   So who has the upper hand?
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:46.480]   If cable vision had held out, they never came into an agreement.
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:50.960]   Wouldn't it be in Fox's interest to then be on Google TV?
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.520]   More choices.
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.120]   Yeah, it's against cable vision.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.360]   Should be the one who's fighting.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.120]   That's a good point.
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:56.720]   That works.
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.240]   That's because--
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.320]   Disintermediated is the cable companies.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.160]   Not the-- yeah, yeah.
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.720]   Why are the content creators worried about it?
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.600]   Because they're not content creators.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:07.400]   They're distributed.
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:07.800]   They're another middleman.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.720]   They're another middleman.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.240]   OK.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.120]   The studio is eventually going to go directly.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.200]   So they say, OK, well, it's dominoes.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.360]   So cable vision or Comcast falls becomes an internet service
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.160]   provider.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.100]   At least they still have a business.
[01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:20.400]   What do we do?
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.840]   It's taking a threat out of the sweater and starting to pull.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:28.040]   Matthew Wiener doesn't go to AMC to make Mad Men.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:30.360]   He goes directly to--
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:30.840]   I don't know.
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:31.840]   Well, some-- what?
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.360]   Well, here's the other big deal.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.880]   The fact that-- and I think I don't
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.920]   have to say this last week or not, but at the Quadrangle
[01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:42.200]   Conference, you had Michael Eisner doing a deal with AOL.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.560]   So this is the start of this.
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:45.240]   This is the unraveling the sweater,
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.400]   where Eisner is making shows and AOL
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.280]   is going to have an exclusive on it,
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.120]   rather than him going to AMC.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.120]   We're going to take a break, come back pretty soon.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.320]   We've got to get to our tips, our tools,
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:02.520]   and our number of the week.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.200]   Gina Tribani, Jeff Jarvis is here.
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:09.040]   Just a quick mention of our domain name service that we use
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.360]   and we recommend you use.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:14.120]   You know I don't like the other guys.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.280]   I don't like their ads.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.400]   I don't like their attitude.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.760]   I don't like the crappy website.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.280]   In fact, they're all horrible.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.560]   Just go for just get a breath of fresh air.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.160]   Go to twig.hover.com.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.120]   It's clean.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:26.200]   It's simple.
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.760]   They don't upsell you with a bunch of stuff.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:30.440]   It's not 90 clicks before you check out.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.120]   twig.hover is as in cover.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.880]   H-O-V-E-R.com.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.880]   I guess you could pronounce that Hoover, couldn't you?
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:39.360]   But it's not.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.240]   It's hover.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.800]   Very clean, very simple, very easy.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.720]   If you can use it for a domain, they've got all the biggies.net
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:54.080]   .com.org.biz.info.ca.us.cc.tv.bz.me.te.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.880]   I never heard of some of these.
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:56.720]   Look at these.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.520]   All the UK ones.
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.320]   You can have it.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.520]   They don't do hosting.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.840]   So don't look for them to upsell your hosting.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:08.240]   They do mail forwarding and they do DNS forwarding.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.880]   And for $25 they'll transfer all your domains,
[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:11.560]   make it very easy.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.360]   I wish I had done that because those other guys
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.440]   locked my domain as soon as they saw that I wanted
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.440]   to move it off of theirs.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:19.760]   They support webmail if you like.
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:20.600]   It's so great.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:25.400]   H-O-V-E-R. And by the way, if you use the offer code twig,
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.720]   you'll save 10% off your domains.
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.040]   And they build in things too, which
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.920]   is nice like the privacy domain privacy.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.800]   Because the other guys charge you for that.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:39.160]   No, you get home as privacy for free with Hover.
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.320]   Hover.com.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.640]   Domain transfers are free, but they will charge $10
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.880]   and give you another year past the current expiration
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.440]   date at the time of transfer.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.200]   So that was nice.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.240]   I thought that was a good deal.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.520]   So go to TWIG.hover.com and use the offer code twig
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.080]   when you buy to get 10% off.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:00.400]   Look at-- I don't have to upsell you on this.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.480]   Just go there.
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.400]   There's the no hold policy for calls made during business hours.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.560]   It's from two cows.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.560]   Used to be domains direct.
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.360]   Maybe you're used to them.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.800]   H-O-V-E-R. That's what we're transferring all of our stuff
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:19.160]   over as soon as that paternalistic other company lets me.
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.320]   We shall remain nameless.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.600]   They've got a new cute girl instead of the old cute girl,
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.560]   I noticed.
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:29.800]   I don't understand the connection between that and domain
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.560]   registration.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.080]   I really don't.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.080]   I'll never understand that.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:32.560]   But that's--
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.720]   So what in the chat room is saying you should do an ad
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.880]   in a shower with a blonde and you can sell a lot more
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.640]   domains for the rest of this hot commercial code
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.240]   on my website.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.960]   Steamy.
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.840]   You know, I just presented that I go there and there's nothing
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.360]   more hot.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.160]   So it's like, come on.
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.880]   I want Leo in a towel in a bathroom doing an old spice
[01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:53.960]   style commercial for her.
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.880]   A vodacta could do it.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:56.800]   I actually did.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:00.120]   I was down at the radio station in the Los Angeles
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.880]   that I started at KFI.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.280]   And the Citrix that go to meeting people were there.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.200]   And they said, would you do a go to meeting ad for us?
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:06.640]   I said, sure.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.120]   They said, we need to take off your clothes.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.400]   I said, what?
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.840]   But it was Hollywood and I was young.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.840]   I'll do it.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.440]   I'll do it.
[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.480]   Yeah, I thought of Jeff, actually.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.640]   So they said, well, don't worry.
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:21.160]   We'll go from here down to your knees with the thing
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:22.880]   and then the ad copies something like,
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.680]   I'm meeting right now with go to meeting.
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.120]   And I don't even have to get dressed for work or whatever.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:28.960]   And then they--
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.240]   Did they have it?
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.120]   I did this.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.720]   And then they sent me the sample.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:37.800]   And the banner, instead of being here to here,
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:41.280]   started re-- I mean, it was kind of narrow.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.200]   And I-- it was a song.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.560]   It was practically a song.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.480]   It's a good meeting.
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:51.200]   And I got it the long name.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.440]   Wow.
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:53.940]   No.
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:55.800]   I don't know who I'm searching this right now.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:56.280]   I mean, did it--
[01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:56.960]   No, it's gone.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.760]   No, no, no.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:58.640]   I freaked out.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.080]   I said, you can't use that.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.480]   So they made the banner bigger.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:04.080]   So now it's just--
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:04.480]   Oh, good.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.440]   Like that.
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.000]   But apparently there are bootleg copies floating around.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.240]   Somebody out there on the internet,
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.080]   you know you have that photo.
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:13.560]   Go ahead.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:14.080]   Go ahead.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:14.080]   Go ahead.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:14.760]   Copy it.
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.320]   Send it off.
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.000]   It was on YouTube for like three seconds.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.880]   There were only like 10 views before I got it pulled down.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.600]   Thank god.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.600]   Oh my god.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:23.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.600]   Oh my god.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:24.920]   Oh my god.
[01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:27.960]   All right, Gina, your tip of the week, my friend.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.320]   Tip of the week, this week, really simple one.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.760]   But useful, especially for those of you
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.800]   who are getting the tab or have an iPad.
[01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.600]   Mobile editing in Google Docs.
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:38.760]   Yay.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:39.600]   Yeah, yay.
[01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.840]   If you go to docs.google.com on iOS or Android,
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:47.960]   I think it's Froyo or better, you can hit an edit button
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.040]   and you can edit regular Google Docs.
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:53.360]   So they've already supported spreadsheets, editing spreadsheets.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:54.880]   But now you can edit regular--
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:55.920]   That's what fooled me because I've
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.320]   been able to edit spreadsheets for a while
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.720]   because I have my We Rule spreadsheet, which I tell you,
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:03.360]   which crop is the best to raise on your medieval farm
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.520]   on the iPad.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.520]   But yeah.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.600]   Now, this is rolling out of the next couple of days.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.480]   So hopefully by the time people hear this,
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:12.600]   it will work for them.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.160]   I do not have the edit button yet,
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.000]   but it is coming out in the next--
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:15.760]   So that's how you'll know.
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:18.160]   There'll be a button that says edit on your--
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.000]   Yeah, there'll be an edit button in your docs.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.360]   And it's kind of as you type.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.000]   So if you're typing on your phone,
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.720]   your collaborators will actually see your changes
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:25.480]   as you type as well.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.680]   Well, that's pretty cool.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:28.680]   Wow, that's really neat.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:29.680]   Hallelujah.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.200]   And that's on all mobile.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.680]   It's Android for Your Better and iOS.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.480]   So it sounds like they're getting ready to release an Android
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.080]   tablet, because on a tablet, being
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.920]   able to edit Google Docs big deal.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.520]   And isn't it a pain to get docs up
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.880]   up in the cloud from iPad, right?
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.480]   That you have to sync or email or drop-box or something?
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.040]   Or get a third-party app, really,
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.200]   is what you have to go read.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.200]   Or get a third-party app.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.080]   So now you can edit docs from your iPad and Google Docs
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.960]   and have them just kind of sync to the cloud.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:55.320]   That's great.
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:56.240]   Or just be in the cloud.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.200]   They're not syncing you.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.040]   They just live there.
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.240]   Right.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.400]   All right, we'll look for our Edit button.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:03.800]   Yeah, look for that Edit button.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:06.600]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.120]   100.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.920]   That's how many pounds Bob Mews lost
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:15.080]   after he saw himself with a profile view in Google Street
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:15.560]   View.
[01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:17.280]   Take that Germany.
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.040]   And he was so important.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:21.640]   At his weight, that according to the Telegraph,
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.760]   he had weighed 21 stone, 3 pounds.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.520]   Chatroom, how much is that?
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:28.640]   Everybody know what a stone is?
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   That's better than a Google calculator.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.960]   Which is a stone.
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.720]   And then he went down to 14 stone, otherwise known as 89 kilograms.
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.360]   Give me pounds!
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:38.800]   So that's amazing.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.040]   Yeah, what a stone.
[01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:41.120]   I mean, really, come on.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.840]   It's 294 pounds.
[01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.400]   How medieval can you get?
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.000]   So this is the picture that we saw on Google Street View
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.400]   he saw that horrified him.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.720]   And it inspired him.
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:55.280]   Oh my god, I'm fat.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.280]   So he really--
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:58.240]   They pixelated his face, but he knew
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.080]   that was his belly.
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.240]   Oh yeah.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.760]   Well, every mother would recognize-- that actually used
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.480]   to be the rule when I worked at NBC.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.560]   The rule was if your mother could recognize you in the picture,
[01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.320]   then you were not sufficiently obscured.
[01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.520]   And obviously, Google needs to follow that rule,
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:14.360]   because his mother could tell that was him,
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.720]   even though his face is blurred.
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:18.320]   But he's not German.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.920]   No, no, it's his English.
[01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.840]   That is actually fairly horrifying.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.360]   It's quite a point.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.360]   I kind of understand.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:30.160]   But when I applaud that he--
[01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:32.440]   Yeah, it's like owning that scale you bought, Leo.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.440]   It's kind of a social media.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:33.960]   The same idea.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:34.640]   Right?
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.680]   Didn't help me at all.
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.480]   Only more people know how fat I am.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:40.840]   That's all.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:41.840]   Is there an afterpitching?
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:42.040]   It's a good change.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:42.800]   It works.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:43.800]   No, yeah.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:44.880]   No, I didn't see it after--
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:48.920]   He joined a gym, started to exercise with a personal trainer.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:50.640]   Eight right, and he'd lost 100 pounds.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.920]   Wow.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.200]   That's really a nice story.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:56.960]   My tool of the week is something brand new
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.200]   from Hot Spot--
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.400]   sorry, from Google.
[01:08:59.400 --> 01:09:01.360]   If you go to google.com-- and this is confusing.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.400]   It is not Hot Spot.
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:05.160]   It's Hot Pot, which is a Mongolian.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.480]   So we're going to get a nice brush.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.560]   Yeah, I don't understand.
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:11.960]   But it is actually pretty cool.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:15.880]   And it's clearly Google's response to Yelp.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.560]   Google already has Google Places,
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:18.880]   and lots of businesses are in there.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.360]   My business is in there.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:22.800]   The first thing you should do if you have a business
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.640]   is make sure that your directory-- it's free,
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.560]   is correct and all that.
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:29.000]   So these are all from places.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.320]   And then you can very easily rate them.
[01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:36.040]   So I happen to like Lagoni, just brewing company quite a bit.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.240]   So I'm going to give it five stars.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:40.560]   And then it says, I'm going to say in my tip, just like Yelp,
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:43.760]   try the beer garden.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.880]   And then you get to-- now, the food is very simple.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.000]   It's not zagat quality ratings here.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.440]   It's either a happy facers.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.360]   But the--
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:53.320]   [SINGING]
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.040]   And the value is good.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.800]   OK, and then you publish this, and now there's a review.
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.200]   And you can see other people's reviews.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.920]   You can follow friends, kind of like latitude.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.800]   You can see what your friends review.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.240]   You can get recommendations.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.560]   This is more their social--
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:09.320]   social and everything.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.840]   This is exactly it.
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.320]   Yeah, of course.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.080]   And when I go to Paris, you can be sure I'll be using this.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:17.360]   This is a clever Google Hotpot.
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.800]   It is.
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:19.960]   And I see now what they're doing.
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.000]   They don't have to do Facebook.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.960]   They have to just do a lot of little Facebooks.
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:26.200]   So what's more-- I mean, right now, this,
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:32.200]   Yelp, Facebook Places, and 4 Square, what else?
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.520]   And what's the travel one?
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.360]   I keep on forgetting the amount of--
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.240]   Travel one.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.280]   Trip it?
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.760]   No, TripAdvisor, maybe.
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:39.320]   TripAdvisor.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:42.360]   Well, look at In-N-Out Burger.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.040]   Everybody loves it.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:45.720]   20 fabulous reviews.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:46.680]   Great wine list.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.520]   Amazingly knowledgeable, helpful service.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.960]   It's a hamburger joint.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.240]   I don't think they got wine there.
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.880]   I could be wrong, but I don't think so.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.120]   Google.com, I have you been--
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:01.800]   Sorry.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:02.960]   Have I been where?
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.040]   It's your polling.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.040]   No.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.560]   I just gave TwiCottage and Petaluma six stars.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.960]   I think you should too.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.960]   Thank you.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.400]   This launch is interesting, Hotpot.
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.120]   You know, you kind of could tell if they learned something
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.200]   from Buzz, that you have to build your whole friends list
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.000]   again.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   And it tells you that you've got all your reviews or public,
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.200]   and you can set a different nickname.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.320]   It seemed like they were super careful about the privacy
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.680]   settings, which I think is interesting.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.240]   Not the same.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.000]   And I imagine that's true of boutiques and everywhere else.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.840]   But is that in the long run really the best thing to do?
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.840]   I mean, don't we not want to have to make this list over
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:38.760]   and over and over again?
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:39.280]   We don't.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.280]   I hate being in front of us.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:41.600]   Well, especially when you wanted you to be able to
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.800]   export your friends.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.680]   I don't know.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.880]   You'd think that you would want the same friends.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.680]   Right.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.680]   You think that you would--
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.040]   it was also really, really good.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.680]   I had Google Places on the go all the time.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.600]   It was really good at showing me places that I've been or
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.440]   have been interested in.
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:56.080]   Like I had this--
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.200]   Oh, it uses your web history.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.640]   It uses your web history.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.880]   Yeah, it uses your web history.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.440]   So I had this moment of like, oh, Google knows so much about
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:03.960]   me.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:06.400]   Look at all these places around me that I like.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:10.000]   So I had a moment of, you know, when you go to a therapist,
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.400]   you kind of confess all these secrets.
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:12.920]   And then the therapist repeats them back to you, and you're
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:13.680]   surprised.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.200]   Like that's kind of how it felt.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.120]   Like, yes, I have given you all this information.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:23.560]   I didn't know there were that many dungeons in San Diego.
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.640]   This season.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:28.200]   So I got a gift from Google because I did register Google
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:28.560]   Places.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.720]   You know, the way they register it, you could do it by phone,
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:33.240]   but if you don't have a phone number registered, they will
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.960]   send you a postcard, which you then enter the code in.
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:37.840]   And then it says, oh, yeah, you must really be at eight
[01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:38.440]   Keller Street.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.280]   So I guess that's how they're rewarding me.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:41.760]   Here it is.
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:45.520]   It says, Google Places user at eight Keller Street, inside a
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.520]   thank you gift from Google.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:49.320]   I can only imagine what wonderful--
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.240]   I thought I saved it for the show.
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.800]   What wonderful gift.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.240]   Thanks for helping keep Google Places up to date.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:59.760]   A $100 gift card for Google Ads.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:01.500]   OK.
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:02.360]   That's nice.
[01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.640]   Here, don't use my gift card.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:06.240]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.240]   You all can use it.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.960]   There you go.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.640]   First person to use $100 wins.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:12.600]   All right.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.880]   Get the screen grab.
[01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:17.000]   Wonder what happens now.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.240]   If the 1,000 people all try to use that gift card.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:24.840]   You're going to be on a do not fly list before you know it.
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:27.160]   By the way, if you want to--
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.120]   we didn't talk about it here.
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:31.920]   I suppose you probably as both as frequent flyers as I am
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.440]   as upset about the TSA regulations as everybody else
[01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.320]   seems to be.
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.080]   There is a great conversation that we had on Twitch this
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.760]   week with Odocter and Brian Brushwood and Odocter talking
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:46.040]   about the friendly search that he got according to the new
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.240]   rules coming out here.
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.760]   And apparently that's made it everywhere.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:49.800]   It was on the Dutch report.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.080]   Hannity mentioned it.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.000]   It's been on radio stations all over the country.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.480]   Of course, we get no traffic from it because everybody links
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.080]   their own copy of it.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.080]   I--
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.080]   It's brand building.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:00.640]   I was agree with you.
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.920]   It's brand building.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:02.440]   I'm just--
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:02.840]   I'm OK with it.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:05.440]   You think it's OK for them to stick their hand on your pants?
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.760]   We are going to Europe and they've
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.480]   done the round the belt thing.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:10.400]   It ain't round the belt, dude.
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:11.000]   Well--
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.480]   You understand, it's not round the belt.
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.840]   They will squeeze your genitals.
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.560]   She is drowning them.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.560]   She can't talk.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.560]   She can't talk.
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.520]   But in fact--
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.680]   Being a teenager again.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:36.760]   If you refuse the x-ray, they are required to fondle you.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.400]   How do you feel now?
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.400]   I--
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.320]   They ain't round the belt.
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.440]   What's the name of--
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.240]   blame the bozo with the underwear bomb?
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.440]   You know, what are we going to do?
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.520]   Well, and some of the number of people pointed out
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:52.520]   that if you have stored something in a body cavity,
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.480]   that none of these procedures will work.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.240]   I don't know if I should be telling you that.
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.760]   An eel dash wrote a good post today.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:01.120]   The guy I feel sorry for is the guy who's job that is.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.800]   Well, that's why national opt-out date's
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.760]   going to be so much fun the day before Thanksgiving.
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:07.440]   No, that's really rude to do to people trying to go home.
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:07.960]   I know.
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:08.480]   I know.
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:09.240]   I'm going to slow it down.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.840]   I want to wait extra long to get homework Thanksgiving,
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.760]   for sure.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:12.760]   I guess so.
[01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:15.080]   I just put on the rundown.
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.440]   I put a link at the bottom.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.000]   The Taiwanese animators have struck again on this topic.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:20.680]   Oh, OK.
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:21.560]   Well, let's watch that.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.760]   Is it a video?
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:23.440]   Yeah, it's a video.
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.600]   All right, we'll watch that video as we close out.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.640]   The show Jeff Jarvis is the author of,
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.520]   "What Would Google Do?"
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:35.640]   And soon to be a major motion picture, no.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:37.680]   But there will be another book, "Public Parts."
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:39.160]   I have an idea for that, a sitcom.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:39.680]   But we'll get back to it.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:40.400]   A sitcom?
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.760]   What would Google do to the sitcom?
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.520]   He's also a blogger at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:46.520]   Thank you, Jeff, for being here.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.000]   Really appreciate it.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:52.200]   Gina Trapani blogs at smarterwared.org when she's not
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.640]   giggling or listening to--
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:56.600]   Shricking or dancing or listening to me.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.640]   And to mention that it's penis, which happens more than you
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:03.520]   think, it's enough to send me into just giggles.
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.240]   Well, if you thought that--
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.400]   Thank you very much, Mr. Pani.
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:09.240]   Thank you very much.
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.600]   It makes you giggle.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:13.400]   They always laugh at my mighty sword, in the words of Randy
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.000]   Newman.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.280]   We will leave you with this new TSA procedures,
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:20.200]   spur airport rage from the Taiwanese animators.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.480]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.480]   We'll see you next week on This Week.
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:26.480]   Oh, I should mention, go to twit.tv/bestev and vote
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.200]   for your best favoriteist moments from the past year

[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.600]   It's going to be a best-up for many of our shows.
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.320]   So you can vote for all-- not vote,
[01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:37.960]   but just tell us what you thought was the best moment.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.280]   And I think we had a couple's day, actually.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:44.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.200]   And we'll make a nice little compilation for you
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.080]   for the end of the year.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:50.360]   Coming up at Tech News Today, and then right
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.000]   after Tech News Today at 4 p.m.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.600]   Pacific 7 p.m. Eastern, we are going to interview Kevin Kelly.
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:58.160]   His new book is What Technology Wants, Kevin,
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.880]   one of the founding editors of Wired Magazine,
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.520]   a really smart, interesting thinker.
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.320]   Great interview.
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.400]   Yeah, I can't wait.
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.920]   Kevin Kelly coming up in about an hour on live.twit.tv.
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:08.600]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:09.640]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.880]   And now, airport raise--
[01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.480]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:15.440]   --in Chinese.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:18.360]   Americans are underarms about the increasing use
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:21.560]   of full body scanners at airports, our translate.
[01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:23.240]   That was Chinese major.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:26.640]   Many say they are an invasion of privacy.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.640]   Whoops.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:31.440]   The TSA say the new measures are designed
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:34.120]   to foil the use of explosives not detectable
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:36.960]   by conventional metal detectors.
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.440]   Passengers who refuse a scan can get a pat
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.680]   down in a private room.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:49.280]   A cell phone video of a passenger refusing both the scan
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.560]   and the pat down went viral.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.040]   This actually is true.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.320]   Critics say the enhanced security measures merely
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:58.920]   enriched former government officials with corporate interests.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:02.520]   November 24 has been designated National Opt-Out Day
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.200]   by Angry Travelers.
[01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:06.280]   Oh, geez.
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:10.680]   Nobody knows how far security measures will eventually go.
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.920]   And there's nude passengers in the airport.
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.640]   Yeah, some people are already beginning
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:16.520]   to say the terrorists have won.
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.000]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   What is this?
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.440]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:21.520]   How did you see these guys?
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.400]   They make more unfaceable--
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:24.040]   --gradable videos all the time.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:24.840]   They're hilarious.
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:26.160]   Wow, that's great.
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:27.000]   Next to media.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:27.560]   Great stuff.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.800]   Good stuff.
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:31.120]   Thank you, guys.
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:31.680]   Thank you.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.960]   Gina, you should check your mailbox.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.600]   I will.
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.360]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.640]   You're good, you're good, Joe.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.760]   There could be something very exciting in there,
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.720]   and I'll play you out just to make you feel.
[01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:42.720]   Bye-bye.
