[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.400]   Because we like to talk about everything Jeff Jarvis has the week off Ron Richards is joining us host from all about Android and
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.440]   A regular appear on our network fact Ronald beyond the new screen savers on Saturday looking forward to that
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.320]   Yeah, me too. You're still in New York though. You haven't left. I am in New York City at the moment yet
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.120]   Alright also here from Austin, Texas
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.200]   It's Stacy Higginbotham of the IOT podcast
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.440]   fame and Stacy on IOT hi Stacy
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.800]   Hello feels like you were just here you were on Twitter Sunday, which was great. Thank you. Oh
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.600]   Super fun. Yeah, love having you on to on the on Twitter because it's a
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.880]   You're gonna call it the big show. Yes, you know
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:48.040]   You caught me busted. I pity your husband man. Oh, I just said on and then that was all you had to hear
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.240]   I didn't know exactly where I was going. Anyway, we're glad to have you on the little I mean the twig
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:01.880]   And of course right now nobody's talking about anything but Apple and that'll that'll be for the next a few days
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.360]   Anyway, apples big event was this morning. They announced a new iPhone
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.760]   7 and I've I've thought for a while this might be an opportunity for Android devices
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:18.760]   Because the rumor was Apple was gonna drop the headphone jack and then indeed they did in a move that Phil Schiller called courageous
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.360]   so
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.480]   Okay, I've got kind of a counterintuitive take here if we want to learn about the Internet of things some more
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.480]   I would love to learn about that
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.000]   So I think it is courageous in the sense that
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.000]   They're making a bet on the future that's gonna alienate a lot of people today
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.280]   So I don't know is that courageous it is just
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.840]   It's a phone if they're making a bet. I mean if you really think there's a that's what I'd like to hear is there a
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.440]   coherent reason to drop something that works so darn well
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.120]   Here is my thought
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.640]   Imagine that you today you want to control home kit
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.720]   You have to talk into the Apple TV remote or you have to talk into your phone. You have to say hey Siri
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.800]   Lala la la la
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.920]   Imagine now you have something just on your ear and then it has paired with all of your devices from the iCloud
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.920]   Once you get contextual clues and you can see Apple building this you could basically walk from your you know phone
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.720]   Where your wherever your phone is into a different area and start talking to that device in your home in a sense
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.640]   They've kind of won up the Amazon Echo, which is room dependent. This is you dependent now
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.440]   That's a little crazy, but wait a minute
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.440]   Why does taking the headphone jack enable that out?
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.840]   Because you don't have you don't have wires in your phone on you
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.400]   I can walk around with some stupid it like I don't know
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.920]   I used to have way back in the day like a plantronics earbud thing that I would disconnect for my
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.160]   Were you one of those dorks that would walk around with you? Yes, yes, I was
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.680]   I was I was a journalist, you know, you're just like you have to stay on the phone. You're living on the phone
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.160]   Yeah, yeah, and this was you're like Ari gold on entourage. You just didn't ever take it out
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.800]   You just always yeah, so if you imagine that or just picture picture the movie her
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.280]   You didn't see him like taking out his headphones as you move from locale to locale. He just I don't know what he has
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.680]   That's a good point because what he had was somewhat like the AirPods that Apple announced which was a device
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.920]   That was at earbud, but also had a now his didn't have a little microphone
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:29.720]   But Apple has a little tube that's a microphone and some apparently sophisticated technology in the AirPod to being formed
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.920]   So that it knows what the ambient noise is it can aim
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.440]   You know it can it can in some way be better
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.800]   That's kind of isn't that what the Alexa does with its array microphone is it's a far-field mix far-field Mike's
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.200]   It's able to pick you up at a distance and figure out what you're saying even if there's background noise
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.400]   So maybe in that sense, you're right the AirPods would help with that
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.840]   So yeah, so that that's my take and it's courageous only in the sense that people are gonna be like
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:02.120]   These are a really expensive be easily lost right see I have to charge them all the stuff people are already complaining
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.360]   So their move is really not I mean in other words the wired headphones
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.160]   They're including in the box with the with a lightning port and the adapter that they're including the box is really just an interim stop
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.360]   Gap towards moving towards the wireless future that we all
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.880]   Will exactly that actually you know what you that does kind of make sense. I hate to admit
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.560]   Yeah, and I agree that that was the thing that jumped out at me was that the the pairing of the earbuds the phone was so seamless and
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.480]   Supposedly on the air supposedly right yeah
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.240]   And now now I think about my experience with my many Android phones and my many Bluetooth speakers and other things like that
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.560]   We're pairing is a nightmare, you know, so so is it courageous that they're taking this risk?
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.480]   You know to charge you a hundred and sixty dollars for something you're gonna lose in about a week
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:52.640]   I don't know about that but the the commitment to a wireless device or you know wireless earbud and
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.600]   Working on the protocols behind that to do that could open the door for so much more
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.160]   And so I agree to say that was the that was the one thing that caught my eye in the in the very long presentation
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:06.760]   If you want courage get rid of the lightning adapter, which is non-standard and
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.240]   proprietary and very expensive to license if they'll even let you manufacture something at all with it
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.800]   You have there's some fairly hefty requirements and go to the type-c connector that everybody else
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:26.040]   Except Apple is going to it has all of the benefits of lightning. It's reversible. It's high speed. It supports data
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.120]   In fact in many respects, I think it's probably superior to the lightning connector
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.900]   Chiefly because it's universal and so eventually we'll all have type-c connectors and type-c cables that would be courage. I
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:45.480]   Agree. I I loathe how Apple both changes its interface every two years and is constantly
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:50.840]   Different well, and they'll never go to type-c now. I mean they're going all in on lightning, right?
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.360]   This is this is Apple saying okay good. We're doubling down on lightning. This is gonna be around for years
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.000]   So I am you know I
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.720]   understand what you're saying and
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.880]   To the degree that what Apple's doing is saying that the future is wireless
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.640]   I wouldn't disagree with you. Yeah wireless and seamless so
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:18.760]   Moving from compute if you imagine computing is in everything you have to figure out a way in Apple's
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:24.560]   Maybe and I need a lot more information to like really say this is it for true, but
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.320]   the
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:35.280]   Integration with iCloud in this particular and having the intelligence and the earbuds to recognize things and switch you between places is a way to deliver that
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:42.240]   Wireless future across computing everywhere. Do you anticipate a future where we're all walking around like you used to with that little earbud in?
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.520]   I think some people will I
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:52.560]   Mean I think I think it will be situational so in your home where you have you just talk to your stuff
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.440]   Yeah, but if you're out and about in the street or in your car
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:03.280]   Maybe maybe it makes more sense to have a little earbud in I do I do I mean look that's what we love about the echo is that
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.560]   It's ambient and the in right now
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:13.160]   HomeKit is not right and that's a that's a big challenge for them. So I I don't know yeah
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:19.280]   The the scenario you you kind of lay out there reminds me of I remember back in I want to say the mid-2000s
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.400]   I went up to Redmond and saw Microsoft presented this whole they had built this whole home on their campus
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.080]   and the whole idea was that you just have a pin or something on your lapel and
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.520]   It follows you from room to room and if you're watching TV
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:38.680]   The video will go from monitor to monitor or that sort of thing and the idea of providing the the context
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.840]   Based on your location and your device serving you the services that you want based on wherever you are
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.320]   And so you know plugging that into the earbud could be a way to do that. That's really interesting
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.240]   But I like the idea of this you know frictionless it follows you
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.200]   Which is almost what you know the phones are doing at this point
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.600]   You know you've got phones that are listening
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:03.600]   You know Google now is listening you know to how you're interacting with the phone and using that to cater your the responses when you use the assistant
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:10.920]   Maybe you know it could be a step in that direction 1967 James Coburn the president's analyst
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.960]   watch
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.200]   Oh, we can't hear the looking at a miracle in modern communications would you well sir?
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.200]   Let's take a closer look
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.600]   Thanks to the science of micro electronics
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.120]   You are looking at a complete telephonic receiver and transmitter
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:33.560]   We call it the cerebrum communicator or the CC for short this dandy little device can actually perform every function of the old
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:38.680]   fashion telephone and more and it does it without any costly maintenance without
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:46.440]   Telephone poles without wires without exchanges without anything in fact except another CC in another location
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.760]   Now you're probably wondering why have we made it so small
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:56.600]   Because it will be smallest communicator we've ever made your own brain now
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.360]   Fantastic
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.360]   Well, not quite know
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:09.560]   Technically speaking for you doctors we inject the CC into the internal carotid heart
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:15.800]   Blood stream carries it directly to the cerebrum where it lodges okay me we haven't gotten to that point yet
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.040]   Oh, god. I hope not that's not courageous. That's Coburn
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.360]   They're researching ways to embed electronics in
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:30.800]   biosafe materials for those exact type of purposes exactly what I want my I know I want to be jacked in man
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:31.440]   I
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.320]   My sister is first in line for when Disney is able to take that magic band technology and make it into an injectable
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.800]   So you just walk around the park and it does whatever you want
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.280]   She's she's openly said that she would she would take that surgery. So
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.840]   What about you Ron? I don't know you let your sister's scoop you
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.800]   Don't go to Disney that much
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.320]   Anyway, Apple I think
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:03.920]   As skeptical as I was about whatever they did with the iPhone 7 I think that they showed enough good stuff including a camera that looks pretty impressive
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:09.920]   to to show that they still have a shot in a world where Android is
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:17.480]   Lapping them every few months. There's a new Android phone with new features in fact many have pointed out the LG G5
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:23.280]   Had dual cameras and many of the features that Apple is now touting in the iPhone 7
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.680]   Did you ever run?
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:32.360]   I've played with the G5. I haven't used it. I didn't you reviewed it briefly and I was underwhelmed actually by the photography the camera
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.700]   I didn't the laser focusing and all that just didn't wow me. I still prefer a
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.640]   S7 or or the note 7
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:46.720]   To the G5 and and I'm but I will get the iPhone 7 just to see what the camera that's assuming your note
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.280]   Your note 7 doesn't explode in your okay now. I want to talk about that. Let's take a break because I did not
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:59.040]   Turn mine in and I'll tell you why I didn't in just a second the first a word from ring the video doorbell
[00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.560]   That's changing the world. I see rings all over Petaluma now and it's not a surprise
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.400]   I might have been the first to get one though
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:12.200]   I we put our ring in months ago and I love it because I can see it anytime when somebody's coming or going at my house and when
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.680]   I'm expecting a part by the way an important package
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.240]   I may interrupt this show to speak to the livery guy because I'm not home and it's they said
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.960]   You're gonna need to sign for it and I really want it
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.120]   So I'm gonna try to talk to the livery guy. He'll ring the doorbell and I'll go yeah
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.360]   I'm I'm not gonna tell him I'm at work. I'm gonna say I'm in the bathtub
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:37.560]   Can you just leave it there and I'll sign for it later. We'll see if that'll work the ring doorbell has a high def camera
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:45.040]   It has a speaker it has a microphone and it's it replaces your existing wired doorbell a year
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.840]   If you don't have a wired doorbell still work
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.680]   It has a year long lithium ion battery in there that you could recharge
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:56.960]   It comes with all the tools you need including a level to install it just right in a variety of finishes to match your home
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:14:03.160]   It rings your ding donger in the hall just like always, but it also rings your phone or your tablet
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:08.440]   Anywhere in the world over the internet because it it's it signs up to your Wi-Fi
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:14.400]   I love the ring video doorbell because even if somebody's just walking up my stupor walking by
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:20.280]   The motion detector inside will let me know now if you don't hear the ding donger in the hall
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:26.800]   Don't worry. You can get the ring chime plugs into any outlet also joins the Wi-Fi and that'll ring in your workshop or you know
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.520]   The basement or the attic wherever you can't hear the doorbell. That's a nice feature
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.320]   They have actually a variety of new things to stick up cam
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:41.400]   Which is a ring video doorbell without the doorbell part so a camera plus speaker and microphone that lets you monitor other parts of your home
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:47.440]   the backyard the side yard and it's it is wireless because it also comes with a
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.960]   Fantastic solar panel that'll keep it charged
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.960]   day in day out what a great idea and then they've just added this and I
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.200]   Vorted this from my house if you use the rings systems
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.640]   They have now a ring sign. You know how you have a security sign you put these are very effective by the way
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:08.880]   Frankly this is the biggest deterrent of all and this is solar so it lights up even at night
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.720]   The bad guys can see that you are protected by the ring of
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.840]   Security take a look at the security bundles. They offer at ring.com
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.960]   Slash twig up to a hundred fifty dollars off a ring of security bundle
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.880]   Depending on what you need in there at ring
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:33.320]   Dot-com slash twig. I'm a big fan of ring video door by love our ring video doorbell
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.200]   I know you will to ring dot-com slash
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.240]   twig
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:45.000]   It was really handy when I abby was my daughter was living with us because I could say how come you came home so late last
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.080]   I'm very crazy wait you wait Stacy you'll be using that in a couple years you'll be I believe it you'll be needing that you'll be
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.360]   So
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.680]   recall
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.040]   recall
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:07.160]   Poor I almost feel for Samsung because they rush the note seven out hoping to scoop apple right get this out the door
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:12.080]   Get people talking about the note seven before the iPhone seven steals all the thunder
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:18.040]   But one little problem Apple second source their batteries that used to use a Chinese company
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.280]   They're still using that but they're also making their own batteries in Samsung's own
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:26.200]   Factories and apparently it's this this is really embarrassing. It's the Samsung batteries
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.320]   That are overheating and exploding
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:35.000]   I think I mentioned this last week and maybe not because I got it on I think on Friday the email
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.160]   From T-Mobile where I got my phone saying you can turn it in and then either wait for a new note
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.760]   seven will happen in a week or two or you can get a refund and
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:51.400]   I thought well, I've already reviewed I'm gonna get a refund then and then I thought but I kind of like it and
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:55.640]   Then I read something now tell me if I'm nuts and I'm not recommending this
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.040]   but the Wall Street Journal and others reported that because
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:07.200]   the phones made in China couldn't use the Korean Samsung batteries
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.880]   Those were not being recalled because all the Chinese batteries were okay
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.520]   It was the Samsung batteries that were causing problems
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:25.800]   Interestingly T-Mobile of all the US carriers is the only one that was offering phones made in China
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.560]   Everybody else was getting the phones made in Korea or elsewhere
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:33.240]   So they this article I don't know
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:38.280]   I don't know how reliable it is said check the back of your phone if it says made in China
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:45.520]   Which this does you don't have to worry you have the Chinese battery in it and I have to say I've never felt it to overheat
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.280]   I've quick charged it many times never seen a problem
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.640]   It doesn't get I feel it doesn't get too hot it's warm
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:57.520]   But doesn't get too hot and most of the time I'm wirelessly charging it at a slower pace anyway. I thought I'd take a chance
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.360]   Crazy crazy crazy man crazy is it?
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:07.800]   I don't know do you talk with it in your pocket or up to your ear which which do you want to explode?
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.440]   No, it only explodes when you're charging it. Oh
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.520]   Yeah, it doesn't just randomly blow up. It's from overcharging
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.680]   Okay, well like the hoverboards and I still by the way have a hover an exploding hoverboard at home
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:26.240]   And the only rule we have is you have to be home when you charge it so if it's close it'll hit you
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.640]   Are you just you just waiting for it to explode? Yeah?
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:35.920]   No, I feel like now and I'm and by the way, I'm not advocating this but I feel like that was enough evidence
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.920]   I couldn't understand why they weren't recalling it in China and that that seemed like a
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.520]   Incredible story to me and this is made in China if it does overheat
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:50.600]   Can you return it then for a reason? Yeah? I'm sure I could oh so it's a win-win
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.600]   Yeah, well as long as it doesn't blow up and melt my face or burn the house down
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:00.080]   It's a work or cause two thousand dollars with a damaged hotel room like that one poor staff food in so Australia
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.400]   Not poor sap poor guy, but yeah, he that's plugged it in his hotel and it blew up. Oh, oh
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.800]   Oh
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:13.400]   See I see this is why I didn't want to do it because I want to have the phone with me when I take going vacation in
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.620]   A week from Sunday and I didn't think I'd have a new phone replacement by then
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:23.840]   But now I know I'm gonna be able to get an iPhone 7 so maybe I know I really like the note 7
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:32.680]   It's it's really a bummer because I don't think I have seen a launch of a phone with so much goodwill
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.160]   Behind it then this is a lot of positive views
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.000]   I mean every every Samsung launch has been strong today
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.120]   You know you've seen a lot of great stuff with the galaxy line and things like that
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:50.200]   But this note 7 it just seems universally praised and now this is just like it's a snapback to just completely rejected and like
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.880]   Oh, it's you know like careful
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:55.120]   It's gonna blow up because once you hear that some phones are being recalled and blown up
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.800]   That just damages the entire line right and it's it's hard to recover from that
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.600]   Not it clearly Samsung stock is taking a hit and they're gonna see declined sales a billion and a half
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:09.280]   Charge against earnings on this it's gonna cost them a lot of money. They'd sold
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:15.680]   Well now somebody saying two and a half million of them only third only 35 explosions
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.320]   I mean those are good eyes
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:24.720]   And the thing is is that I mentioned this last night on all about Android and then I saw it
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.280]   Earlier today, but the FAA is cracking down on lithium ion
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:33.560]   Right you can't you can't carry lithium ion batteries and check luggage right and now they're looking at this phone
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.000]   And they might ban this phone completely. Oh that would be bad if I couldn't get on the plane with it
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.120]   Yeah, what if I promise not to charge it?
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.360]   I'll turn it off and just leave it sitting it's not gonna explain
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.240]   It's just a thing and I think that some of this is overblown
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:50.160]   I mean it's not gonna explode just sitting in your pocket. It's you have to it's not a ticking time bomb. Yeah, yeah, exactly
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.400]   I don't know somebody in the chat room says I have my my note seven came from
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:03.560]   Sprint it also says made in China and I use fast charging and never gets hot
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:09.200]   Look on the back. That's the one that's where you want to look is it'll say in the fine print
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.040]   It'll say whether it was made in Singapore made in China made in Korea
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.000]   and
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.040]   Suppose Samsung's not telling us this and in fact the consumer reports that Samsung should do an official recall
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:25.920]   They are not doing that through the CPSC the consumer product safety commission
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:34.600]   If you do an official recall it becomes illegal to sell these and and and the speculation is Samsung doesn't want to do that because there are people still selling note
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.600]   Simmons
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:43.360]   In fact Samsung one of the options that T mobile gives me is hang on to the phone to learn we have a replacement then you can bring it in
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.120]   Doesn't sound like they're really concerned
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:53.720]   Yeah, well, I mean it's such a the percentage it's it's interesting because we were again
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.160]   We were talking about this lesson all about Android
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.160]   we were wondering how much of
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:03.480]   Because Jason Hal brought the question did Samsung know about this right is that why we have this recall program in place
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.880]   So quickly and my argument was that they have they have a you know
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.960]   In emergency break glass plan for when something like this goes wrong with other prior
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.760]   I'm assuming this that you know God forbid something goes wrong that they don't they don't know about this is what we need to do
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:21.120]   In order to stay on the side of consumer safety and pro consumer values and all that sort of thing
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.640]   But I wonder if they have any way of estimating you know
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.320]   Yes, we've only heard this only been 35
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:32.960]   But is there some percentage of the ones that have been sold like is there some what is their risk assessment of what this risk is and that
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.240]   Could be driving how dramatically they're pushing for the the exchange or not
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:41.600]   Right and I think consumer reports isn't far off when they say Samsung should be more
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.120]   forthcoming about this and more aggressive
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.840]   yeah
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:50.360]   But and the thing is that now if someone's walking up to a store to go buy a note
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.840]   No, it's seven if they've heard about this five bucks is there walking away there?
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.840]   you're reconsidering that that's right and
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.680]   Of course the whole point of rushing this out and I think they did rush it a little bit was
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.120]   Was to get it
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:09.440]   Into the market before Apple got theirs into the market and now that apples is coming in the market soon by the way sooner than normal
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.440]   It's coming out a week from Friday
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:17.680]   Pre-order this Friday, which I'm very happy to see I've been I've been longtime railing that I can't stand the and this
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:23.480]   Here's the presentation and this is gonna be available in a month or in whatever like I want to see day of like you can buy it now
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.560]   Like I'm waiting till we get to that point and it seems like we're getting closer and closer
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.400]   I understand why because of supply chain and all this sort of things
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.800]   But like this also seemed to be one of the leakiest not to go back to Apple
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:38.800]   But one of the leakiest launches and that you know there stuff was up on Amazon an hour before the presentation
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:44.560]   You know so it looks like they're trying to move closer to that simultaneous release, you know
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:48.080]   Opportunity
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.200]   Given those leaks, maybe they'll rethink that strategy. Yeah, maybe
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:59.600]   By the way, they made a illusion of the leaks. It's funny James Corden. They did a phony carpool karaoke at the very beginning
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:04.000]   Video and one of the first things James Corden says to Tim Cook is well
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.040]   I kind of know all about it because I read all the rumors
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.200]   So even Apple can laugh at itself in that respect, I guess
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:18.360]   So
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:26.120]   Anyway, there are gonna be other choices in fact according to the rumor mill once again
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.400]   the new Google phones are coming and
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.800]   I was hoping we'd talk about that. Yeah October 4th
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.960]   Are you excited? Stacey use a 5x or 6p?
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.640]   I'd use a 5x because the 6p is too big right and I would love to get a new phone. That's not
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.160]   this feels
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:50.480]   It's perfectly good phone, but it feels a little chintzy like many of Google's hardware efforts
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:54.080]   Yeah, and I'm not sure if the is it the pixels
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.400]   Yeah, there's a
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:56.920]   They're gonna
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:02.800]   Yeah, the rumor is that they're dropping the Nexus brand and they're gonna be the pixel and the pixel XL
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.960]   Which when you say pixel XL
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:10.840]   So like so pixel pixel pixel pixel pixel pixel. Yeah, it's difficult sounds like a Mayan king pixel total
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:20.200]   Yeah, I'm that I want to see these I okay. This is the problem. I have on the one hand
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:27.200]   I think it's fair to say if you're gonna buy an Android phone the safest phone to buy is one from Google a it's gonna continue to get updates
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:33.000]   Longer than any other phone and be Google's gonna push out those monthly security updates
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.560]   So it'll be the safest phone with the best future ahead of it and yet
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:43.820]   Hardware wise these phones never seem to be quite as good as
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.320]   other companies phones. I mean I really didn't then I would love to put
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.120]   You know
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.320]   vanilla
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.720]   Nougat on my note seven
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.200]   Get that get all the note hardware
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:03.160]   But the the purity of the Google experience do you think run that the pixel phones will be?
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.880]   Finally true flagship phones or just a notch below
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:13.120]   They're always they're always just a notch below and I'm not quite sure why I mean like some of the rumors going into this
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:18.400]   Were that Google was gonna embrace their own manufacturing chain, you know similar to how they did with the pixel C
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:25.080]   But these the at least the rumors to these phones that that's not gonna be the case and they're actually gonna be HTC
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:31.500]   Kind of based off of the HTC one a nine line of phones that's so similar kind of you know
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.320]   Aluminum metal kind of casing just with the two different sizes
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.600]   So if you believe that then you know my guests and based off of HTC's been doing
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.480]   They will still not be as good as the Samsung, you know
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.480]   No, it's seven from a camera standpoint or just from a total phone standpoint
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:50.080]   But for whatever reason Google feels that these are the best foot forward
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.640]   I agree with you the next the next response have been in my opinion, you know the next five
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.440]   I use I use that phone for and a year and a half. I think that was a great phone
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:04.640]   But the camera was secondary. Yes battery life was secondary and I just want to see them be as good as
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:11.360]   Yeah, I think and I'm not sure what the Venn diagram is on this, but I
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.440]   Know that when I was buying my phone
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:20.360]   I looked at all the reviews and man reviewers were killing the 5x because it had like a plastic e exterior and blah blah blah
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.360]   and I was kind of like you know what I
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:27.320]   Okay with that and you know, I don't know how many normal people
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:34.640]   Really like spend a lot of time worrying about like megapixels on your cameras and having things be the optimal thing
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:42.360]   I but I also don't know of those normal people how many actually care about having base Android so that's that's my curiosity
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.920]   Yeah, and this is I think you're right
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:50.200]   I think I think we overestimate the audience for the Nexus line also because it's just a challenge to get
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:53.720]   I mean, you know, it's it's you got to go to Google's website to buy it, you know
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:58.880]   They had a couple of in-store opportunities, but they haven't really embraced getting into carriers never pushed these phones
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.920]   Carriers would much rather you bought something else. I
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.400]   Didn't have a hard time getting
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.520]   Mine hooked up with Verizon at all. No, but once you get it
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:14.080]   It's just you have to go to Google to get it. That's a different process that most people are used to I also think some people really
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:18.000]   Embrace the additional features that other companies put on
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.800]   I mean, there's a reason why Samsung has all these weird
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.880]   quirky touch was type features
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:29.440]   Their cameras have a lot more going on than the Google vanilla cameras
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:33.000]   You know, they have a lot of interesting
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.600]   You know
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:41.600]   Features with the touch the edge and so forth. I think I think those are those I don't know if they prize them Leo
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:46.000]   I think I think that Samsung trying to differentiate themselves and show independence in the marketplace
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:51.600]   But I don't I'm not sure if they are the kind of thing where people like oh I get Samsung because I love touch was in fact
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.360]   You know the majority people that talk talk to either don't even know that there's a difference
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:00.680]   It just looks different than my phone or the people who do know what they're talking about don't like touch was right?
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:06.640]   So, you know, I think it's really just an identity thing and a branding thing to say that hey, we're doing something different
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:11.280]   But Stacy, I know the reason you're excited about this announcement is not the phones per se
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:16.120]   But everything else that Google be talking about although you have to think just as you
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:21.720]   Mention in a way that some of the what apples long-term strategy with the iPhone has to do with home kit that Google's strategy
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:27.400]   With these pixel phones should somehow integrate with Google Home and other other things, right? Oh
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.360]   For you. Yes
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:35.640]   Okay, so this ties into Google Home, which is why I'm bringing it up now last week on this week in Google
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.880]   We talked about Nest and the software developers moving over to Google from Nest
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:44.640]   So I talked to Nest this week and one of the things they told me was that story
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:50.200]   It was a little exaggerated what's happening is the works with Nest engineers
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:58.640]   Some of those software folks are moving over to Google to help create a more integrated experience around works with Nest and presumably
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.520]   They didn't go this far Google Home. So
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:05.160]   If you look it actually we shouldn't even say Google Home
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:11.040]   We should probably say Google products because if you look at the on hub router that just got Philips light support
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.760]   Yeah, I think what you're gonna see is Google bringing all of its smart home stuff into
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.520]   The on hub this this home device that we're gonna learn more about on October 4th
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.960]   Maybe we'll even get some cool stuff with Chromecast. I have no idea
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.000]   So that that's kind of what that
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.440]   Nest news was about so that's that okay a realignment
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.280]   Not a reorganization
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.880]   Yes, because they still got lovely shop for people
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.160]   I'm like, I'm not gonna give it that much
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.800]   It's just not everybody's going over. Yeah, it was kind of what people were thinking
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:50.360]   But they wanted they wanted a group of smart people coming over to work on this overall strategy
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.680]   Yeah, and it could be that
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.600]   Google is saying you know guys
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:31:01.160]   Y'all are not y'all are not making it here. Let's let's bring more stuff in house
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.640]   Well or it would make sense that we want everything to work together
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:10.640]   And so we want the nest stuff to work with whatever Google stuff we you know is going on too
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:16.560]   Well, that was the original that was the original hope when they acquired nest was that because at the time if you remember when they acquired nest
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.000]   Google was dangling the idea of Google Home and I remember seeing some
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.200]   Animations of you drive up to your the house and the lights turn on all the sort of stuff and we all thought oh nest
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.720]   We'll integrate, you know brilliantly with that and then there was just no integration
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:34.560]   So, you know, hopefully that this is the step in that direction because honestly, I think that's the power
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:40.320]   I mean like the the Google home device that hopefully we're gonna see more on October 4th of the little air freshener that they showed
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:45.280]   At Google I/O I can't wait for it because if you ask me that's the that's the Alexa killer
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:50.840]   That's the you know, like that's that's they're gonna be their opportunity to really, you know kind of finally
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:56.600]   Dive into the home and provide a product that people can't live without similar to how people can't live without the echo
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.360]   Will it work better with the pixel? Well, this stuff I
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:07.480]   Think I think if you have if you're using Google now and the Google now assistant and you're fully baked in to the Google ecosystem
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:12.640]   This is just gonna it's gonna supercharge so they're gonna pull an apple. I mean essentially what Apple's done
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:20.400]   Even especially now with the headphones is say look all Apple just you have to use everything has to be Apple
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:25.240]   If you want it to work you got to be using Apple gear and Google hasn't done this
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.640]   I mean it but could do this right
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:32.440]   They haven't I think they'll still keep
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:34.120]   Google calendar
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:38.200]   I mean because you can work with Google on the echo right now. I get my calendar on that
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:43.520]   I think they're gonna keep a lot of that open and keep their apps basically. I guess is what it would be
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.920]   with iOS and with
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.480]   Amazon's ecosystem so
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:55.840]   Maybe maybe they'll go that's like that's the Microsoft strategy which is
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.240]   Reach out to other platforms and make ourselves available to it
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:05.000]   But Microsoft's always been clear the best experience will be if you're in an all Microsoft world
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.240]   That's what Google's saying is oh no, we'll make calendar available. It would be better if you were to use
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:14.040]   Google branded devices
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:21.680]   And I think I mean like again when I see it, I'm gonna feel very torn on home versus right
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.280]   The echo no you have to give up one or the other well
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:31.120]   And I've always thought that it's it basically comes down to whose services you use the most
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.960]   You know I am an Amazon Prime member, but I'm not you know
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:40.040]   I'm not really I don't dive into the Amazon offering so I haven't pulled the trigger on an echo
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.040]   I haven't pulled the trigger on a fire team
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.960]   That is you should yeah
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.800]   Well, I know I've heard but but the promise of you know
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.960]   The Google air freshener to bring me that you know echo experience
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:01.640]   But times 10 with all of my calendaring and all my mail and all my everything that I already do within Google to me
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.560]   Like that's that's what I feel like I'd be frustrated with with the echo and that it stops at shopping
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:11.680]   Well, it's the same thing with Amazon with Apple TV like if you do iTunes you need an Apple TV
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:19.480]   But on the other hand if you do Amazon you want a Roku or some other similar device or an Android TV device or you just get both
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.600]   And I think a lot of people do that
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:26.240]   I think a lot of people will have an echo and a sauce and a and a Google home
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:30.560]   And then you just you just leave the house and let them fight it out well they have different trigger words
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:35.760]   So you just you know you'll use you don't you're not gonna do that Stacy you're gonna pick one
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.840]   I think you're overestimating a the budget of the mainstream American consumer
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:46.160]   That's only a matte major gadget how it would go like yes people like us will probably have yeah a lot of those things
[00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:48.960]   but most people are gonna choose and
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:54.640]   You know, maybe they'll choose poorly and I would say Ron. I can't believe you don't have an echo
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.400]   I mean god Ron. What's wrong with you? I know I can't
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:04.400]   I've spent the minutes hovering over that buy button just like and I and for whatever reason
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.360]   It's cheaper now though, right? It's getting cheaper and cheaper. You were smart to wait
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:12.240]   Yeah, a little fuckers out those are the refer get a refurbished who cares if it's refurbished
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.720]   Yeah, now what 179 99
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:19.440]   And then the refurbished one is usually $30 less. I think get a refurb
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.720]   Yeah, I should just to play with it just to at least compare the two
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.480]   I mean I've seen it, you know, I've played with it
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:27.120]   We you know like I have friends who have it and I get it
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:31.200]   But to me as soon as they announced that google I owe there like keep calling it the air fresher
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:35.200]   But as soon as they announced the air freshener, I was just like all right. I'm gonna wait on the echo until
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:39.040]   Well, that's true. That actually is in the bag. Okay. Yeah, because I've had mine since
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:45.200]   Yeah, we got it before the air freshener. Yeah, wait before the air freshener. Yeah, and I'm all in on google so I'm
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:52.720]   Yeah, well, you say you say that it's more than just shopping and I get that it's got access to music and also and is it just the
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:58.880]   User experience that is so delightful about it. Like what Stacy. What is it that then that has you thinking I should get one
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.840]   So I use it to control my my home
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.040]   So, okay
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.520]   If I talk to the echo right now like when I go to bed and like echo turn off downstairs turn off
[00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.160]   Afro circus, which is a light
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:14.080]   That my daughter named wait a minute your lights called the afro circus
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.120]   Do you remember mad a gas car? Yeah
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:19.440]   Yeah, so
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.840]   The afro circus song so my daughter named my wevo switch afro circus or one of those
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.880]   Staira goal. I love your daughter. She is so great. She's so cool
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:32.160]   Strange. I mean and she is so strange
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.080]   Uh
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.480]   But yeah, so i'm you do you talk to it all the time. You can have it program your commutes
[00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:42.400]   I mean, I don't know we play bingo with it. I mean, it's great. You play bingo
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:48.000]   Yeah, there's a bingo there's a bingo skill. So you know if you ever want to have bingo night at our house because r
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.640]   53 r
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.080]   53
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.440]   Wow
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:58.160]   I want you know of all the things that will be announced probably on this october 4th thing
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:05.120]   I'm most excited about aloe of all things. I want to use aloe everywhere. I I feel like that is the embodiment of
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:11.520]   a home or echo in my phone where it really should be so I have it with me at all times
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:16.400]   I'm getting worried about aloe though. Why why because well because we because duo came out
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:19.840]   And it was really simple duos not bad
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:27.440]   But it but it was just really just did that one thing and you couldn't even you know if you if someone called you and you
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:31.840]   Didn't miss the call they can't there was no messaging. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, so and then aloe
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:35.200]   The reports that it's gonna need an android
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:41.360]   7.0 update the 701 to support api's to drive aloe has got me worried
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.200]   And the fact that we haven't seen anything and they were supposed to launch around the same time
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:51.280]   Yeah, I'm excited for aloe too because I want I want the combination of a cross platform unified messaging platform
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.520]   That I can use with my iphone friends
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.040]   But also having the google assistant baked into it looks super cool
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:01.520]   But the silence has got me concerned is this stuff harder to do than we
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.480]   I mean arguably google has the lead in this kind of virtual assistant world
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:11.600]   Well, I think what we're seeing oh go ahead. No, no, I'm just a single
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:16.160]   I was gonna say google's betting its whole future on machine learning, right?
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.760]   Yeah, so what you're seeing is the google assistant stuff if you look at what apples launched
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.480]   it's betting on
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:27.600]   Easy to use hardware and integration. Yes, they have a machine learning component
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:32.800]   But it's not anywhere near googles and so it's kind of these two versions of the future battling out
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.280]   And I think they're pre-announcing things
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:40.800]   or putting things out before they're fully ready because they're trying to drive towards these respective visions
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:47.360]   And maybe that's just what we're seeing here. Okay. Well, and if anything we I always use my baseball analogy
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.720]   But we're in the we're in the first inning. Maybe the second inning
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:56.080]   And you go back to the her analogy of you know the little earbud in the operating system that is aware
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.960]   I think if anybody has the opportunity to make that
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:05.680]   Concept the reality it's google because they have how many years of all this machine learning data that I put together on how people search
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:13.280]   And you know do all these things. I realized a little while ago that at some point that I don't know when I stopped searching
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:21.760]   via boolean keyword based searches on google and moved back to the old ash g's where I just ask google questions now and I don't know when that happened
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.240]   but that behavior is being
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.120]   rewarded with really great search results
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.160]   So
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.560]   You know, I feel like it's good google has the edge there absolutely
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.880]   Also very good news for people who love the nexus seven and there are not a few of them
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:44.800]   Uh, there will apparently be it announced at this event at least according to nine to five google google a seven inch tablet built by wah way
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:50.240]   Who builds by the way the six p and does a very nice job with four gigs of ram
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.440]   Pixel c I think we can safely write off as an aberration. I think it's over
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:01.040]   Uh, but I would love to see a seven inch the nexus sevens are so great and so affordable
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:03.520]   It'd be very interesting to see what this
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:10.560]   Although seven has been confused because a seven isn't that much bigger than the six p or what will be the bigger than a phone
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:12.400]   But you know, you don't want a seven inch phone
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:18.560]   No, but but would you rather have an eight inch tablet? I that's the no, but I mean some people would
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:23.840]   And there are plenty god knows there's plenty of tablets in a variety of sizes and right tablets
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.400]   Samsung's making some pretty good tablets, but but what's missing is that seven inch
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.480]   I think
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.320]   Well, I also I also wonder how viable the tablet market is these days. Maybe maybe not
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.200]   New new watches. Although I have to say we saw this
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:44.000]   I'm i'm a little torn because the ties in based samsung gear three that we saw at ifa at efa
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.200]   Was very impressive looked very good. Of course it'll require a samsung phone. I'm sure
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:56.400]   Um google will do this time according to again 95 google some android wear watches that are branded by google
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.280]   Which would be interesting to see
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.600]   um
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.080]   I feel I feel like
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.560]   I'm waiting for android wear to make a breakthrough
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:11.760]   Just as I was waiting. It's still am frankly. I think for the apple watch to make a breakthrough
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.520]   Yeah, well, I mean
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:19.440]   Aside from just having new watches that are thinner or do you know or have more buttons or don't have buttons or whatnot
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:23.200]   I don't really know where the android where platform can go from here
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:29.040]   I mean we're due for a you know like what can the latest version of android bring to android wear
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:34.080]   Which we really haven't heard yet. Um, but I just feel like the wearable market is still a market
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.200]   That's that's a solution still looking for a problem. Yeah
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:43.840]   Fork it watches are go ahead. Oh, no, I was just gonna say I think watches are there they're just
[00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:50.480]   I don't know. They're they're not something I feel like a lot of people. I don't think people really want full on computing on their wrist
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.640]   I don't know
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.280]   Well, you um actually are very mainstream on that. Um, the latest the latest
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.080]   From idc
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:03.040]   And of course idc is guessing somewhat they don't know
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.760]   Um, no apple doesn't release watch sales and so we don't know exactly
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:12.320]   What those sales are but according to idc apple watch is losing ground
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:15.920]   As basics boom and you're wearing a fit bit
[00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:21.120]   You're wearing one of the more basic. I'm actually or is that a under armor. Oh, okay
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:26.880]   But I did just get ta ta let's see if I can show it to you. Nope come out
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.280]   I'm charging it
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.760]   Wow, this is this isn't
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.880]   This is a phillips smartwatch that is supposed to be a dedicated true health wearable
[00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:38.880]   So i'm going to play with this and see how that works
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.560]   Well, those seem to be doing better
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:45.200]   In fact, the simpler ones do better because I think people realize there's only a couple of things a health watch
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.080]   Health ban can do footsteps and heartbeat
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.120]   um, the fit bit has showed growth
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.840]   of 28
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.080]   Year over year and a 25 market share compared
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:04.880]   To the number three product apples watch which only has a 20 market share and fell
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:10.960]   56.7 percent year over year in sales. That's again a gas from idc
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:14.720]   Uh, and those are global sales in global market share
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:19.760]   But I think that sounds about right it doesn't seem to me that people have chosen the simpler
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:26.560]   More you know, less expensive fit bits over the expensive and more complicated apple watches
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.880]   And and by the way, and right is not it's not any and where it's not anywhere
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.240]   I was just because there that's because they're anything but basic and I think that's the real
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.360]   I think that's the real issue is that people, you know got the opportunity
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:42.960]   To sample what a smartwatch can do and realize that in a postage stamp size watch
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.480]   Navigating things and you know, it's really a pain in the butt
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.480]   So go with something that just you know, tracks your pedometer and tracks your heart rate
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.320]   And that does one thing and it works with a companion app or a website and that's great
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:56.480]   You know, so I'm not surprised by this at all
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:02.400]   4k chromecast I would like to see that for everything should go 4k now that I have a 4k tv
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:10.000]   I'm just saying how does how does that work on a because I know my chromecast like if you open the door wrong in my house
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.080]   My chromecast stops, you know
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:16.320]   Broadcasting so there's really it feels my chromecast is very tenuous
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:22.240]   And I have really great Wi-Fi and you have an ear oh, right you have the ear. I have I have several earos
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.280]   Yeah
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:30.320]   Yeah, so I'm not I'm not in my tv is actually hardwired. So I wonder if your chromecast is funky
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:34.320]   I don't have that problem with my chromecast. Is that an official official thing?
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:40.240]   Okay, okay, okay, chromecast so maybe I'll try the 4k, but I'm kind of like god you want to shove more data at that thing
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.320]   I don't know if it can handle it
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.400]   Well, yeah, you'd have to redesign it. It'd have to have a faster chip and
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:53.120]   So forth and yeah, I guess the broadband would have to work because you're gonna need a lot of throughput to make 4k work
[00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.560]   That is true. Yeah
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:01.600]   And finally remember Google announced the it's VR initiative. What was that daydream?
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.360]   Daydream correct
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:08.720]   There apparently maybe we'll announce a daydream headset not that anybody's clamoring for one
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.080]   This is gonna be a big event. We'll do live coverage
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:17.040]   I'm sure if they if they send out invites and and we get a confirmation, but this is all
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.200]   Rumor from 9-5 mac, which is a pretty good track record in this regard
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:26.560]   And they've also historically shied away from doing events other than google. I oh haven't they like didn't didn't one year
[00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:30.000]   They just that dropped it all on their blog. Huh? Like you know, so
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.520]   Did they launch that remember that weird octopus looking thing?
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.400]   Um, what was that that was like a tv thing?
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:41.440]   Didn't they launch that in its own event the queue the queue was that I oh that was
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:45.360]   I still have my next right that I got it. Oh, yeah
[00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:48.320]   I'm banking on that being worth a pretty penny in about 20 years
[00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:54.080]   I think I would do a dedicated thing for the nexus the original nexus phone
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:46:00.480]   I'm trying to remember now. I'm trying to remember too. Are you right? I that's right. They don't normally do that do they?
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:05.120]   They have yeah, they haven't done big dog and pony shows other than google I oh, which makes sense
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   But yeah, but this is this is going to be their big consumer push. I mean going into the holidays
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.960]   So we're you're gonna. A lot of stuff dumped on us
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:13.360]   I'll be very surprised if there is a daydream headset though
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:16.240]   Just because I feel like the days of daydream are so early
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.800]   Um, in fact, you know very few phones can support it
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.400]   We haven't seen any real development unless they have some big partnership there announcing
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.400]   I would be surprised that that actually happens
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:31.200]   Do I ever buy clothes from the search results? I buy a lot of things from the search results google now wants you to buy clothes
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.240]   This is a
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:37.840]   An initiative they call shop the look it's an advertising program you search for specific outfits
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.920]   You'll get photos and purchase links in the results page
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:51.680]   I am so I am so excited about this really well. I already shop from google remember. I I've been so excited about my google now
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:55.920]   Show me what's going on and I'm a huge fashion week kind of consumer
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:01.760]   Just of like what new clothes are out. So I would totally buy pretty stuff from
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.360]   I
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:08.640]   Find this is that these this is the most effective kind of advertising for me buy it right there
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:14.880]   It just it just somehow I you know if something catches my this instagram works
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:19.360]   I've bought stuff from instagram ads because you're going through your feed and you see a cool picture and
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.080]   It's not so hard just to click it and buy it
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.520]   um
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:28.560]   Facebook I guess and this is even more immediate right search for something buy it
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:34.160]   This is this is what made amazon billions, isn't it right just that that one button that one click purchase
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:36.480]   Which they fought so hard to protect in the courts
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:42.960]   But uh, you know, it's it's preying on our impulse and then you know the the click of the mouse is uh faster than our regret
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.760]   so it's um
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.680]   But yeah, it's neat. I don't know about shopping clothes
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:52.960]   That's just me because I'm a I hate shopping for clothes. What is this speed of regret? Is that close to the speed of lighter?
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.040]   It's just slower than clicking your mouse. That's what it is
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:00.800]   Just like slightly behind the speed of a click
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.600]   with them announcing this it
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.600]   I don't know. This kind of relates to pinterest hiring is it Lee fan?
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.800]   Oh, yeah, Lee fan went over there. Yeah as the new head of engineering
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.680]   And she was she was head of image search at google
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:17.840]   If you look at pinterest business model, which is basically buying on pictures, right?
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:24.080]   That becomes a really interesting hired kind of related to this very interesting. Yeah
[00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:30.560]   Yeah, very interesting image recognition. Well, what is what is pinterest full of pictures of stuff?
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:36.320]   And that's always been the promise of pinterest was that you can you know that you would have all these things on your boards
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:42.080]   And you just click on them. You can buy them from there and it was always the disappointment of in pinterest for me as I couldn't do that
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:48.000]   Exactly. It's like I want to buy that they're moving very much in that direction. That's an obvious thing
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.400]   Well, while apple was having its event so was sony poor sony
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.640]   We won't even mention that del also had an event
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.000]   Just kind of avoid those apple event days
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.880]   That's uh, you don't want to be making news on those days or
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.960]   Conversely, if you've got an embarrassing announcement like say an exploding phone
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:12.000]   Do that on the days apple announces its phone. That's when you can bury stories
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.400]   We'll talk about what sony announced in just a second stacey higobothum is here
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.960]   From stacey on iot the great podcast you do with kevin toffle
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:24.640]   Talking about iot what are you what are you talking about these days?
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:27.440]   Did you just did what this one this morning or are you about to do one later today?
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.560]   No, we do it what do you do it in the morning and it comes out tomorrow
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.960]   So we talked about kevin reloot reloot reviewed the wink relay
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:42.320]   And then we also talked about rumors of a new wink hub second gen wink hub. So it's exciting wink
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.960]   wink
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.720]   Who's wink?
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:49.280]   Wink is the company that was bought by flex
[00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:54.960]   Um, they used to be part of quirky their home quirky. That's right. They were a quirky
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.440]   They were a quirky. They were a quirky product. Okay. I know I knew it
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:03.440]   All right wink. Hmm. Does he like him?
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:08.720]   He loves him. I love it. It's my favorite smart home hub. Oh, yes people always ask me this
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:10.800]   They're like stacey. What's your favorite smart home hub?
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:11.760]   Uh
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.760]   The wink are you a wink wok?
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:19.680]   I'm a wink wok over smart things because smart things isn't as reliable. So if you're out there choosing your hub
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.000]   What protocol does wink use?
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:30.640]   Um, it actually speaks a bunch of different radios. So it's not just zigby or it's zigby z wave lutron kitties
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:36.880]   Uh, that's what you want. I guess that's what the smart things did too. The whole idea of it was it integrated all of these protocols
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.000]   And smart things doesn't have the lutron and it
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:44.480]   Doesn't have kitty it has zigby z wave bluetooth and wi-fi
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:49.760]   So you could get a wink instead of getting the phillips hue hub for instance and use that instead
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.800]   No, no it talks to the hub
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:57.440]   So that in that because of the type of integration they have with phillips it talks to the hub
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.600]   It actually talks to the cloud. I think
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.120]   Talk to the hub
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:03.120]   It no it talks to the cloud the phillips he was
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.440]   The cloud will talk to the hub
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:09.280]   Yes, it's a bit late, but the next gen is supposed to have more power
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.920]   So they used to call me latin
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.320]   Yeah
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.520]   What about jittery?
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:16.480]   Yeah
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.760]   Depends on the amount of coffee latin latin latin and jittery
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:27.040]   Interesting all right wink. All right. So we'll we'll listen to the iot podcast when it comes out tomorrow

[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:55.440]   So i've been i do not have a playstation for them one of the few people i made the wrong bet
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:54:00.880]   Two years ago and i bought an xbox one you got x-boned i get x-boned
[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.360]   [laughter]
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:08.880]   Everybody else bought a playstation 4 and now they're playing no man's sky and i'm still on gears of war
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:14.000]   Now i like the xbox one and i really was hopeful because it was a whole i thought it was going to be
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:20.800]   Microsoft's media center play it hasn't really turned out to be and now i want to play station 4 because i wanted to do the playstation vr
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.800]   I've played with it and it was really impressed
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:25.280]   Sony had an event it started at noon
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:30.800]   Which was technically right after apples event, but i imagine that even the news coverage will be a little
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.000]   limited
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.840]   They uh they announced two new xbox i'm sorry
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:42.640]   And only in my dreams two new playstation 4s a slimmed down playstation 4
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:46.240]   Uh that will be available very soon
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.800]   September 15th
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:54.480]   At $299 but it's essentially the same as it as the existing ps4
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:59.520]   Just a little bit smaller and like a redesigned light bar and things like that
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.920]   And then coming November 10th
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:05.040]   What was called or codenamed the neo
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:07.840]   a playstation pro
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:14.560]   Which is in fact improved $399 support for 4k faster processor better graphics
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:22.160]   Uh, this is not a new generation. This is just you know kind of a a slipstream upgrade for the playstation 4
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:29.120]   Uh upgraded gpu and a terabyte hard drive, but an upgraded price to 399
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.440]   39
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.560]   So they went from having one console to having three
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:37.280]   Yes, basically
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:44.720]   Or no the slimmer to the slimmer cheaper playstation 4 is just it just replaces the original model and then this this is for the hard core gamers
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:48.800]   Right. Yeah, so well and I want it because i'm very interested in the
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.600]   PlayStation vr
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:54.240]   Now I don't know if that will come out at the same time
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.960]   It should because they well I know they wanted to get about by the end of the year
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.240]   So I'm thinking this neo this playstation pro
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:05.360]   Will also be offered in a vr bundle at another price probably a couple hundred bucks more
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:11.600]   Um, and they're also adding hdr in software to every playstation for
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:16.640]   Um, so that's for gaming and I guess streaming video playback
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:22.720]   Not blue rays though. Not blue rays. I the new xbox supports the uhd hdr blue rays
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.360]   And i'm been watching them on my new xbox. I really really like them
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:32.160]   You have to have a tv that supports it. I really wonder I mean it's I think it's interesting that the playstation pro won't play
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:36.240]   4k blue rays after sony helped usher in the era
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:38.080]   With the playstation
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:44.640]   Uh, and so that really makes me wonder is is sony betting on the fact that we're gonna consume all of our content
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:47.200]   Streaming and not be just anymore. Is it?
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:53.600]   No more physical media it feels even a little retro today when I go to amazon and i buy you know the martian
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:59.040]   Uh on a disc and I have to wait for a truck to bring it to my house to watch it
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.480]   But it is the highest quality. I mean if you want, you know uhd
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.320]   hdr
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:10.480]   Uh play it back on one of those new players or on your xbox one s and I have to say it looks really really good
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.840]   It really does. There's a danger. There's a danger in
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:19.920]   Going all streaming in that you know in your in the the quality is better on the disc like you mentioned
[00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:22.640]   But also there's availability. Um, I found out
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:27.200]   Much to the Midas may a couple of weeks ago that the only way I can watch the the movie the commitments
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:32.800]   Remember that movie? Yeah, great movie. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not streaming anywhere. Danny boil, right?
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:38.160]   It just is no no no cs or in 1990. I forget who directed it, but um, he did train spotting
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:42.480]   Yeah, but i confused it too because I can't understand anything anybody's saying in both of those
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.200]   Irish scottish saying
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:49.120]   But yeah, no, but that that movie is not available that movie is not available streaming and in fact
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:56.080]   It's not even imprint on on discs that you have to buy. I use the dvd wait. Here's a tip from stacy
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:04.480]   No, if you chip if you check back sometimes things that are not available become available over streaming is like the licensing rights change
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.600]   Yeah, so you don't need it right away. Yeah
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.080]   It's not unusual though
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:14.320]   I don't understand. I even complained to a friend of mine. I was trying to watch his movies and none of them were on
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:20.640]   You you had to buy them you couldn't even rent them anywhere. I know I why why is that the case?
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:25.600]   Well, and I said, you know, you really ought to talk to your but it's not up to him. It's up to his film company, right? The producers and
[00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:31.520]   Yeah, the owners of they're so nervous. They are just so nervous about piracy. I think I
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.880]   Will give
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:39.840]   I will give the uh, oh and stacy you're totally right now. It's back available. That's crazy. Uh tip from stacy
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:44.320]   So yeah, so I was gonna I was gonna give a shout out
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.240]   Maybe it's for later in the show for pics or whatnot
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:49.360]   But uh, the website just watch.com is a great aggregator
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:54.240]   Where you type in you type in any movie and it tells you, you know, you first you tell up a country
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:59:00.880]   And you type in any movie or tv show and then it tells you where it's available for either renting or buying and what the prices are
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:08.160]   And you can you can filter by st or hd or anything like that and sure enough now it's back available on amazon apple and a google
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:11.440]   I've been using uh, can I stream dot it?
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:16.000]   Yep, can I stream it? But this uh, this isn't and this is the same idea. It looks like
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:22.800]   Yeah, it's a shame that we actually have to go through this right great. I mean you can't even figure out where
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:28.800]   At least on the apple tv or one of the or the android shield where you can talk to it
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.120]   You should be able to say can I stream this and where
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:34.560]   But now they're not that good and the can the echo do that
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:38.000]   No, but it should somebody somebody build an
[00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.440]   That would be a skill. We need to just watch skill for the echo
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:47.600]   Now I will also say because i'm a big fan of this because i have a kid i go to the library all the time
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:53.920]   But our library has wonderful videos. Yeah, so whenever i can't find something i don't forget that
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.640]   That everyone does. Yeah
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:57.920]   So
[00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.320]   And they're free support your local library kids
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.320]   If you don't go there nobody will eventually
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:09.040]   I'm sorry i'll be distracted by just watch now. I lose all the movies. I want to say
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:16.000]   They've got an app too, which is handy when you're you know out somewhere and you have an argument over whether or not something's available
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   Which believe it or not i have had
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.520]   Uh, it's it saves the day

[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:28.480]   This was part of uh mo to roll is kind of research projects and they've suspended it
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:31.200]   At this point. They didn't say why
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:37.120]   Maybe because they figured out nobody wanted janky phones to fall apart. I don't know
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.600]   I am maybe rick osterlois. Oh, sorry. This could be something rick did because rick
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:47.520]   This is all rick. This is another reorganization under osterlo and rick would know because he was at mo to roller one project ara was
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.240]   One of their research projects
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.880]   Why do you think he killed why are you upset first of all ron?
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:02:00.560]   Because I loved this concept because I think that every phone out there we've reached, you know, um
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:05.200]   Peak peak phone. Yeah, we peak we've reached peak phone. It's just completely homogeneity
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.200]   And there's no real innovation going on on the hardware side
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:14.720]   And the also thing is that no one person has the same requirements for a phone as the next person
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.520]   We all want something different. I want more battery. You want a better camera
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.160]   You know, there are all these different kind of uh variables
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:26.400]   So the idea of making your own phone with these dinky little lego pieces to me sounded amazing
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:32.880]   And the idea that you could have third parties building speaker accessories and projectors and batteries and all these other things
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:36.320]   And you can make the phone of your dreams. I found out to be really really cool
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.840]   Now, I don't think it's uh
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.400]   The kind of thing that millions of people are going to get would be mainstream
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:45.680]   But having that as an option is something that I was really interested in and I'm really disappointed that I will never get to snap
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:51.040]   On a bigger battery or a better camera or flash. So I don't know. It's a bummer
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:56.160]   Nothing else for the same
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:59.840]   Yeah, but it sounds good in principle, but I just feel like it's gonna be a little rattly
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:03.280]   You know, it's just gonna feel like a lego phone
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:08.720]   Well, but well that and that's the thing and look how well lego did everybody thought lego was crazy all those years ago
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:12.480]   Why did they give up then what's wrong? I mean, there must have been
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:18.080]   I think it I think it's got to be something about taking a product from concept to shipable and
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:23.360]   While the idea of snapping on all these things and doing hot swapping and stuff like that is great
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:28.960]   There has to be a flaw somewhere in battery life and maintenance or in processor
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:34.880]   You know management in that it actually wasn't a phone that they could ship because people would complain about one of those two problems
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.280]   that's my guess so
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.600]   Four years in prison for gucci fur
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:44.560]   Uh gucci fur, uh, I didn't know they caught gucci fur
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:50.000]   It turns out he's a 44 year old Romanian Marcel de jalazar
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.560]   Uh, he hacked george hw bush george w bush
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:04:00.880]   Uh, I thought actually he was a kind of a cover for russian state hackers
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:05.280]   Um, he was the one who uncovered hillary clinton's private email
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:10.000]   Server he also hacked colin powell robert redford steve martin
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.600]   nicole kidman and he always took credit for it
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:20.640]   But now he's been arrested and sentenced 52 months in prison 52 months
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.000]   in jail
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.280]   however
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.680]   Now there's gucci fur 2.0 and gucci fur 2.0 apparently he's not lazar
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:35.760]   But some other group and they hacked the democratic national committee and leaked those documents to
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:40.480]   wiki leaks so maybe gucci fur lives on even though he
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:46.720]   Will live the next 52 months in uh, is it a romanian prison or a us prison?
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.720]   Oh
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.080]   He was extradited to the us so it's a us prison. Yes. Yeah, I
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:59.040]   I think um, and that's if gucci fur is indeed just that one person or if they're like anonymous probably right there's yeah
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:05.280]   I just want to know I the the the political ones I get but what what's the motivation for hacking robert redford
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:12.560]   Everybody loves robert redford right I'm like and even if he had nude photos. I don't know if there's a market for that
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:15.120]   He's like 80 now, right?
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.600]   Uh, this is mean
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:22.480]   Maybe he has really great emails though think about the gossip. Oh the gossip. Yeah
[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:26.480]   Ooh
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.800]   Oh wait a minute. I know why because he was in sneakers
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:33.360]   That's it. That's the hack the faux hacker. There it is
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.480]   Yeah, that's what it is the faux hacker
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:41.440]   Self-driving ubers in san francisco. Maybe you can try these for us run and report back
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:47.600]   Uber has declined comment, but look at this car. This is the batmobile, baby
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.960]   The uh, I think that almost is a joke
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.240]   It looks like it's got so many cameras
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:06:00.800]   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 plus lydar. I'm just counting
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.760]   Uh, why does it why does it have pennsylvania plates? Oh because they were doing the no
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:10.960]   They're doing the test in pittsburgh too. That makes sense pittsburgh and now it's in san francisco. I get it. I get it
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:15.200]   Here's uh, yeah, this is the one that was captured four days ago
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:21.840]   That's pretty I swear to god. Who are you gonna call ghost busters is leslie jones driving? I figure
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:25.440]   This is the new ghost busters mobile that is ridiculous
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:30.560]   That's awesome. I would get I would try it in a second. Oh, yeah, and I love and i love that
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.520]   There's still somebody behind the wheel because these aren't stage four as autonomous. This is
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:40.720]   You know, there but I think it's I think it's amazing that uber's beating google to the punch of this
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.680]   Well, are they are they really?
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:50.080]   Oh, I mean, they're just they're all trying these I mean by do has a lesser a license in california to test
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:55.920]   Autonomous vehicles you do have to get a permit, right? You can't uh, you can't just go out and do it
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:00.960]   You can't just bring although neohot might neohot might just george hotts might just go
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:03.920]   I'm just gonna do this. I like yeah. Yeah
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:09.600]   I imagine there were some self-driving vehicles on the pliya this week on at the burning man
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:15.040]   Just oh, they got their their vandals attack the whole again the whole again
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:21.840]   I have to admit I was kind of rooting for the whole again's now. I feel bad if anybody I know was one of those fancy campers
[01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:27.760]   I guess this was a camp created by uh, deejays. It was like an edm camp that was very nice
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:32.240]   um and they would and they and they were they brought did
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.480]   concerts
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.160]   and stuff
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:41.680]   But they were kind of the others that burn I don't know I think about the ethics or the culture of burning man
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.680]   But apparently others at burning man didn't like these guys because they didn't share
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:50.880]   It wasn't an open camp. It is a communal culture. Yeah
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.760]   No chapstick for you
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.160]   And so they just they ransacked the place
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:02.640]   But by the way when crimes occur at burning man burning man does not hesitate to go to the local authorities so uh
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.600]   So actual police can be involved at this point
[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:10.480]   They're real happy to uh to uh to reconnect with the world when they need to suddenly
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:13.280]   It's a blaze in here
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:18.800]   Um t-mobile says to Verizon our lte is more advanced than Yuri. Oh screw it
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.280]   uh
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.280]   I even I can't even I can't
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.320]   bring up the energy to even
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:30.080]   How about this one snapchat ad revenues?
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.720]   Here's a prediction
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:38.480]   Prediction by analysts at e marketer. They're predicting snapchat ad revenues, which are currently
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:43.120]   $366 million will grow to nearly a billion
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.040]   next
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.160]   Year
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.720]   Wow, and that's what fact what did snapchat's own presentation deck predicts?
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:58.720]   I gotta give it with the apple event more people were snapchat and that were uh tweeting so interesting
[01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:03.440]   That's the place to watch it now. Uh, which is which is funny because I've seen I've also seen more
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:07.600]   You know movement from twitter to snapchat, but with the recent instagram
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.800]   snapchat rip off the instagram moments or whatever they are
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:15.520]   I've seen a lot of my feed move from snapchat to be more active on instagram because there's more
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:24.720]   You know old people. Yeah, possibly but I will say that snapchat has impressed me by the hyper targeting by media partnerships
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:31.040]   And then I don't know if you saw I think it was last week. There's an article in variety about that uh, seth rogan animated movie sausage party
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:37.280]   Uh that is how sausage sausage fest sausage sausage sausage sausage sausage party. It's all. Yeah, and it's an r rated
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:44.000]   Cartoon yeah, exactly and uh 50 of their marketing budget was spent on digital
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:49.360]   Including snapchat. Well, if you're gonna make a movie like sausage party
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:54.080]   I I got a I I subscribed to comments since media
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.840]   Which tells you what things you should let your kids watch and what you shouldn't not
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:00.400]   Issueed a warning
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.440]   Just because this is animated doesn't mean it's for kids. I was like
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:08.160]   Awesome, but it's rated r. I mean like I know I
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:13.760]   That's what I thought was hilarious and it's called sausage party and if you look at the animation
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:18.160]   But it's just a bunch of dancing penises. Is that what you're saying?
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:21.680]   Um, I would never say that here's the new york times
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:27.840]   Review the first word otter in sausage party is a popular synonym for excrement
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.360]   Which is a bit counterintuitive in a movie about food?
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.880]   You would expect that to come to the end at the end. Oh boy
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:37.680]   So
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:43.360]   Well, if you want to hit some more tech news and you may not know I do I do
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.920]   Please I beg of you
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:48.480]   Intel bought a computer vision company
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.640]   They just they just upped
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:55.280]   McAfee out, so maybe they're taking the McAfee money and buying a computer vision company
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:58.400]   Well, I think McAfee probably made them more money
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.240]   um
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.240]   So yes movidius
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.000]   which is
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.480]   They're the computer vision chip inside project tango. They also are working with a lot of drone people manufacturers
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:13.120]   to
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:19.680]   Basically process. I mean, it's computer vision. So it's it's basically helping computers in a low power format
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.320]   Understand what they're seeing
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:30.720]   So really cool buy for intel. It shows a couple things one google or google intel is not going to get behind hopefully on AI
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:36.800]   Two it's embracing heterogeneous architectures so things that are not x86 which we have seen
[01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:42.800]   Um with manufacturing arm and with buying nirvana systems, which is using a gpu for machine learning
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:49.680]   um, and this is all very nerdy, but it's all very exciting because it means intel might continue to be a
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:52.960]   good bet movidius mo problems
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.400]   No
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:12:01.520]   Thank you for the correct grammar there I tried
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:07.680]   Um, I thought you were going to talk about intel selling off McAfee. It's it bought McAfee
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:14.720]   Six years ago for 7.7 billion dollars changed the name to intel security didn't go anywhere. They're selling it now
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.080]   not
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.360]   entirely but a
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:21.040]   Massive stake in it for 4.2 billion including dead
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:28.480]   So they basically writing off billions of dollars on this one and the name goes back to maccophie, which is after all
[01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.200]   synonymous
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:33.200]   with security
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:36.080]   Lord yes
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.080]   Did you see uh
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.680]   I guess it was samantha beesful frontal did a thing on the libertarian
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:48.720]   Convention a while back in he's a candidate or he was a candidate he was a candidate until gary johnson got the nomination yet
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.840]   yeah, well, um
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.240]   This is the year of interesting candidates is all i'm going to say
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.040]   All i'm going to say
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:04.660]   Let's take a break and come back with your picks of the week because we want to wrap this up in time for t and t stacie higgin
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:10.660]   bathroom from the iot podcast iot podcast calm at gigga stacey on twitter
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:15.940]   And ron richards ron exo on twitter and of course a regular
[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:20.020]   on all about android joining us this saturday
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:25.220]   For the new screen savers our show today brought to you by wealth friday if you're investing for the long term
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:30.180]   You know how challenging it could be investing doesn't mean putting it in the savings account because that's basically
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:38.900]   At best no growth and in in many cases because of the cost of living not going up but going up higher than the
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:44.740]   Interest rate on your say what is the savings again interest rate? It's like one quarter of one percent or something now it's terrible
[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:50.340]   You got to invest you got to find you know some vehicles to make some money on in most cases
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:55.300]   That's the stock market, but are you going to manage that investment or worse? You're going to pay somebody
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:57.780]   one two or three percent of what you're
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:06.260]   You know investing just to keep an eye on things for you. No, here's what you do you go to wealth front wealth front is computerized
[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:08.740]   investing
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:15.780]   It keeps an eye on your investment. It redistributes it rebalances. It does tax loss harvesting
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:23.460]   Maximizes your returns while minimizing your tax bill and it does it at a very affordable one quarter of one percent
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:27.540]   A year 25 basis points. That's a heck of a lot less
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:32.660]   Than that human down the street will do and they do a better job because they're monitoring you constantly
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:39.700]   Using the best modern portfolio theory and no bell prize winning economic theory to do the best job
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:45.380]   These are the advisors. I mean the best people like berten malkeill charles dl is over 200 years and of wall street
[01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:50.340]   Experience on their advisory board. These are the people who help them design the algorithm that make sure

[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.060]   They'll manage it for free

[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:50.260]   free
[01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:52.260]   Last week we said Stacy you should do a
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:55.460]   What was it a recipe of the week or?
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:57.220]   You did
[01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.540]   So but not not a cooking recipe
[01:15:59.540 --> 01:16:02.260]   Not a thing. Well, I had a thing for this week
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:07.300]   So I wanted to ask you should I do a thing? Do a thing and you can do it if this is another time or this time
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:10.180]   You know what anything you want to do. This is your show
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:14.100]   I have both so this is my show really
[01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:16.740]   It's your show now
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:21.780]   All right, so this is what my thing of the week is if I can get it out because my this is my daughter's thing
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:27.940]   This is the drop kitchen scale because last week you were talking and complaining about
[01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:31.620]   Or are you complaining about oh when you're making something and
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:36.340]   Your proportions get all wrong or you don't have enough of one thing. Yeah, you can't
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:43.300]   Re-do it. So what this is this is a $99 connected kitchen scale. It only works with iOS
[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:47.540]   So this is a terrible thing to bring on this week in google. No, no, I have an iPhone. Yeah
[01:16:47.540 --> 01:16:53.860]   Oh, I lost my iPad. Um, so what it is there's nothing on the scale except for this button right here
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.660]   you open up the app and
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:17:00.500]   What it does is when you put things on it
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:05.460]   It gives you a recipe. So if you can actually show them a recipe that would probably be the best thing
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.300]   um
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.620]   All the recipes are modular. Okay, and
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:14.340]   When you start up the recipe, it's like okay pre-heat your oven and
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:23.220]   Here are your steps here. You have your recipe. There's mini chocolate. Oh, all right. You can do the other lemon sorbet lemon sorbet. Okay. That's easy. Okay. When you start the process
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.980]   It gives you the ingredients in a very step-by-step passion
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:29.540]   uh path, so you're like
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.380]   put
[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:37.060]   There it is place a clean saucepan on drop put the following six ingredients in and then as you would
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:42.100]   Press one you can either do it on the iPad or you do it on the scales if your hands are dirty
[01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:47.860]   So this is cool because if you don't have in the lemon sorbet example, if you don't have enough lemon juice
[01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:51.460]   You just say I only have two tablespoons instead of four
[01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:58.260]   How do I how do I adjust my recipe? Yes, it's more interesting when you're like, I only have one egg. Yes
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:02.420]   So this is really fun. The cool thing is at efa
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:08.420]   They announced that they're working actually on a kitchen o s and the recipes are the key of all of these things
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:12.980]   So you can put your own recipes in and eventually
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:19.300]   The drop stuff will work with other connected kitchen appliances. So they have a deal with Bosch
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:21.700]   So now when the recipe says
[01:18:21.700 --> 01:18:26.420]   Preheat your oven to 450. It'll actually just send the instructions right to your oven
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.740]   uh
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:32.580]   If it if it works if it's integrated with drop so I think that's really neat
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:37.060]   I'm excited about the kitchen. This is a great present for people who are learning to cook
[01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:43.540]   Because the recipes are super like my my eight-year-old at the time loved it. She actually demanded this for christmas
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:47.460]   You know two years in a row and finally we gave it to her
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:50.500]   So that is my device of the week
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:54.580]   And if you want a recipe I can throw that out too. Not a kitchen recipe
[01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:58.740]   If this than that style recipe it is let's hear it
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:01.780]   All right, so here's a fun one. It's really easy
[01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:07.620]   But useful if you have an echo and you have hu lights or lifex lights because those will also work
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:10.420]   You do a recipe that says
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.500]   If my timer goes off on my echo
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:15.700]   Blink my lights. So that way if you don't hear your timer
[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:20.740]   Your lights go off and you're like oh my timer is up if that makes sense
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:23.380]   It's a good recipe. Wow. We use it
[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.020]   Wow
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.380]   Cool
[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:31.620]   I'm like I'll send you a link to the recipe. Yeah, how do you can you can share recipes, right?
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:36.020]   You can just tweet it tweet it on your gigastacy. Okay, if you want
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:38.420]   Yeah, let me
[01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:41.780]   You don't have to do it right now. You can do it later. Yeah, do it later
[01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:46.580]   I got a crazy one for you. That's uh, I just read an article about this. It's a twitter
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:51.460]   So we all we all know about prisma, you know the great and by the way, if you don't
[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:55.460]   Have it yet. You should get it. It's an android app as well as an iOS app
[01:19:55.460 --> 01:20:01.940]   Does neural networks applies them to your photos does really great stuff. I mean, I'm really happy
[01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:04.580]   with some of the images. I'll show you a uh
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:07.140]   An image I just did
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.940]   Um on my iphone
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:14.260]   Um, well, you know what let's show you how I do it on on Kandinsky
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:19.940]   I mean the neural painter so neural painter is a twitter bot that does the same thing you tweet
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:26.580]   To at neural painter and you can use one of their filters brutal candy castle ceremony
[01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:29.220]   uh
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:33.220]   Edta oh nisl. I don't know what that is kind of gawa hokusai
[01:20:33.220 --> 01:20:39.140]   Kandinsky selfie star and i so I created let's just let's just tweet to it an image
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:43.460]   Uh a picture of me and then you do the hashtag
[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:46.180]   I'll do Kandinsky
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:48.740]   Actually, let's do a different one. Let's do brutal. I don't know what that'll do
[01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:53.620]   And uh, and i'll show you what happens because I pre-tweeted this just like a cooking show
[01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:59.940]   This is this is the the tweet back to me of that picture from Kandinsky. Isn't that cool?
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:03.140]   Uh, here's one. I tweeted a picture of a boat
[01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:09.620]   And uh just used the default random tweet and a little bit. I'm sure I will get a tweet back from
[01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:14.660]   Uh from neural painter of whatever brutal does to that picture
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:20.020]   It's kind of fun and you can actually watch its feed to see what it's doing with other people's images as well
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:22.420]   Just an interesting a bot
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:26.820]   Uh created by a hane neural. It'll also convert videos
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:30.660]   And gifs animated gifs as well as images
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:39.540]   Into an interesting uh form of art and it's free. Let's see if I got one back with brutal. Yeah, here's my brutal. Ooh, that is brutal
[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:46.100]   I just love the idea anyway
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:49.780]   Uh neural painter free. Uh, it's a it's a twitter tool
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:53.540]   And uh another way to fill your feed with nonsense
[01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:56.980]   Mr. Ron Richards. What do you got for us?
[01:21:56.980 --> 01:22:00.820]   He's muted again
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:07.620]   Is the dog bark who let the rich dog out? Sorry about that the air conditioning kick then. Oh, um, it's still hot in New York
[01:22:07.620 --> 01:22:13.060]   Uh, so I was wrestling with what to bring to you today. Um, I already mentioned just watch which is fantastic. Just watched a tv
[01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:17.780]   But I I think I think considering that I'm on all about android and we're talking about the new nexus phones
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:22.980]   I gotta recommend my daily driver the phone that i've been using and leo you know, it's the next bit robin
[01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:25.780]   but for a important reason
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:34.500]   Uh that they have dropped the price now to 299 and they have a very good looking uh red version
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:40.180]   Uh of the phone, uh, actually they call it ember and it's a red and black color combination
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:46.180]   And I know earlier when I was talking about project r. I was saying that my big frustration of the phones is that there are you know
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:52.100]   There's two they all look the same. They're all you know, they're all doing the same thing next bit is a company that is actually trying to do something different
[01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:53.860]   And I really like that. I really want to support them
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:58.260]   So uh check out the next bit robin for just 299 now you get a really really solid phone
[01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:00.500]   And you can get a really sexy red one too if you want it
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:05.780]   Well, and that's proof in the pudding that you have had this now for months and still using it
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:11.940]   Yep means you really like it. Do you use the thing that this that made them famous the idea that you don't have a lot of storage on the
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:17.060]   Funny you have 32 gigs, but it will move stuff off the phone that you don't use it. Do you find that useful?
[01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:22.820]   What's funny is that I don't because I had been operating for so long on a nexus five with 16 gigs that I
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:27.620]   I run a really lean phone. Yeah, so I actually haven't hit 32 gig yet on the phone
[01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:31.300]   But I keep trying to download music and trying to put stuff on there to fill it up
[01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:35.620]   But I haven't actually got to the point they finally did uh backup for apps
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:41.780]   Uh that were apps that I actually showcased on all about android and then never used that the showcasing them just didn't delete them
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:46.740]   And then I saw that they recently they the icons grayed out and actually reminded me that they were even on my phone
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:50.500]   But uh, so it's just starting to do that so I imagine i'll get into it a little more
[01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:56.820]   But uh, I just signed up and joined their beta beta tester program for their upcoming uh, o s
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:02.500]   For to nougat to bring and that was my next question. So they're gonna be nougat soon
[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:08.180]   So what they're saying they're saying by the end of q4 and they're saying they're adding their own little bit of next bit
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:10.580]   Flavor to it and they're they're going to
[01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:17.620]   Revitalize your battery life and i'm very curious to see what that means. So how is the battery life? I thought it was pretty good
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:20.580]   All right. It's not great. I mean it's it gets me through a day
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:25.460]   I can get I could pretty much leave the house go work a full day and come home like around five or six and have to plug it in
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:26.740]   Which is to be expected?
[01:24:26.740 --> 01:24:31.300]   Um, it's really bad when i'm at an event and i'm doing something and i'm you know using a lot of data
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:34.980]   But that's to be expected but apparently there's something in android
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:41.460]   And that combined with their engineering master mastery they're gonna make that battery be that much better
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:47.460]   So we'll see be very interesting and but but that ember phone is oh, it's beautiful. Look at that. That's cool. Yeah, very poor
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:48.740]   Yeah
[01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.980]   As 299 now they dropped it 100 bucks. So
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:57.460]   Oh, it's oh it was more. Oh, that's good. Yeah, it was 399. It was 399. Now they dropped it to 299
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:02.740]   I'm glad they're doing well. I really I like them a lot and I wanted the best form. So that's good
[01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:05.700]   Innovation is good in hardware and competition
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.380]   Yes
[01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:12.100]   Ron Richards, you see him all the time on all about andra you'll see him saturday on the new screen savers
