[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, Jeff and Gina are here. We're going to take a look at
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:10.560]   others so much to talk about, including this really big phone and the furore over path.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.400]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.600]   Netcast you love from people you trust.

[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.320]   and album art that actually has people's faces on it. Hello, I'm Leo LaPorte. You really hate the
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.320]   music, Gina Trappani? I don't hate it. I don't think it adequately communicates. You want something
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.560]   more rock and roll. How dynamic and modern we all are. It was high concept. It was a big mistake.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.520]   I wanted to go with a fugue or a round or a cantata, something that would imply the three
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.200]   voices intertwined. It was too high concept. It was a long-thinking. It was a mistake. I think
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.120]   it might be terrible mistake. We might be ready for an upgrade. It isn't a fugue, Dave. I couldn't
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.440]   find a fugue. I could only get what I could get. That's the other thing is,
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.480]   licenseable classical performances are few and far between.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:14.240]   Aaronic. Isn't that ironic? That is Gina Trappani. She is the founder of Life Hacker,
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.640]   the blogger at smarterware.org, the author of Think Up Act,
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.680]   app. Think up app. That's me. The author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.600]   I'm sorry, that hurt. That was a low blow. It's okay. It's okay. My favorite hour of the week.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.520]   Yay. Hey, Gina. It would be even more of your favorite hour if we had
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.200]   spaghetti and meatballs, wouldn't it? Or Chipotle. Oh, man. Spaghetti and meatballs here in
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.960]   California. I try not to think about it too much because I'm far away from Brooklyn.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.840]   Sunday gravy. Oh, Sunday gravy. Sunday gravy, baby. Yeah, I got to book a flight home.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:06.000]   Me too. We Italians, we don't stray far from the ragu pot. Also here, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.240]   who's standing in for the first and the best. Jeff is a buzz machine.com. He's also the author
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.200]   of Public Parts, brand new. And the author also of what would Google do. Hello, Jeff.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.360]   Professor of Journalism teaches the new journalism to young people. Good luck.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.920]   Yeah. I'm leaving the mestre down down over the cliff. Does the administration ever say that?
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.480]   Does the administration ever say, "Yeah, Jeff, could you do more with printing presses?"
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.920]   I met David Carr. I knew him before when I was at a dinner last week at Clay Shurkeys.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.120]   Oh, man. And yeah, I know. And David Carr from the New York Times.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.960]   That's a name drop I'd love to drop. So David wrote a blog post today about the
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.680]   bread we all had at Clay's. And you mentioned no one else in the meeting,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.400]   but I was telling the story of going to the Gutenberg Museum on my
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.960]   pilgrimage there. And Carr, you could see the joy coming his face. He said, "So, is that the
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:20.240]   print last print guy you liked?" What fun. That sounds like a great dinner party. Who else was there?
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.360]   Yeah. That sounds like a good party. Emily Bell from the Guardian,
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.440]   from the Guardian. And... It's all the media matters types.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.200]   But it was. And Cindy Stiver is the new editor of the Columbia Journal's review.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.880]   Clay, Jay Rosen, who couldn't be there. Emily and I were all skewered by the Columbia
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.000]   Journal's review as the news consortium, the cabal. And so I had the idea of having the new
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.080]   editor of Cindy Stiver's somewhere for dinner to brainwash her. Brilliant.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.520]   And so we didn't do any of that. We just drank and they were delicious bread that Clay makes.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.560]   So Clay makes his own bread. He makes his own, huh? It's really good.
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.400]   Boy, that's very true. On top of everything else,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.640]   on top of understanding the whole world and the universe and everything else, he makes good bread.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.040]   I actually am a very good baker, but I had to stop because when you make a nice, hot,
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.560]   fresh loaf of bread, there's only one thing to do, which is slather it with butter and devour it whole.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.240]   The entire thing. And I've already got a problem there. So it was just not good.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.400]   What kind of bread does he make? Just a simple low low, you know, baguette.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.880]   Baguette, yeah. Yeah, my mom. We're only the reasons I do this, because my mom, my entire life,
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.480]   growing up would make spaghetti and meatballs. We have any pasta beginning the meal.
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:46.240]   And then she'd homemade baguettes every meal. Oh man. Meets and cheeses and olives and
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:54.880]   roars and cheese. Oh, I love that stuff. Anyway, but that's not what we're here to discuss.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:03.440]   Ladies and gentlemen, this weekend diet, this weekend path. I, you know, boy, there was a lot of
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:10.480]   gnashing of teeth over path uploading. Path is the app that the reason this is big is because
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.200]   path is the app that all the techno Roddy use, the Dijerati use. And so I don't know if real
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:22.720]   people use it, but they we all use it. And so it really was offensive to our sensibility.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.560]   This is the Dave Moore and the guy who worked at Facebook, left Facebook to start this company.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.000]   And it's kind of like Facebook. It's a the path through your life, a journal of your life,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.600]   in pictures, text, music, you tell everybody you tell the world when you wake up, not actually,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.640]   not the world, no more than 150 friends. When you wake up, when you go to sleep, all that stuff.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.760]   And I love it. And I've only got like 60 friends and I know all of them. Alex Lindsey's rule of
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.880]   thumb on path is you only add people that you would have at a dinner party. So it really is,
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.920]   it's like what Facebook was supposed to be kind of. And you can cross post on path to Twitter,
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.040]   Facebook, Tumblr, four squares. So you're not, you know, often I'll cross post, but I just love it.
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:10.000]   So when you, you know, sign up for path or at any point thereafter, you have the opportunity to find
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.400]   friends on path to add friends and they have three places you can add them from contacts,
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:23.200]   Facebook, or invite them. So it's two places. When you type, when you press contacts,
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.960]   what does it do? Well, somehow it figures out which of the people in your address book are on
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.680]   path. How would it do that? Now think a little thought experiment. Does it download the entire
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:44.800]   database of path users to your phone? No, no. And check on the phone. No, any program and every,
[00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:51.120]   I most social programs for years, any program, it has to, because if you think about it,
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.680]   be the programmer for a moment. How do you solve this problem? I have two lists, a list of my address
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.320]   contacts and a list of everybody who's on path. How do I figure out where the intersection is?
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:06.160]   Either I have to, I don't know, one by one path on the phone has to go through the contact list
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.080]   and compare it to the data. No, it uploads the whole thing. Boom, does a fast comparison
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:18.160]   downloads it. So some, some smart person, for some reason, I love his blog name,
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:27.200]   McLovin, mclov.in, McLovin, notice this. Well, dough McLovin, you're significant. You're,
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:31.280]   obviously sophisticated technically. What did you think it was doing?
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:35.920]   But then why did anybody even tie on with it? It started spreading around
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:39.600]   out because most people aren't sophisticated enough to figure out that, of course, they're
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:46.480]   all doing that. Well, so, so I think there's some interesting things here. First, first, there's the
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.840]   the permissions model of Android and iPhone. I have an install path. When you install it,
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.520]   you know, if you were to install on an Android, it would say this app would need access to your
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.920]   address book and lots of apps do, mostly because they want, you want to be able to quickly, you're
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.560]   easily share. I actually, I don't have a problem with an app having access to my address book, but
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.280]   the idea that path is uploading my entire address book and keeping it on their servers to monitor
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.280]   you know, hey, well, that's the question. Do they keep it? That's the issue is the
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.680]   reduction. Yes, they keep it on their servers. They maintain an up-to-date database of your
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:24.080]   contacts on their servers. So it can notify you when friends and family join that. Exactly.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:29.200]   Now that that is something that I that's that's different in my book than hey, you can have access
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:33.520]   to my address book to quickly call someone. Because when you add your mistress to it,
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.080]   you don't know that it's going to go there. Not that I have ever had forever. Can.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.400]   Oh, let me tell you, it's fun. So but but I have to say the issue
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:50.480]   is really more one of disclosure. Yes. Then it is of oh my god, it does this.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:56.000]   Well, when on Facebook, you do the same thing, right? On Facebook, if you want to find friends
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.080]   and then you, Gina, you're a programmer. How would you solve this? You could, I guess, well,
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.520]   saving it's another matter. But how would you go through a contact list on a phone
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.160]   and compare it to the database on a path servers? You either one by one have to compare,
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.160]   which is going to take forever, or you just upload the whole thing, you do a quick comparison on the
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:22.320]   server and and flag matches now. What you should do is you should say somewhere in it doesn't
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.400]   obviously not through the Android or iPhone disclosure because neither of those are complete
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.560]   enough. But you should say in your privacy policy, we will do this. And if you save it,
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.400]   which maybe they shouldn't have done, but if we will save it and we'll do the comparison
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.240]   and you're giving us permission if you use path, but you have to do that.
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:44.160]   Yeah. I mean, technically it is easier and easier way to do it. And it is an issue of disclosure.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.480]   You can't do it with hashes, folks, because they are not all exact mashes. You have to,
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.960]   you cannot do it with hashes. You have to have a grep, I think.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:58.240]   Right. One of the suggestions that someone made was that they could pass this information.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.720]   They could hash the email addresses when they send them across. But you know, this is,
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.200]   well, they shouldn't send it in the clear. That's a mistake as well.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.360]   It's not over in cryptic connection anyway. I think the idea is just that path is maintaining
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.240]   your address book on their servers and you're not aware of that. Were you aware of that?
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.440]   No, no, no. No, although the minute path says, oh, your mom just joined path,
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.880]   a light bulb should go off if you're thinking, oh, how did they know that they must be saving
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:30.480]   my mom's email address somewhere? Right. Right. So now I'm kind of new, relatively new to iOS,
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.040]   after several years of straight Android. And Android has, I think has a really clear permissions
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.080]   model. When you install an app, it tells you what the app needs access to. I think it could be more
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.840]   granular and I wish that I could opt out of certain things, you know, one by one, but whatever.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:51.600]   iPhone does not do that. iPhone does not do that. Apple is supposed to keep track of that.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.040]   And Apple's supposed to keep track of that, right? So, so, you know, so a few, I saw a few people
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.920]   make the point that they wish that the Apple review process had caught this, that this
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.160]   possibly could go against Apple's terms of service, that you're not supposed to
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:11.040]   store this contact information. I don't know if that's actually true. And in fact,
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.320]   I should try and find the, try and find the link where I saw that. But, and I think it's actually
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.800]   on the original post by the guy who did the network monitoring to see what was going across.
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.920]   I don't, I don't blame paths. I actually think that path's apology was very well done. And I
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.040]   applaud them for saying they're deleting all this contact information off their servers.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.600]   They're saying, we're sorry, we made a mistake. Like based on your feedback, we realized that we
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.680]   shouldn't have done this without being more communicative. We're deleting all the contact data that we've
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.240]   collected thus far from our servers. That's, that's pretty, that's a pretty good apology.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.520]   So I applaud them for that. For me, this was just a bigger question about
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:53.200]   how do mobile apps communicate exactly what they're doing and why to you. And in a way that is
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:00.560]   usable and reasonable and clear, but not, you know, a 40 page terms of service or privacy policy.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.720]   This is a hard, this is a very difficult. Well, this, but this is a UI problem to some extent.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.960]   I think, Jenny, you're right. It's disclosure, but disclosure is UI in this case,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.760]   where what we need is this notion of the data vault and you have a easy means. You say, okay,
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.800]   you're allowed in. And here's how you're allowed in and not. And, and if we don't do that as an
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.840]   industry, we're going to get, I'm sorry, I wasn't going to bring it up this week, but we're going to
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.960]   get things like the European rules coming where they get their co-opion about saying you may only
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:33.680]   gather the minimum data for the minimum amount of time. And that to me is, is very chilling on
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.920]   innovation and chilling on knowledge and other things, but that's where they've gone and that's
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:43.040]   the extreme of where they can go and probably will go unless we have a better structure where
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.360]   people say, I get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine. Sure. Because I said, okay. And that's to me,
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   privacy is being, you know, privacy by design is one of the great buzzword buzz phrases of
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.880]   labor. To me, that's, that's a misnomer because it starts at the end of the process. The beginning
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:04.400]   of the process is I want to share. I want to find friends. Okay, says path, great, we'll help you do
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:09.840]   that. Here's how, but here's what you're doing along the way. And privacy policies aren't the way
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:13.760]   to do that. Privacy laws aren't the way to do that. The UI is the way to do that. Yeah.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.400]   Right. I agree. So it's really an issue from a technical point of view, I think probably,
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.160]   I'm sure I know everybody does this because it's the simplest way to do it. Somebody saying you
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.400]   could hash and it's true. You could hash on the phone. You could hash all the email addresses,
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:36.400]   upload the hash and compare them with a hash on the, on the path side. I can see why they would
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.800]   choose not to do that. It's computationally intensive. And they probably just didn't think
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:46.160]   because I'm sure Facebook and everything else does. If you're going to search your contact list
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:51.040]   for matches, that's what's going to happen. Right. Right. That's really the message I want to
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.680]   get out to people is, well, how did you think they were doing it? Right. I think you're right. Right.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.800]   Right. But I mean, the, the apples turns a service section 17 one apps cannot transmit data about a
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.400]   user without obtaining the user's prior permission and providing the user with access to information
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.120]   about how and where the data will be used. So it is a violation. It should be a big box that says
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.000]   you're, we are now going to upload your contact list to our servers where we will compare it with
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.880]   our members list. We will store this for future reference. If you choose not to do this, press
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:24.560]   cancel. I think that they understood, except for the storing part, I think that they presumed
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.000]   that people would presume this is how we're going to do it. People are not. I think your right too is
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.840]   that in our world probably would people would presume it. But obviously others don't. Right.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:38.320]   Yeah. Yeah. Geek would know, although I didn't think about it. I was actually, I didn't think
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.480]   about it till I read the art, all these, all this outrage. And I thought, well, yeah.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:49.280]   Oh, I, of course they're doing that. But it's interesting. So I wonder how apples going to
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:54.880]   respond. So the response from Dave is we blew it. We're sorry. We're going to delete it,
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:01.280]   which will actually eliminate some functionality of path, which is to let you know your friend is
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:05.920]   now on path, which is a big deal. I like. So what I'd like is the choice.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:10.960]   Right. There's an update that will involve some better communication and choice. Oh, I see this.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:16.640]   In path 2.0.6 released to the App Store today, but mostly probably to be in compliance with Apple's
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.680]   own policy, you're prompted to opt in or out of sharing your phone's contacts with our servers.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.960]   If you accept and later decide you would like to revoke this access, send an email to service
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.880]   at path.com. Is that is that significant? Is it sufficient? Email us and we'll delete it.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:37.280]   First, I think it's, I think it's funny that they said sharing your phone's contacts with our
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:43.200]   servers as if we're in an entity. We are servers. We would like to share my
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.800]   ear with your servers. And maybe it's because, and I have to admit, I love path and I love Dave.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.360]   Although I've given Dave a hard time in the past when he was at Facebook. In fact, he remembered
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:59.600]   that, which I felt bad about. But I think he's great. And I think, I think, I don't think he's
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.800]   nefarious. So, yeah, I'm not saying I didn't put the story in the rundown because I think that path
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.080]   was a big story. I think that their apology was remarkable. I think this is a bigger issue about
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.320]   disclosure and what our expectations are when a mobile app says it needs access to your address
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.120]   book, do you expect that that means they're uploading all your contacts to their server?
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:25.280]   To me, I expect that that means, you know, they're going to say, oh, this person on Twitter is also,
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:29.200]   you know, this is the phone number that you have for this person or, you know, data sharing or kind of
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.640]   mash data together or give me an easy way to email someone or phone someone from within the app.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:39.680]   That's what that translates to me. I agree. To me, that sounds, I assume that it's client side.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:44.800]   If I got a notification from path, I said, oh, hey, your mom just joined path. It wouldn't ring a
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.600]   little bit of a bell. And I'd say, oh, how did they? But you can't expect regular people to do that.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.360]   Right. Right. And I would think, well, maybe the, you know, maybe the app is running in the
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.640]   background, you know, maybe there's an asynchronous task going on in the background. That's true.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.720]   That's doing the check. It's not that difficult to check, you know, to send the data.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.920]   That's a really good point because we can think of credible, maybe not preferable,
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.480]   but credible ways to do this without uploading and storing data.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.640]   Right. Then really, that does mean you've got to tell us if you're going to do this.
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.080]   Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that would be efficient. It would use a lot of bandwidth. It would,
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:18.240]   you know, it might slow down your phone. They're all good technical reasons why they did what they
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.320]   did the way they did it. And I'm not blaming path. I'm not saying that they did the wrong way,
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:28.240]   but I do find this really interesting about what users' expectations are about Apple's review process,
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.800]   about what, you know, what their phone is doing when they ask for certain permissions.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:36.000]   I think about this a lot when I have to set my apps to ask for permissions.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.080]   Apparently, chatroom just gave me a link to a story from last year, Rims, who's kick,
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:50.000]   which is a messenger client on iOS and Android, by the way, after they found out that it was doing
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   the same thing. Kick it, breach contractual obligations based, blah, blah, blah. Apparently,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.120]   what they were doing is uploading a contact list. This doesn't actually say in great detail what it
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:08.240]   was, but in fact, now it's in court. So I, you know, maybe this is not an uncommon thing,
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.720]   but maybe it's also not unreasonable to get upset about it and say, hey,
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.600]   Yeah, but again, I think we have to go to harm, right? So what are the possible harms here?
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:26.080]   I, you know, if there were a breach of the data, well, yeah, they sold my contact list to anybody.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:30.080]   That's a pretty big harm. Not, not salivating. I don't think Panther ever saw that that that is
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.800]   like a good car. It could. Well, they asked them, right? But even if this is a breach,
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.920]   well, what if they're compiling, what if they compile a mailing list and sell it to a spammer?
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.520]   Yeah, you see that that's the thing, Leo. That's where we get to. That's why this is the
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:48.800]   the data void rule, regulate the behavior and other technology. So if you try to regulate the
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.320]   gathering of data in full, you can't know anything and you must forget everything.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:58.080]   That becomes very difficult. Whereas you say, listen, if, if you, if they gathered this data for
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.920]   the purpose of giving you a service, they allowed no access to it. There was no breach. They did
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:07.200]   nothing else wrong. The harm of them having on the server is to minimalist. If they purposely
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.080]   didn't go and sell it or if they treat the data carelessly and there's a breach, that's where the
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:19.360]   harm lies. So the regulation is more in, what did they do wrong to you than my God, everything that
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:25.120]   could go wrong. Right. So, so to me, it's, it's, as I say, it's to minimalist that they have my
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.280]   address book on their server. If I trust them to hold it well, and if they don't do anything bad
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.240]   with it, there's no real harm there. There's potential harm that's not. If they do, you're right. If
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:41.760]   they sell it to a third party without my knowledge, yeah, that's harm. What about Pinterest, Pinterest?
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.880]   Can that, can that fad go away before I have to actually use it? Well, I feel the same way. Maybe
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:53.680]   it will. I am not a Pinterest fan. I am a member because I, I try everything and I've often wondered
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.840]   why people are so crazy about it. Somebody said, just, you know, ask a woman, but I don't think
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:03.360]   that's sexist. We're not going there again. So the idea of Pinterest for those who have yet to
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.840]   been exposed to it, and it isn't by the way, public, and yet I read a thing a couple of weeks ago that
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:12.880]   was like the number eight most used site in the internet. I mean, it's huge already, even in beta,
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.320]   is that you just use it as a digital scrapbook of things you think are cool in lots of different
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:23.040]   categories. And you can browse other people's, there it is, other people's child free and loving it.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:29.520]   You can browse other people's Pinterest. It's 23 months. I didn't realize I've been around so long.
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:35.680]   It's got a lot of content. As I said, it was recently reported. This is from this article on
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:40.640]   digital trends.com that Pinterest drove more referral traffic last month, more referral traffic
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:47.280]   than Google Reddit, YouTube, LinkedIn, and MySpace combined. Who said that? That can't be right.
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:54.400]   Maybe they mean Google plus even so even so. Yeah, more than Google plus.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.960]   Plus it seems like all the gifts from Google plus just put together one place with nothing else
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:05.600]   of value. I mean, that's exactly what it is. This is from shareaholic. According to shareaholic,
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.200]   Pinterest drove more referral traffic to sites in January than Google plus Reddit, YouTube,
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.040]   LinkedIn, MySpace combined. Yes, on what they were, what source for the data?
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:20.240]   Referral traffic is 3.6%. I'm not sure shareaholic is a sharing app, I believe. So it could just be
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:24.960]   through shareaholic. It could be some small subset. All right, I agree. Call BS.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:30.400]   Everything. Call BS. That's right. See, this is what's good. We have a panel that can actually say
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.600]   things like that's ridiculous. I'm going to summon this Clay Johnson.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.480]   Yeah, really. I call BS. Information diet. Checkers orces.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:46.000]   Here's an interesting thing. LL Social did a little digging on where the money is.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.560]   And look at the referral links. If you pin something in Pinterest and it links to an e-commerce
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:56.880]   site that has an affiliate program, Pinterest will modify the link to add their own affiliate
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:02.320]   tracking code. Clever. Very. I mean, that makes them a billion dollar company, Bada Bing.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.800]   But again, this is probably not illegal or wrong, but they probably should disclose.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:14.000]   Yeah, but I don't. Yeah, I don't think they're wrong with that. And you've seen gentleman, right?
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.120]   That's the day I joined. I'm trying to join gentleman because I'm a man.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.600]   But even there I get so there's a picture. I want to shave share share,
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.480]   share, say shaving tips with other fellas. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.960]   Pictures of guns and burgers. Thank you very much.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:32.640]   Is it like a special theater here? That's a good question. They haven't let me in. Are you
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:38.640]   a member of gentleman? No. No, I've asked from a. I just learned how to watch the Super Bowl.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.160]   It's a it's a mint manly things.
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.000]   Mustache pomade of a shaving mug.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.680]   Webber performer charcoal. I don't know. Don't you? I want to join this site. I'm sorry. Beer,
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:02.160]   barbecue, you know, shoes and foosball. I don't know how to make a moleskine.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:09.440]   I think it's very interesting. There's some interesting subset of women's world.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:14.560]   Pinterest for men is what it is. That's all. And I think that's good. So, but back to the question.
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:21.200]   So they're generating using a service apparently called skim links. They're generating revenue.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.720]   I think this is brilliant by adding affiliate links. Now we, you know,
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.360]   when I link to something on my website, I try to remember my Amazon affiliate code, not so
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.440]   effectively. But that's a great way to what if Twitter did that?
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:39.120]   Twitter absolutely could do that. There's nothing. I mean, there's no reason why they can. It's their
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.840]   domain. You're posting links to it. You know, I mean, Twitter already shortens your links using
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.760]   their Tico service. And you can opt out of that. So I bet you make a lot of money really quickly.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.400]   I think that would be probably pretty, pretty controversial.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.760]   But is it wrong? Are there any loss to you?
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.160]   No, it's it takes away the advertising clutter.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:06.960]   Right. I mean, what would be nice is if, and this is what I think, you know, this, this is a column
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:12.560]   that I thought was, was full of horsepucky. You know, arguing, I forget who it was into the column,
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:17.600]   saying it was near times. Nick built it. So well, well, where's our money from Facebook?
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.160]   Because all this money they got, and then far content.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.720]   Would you prefer that they just charge you for the service? Yeah, you're getting value out of
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.640]   you and your data. You're choosing to post it on Pinterest, not your blog.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.280]   Right. So I think it's a way to affect how many steel that business model immediately for all
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:38.720]   the local sites I work with. Well, there's this service will do this for you. This looks cool.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.040]   I'm going to check them out. What's the name of the service?
[00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:46.320]   skim links. They go through all the links on your site and they add affiliate codes.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:51.360]   Here's the unlock the cash in your content. And so what proportion do they give you?
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:57.040]   Well, I think it's your code. What's your code? Oh, I don't know.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.160]   Well, I would like it if they already went and did deals with all these places.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:06.320]   And I didn't have to do all that. Well, they'll even add a pop up that shows price comparison
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:11.840]   stuff. I mean, this is actually pretty sophisticated. So the question is, if you post a link to Pinterest
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:17.920]   with your own Amazon or whatever affiliate I those Pinterest overwrite. Yes, yours.
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.000]   Yeah, I believe that's the case. Oh, see, that's not okay with me.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   I've from for me, I feel like it has to detect, you know, if the user is adding their own affiliate
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.080]   code, then I think that, you know, if I'm going to post a link to Twitter to, you know, recommending
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.160]   an app product on Amazon and I use my Amazon code, I expect that that's going to be maintained.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.160]   If there's no code, then I wouldn't have a problem with Twitter adding their own.
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.080]   Right. Now, there's an argument though, Gina, isn't there that if you and I do this myself,
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.920]   I use affiliate links myself. But if you do that, there is an argument in kind of journalistic
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.080]   walkie circles that says that that puts you in a conflict of interest that you're selling the
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.560]   products that you're writing about and thus your suspect. But Pinterest is not a journalistic
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:05.040]   enterprise by. Well, that was per se. Neither. Am I? Yeah. I do it too. I'm just presenting the
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:10.800]   argument. That's a good point, actually. Yeah. I mean, if I work for the New York Times or a paper
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.880]   where I have to worry about those kinds of conflict, I mean, I mean, I've kind of developed my own
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.280]   sort of personal code of contact, conan, conduct, and that doesn't, I use affiliate links on my blog.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:24.640]   Louis DK says in our chat room, they do not modify if there's an affiliate code existing
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.040]   affiliate code. Oh, that's good. So if they're respectful of users, users content in that way,
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:36.720]   then nope, I've got no problem with that. Yeah. Do you actually make more than coffee money with it?
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.360]   Do you know? No, not too much more than coffee money, but I, but I, but I, but I, but I, but
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:48.960]   I think enough. We made, I think $20,000 last year. Oh, yeah, I'm not near that. I don't remember.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.840]   I saw the amount. I don't know. I don't know where it came from. It could be from also search links
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:59.760]   in other in the tech guy has Google ads and the search results. It uses Google search results.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:05.200]   I don't know if the Twitter site does, but it's more than coffee money, but I don't, you know,
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:14.800]   it's funny because I don't see a conflict of interest because it's not, I mean, in the case
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.760]   of the New York Times, they're the New York Times is allowed to do it, not their reporters.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:23.680]   Right. Right. So the conflict of interest is the New York Times wants it to accrue to
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.200]   them, not to their reporters. Yeah. Right. That's the conflict of interest.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.680]   And most of the time I'm mentioning my book, which, you know,
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.360]   right, it's our own stuff that we're still at. It's my own stuff anyway, or stuff from, you know,
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.480]   from friends that I, that I want to, apparently, because it's good. Skim words is used by Techner
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:46.720]   Roddy, Cosmopolitan, uh, Ning, fat wallet.com. So at least they claim them as clients.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:51.600]   So there. All right, we're going to take a break. When we come back, I'm going to talk about my
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.000]   really fat phone. It's fat, baby. We also,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.680]   AT fat will also talk about Chrome, finally, on Android. And I'll give you a little demo on our,
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:08.160]   this I should give a review of this too. The hot Asus transformer prime. It's all Kevin,
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:13.920]   get it just a moment. But first a word from Citrix, the folks who do the great go to my PC,
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:24.880]   G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C dot com. Go to my PC. It's amazing. It lets you access your office computer. Here's
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.200]   a scenario. Your head and not to the airport. You got minutes to spare. You know you're going to
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.920]   miss the flight. And suddenly you realize, God, I forgot my presentation. It's back on the office
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.080]   computer. Now what do you do? What will you do? Well, I'll tell you what you could do is turn
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.960]   around and miss the flight. Or if you got an iPhone, an Android phone, an Android tablet,
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.120]   you just log on to go to my PC on the free go to my PC app.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:52.560]   Securely, you are transported like magic to your computer, even on your Android or iPhone.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:56.480]   And there it is. All your stuff, send and receive email, access any network resource,
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.520]   copy the file that you need. It worked like on this, on this Asus. It works great.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:08.080]   You're seeing, and it's weird because you're using an iPhone or a tablet to look at a Windows
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:15.280]   machine or a Mac. It's kind of eerie. I want you to try it free for 30 days and see what that
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:22.000]   eerie could be for you. Visit go to my PC.com. Click the try it free button. Use our offer code TWIG,
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:32.960]   TWIG, not TWIG, like a little branch off a tree. 30 days free. And then that's for the
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.480]   desktop app because you got installed on whatever computer you want to access first. By the way,
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:40.000]   you won't need the IT department or anything like that. It's very easy. It takes literally
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:47.680]   a minute to install and then download the app for the various platforms. Mac PC, iPad, iPhone,
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:56.080]   Android tablets. It's really cool. Go to my PC.com. Use the offer code TWIT. These guys are great.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.680]   TWIG. TWIG. See, I did it. See, I have a feeling. There are people out there who will do exactly
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:07.360]   the same thing that will type in a TWIT. No, use a G. TWIG. Thank you, Eileen.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:14.400]   Let's see here. Should I tell you about the files? This is a good time to show you the notes.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:21.920]   Sure. Yeah, show it to us. This is going to be available February 19th this week. AT&T will offer
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:28.160]   it. It supports AT&T's LTE network. This is the European Unlocked version and there are some differences.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:35.920]   The Unlocked version has an Exynos processor. The AT&T version will have a Qualcomm processor.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:41.200]   I think they're roughly the same speed. This one has a physical home button. The AT&T will have
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:47.680]   the capacitive buttons across the bottom. It does come with Gingerbread 236. Although they say
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.800]   that they will upgrade to ICS. Samsung says it's going to upgrade almost all of its latest stuff,
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:59.280]   like the Galaxy 2 and then X is already ICS. I think this will be ICS. But what I like and what
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:07.200]   I'm interested in this, this is a Fablet. A phone. Fablet. Is that a great word? A phone that you
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:12.560]   could really approximate a tablet experience. In fact, do the over the shoulder because you can
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:19.280]   get a sense of how legible and big it is. Now, I'm an old man. You don't need reading glasses for
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:27.760]   this. In fact, stuff is really easy to see to read. Let me put up the Kindle app up and you'll see.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:33.440]   This is actually in some ways isn't this the test for a phone? Would you want to read a book on it?
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:39.920]   In fact, it's now I can make it different type sizes. Of course, I'll make it bigger for you guys
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:47.840]   because you're a little more distant. But it's totally, it's 5.3 inches. It's intermediate
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:53.760]   between a tablet and a phone. But it's big enough. I've read quite a few pages. Very comfortable.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:59.840]   It'll fit in a jacket pocket shortly. But watch the shirt pocket. Watch. Now, this is a Scott
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.960]   Evess. So everything fits in these. Oh, yeah. So it's. But no, it fits in your breast pocket.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:07.600]   No problem. What's different from this like than the streak, which is also a big kind of phone,
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:13.440]   is it's so thin and it's very light. Battery life is pretty typical. It is a bigger screen.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:18.000]   So it's going to use up more battery, but it's got a bigger battery. So it's kind of a push. I'm
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.720]   getting roughly 10 hours pretty regularly, kind of iPad battery life out of it. But I don't talk
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.800]   on the phone. And by the way, talking like this probably does look a little goofy, you know,
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.600]   holding it to your head. But most lately, I very rarely I was before I bought this, I thought,
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:36.160]   do I ever actually hold my phone up very rarely? Almost always I use earbuds, Bluetooth or I'm
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:40.240]   in the car and I you know, if you think about it, when the first phones came out, it was goofy.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.520]   Yeah, it's goofy anyway. Remember when phones were little? There's a guy named David Borman used to be
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:53.680]   the bureau chief at CNN in Washington. And now I think he's running current. But he's a big guy.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:02.960]   Don I miss used to call him moose butt Borman. And he was he was the NBC liaison producer for
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:08.880]   the site, the show we did for MSNBC when it launched. And he this so this was 1996,
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:14.560]   95 and phones were really little by then he had a little Sony phone. It was literally it was this
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:20.320]   big. It was so little that you folded out the thing to talk into. And so this big fat guy was
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:27.200]   hold this little phone. That looked dumb. Yeah, it looks dumb. You know, so this is I don't think
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:31.440]   that looks I have a big head. I don't think that looks bad. It doesn't look too bad. Can you use
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.360]   it with one hand comfortably though? Yeah, well maybe and again, that would depend on hand size.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.200]   And I have talked to women who say, Oh, no, I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to use this.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.920]   It's too hard for me to type on. But I you know, I my thumb reaches all the way across.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:48.480]   So that's not a problem. But you would more typically do it like you would with it with
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.680]   the galaxy where you do the two thumb thing it has it comes with as all the Samsungs do,
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:59.840]   which I really like comes with swipe, which I'm very fond of. So let me write a tweet here.
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.760]   Yeah, he's really looks nice on that screen. That's a big old tweet box.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.040]   Look how big this text is and everything.
[00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:15.840]   I like swipe and I just think it's very easy to use it. You know, it's it's Android. So you
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.800]   know, it's you're familiar with it. It's just a bigger screen. Very snappy though. One the one
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:27.840]   point for a gigahertz dual processor. So it's very snappy. Swipes very quickly and easily.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:32.720]   I like it. I'm very I've been very happy with it. You get a lot of widgets on that screen too.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.720]   I'm a widget guy. Yeah, I like widgets a lot. I've been missing them in iOS.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:41.520]   This is a widget that shows the moon phase. Yeah, that's what you missed from iOS is you can't
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.760]   customize the screen at all. I even have a customized, you know, I have a live wallpaper
[00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:50.400]   that's the weather. You know, like that like that weather widget right there on a lot of phones
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.720]   that would take up the entire horizontal space of your home screen. But it doesn't on that. You
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:36:01.360]   got that's that's widget. That's a widget. This is a battery widget. So I see the battery live. I
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:06.240]   know I like widgets and I do this one thing. I think that iOS doesn't do very well as the is the
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:12.480]   I miss the widgets. Leo, I should know this. I got a new Android phone and it didn't carry in all
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.920]   my apps and all the stuff. Isn't it supposed to just carry all the stuff from any? You know,
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.680]   that seems to be a genome. I don't know what your your experience is. That seems to be kind of hit
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:23.840]   or miss. It does seem to be hit or miss. My wife just got a new phone and she had a similar thing.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.480]   She said, are I supposed to get all my apps? And I was like, yeah, you know what I do. I can remember
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:33.680]   if you have to opt into the thinking somewhere. It does sometimes it sometimes it doesn't.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:39.440]   A lot of the free apps won't transfer over, but your paid apps. Well, I got a I got a fix for this,
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.840]   by the way. So you get a app brain. You all know about app brain, which is a great little app. And
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:47.440]   one of the things that brain will do, by the way, that talk about crazy live wallpaper.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.760]   I got an aquarium on here. Let me add a blank screen so you can see it.
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:00.080]   One of the things that app brain will do is it will. Where is it? It will.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:04.480]   That live wallpaper with all those widgets and that big screen.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:08.560]   I got that battery last for a good five minutes. And I can feed the fish here. Come here, fish.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.760]   So, I mean, I could just sit and watch this all day. So.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:18.960]   The app design up nightmare. It is. Oh, God, you guys, this is so trashy. This is the equivalent
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:25.360]   of having 18 fonts on a report, a book or I love it. I'm trashy. And with that screen,
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.320]   actually, I'm getting decent battle battery life, although I did buy three batteries.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:33.040]   Battery is replaceable. So are you loving it because you're you're an ICS snub?
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.320]   I hate ICS. I know that's why I is that part of the reason that you're you're
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:40.640]   chortling that you love this one because I think it's going to get ICS and I'll put ICS on there.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.320]   I think now's the time if you're worried about ICS to buy a phone with physical or
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:49.920]   capacitive buttons so that you at least will have those buttons. And then when ICS moves the menu
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:54.640]   all over the to hell and back, you'll still know there's a menu button right at the bottom as it
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:38:00.240]   always has been at every Shelby. That's the only thing I bugged about ICS everything else I like,
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:06.960]   but that really drives me crazy. Sorry, Gina, you were saying no, no, that's okay. I appreciate
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:14.880]   strong, well-formed opinions. And I think I think it makes sense because the menu button on my
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.600]   next is Galaxy Nexus. Sometimes it's at the bottom. Sometimes it's the top. You always have to look
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:23.360]   where's the dot dot dot and it's and it's an ellipsis sideways ellipsis, which you can't see
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:29.520]   anyway. Yes. But I love the apps. The apps are much improved. I really missed the better browser.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:35.200]   You know, so anyway, but I but so anyway, to say to complete the thought this is actually
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.760]   unlike a big screen. And I think what's nice about Android and a real advantage Android has
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:44.720]   is the variety of choices. You know, Apple calls it fragmentation. I call it choice.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:50.960]   Mm hmm. True. And boy, everybody thinks I'm wrong about iScript, which is how much fun.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:56.000]   You know, I'm just just my opinion. It's called opinion. It's not called fact for a reason.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.400]   App reign. That's right. Let me finish the thought. So you download App reign free app,
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.160]   you put it on there, you sync your phone. Now what App reign does, you have to log in your Google
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.800]   account. What App reign does is creates a list of all the apps on any phone you have. This comes
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:15.280]   up a lot for me because as you know, I have about 80 Android phones. So I have a list on App reign.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:20.160]   I'll show you of all my all my different phones. And what you can do, it's really makes this very
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:26.480]   simple. The App reign has a fat, it's called the fast web installer. And so what you do is you say,
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:32.800]   okay, let's let's go to my phones. Where's my apps? Here they are. So right now, I only have two
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.640]   phones on here. I have the Galaxy S2 in the sense. So I can look at all the apps. These are, this is
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:43.040]   what's installing the Galaxy S2. And I can check all if I want, or I can go through them one by one.
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:48.160]   And then I can copy, I can take these and I can add them to a different phone list.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:54.400]   So we'll move all these apps to that phone. And then, or just the apps you want. And then,
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:58.480]   and it doesn't care if they're free or not, or paid or not, whatever, then it just then you can
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.440]   you, as long as you have two years.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.000]   Yeah, right. Exactly. No, it doesn't take any time.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.440]   On a Wi-Fi, maybe take an hour to have that phone be identical to the one I start with. You
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:14.720]   could also use titanium if you've rooted your phone and back it up. But this is a very simple
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:19.200]   way to move your stuff over. Gina, you use App reign. Because I follow you. I do.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:26.320]   So that's the other thing you can do is you can follow people, see what they use on their phone
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:31.200]   and copy that to your phone. So here's Gina's list of stuff that she's...
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.000]   I haven't been diligent about... Oh dear.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.680]   ...installing it. Uh-oh. Am I, is it, am I empty?
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:42.160]   No, they're there. Okay, so here's apps on her phone. So all you have to do is install it and sync.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.240]   And so if I see something, oh, the conventionist, I don't know that. Let me add that. And I press
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:52.000]   install and installs it on my phone. That's pretty sweet. That's another thing Apple won't do for you.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:00.240]   So there you go. And it seems to be, at least you can do this manually. If you didn't do it
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:05.920]   automatically for you, you can at least do it manually. And I do, and I'll give a thumbs up to
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.440]   the note. I think Tony reviewed it. Tony liked it right on. He reviewed it on before you buy.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:14.960]   He loved it. Yeah, I think it's a... I love it. Now, I didn't show you the thing that Samsung
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:22.640]   wants me to show you. It is a stylus. Oh... Which is so stupid. They call it, they said,
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:29.680]   "Don't call it the stylus. It's the S Pen." It's a stylus! The spin. Spin. So there's a few things
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:35.040]   the spin will do that are, I guess, fanicle. The phablet spin, yeah. Well, it's even worse,
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:40.240]   because it's not only is it a stylus, it's a stylus with a button. Oh, please. And, and, you know,
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:45.360]   but the nice thing is if you lose it, you don't really care. But anyway, so, so I have never,
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.000]   I've never pulled it out. But there are a couple of things that we'll do. And some people might like
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.040]   this at CES. They were really highlighting the fact that you could draw with this. And they had
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:58.240]   little, they called it the Galaxy Note A TELE and people were drawing with it. But if I press the
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:05.120]   button and double tap, it opens up a note. This, and you could do handwritten notes as well as text
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:11.520]   typing. If you see a stylus, they blew it. Well, that's what Apple, that's what Jobs said, right?
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.680]   Yeah, that was Jobs was a famous quote, right about a style, a possibility of a stylus with the
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:22.080]   iPhone. So you could type, you can draw, you can erase. I mean, I get free, you know, I am not that
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:27.120]   left or right brain. If I were, maybe I'd be really excited about that. If you press the button and
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:34.720]   you hold, it does a screenshot, which it then opens up in an image editor. And you can
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:41.680]   annotate it. So you can crop it. Let's get the right cropping tool. Let's get the rectangle.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:49.840]   I can crop it and say, yeah, let's just copy this part here. Okay, everybody, whoops, I pressed it.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:56.160]   Cool. I'm done. There's that part. I can annotate it. Let's pull up a pen and say, look at that.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:03.040]   Wednesday, it's going to be cloudy. Wow. And then I can save it. And I can also share it out,
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:08.000]   you know, to Twitter and all the other places. I guess that's of some use. I, you know, they have
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.200]   some apps that are designed for the S Pen. There's a crayon physics game that you can play with the
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:19.120]   S Pen stuff like that. Something that Tony did that I thought was genius was at CES. He got an
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:24.320]   autograph. He took a picture with celebrities. You could do that. They autographed his photo on the
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.720]   note. Yeah, this is this is cool. This is one of my favorite apps. This is a Zen brush app.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:35.120]   That's very beautiful. Oh, that's nice. I mean, I bought a stylus for my iPad for an art, an app.
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:40.400]   So that's the thing when people say stylus, you know, you have to use a stylus, you blew it.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:46.880]   There's a huge market and third party stylus is for the iPad. So maybe, you know, maybe not, right?
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:52.000]   And they don't work as well as the spend. I can assure you. No, that's nice. The pressure sensitive
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.320]   and very nice. Oh, license check failure. This is the problem. Okay, I didn't mention this,
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:02.560]   but this is my big problem. This is the unlock GSM version. I put a T mobile SIM in it.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.960]   It doesn't have all the right frequencies. It only does edge on T mobile. And it often
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.440]   thinks I'm not online because this stupid piece of crap doesn't do doesn't do 3G.
[00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:17.840]   So get the AT&T version or if Tony did this, he got an AT&T SIM and with a little hacking of
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:25.280]   the APN addresses, you can make this work with AT&T's 3G. Not their LTE, but their 3G. If Verizon
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:31.120]   released this as an LTE phone, I would be so all over that. All over that.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:37.360]   So I think this is what's great is you got the choice. Leo, do you have the new Chrome on it?
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:42.000]   I don't. I have it on. You want to look at it? I have it on. We just did a demo. Let's not do
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.520]   another demo. No, no, no, no, no. You have it on your I have it. But the problem is that it says
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:53.600]   you can sync all of your tabs and I only I don't get my tabs synced. Oh, did you sign in? You have
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:45:01.520]   to sign in. I'm signed in. I synced. And so it does all your tabs? Well, oh, it's needs a pass phrase.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:07.200]   It's syncing now, I guess. So in theory, it's going to look just like my Chrome at home.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:11.360]   Which sounded great, but mine doesn't work that way. So everybody, tell me where the menu is just
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:17.920]   at a curiosity. Where is that menu? Oh, there it is. See that? There it is. It's up there.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:25.120]   Steely. There's the memo, the menu. So it hasn't yet downloaded. It looks like it hasn't yet
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:30.800]   downloaded my bookmarks. But it will. So it looks just like Chrome. I love this up for a tablet.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:36.480]   You want Chrome, right? Yeah, you do. Are they both WebKit, Gina?
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:43.760]   Yes, they're both WebKit. I don't think that this doesn't support Chrome extensions yet.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:49.680]   Oh, maybe that's OK. Well, I have extensions. And look, it's identifying as mobile, which really
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:54.160]   kind of is annoying. The reason why I use Dolphin is for the LastPass extension.
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:46:00.400]   Dolphin is great. And the LastPass extension is fantastic.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:04.320]   Yeah. I mean, I'm to the point where I'm basically useless on the web without it,
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.640]   because it's just it's got passwords. Yeah. But this is working. I mean,
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:15.040]   this seems to do a decent job. It's just like Chrome, to be honest. Now, this is on the gate.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:21.040]   By the way, I love this. This is the Asus transformer prime, the newest Asus transformer. So it docks
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.640]   into this keyboard and blah, blah, blah becomes a laptop.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:32.320]   That's an operating system on that is ice cream sandwich. I see. Oh, wow.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:36.880]   Right. Yes. You can drag and drop and make folders like you do on the phone.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:42.480]   So yeah, if you yeah, there you go. How much is that one run? 500 bucks.
[00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:49.520]   And if you get the the docs 150, so for 650 bucks, you get a laptop. Now it doesn't this one
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:56.480]   doesn't have 3G, but it does have a lot. I've been using the Logitech iPad keyboard.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:00.000]   Right. Which is very nice. Elkin makes a lot of companies make these.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.320]   Yeah, this one's this one's I like this better than 70 bucks. You know, it's okay.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:09.840]   I just bought one of those. But it's on its way. Yes. Being shipped. I finally I gave in. I felt
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:14.400]   I felt kind of dirty about it. I'll be honest. Well, I got a nice job. You know, you bought
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:19.520]   a stylus for your iPad and you you bought a keyboard. Why did you just buy a laptop for crying out loud?
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:25.120]   Exactly. No, it's true. I know. I really I've been there for a long time.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:30.880]   But I like to I like to write and you know, the iPad really is kind of this nice distraction
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:35.360]   for your environment. It travels really nicely. It's lighter and just easier to carry around.
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.800]   And you can you know, have the choice of taking the keyboard. I don't know. I'm glad you like it,
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.440]   though, Jeff. I'm gonna I'm gonna try it out. I held out for a long time and finally given.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.560]   So this has an incognito tab, which like a real Chrome, which is nice. That means you can browse
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:55.680]   and surf completely anonymously. Let me see if in the settings because it is identifying itself as
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:01.920]   a mobile browser. So if you if you put your passphrase in, which I thought I did, but I'll do it again,
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:08.560]   it will it will sync apparently. Most of this looks looks pretty much the same.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:14.240]   I sure would like to change its identity, though. Maybe it's in developer tools.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:18.560]   Enable tilt scrolling, enable USB web debugging.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:25.280]   That's gonna be a popular feature. Really? Why?
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:30.160]   Oh, thank goodness it has that. Good. Thank goodness.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:35.760]   Private. You know, mine isn't sinking either to my desktop just yet. It might take some time.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:44.160]   And I'm surely signed in on both. Right. School. Is this news? I just I just looked at Amazon
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:48.400]   as I was gonna look up that I was gonna put that on my wish list and they say they've just wrapped
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:54.080]   up another deal with MTV Nickelodeon Comedy Central TV land via one big story or Amazon Prime.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.960]   This is they're going right after Netflix now. And in some ways,
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:02.800]   I might have a little bit of a head leg up on Netflix. If you're an Amazon's prime subscriber
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:08.000]   now, the stuff you get for free from Amazon streaming from Amazon is pretty good. And if you've got,
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:14.480]   you need a Roku or what else does a boxy box Google TV? Obviously, we'll do it.
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:19.520]   The Google TV crashes a lot on me. The Amazon Prime streaming. It's using flash
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:23.600]   and it crashes. And I've the updated Google TV, the Logitech review,
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:30.160]   and it crashes all the time. But Netflix never crashes on me. So prime instant videos is gonna
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:38.000]   be, yeah, but they did a deal with Viacom. So lots more stuff. Jersey Shore. Oh, thank God.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.960]   There's some quality content. MTV. That's at the top of my information diet.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:49.360]   Oh, come on. You want this? You know you do. No, this does look good. I've actually never
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:54.080]   watched this show. Is it good? No, no, no, no, no. I know Snooki. We just missed Snooki. She was at
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:59.120]   live with Regis and Kelly. I'm sorry. There's no Regis live with Kelly. The day before we were
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.040]   there, we missed Snooki. I would have missed Snooki. Instead. I met somebody from Twilight. I don't
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:08.320]   even know who it was. Oh, yeah. A lotner or something like that. I don't. It wasn't. No,
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:13.120]   I heard it was. You're bugging me. I heard it was Ashley Green. It was. It was the young
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:20.080]   Anjhanu. Is Alice, right? Yes. The one who? Yeah. Again, no idea who she was. Yeah. We got it.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:24.880]   We got it. We got it. We got it. Walked by me in the hall. I just noticed she was short,
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:31.920]   beautiful and had a lot of makeup on. Well, so did I. So.
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:36.720]   We are you to great. I had a lot of fun. I had a lot of watching that. That segment.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:41.760]   Did you like that giant boombox? I did. I thought it was so great. I love that Kelly was working it.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:46.400]   And I love all your faces when she accidentally paused the music. You all sort of looked around
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:54.240]   like. She broke it. You broke it. That was fun. That was really fun. Rocky. Just call me Rocky
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:51:08.400]   Laport. Let's see. Moving along. Google screen wise new program pays you to surf using Chrome,
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:13.280]   but you have to give up your privacy. But it could not be more obvious what you're doing.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:19.840]   I think this is great. You could sign up at google.com/landing/screenwise panel.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:23.440]   One thing I wanted to know is will it ignore an incognito for you?
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:28.400]   Ah, that's an interesting question. If it did that,
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.800]   obviously you could game it. But you wouldn't get it for your web experience. But if you really
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.560]   wanted to go to something that you just did not want anyone to know about, then you got paid
[00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:40.960]   five bucks otherwise. I'm guessing that the screen wise browser extension has an on/off switch.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:49.040]   I can try it. That's what happens. You install a Chrome extension. They don't give you nothing
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:58.720]   for 25 bucks in gift cards. Come on. I don't even understand fully why they're doing this
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:02.800]   since they already know so much. They want to know how every day people use the internet.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:07.040]   It says, "What we learn from you and others like you will help you improve Google products and
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:10.400]   services and make a better online experience for everyone." You could be simply watching what
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:13.920]   you click and the... They want to know the whole internet your entire experience.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:18.320]   They're using a company called Knowledge Networks to do this.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:25.760]   Every three months, this is even worse than I thought it was. Five bucks for signing up,
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:30.800]   and then five bucks every three months. Up to twenty five dollars. Yeah, it's not good.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:37.440]   This extension must transmit information about the web surfing that they can't get
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:41.360]   from... Exactly. That's right. You have to be 13 or older. So it's obviously...
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:46.800]   It sounds like they're just expanding their focus groups. It's like a focus group.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:52.080]   Yeah. And you do it not for the money. I would hope if that makes a difference in your bottom line.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:59.360]   What is it? A buck 33 a month. See, what would be smart about it is if they fed you data back.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:05.200]   If they had a feedback loop to say, "Well, you go to these unusual sites or you do this and you do
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:10.720]   that," that might be something I'd sign up for. But five bucks. Well, Lou, it's a big Mac when you
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:14.800]   sign up and a big Mac a month for up to five months, up to four months.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:20.400]   The economics. You gotta talk in the language of the people.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:25.600]   You know, I use a rescue time, which is an extension that you can install on your browser,
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:29.920]   and also an app that you run or you just stop that analyzes all your activity and breaks it up
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:33.920]   in terms of productivity. And that's really interesting. So that's kind of what you're talking
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.560]   about, Jeff, is giving you feedback on your behavior. Yeah.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:40.000]   In order to fit it or whatever. I turned that sucker off. It was depressing.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:43.280]   It was depressing. Was it too hard to see your habits? Well, when I was doing it, it was like
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.640]   farm, you know, more farm, but really more farm. More farm.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:55.120]   Again with a farm, Bill, I was saying. Sometimes you don't really want to know what you do with your
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:58.080]   time. No, I don't. I definitely don't.
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:08.080]   Now this is something we talked about on security now. This morning, I believe,
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:13.520]   Google's Chrome browser is going to stop using something called
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:20.320]   CRL or certificate revocation lists. I wish we had Steve to explain this a little more.
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:24.000]   I read this a little more. I didn't get it either. We should just rerun the damn thing.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.480]   So the idea is, it's just a broken service, to be honest with you, the idea that it's been around
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:39.120]   for ages. Most browsers use it. I think Firefox also has abandoned this, but Chrome is. So the idea
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:46.080]   is that, as you know, in order to validate the site you're on before you do a transaction, a secure
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:52.080]   transaction, the browser checks the certificate and sees if it has a legitimate certificate that
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:57.840]   matches the site. So you go to Amazon.com. Amazon presents you with using public key cryptography.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:02.640]   So it's a secure certificate saying, yes, I am Amazon.com. It's been verified by a trusted third
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:13.360]   party, etc. There is a service that browsers are supposed to query each and every time.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:21.760]   The online certificate status protocol saying, is this certificate, has it been revoked?
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:29.360]   And that's relevant because, you know, remember the service in Digi Notar in Holland that was
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:36.560]   compromised was a certificate authority and they'd been compromised. So they had to revoke all those
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:41.680]   Digi Notar certificates. So your browser would accept it until it was revoked. So it's to check
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:47.520]   to make sure it's revoked so that if you got a certificate, it's going to be legitimate. The problem
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:55.520]   is the way the server works, if the server is down, for instance, that you're checking with,
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.400]   it'll just say, hey, you know, I'm down, but I'm sure it's fine. Just go ahead.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:05.520]   So it's, and so Moxie Marlin Spike, who is the best named hacker in the world,
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:13.520]   wrote a example program called SSL strip, a tool that says that does that. It doesn't, it changes
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:18.080]   the certificate, does a man in the middle, and then pretends that the certification server is down.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:23.040]   And so the browser goes on happily. So,
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:32.320]   So it's useless. It's useless. It's, it's flawed. In his blog post, Google researcher Adam Langley
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:37.440]   said, while the benefits of online revocation checking are hard to find, the costs are clear.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:45.600]   Online revocation checks are slow and compromise privacy. They add 300 milliseconds as a median
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:51.760]   time and as a mean of almost one second to page loads. So it actually discourages people from
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:57.600]   using SSL. And since it's unreliable, it doesn't do anything. There's no point. So that's basically,
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:02.000]   I believe I've encapsulated Steve's information from the show today. If you really want to hear
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.360]   somebody who actually understands this, listen to security now, we just finished it. It'll be on the
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.120]   on the interwebs soon. Thank you for explaining that, Leo. I think that makes sense. Yeah. I mean,
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:19.600]   the speed issue is, you know, a second golden rule of Chrome, right? Yeah. That's a way too long.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:27.680]   Way too long. Yeah. Let's see. Google has said we have, yes, we have the patents from Motorola.
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:31.920]   And if you want them, we will license them an affair price.
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:40.240]   This is this is from Stephen Musil writing at cnet.com. Google apparently was about to send out a letter
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:48.000]   in the next 24 hours saying that they're going to use friend or fair, reasonable, and non discriminatory
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:55.280]   terms. If you would like to license any of these patents, well, don't they have to do that for
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:03.120]   their Android partners? Right. Unless they have that kind of a fair view of having the patents that
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:07.360]   all of their Android manufacturers are going to have a fit. Yeah. Not to mention the fact that the
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:11.600]   EU has yet to approve the merger. Yeah. And might not if they didn't say this.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:18.000]   Apple actually has sent a letter to the European Telecommunications Standard Institute asking that
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:24.880]   the standards body create basic guidelines regarding patent licensing so that there is a kind of
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:28.720]   standard, you know, suggestions for appropriate royalty rates and stuff like that.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:36.480]   So the Google acquisition, I guess, is approved in the US, right? But not yet approved of Motorola,
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:41.600]   it's not yet approved in the EU. This might be something to make it go better.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:49.200]   Are you ready for Android powered smart glasses? I can't want to buy a pair now.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:58.480]   Yes. I'm ready. Google glasses will have a built in heads up display. I don't believe this for a
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:03.920]   minute. This is from nine to five Google can't possibly be true. I think that's what I thought
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:09.360]   about the car. Yeah, I know. So we found out a couple of weeks ago that Apple when it hires an
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:15.360]   engineer assigns him initially to a fake project and waits to hear if the engineer leaks that
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:19.040]   information before they actually assignment to a real project. That process can take months.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:23.920]   You can actually work at Apple for months on a project that's bogus. I'm convinced that's what
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:30.160]   this is. Something Google made up to assign sketch sketchy new recruits.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:36.880]   Yeah, put them on the on the glasses project. And then if they see a leak, they know, I don't know.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:44.240]   That's just a depressing thing. I want it. I want it. But it just it sounds like an April Fool's
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:50.640]   joke. The glasses, which apparently resemble Oakley sunglasses, you know, that maybe that
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:55.360]   maybe the thing that takes it over the edge. Yes. Yeah. Said to have an integrated transparent
[00:59:55.360 --> 01:00:01.520]   display for one eye and a built in front facing camera. The latter could be used for augmented
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:06.400]   reality. So you'll be looking through one eyes normal and one eye you're looking with a heads up
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:12.480]   display. And you could see you could see stuff. I have a researcher I'm working with here at CUNY
[01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:17.040]   named Nick DiKoppelis. And he got his PhD at Rutgers. And I think it was there where his
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.560]   advisor, maybe was, you know, probably George attack, I think was. I used to be at MIT Labs and he showed
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.840]   a picture of him just just just yesterday where he had a little and he'd been doing it for years.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:30.720]   Like 20 years. He has a little tiny display here attached to his glasses and he wears it all the
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:37.120]   time. And he has a one handed cord keyboard. That's so nerdy. And he said you'll talk to him.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:41.280]   And suddenly you'll see him typing and you'll see the one eye kind of look over there to the
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:46.080]   right. And he said it's so wonderfully weird. He loved the guy. I love it. He said it was just
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.960]   so weird because you don't want to is he typing? You know what I'm saying? Is he looking up something,
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.440]   you know, on Google to see what I'm saying is right? You know, what is he doing?
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.880]   I am not mocking this. I would buy this in a heartbeat. I don't care if it's five grand. I will
[01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:02.320]   buy it. But I'm just thinking I don't think it exists. So according to this story in nine to five
[01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:09.200]   Google, the device will use speech and head tilting for text input and control. So if you thought
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:16.000]   that was weird. Some people walking down the street left head gestures, right, right. Nine to five
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.800]   Google suggests that Google Glasses product could soft launch with a pilot program later this year,
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:25.760]   making the product available to selected number of testers. They would follow the model of the
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:32.000]   Chromebook launch, which was preceded by the CR 48 test unit. I want to see our 48 Google glasses.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:36.480]   Oh man, Google I owe baby. Google I owe. We're going right. We're going to get out the prototypes.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.520]   Here's somewhere under the seats.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:47.520]   Well, not within it. It's a bit of a wet dream, but but but Google once you online all the time
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:53.360]   everywhere. Well, there you go. I'll be on. I'll do it at Davos Marissa Meyer, Mayor,
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:58.720]   right, that Google has caused 12 million miles of turn my turn direction.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:04.960]   Wow. That actually seems low. Shouldn't it be higher? I think it was billion.
[01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:12.000]   Millions seems low. It's got to be billion. If McDonald's has served a billion hamburgers,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.200]   right, a million 12 million miles, it'd be like, I'm sorry, this is a flop. We're going to close
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.440]   the maps project. It's not working. That's right. I know it was billion.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:25.840]   Number of the week has to be. That's right. It's just number of the week.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.400]   Oh, my glasses into live streaming everything I see up into Google Maps. So you will just have
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:36.640]   Street View of everything. Gina, they must give us glasses because you and I were the perfect,
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:41.600]   you'd go to the White House. I'd go to live with Kelly. We would map everything.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:47.360]   Yes. I will promise to wear them at night in the everywhere I go from now on forever.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.720]   And you can give me five bucks a month. I'll take it.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:56.640]   Maybe. Wow. Wouldn't that be funny if that if that. Oh, here's your $25. Oh, by the way,
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:03.520]   here's the glasses. Crowds or secretion images. We didn't mention this. Yes, you get a big Mac
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:11.760]   and Google glasses. I want them. Well, you'd go. The internal inside things, right? It has inside.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:15.520]   Yeah. I used it. Where was it? Was it? Was it? Yes. Yeah. I was using him at C. Yes. Yes.
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:20.480]   Yes. We're just said that there's a pride on the team that within the Google campus,
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.560]   they can put you not just in the room and not just on the table, but at the seat you ran at the
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.000]   table. I love that because they use the Wi-Fi identifiers to try and go at you.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.640]   Wow. See, these Google glasses would really help.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:37.040]   Wait a minute. There's no way. The privacy issues alone.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:42.000]   Well, you're choosing to do it. No, but you're choosing to look at somebody who's not choosing
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.920]   to do it. You can do it. There's a camera in it. You just hear your phone. Oh, here we go again.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:57.600]   Get used to it. I didn't bother me in the least, but I just think that there's no way this is a
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:03.680]   real story because there's no privacy in public. Well, you can wear it in the bedroom. You can
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:07.440]   wear it anywhere. Well, that's a different area. You could wear it everywhere. You go in a store.
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:12.080]   You can wear it in the sauna. I mean, if I go into a Las Vegas casino with a camera,
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.960]   they will they will bottle it. They tried to last year. Throw me out. If I go into
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.240]   many stores with a cell phone and try to take pictures of the products, they have signs now
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:26.480]   in stores that say you may not take pictures in this store. So if I go in with glasses that have a
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:34.880]   Google logo on them and a camera, I think this has to be bogus. Well, I'm envision right now,
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:38.320]   because I'm told the show really is watched at Google. There's a whole bunch of snickering
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:44.080]   engineers at Google. We got them. We got them. We got them. Yeah. They're really talking about it.
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:49.120]   And watch out in a month. They'll be out and we'll say, oh, hey, cool. I wouldn't be surprised if
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.520]   there's some it may, you know, it could be somebody's 20%. Or I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if there
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:05:00.000]   is such a thing inside of Google. But I do think that there's no way because of the privacy issues
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.160]   alone that they really I mean, people are scared of Google. A cadre of 100,000 people walking around
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:11.760]   with cameras on their heads that send them images back to Google. Right. I think the camera is the
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.400]   piece that goes too far. What if it didn't have a camera? What if it just then you don't have
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.880]   augmented reality? No, you don't have a reality, but you could have maps and you can have all kinds of
[01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:25.600]   things. Oh, I see the camera is a camera. Wait, do you need the camera to have augmented reality?
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.320]   Apparently they look like the Oakley thumps. According. Yeah, did you see the picture?
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:35.920]   I've had these. I actually had these for I put them on Regis. He loved them.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:41.600]   Those are a few years old. Okay, the heads up display is only for one eye and on the side.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:46.960]   This is just like with MIT guy. It's not transparent. Nor does it have dual 3D configurations. That's
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:55.680]   fine. If it had 3D, I'd throw up. Yeah, seriously, headache forever. Yeah. So, by the way, all of the
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:01.360]   technologies to do this completely exist. This is this is not like innovative. Getting it to a
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:10.640]   reasonable price. Might be a way to have a you're not you're not buying glass. You're buying a
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:14.800]   little paper on something. Yeah, cameras are cheap. This I mean, everything else, you know,
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:19.040]   maybe it isn't that expensive. You know what we remember at the web, there was that guy wandering
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:23.680]   around the Swiss guy wandering around and he was wearing the Motorola had an Android, I think.
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:29.360]   And he had a little ocular. He was shooting video with it. He was shooting video and walking around.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:35.920]   What does that sound? It's a car alarm outside. Oh, hey buddy, your car's being stolen.
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:42.800]   All right, I took care of it. I hope that I hope this is real. Oh, I do too. I will.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:46.880]   Obviously, the camera doesn't have to record and upstream up, you know, upload. It's recording.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:49.680]   So it doesn't even have to be there. I mean, you can get a lot of information just from GPS.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:53.920]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. No, I'm saying you can make it so that it's not an invasion
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:07:01.360]   of privacy, but people are still going to freak out. Right? Yeah, I, yes, I'm not saying it's I'm
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:06.160]   not saying it's bad. Don't get me wrong. I want one in Google. If you're listening, Gina and I
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:12.080]   were perfect. Hey, hey, hey, you too. New York City, center of the universe. I'll work with you.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:16.000]   You know what I really want? And this was something that they took out of Google goggles, but Eric
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.640]   said they have it is the facial recognition. Yeah, facial recognition. So if I walk up,
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:24.320]   because this happens to me, I have so all the time I walk up to somebody. I know I know I know I do
[01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:29.600]   who they are. That's especially bad for you, because you may not know them. I know so many people.
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:35.360]   Right. I developed this terrible affectation. I have many, but this one I developed was a
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:40.880]   columnist in San Francisco and my face ended up on the newsboxes and the trucks. And so,
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:46.400]   everybody knew you. If you say hi to someone that is an ellipsis that assumes the name.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:51.040]   Hi, Leo. Right. Right. So I couldn't say hi anymore. I started saying howdy.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:57.360]   Because nobody says howdy, Leo. They just say howdy. Exactly. You never howdy. And that was enough.
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.000]   And so that's what I to this day, I say howdy. That's not everybody in California says howdy.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.160]   That's not an affectation. That effect. I remember that when I first came here, I thought that was
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:09.840]   so strange. Maybe you started it. Maybe it was Jeff. I ran into Jeff one day.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:15.440]   Me and there. So is that true? If you say howdy, you don't have to say that person. I don't think so.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:20.080]   Huh. Or you could do like Paul Harvey say hello, American.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:26.160]   Oh, I'm not doing that in the diversity of New York. I'm going to get in trouble.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:30.320]   That's true. No, no, no, no. Greenpeace says the Google is the least.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:33.360]   Uh, unecological.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:39.040]   I have these green piece list as always seems to me be a little bit political.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:43.920]   I like wired headline Greenpeace hates big tech, but wants to kill Google the least.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:50.480]   Um, there's a list of this is ours in an app. Is this an app?
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:55.040]   It's a 50 page report. Everything's an app. Now, Jesus, you want to do a shopping list.
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:59.200]   They're making it an hour and a half. There's a leaderboard. They call it the cool it leaderboard
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:06.400]   of, uh, of tech companies. Blue is solutions. Green is energy impact. Yellow is advocacy.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:12.400]   Google has lots of solutions, a little impact. They actually do have a lot of impact. Any,
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:18.240]   anybody like Facebook or Google, it has server farms as a huge impact, but they score a 53 on
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:22.160]   the leaderboard. I don't know what that even means. It's a good or bad. It's Apple not on the list.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.880]   Yeah. Cause Greenpeace hates Apple, right? No, I don't see Apple on this list.
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:32.080]   Maybe Apple made it. It's just an energy. Is this maybe this is an energy list versus
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:36.640]   Apple's got a server farm in North Carolina. They use some energy. They got the cloud.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:42.320]   Facebook launched that, uh, that completely Oregon data set as completely solar and so forth.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.880]   The report ding, dings, Google for killing its solar energy program. Remember that?
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.560]   That was one of the thing Larry told in November and the renewable,
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.520]   renewable energy stuff that they were doing. They were doing some really cool stuff. We did
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.760]   a green tech somewhere. If you look on the Twitch site, the green tech piece that we did on Google
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:01.200]   where we interviewed them, we took a look at all, like they have electric cars, all that stuff.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.840]   It was really interesting. It's kind of sad that they're not doing it anymore.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.560]   Pete, uh, Dell and HP saw their marks drop, but the biggest loser is Apple,
[01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:20.080]   which like Facebook is once again, emitted from the list because they've seen,
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.560]   Greenpeace says we've seen no effort from Apple to lead unlike Google.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:28.480]   Oh, I see. So this is a list of people of computer doing it well.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.080]   Right. That's why Apple is not on Apple has a lot of reach into a very loyal fan base,
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.360]   but we don't see them leading environmental advocacy efforts.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.600]   Green pieces always has hated Apple for years.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:49.440]   So there you go. Um, is Facebook according to CNET, there's an article. This is an,
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.440]   I thought this was kind of interesting. Let me say this one.
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:11:03.280]   Is Facebook accurately counting its daily active users? They claim 850 million users,
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:06.960]   active users. Certainly this is relevant if they're going public.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:10.800]   I, I cited this. This was a, uh, this is a rock,
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.640]   sort of column. This is a New York Times column.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.000]   It was based on an under arrest, sorry, column, and it was very, very bright. And the thing is,
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.840]   what I said on Twitter is if you read this story from the end, you say, my,
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:23.600]   how smart of Facebook, they, everyone should be doing this is what they're doing is they're
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.160]   distributing themselves around the net. And if you do, what would they, the beginning is,
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.720]   they count as an active user, somebody who it's like in a day.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:36.000]   They say 485 million. Right. So that's so that while they didn't go to the site,
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.600]   they hit like, okay, again, but that he points out, but, but they did interact with Facebook and
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:45.840]   Facebook got valuable data about that person and about that content out of that person.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:50.720]   Gee, shouldn't we all be doing that in media? Yeah. I guess the point is they didn't see an ad
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:54.480]   on Facebook. So you can't count that as a visitor to Facebook sites. They don't see an ad on Facebook
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:12:00.320]   mobile either. Right. No, um, I think that's fair. They say these people are using Facebook.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:04.560]   They're engaged. Yeah. I think it's absolutely fair. And I think that it's, it's, it's an old
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:09.200]   com score media view of the world to say that you have to go to the site.
[01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:13.600]   No, that's where Facebook is very innovative. They're putting Facebook, splashing Facebook on
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:20.080]   everybody. Peanut butter spread. It's incredible and spreadable. Totally agree. But would you say,
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.920]   but if someone's asserted that visiting a website that has Google Analytics JavaScript
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:29.040]   dropped into the HTML is interacting with Google just by visiting the site. And I wouldn't agree
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:34.080]   with that. And I think that, I mean, I agree that clicking a like button is, is interaction with
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.240]   Facebook. It's, it's, it's an action, you know, you're associating with a brand, you're signing
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.000]   into Facebook or sending them data, but you're also sending Google data when you visit a site
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.520]   that has Google Analytics installed. Right. The difference is that in one case, you're doing
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:49.360]   it passively in one case, you're doing it actively. Exactly. So when they were active, I mean,
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.560]   they did have the description in there. I mean, Andrew didn't, you know, come up with any
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:55.200]   scandal. And again, at the end, he came back around and said, well, this is smart stuff and
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.960]   this is really good. But I think it was an effort to kind of headline. Yeah, the headline is bogus.
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:06.400]   In December, Nielsen company was tracks usage on the internet count at 153 million unique
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:12.880]   users on the Facebook website for the month. Although Facebook says it had 161 million active
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.640]   users, you know, that's a small difference that you see all the time and counting.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:24.880]   That's us, by the way. New York Times has an odd, the Sunday, New York Times, particularly,
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:31.120]   last week, I tweeted out five links that were kind of anti-internet, anti-progress stuff.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.680]   It's getting to be a drumbeat, isn't it? Yeah, it's getting to be a really, really,
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:40.400]   is I wrote a piece this morning on the blog, really boring, won't go there. But, but,
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:46.320]   getting dict hopeful, who's general manager of pro public, former assistant manager,
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:50.560]   assistant publisher of the Wall Street Journal wrote a piece arguing that the original sin of
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:54.080]   newspapers was that we didn't charge. And I've been in that argument a million times.
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:14:00.240]   But the interesting he said in there that I then hooked on to was he said that there was a cultural
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:04.400]   issue in his view, and I don't agree with this, that was East Coast versus West Coast,
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:09.360]   which is another way to say the soap of people argument of Northern California, Southern California,
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:17.120]   which is, you know, tech versus IP, content versus platform, disrupted versus disruptor.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:21.760]   And there's kind of this kind of argument now that that we the techies are the siren call
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:26.960]   leading people down the wrong road, because we lead them away from their past and where they do
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.280]   things. And so yeah, I think there is almost a drumbeat going on. And that's what, you know,
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:37.040]   the privacy stuff and all this stuff is is the revenge, the nerves got the revenge. And now the
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.800]   the disruptor are trying to get their revenge to back on us.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:49.680]   Moving on, we got a couple more things, and we're going to get your tool tip and pick of the week.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:54.800]   We're running out of time. So let me jump these in here. Skye figured you'd have something to say
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:15:01.120]   about this, Jeff Jarvis. There's a great there's a guy on Sky News on Twitter. It's at field producer,
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:06.560]   right? Who's been doing breaking news as a field producer on Sky News. And it's not all Sky News.
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:12.160]   He's just like, he's just like a one man breaking news is like Andrew Carvin. He's like a one man
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:18.240]   breaking news engine on Twitter. Apparently, Sky News has told their their reporters
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:25.520]   that you cannot retweet rival journalists or other publications. You cannot retweet the public.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:31.440]   You can only retweet other Sky News reporters. You cannot retweet about subjects that aren't
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:36.240]   on your beat. And you may not have personal tweets in your quote professional accounts.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:44.560]   Numb nuts. Yeah, talk about clueless. Absolutely. It's amazing. There should be a collection of
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:50.080]   of of num nutty social policies that companies have. This one this one does kind of beat the
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:56.240]   army. Especially when you have such a great case study with this guy who's got I don't know how
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:01.280]   many Twitter followers he has. And in the long run, it redounds to the benefits Sky News, right?
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:07.120]   Yeah, but they don't get it. It's the same as Andy Carvin. Anthony DeRosa Reuters is really very,
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:12.240]   very good as well. And if they want to give up that it's the same argument before is don't link out.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:17.120]   You put a argument made media media get that all the time. I have a piece coming out in the
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:22.320]   Guardian on Monday arguing that the biggest mistake we made the original sin is that we think we're
[01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:27.120]   in the content business. We think we make content. What business are we in? We're in the relationship
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.120]   business. Oh, the Facebook understands that content is a tool to get you to generate and
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:40.000]   be nice by yourself. I should be nicer to people than. I'm a blowing it. Leo, you are most definitely
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.160]   delicious. Everybody is here because they love you. No, it's true. I have a relationship with each
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:50.000]   other. Right. Chat room. Yeah, I love you guys. You guys are beautiful. That's Paul McCartney doesn't
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.520]   like you guys. He is pulling tracks from Spotify and Mogg and all of those streaming services,
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:03.760]   RDO, Rhapsody, Sohaz Coldplay, Tom Waits, even Adele. What?
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:13.760]   McCartney apparently did this in 2010 from Spotify. This is not the Beatles music. This is the
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:17.200]   guy who used to be with the Beatles whose music isn't really that good.
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:23.920]   I was on Delta flight. This was really creepy. I was on a Delta flight and they're blaring music
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:27.120]   into the cabin. You know how like you feel like they're trying to call me as you get on the plane.
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:33.360]   By blaring music into the cabin. It was the weirdest channel I ever heard. It must have been
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.200]   a cover channel because they had all these well-known songs by people not the original artist.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:42.320]   So they had silly love songs. Paul McCartney, silly love songs by somebody who wasn't Paul McCartney.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:49.280]   I mean, they just tons. Why bother? Why bother? It's not a good song. I'm sure it had to do with
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:53.360]   rights. I'm sure it had to do with the music. Isn't that was the music going back?
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.960]   But it was it was yeah, I guess music did that right. But this was an instrumental. This was like
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:00.160]   full production numbers of well-known songs, but by somebody else.
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:05.040]   The music still live? There was a cold play song. Maybe it's these guys.
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:13.040]   Milo Zilodo, the latest Coldplay album will not be on, they said wouldn't be on Rhapsody. It is now.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:16.720]   So it's I think I think people do this and they and they regret it.
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:24.640]   McCartney is streaming his upcoming concert on iTunes. Anybody's controlling that, but he controls that.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:29.760]   By the way, I just looked at Rupert Murdoch's Twitter account. What's what's the old guy up to?
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.360]   And he said about this time this was happening. I have nothing to do with Sky News.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:39.360]   Oh wrong. Doesn't he own 40% of Sky News? Yeah. Oh yeah. Wrong.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:49.520]   It is. I have nothing to do with Sky News. Some I think Brian Hogg has to do a puppet Rupert Murdoch
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:56.000]   and just say his tweets. I got a great game. Great for New York. Feel a little sorry for my
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.680]   Boston friends now. Well, that's a great idea doing dramatic readings of Rupert's tweets. I love that.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.800]   You have to do it. Is he still have an Australian accent or is that because
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:09.920]   I does the Rupert doll. Rupert Golden Brown deserves much more credit on your. I can't do it. I won't do
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:19.600]   it. Moving along. A plug for Jeff. Yes. So I'm doing an economist debate on the value of sharing.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:25.600]   If you go to economist.com/debate and my. Do they do this a lot? This is a great idea. It is every week.
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.960]   It is every week. You and Andrew Keene, huh? And he is having fun going off and trying to
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:35.120]   stack the deck. So I want to stack that. I don't care about the vote, but do me a favor.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:41.040]   All of twig. Go there and vote. Prove your power. Prove Andrew Keene for the anti social
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:46.960]   Twitter. He is. He's a friend too. But go just go vote. I don't care. So the proposition is the
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:52.480]   house believes that society benefits when we share personal information online. Jeff is of course
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:59.600]   supporting that. Andrew Keene says now it's a terrible thing. I like Andrew. He's a funny guy.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:02.800]   And there's a nice guy. He's a friend. But but he's playing the game. He's trying to game it.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:08.720]   So what I want to do is twig go game it please. He wrote the game. He wrote the cult of the amateur
[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:14.480]   and you know he's kind of anti new book is is digital vertigo. Give you a plug Andrew. Oh wait a
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:21.840]   minute. By the way, 65% on Andrew's side, only 35% of Jeff's because he's playing the game. He's
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:25.120]   going all over town. People will vote on Twitter or something. Okay, fine. Let's play the game.
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:30.320]   Wait a minute. It's not fair to use social networking to win a debate saying social networking sucks.
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:37.520]   Bingo. Somebody. Somebody pointed that out to him on Twitter. You can't use Twitter Andrew or Facebook.
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:45.120]   No, you got. First of a lot left a comment on my post on a Google plus and then he came back and
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:50.000]   said, well, you can't have a balanced discussion about social networking on a social network.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.840]   And somebody else said, where are you going to have it? You guys like him? You're friends with him.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:21:00.560]   You feel like he's a character. I don't know him very well, but I feel like his work is like
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.960]   truly destructive. Oh, exactly.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:06.000]   Kind of what we're talking about. He's polemical for the sake of being
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:11.520]   polemical. He goes overboard for the great British tradition. Yeah, he does all that stuff. He loves
[01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:15.440]   to have enemies. He does all the stuff. He's not like an other person with the accent. I'm not
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:21.200]   going to talk about Christopher Hitchens. No, no, he doesn't remind me a little bit of Andrew Sullivan
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:25.520]   or Christopher Hitchens. We're there. There's polemicists. They're polemicists, but but not as
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:30.560]   smooth. I mean, Sullivan and Hitchens are very, very, very, very, very blunt. Yeah. Very blunt.
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:35.920]   No, Andrew makes enemies. We had him. We actually had him on a twit. And he was actually, I thought
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:42.800]   he was spectacular. And the chatroom hated him so much. He begged to come back and I said, I just
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:49.040]   can't because it's just, it's, we were going to have, I mean, people pitchforks and torches were
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:55.440]   going to be at the door going, we want him. And he loves to be. Oh my God.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:01.840]   It was, remember that? Oh, he's so chatroom. All the more reason to show him what's what,
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:06.640]   economists.com debate. I don't give a damn about the vote personally, but let's, let's show Andrew,
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:10.800]   the power of twig. Yeah. No, I already told Andrew he can't come back.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:17.760]   So it's already up. He lives, literally lives in Santa Rosa. He lives like just up the block.
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:22.000]   And I, and I, at the time when I brought him in, I thought he's, I love him. I think he's a great,
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.760]   he's fun. He's kind of entertaining in that British way. And I thought he'd be great.
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:30.960]   Maybe we'll do a show with him. This is great before our very eyes. The votes change. He has 43
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:45.520]   percent. Yes. Yes. Twit. Let's just bring down the economist site. That's what we want to do.
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:51.280]   Oh, don't tempt me. Thank you for the, thank you for the plug. Please. You can't let Andrew
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:23:00.320]   came win this one. No, no, no. Boxy is clashing with cable companies over quam, clear quam versus
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:07.360]   encrypted quam. Boxy box, which is a really, I think a really neat device. Boxy stopped doing
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:14.000]   software. They're focusing on the box and now they have a live TV dongle. But time Warner and
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:22.880]   Comcast and so forth are upset. They encrypt basic cable programming, even though it's against FCC
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:29.840]   rules. Oh, it's against the root. Always pisses me off. And you know when they did this, they did
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:36.320]   this when broadcast went from analog to digital and they kind of used it as a little diversion.
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:44.400]   Oh, well, we have to go digital too. Existing regulation according to this article on GigaOM
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:53.440]   says you cannot encrypt basic cable. So FCC is having a hearing of Boxy's filed multiple letters
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:58.240]   with the commission met with staff last week. The cable, could they write? This is Boxy and I
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:02.640]   love Boxy. The cable company's real motivation to prevent you from being able to connect. The cable
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:07.440]   from the wall directly to your TV or boxy box, they want you to rent that set top box for an
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:13.920]   extra five to $15 a month. And by the way, the boxy box won't work with a set top box. So then
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:18.880]   you have to get the cable company's DVR. The cable companies are losing subscribers every
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:22.240]   quarter. If they want to reverse that trend, they should look into building better products.
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:29.440]   No, reducing prices. Whoa, let's not be communist and improving customer service. Not going to
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:34.320]   the government asking for rule changes. I agree. Public knowledge supports some consumer electronics
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:42.800]   association supports them. It's not a surprise. I think this battle is going to get really pitched
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:47.600]   heated and ugly in the next few years because the cable companies do not want to be data
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.920]   providers. And frankly, that's their future. They want to sell you premium content. They don't
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:56.960]   want you to be using a broke who box or a boxy box or a Google TV. It's not in their interest.
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:03.040]   All right, let's take a break. When we come back, we will get your tip, Gina, your number,
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:07.760]   Jeff, and I have a tool you're going to love in just a bit. But first, let's talk about a
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:12.080]   very important tool for anybody using Mac or Windows. It's a backup tool card, Carbonite,
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:17.600]   C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E dot com. I'm going to be having dinner next week with Carbonite CEO,
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:21.440]   David Friend, who is a good friend. He's actually an interesting fellow. He was a
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:26.720]   straight out of MIT. He founded a synthesizer company. You might remember called ARP. Everybody
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:31.840]   in that day, it was like the 70s, early 80s. Everybody used ARP synthesizers. It was like it.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:38.000]   Made a packet of money, retired, and then had a daughter in college, as I do. And she called
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.480]   them crying one day saying, "I lost my term paper. My computer crashed." And he thought,
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:47.520]   "There's got to be a better way. I'm a geek. I could figure out a better way." He created
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.560]   Carbonite. The whole idea online cloud storage just was years ago. This was before anybody was
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:57.440]   doing this. It made it affordable, make it easy to use. Anybody with a Mac or PC for less than five
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:02.480]   bucks a month, you put Carbonite in your system. Whenever you're online, your data is backed up
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:07.360]   automatically, continuously, without your thinking about it, you can get to it anytime. It is cloud
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:11.040]   storage. So you log on to your Carbonite account on any computer, your smartphone or tablet,
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:16.000]   all the platforms, even BlackBerry. And there's your stuff. There's your data. So you always know
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.320]   what's there. If the worst happens, restore is very simple. It's a great way to upgrade computers.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:25.200]   For instance, just move your Carbonite account to the new computer, restore and you're good to go.
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:32.640]   $59 a year per computer. They also have multi-computer systems programs and they have a plan for
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:39.120]   people who want to do external drives. No matter what, go to the website. Do the free trial. You
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:43.440]   don't need a credit card. You just need the word "twig" as your offer code. And if you decide to buy
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:48.160]   use "twig" again because you'll get 14 months for the price of 12, that's a good deal. I, of course,
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:52.400]   when my daughter went to college to go full circle, she had Carbonite on that laptop.
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.200]   You better believe it. Still thus. You got to back it up to get it back. So do it right
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:05.120]   with Carbonite. Use the offer code TWIG, Gina Trippani, your tip of the day.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:12.240]   Tip of the week is for Android Google Voice users. The new update to the Google Voice app
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:17.920]   supports offline texting. I love this because I live in Google Voice and this happens to me all
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:23.040]   the time. I'll be on a plane. The plane will land. We're on the jetway going. You can turn on your
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:27.440]   electronic devices. I turn it on. It doesn't establish a data connection yet. So there I am
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:32.000]   texting my wife. Hey, I'm here. I just landed. Can't send the text. This new update, which I
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.120]   actually haven't gotten yet. They just announced this today. So I haven't gotten the update yet.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:40.560]   But the new update to the app will let you send a text while you're offline. And then once you do
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:44.640]   establish the data connection, it'll send it out just like email. That's interesting. So it's not
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:48.080]   up to the messaging app. It's an update to the voice app.
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:51.040]   Yeah, it's an update to the Google Voice app. Exactly.
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:28:00.640]   So if I launch Google Voice, like voice.google.com, not this talking, got it.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:03.760]   Right. Google Voice. Right. Right. Yeah. Like voice.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:09.520]   Phone thing. Yeah. So yeah, that's good. I do that all the time. I now if they had scheduling
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:14.880]   texts, that would be cool. Yeah. And I really want MMS, Google Voice Engineers, MMS, please. I want
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:19.520]   to be able to send pictures of Google Voice. Yeah. That's cool. So you can, you can, you're on the
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:24.560]   runway. You're not got a connection, but you can send a text and send it as soon as you do
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:27.680]   actually get online. Exactly. Especially when you have to go through customs and they won't
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:32.080]   let you do anything. Right. That'll be very handy with this note, which isn't online. Because of
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:36.960]   the team of things. Your number of the week. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you. Gina, Gina,
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:42.560]   Gina, Gina, you saved me. So the rest of you. Just so nicely, so generously, just put in a
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:48.480]   suggested number there. That's our Gina. That's why we love her. 41% of Super Bowl ad searches
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:52.960]   were mobile according to Google. And as a look, there's a certain, who searches on ads? Well,
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:59.760]   the numbers are substantial. A lot of people searched on Madonna and Clint Eastwood and Acura
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:06.960]   and David Beckham, you know, and underwear, I guess. And so on. And so they said that
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:16.560]   the Super Bowl ad searches rose 200% on desktop, 970% on tablets and 2700% on smartphones.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.200]   Wow. Now we don't have a number there for
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:25.120]   phablets, but we see will. I'm going to call it a phone. I think it's, if it has a phone
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:28.720]   thing, it'll be a phone. I love that. I think you've invented this. It's a phable.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.760]   I'm going to do one more number because I love you. I love you, Chaterer. I love you,
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:37.600]   to the number on the debate is now up to 59% agreeing with my side.
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:43.520]   Oh, nice. Apparently, Andrew doesn't really have the clout he seems to have. It's just nobody knew
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:51.520]   of sharing online. Yeah. That's chapter of this. Well, you actually, he could argue, well, it was,
[01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:58.560]   you did it with broadcasting. Try it with your social networks. So now I guess I've
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:04.000]   voted so I don't get to vote anymore, but you, it's economist.com/debate/day/view/806.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.720]   Slash debate will give you the whole thing. Very good. You're going to win this one.
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:14.800]   You're going to, but keep voting. You know, you can vote many, many times.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:18.960]   Apparently don't care. 59 to 41. Look at that.
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:24.400]   Which all says what BS these votes are. Well, that means he only had five votes.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:31.200]   Exactly. You can change it, but they do keep track of your login. So using cognito window
[01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:38.720]   to vote. Oh, actually, I said that. Wow. I am a bad, bad man. So this is something that actually,
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:42.160]   we just learned about another thing from security now earlier today. Steve Gibson,
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:47.360]   our guru on security does a great show for hardcore geeks. He is a big fan of turning off
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:52.720]   scripting. Scripting is the number one way you will get infected by malware from going to a website.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:59.520]   Websites often are infected themselves, even benign websites by malware kits that run as,
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.960]   you know, hundreds of different attacks on your system looking for vulnerabilities.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:08.400]   The whole thing is mitigated by just turning off scripting or using an extension. Now,
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:12.160]   on Firefox, we've been talking about no script for a long time. It's an amazing extension.
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:17.280]   There is in some ways an even better one available for Chrome. This is called script no. And if you
[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:21.520]   want to know more about it, do listen security now. But here's the, this is the tool of the week.
[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:27.200]   Once you add it to Chrome, when you go to a site, there's a little box, you see, it's red right now,
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:33.280]   I can click on it, and it will tell me what scripts, what things, what APIs are running.
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:37.760]   And then I can decide if I want to allow them this once, trust the site forever,
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:42.640]   block it, distrust the site forever, or just temporarily allow, in this case,
[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:48.160]   I'm going to trust chrome.google.com. So that allows me to use all the scripts on the site.
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:53.040]   This is a really interesting because it gives you a lot of information about what the site's up to.
[01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:57.840]   There's a lot of options. It's actually very powerful. If you are Andrew Keene, you might like
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:06.640]   a little, there's a little social button that says, block all widgets, all social. No,
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:11.600]   none of that, none of that in here. Where is that? And get off my internet. Get off my lawn.
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:17.520]   Anti-social mode. See, there it is right there. Always remove social widgets and buttons,
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:20.640]   even if whitelits just don't have them. I don't want them, but they're no good to me.
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:26.480]   So this is a, this is actually a great security extension that is fairly benign.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:29.600]   You know, sometimes these things can really get in your way, but I like this one a lot.
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:35.440]   Script no, just Google it because it's a very long URL. Script no, if you're using Chrome.
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:41.680]   And by the way, they're telling me the economist.com has become a very slow website.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:50.320]   What is happening? We're being attacked. We're being de-dosed from everybody all around the world.
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:56.160]   64%. It's now God reverse. Oh, Andrew's going, what the hell happened?
[01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:01.600]   What happened? Wow, 64.36. What happened? I was winning.
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:11.360]   Sorry, Andrew. You are the biggest loser. Thank you, everybody, for being here. We do this show

[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:47.920]   Great show as usual. And I'll be back in an hour. Gina is going to be our guest.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:51.600]   Yeah, everybody. Everybody come back and watch Gina on triangulation. Jeff's already done it.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:57.360]   So it's Gina's turn. It's funny because we see you guys every week. And I forget that we have
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:02.000]   some of the most interesting people, the kind of people we look for for triangulation are our hosts.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.560]   So for crying out loud, we should have had you on ages ago. So I'll talk to you in an hour.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:13.440]   4pm Pacific 7pm Eastern for triangulation with Tom Merritt and Gina Trapani.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:19.440]   Jeff Jarvis is at buzzmachine.com. And his new book, Public Parts is a must read for anybody who's
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:26.400]   curious about public life, including Andrew Keene. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Gina. Thank you
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:29.520]   for being here. We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:37.760]   We'll get rid of that music. And if you guys have suggestions, Jeff and Gina,
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:43.040]   and kind of music too. Yeah, we're gonna get sure. I think the Manass George Woods to write.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:35:02.480]   Let's start right here. I've got the world's largest phone in my hands and I love it except.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:08.880]   You have the new one. Oh, it's the one galaxy note. Oh, when I loves it, I love me some
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:15.040]   guy except I was stupid. I should have asked our talented all about Android team before I bought
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:19.840]   it. It doesn't work with T mobile fully. It's edge only. And I'm off the line, which is very
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:26.080]   frustrating. But I love it. And if you know what, if a rising came out with an LTE of this,
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:32.320]   I would buy it so fast. How was it different from the what was the Dell one? The Dell
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:38.400]   streak streak was thick. This doesn't feel big because it's like this thin. Is the screen the
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:42.240]   same size of the streak? Yeah, five, well, actually five three. How big was the streak?
[01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:50.720]   Five five. Yeah, so it's a little bigger. And it's 1280 by 800. So it's it's actually like a
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:56.400]   computer side screen. Is it ice cream sandwich? It is not, but I don't mind that. I know you don't.
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:00.720]   I just said that to get as a physical button. Look at this. It's got a physical home button.
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:05.360]   Just like the iPhone. Look at that. I mean, not merely capacitance. It's got capacitance
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:09.360]   and physical, although like all the European Android phones, for some reason, it does not
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:13.840]   have a search button. You know, and I really like pressing and holding the search button.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:18.480]   You can double click this button, but then Vlingo launches because that Samsung's touch was
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:26.560]   play Bob Dylan. It's very it's better than Siri, by the way, you can open apps. You can do a lot
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:31.840]   of stuff with it. It's really a lot better than Siri. But that Samsung only or is that
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:41.120]   now that's impressive. I mean, is that not like freaking awesome? That's Samsung only?
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:45.680]   No, Vlingo, you can download on any, uh, Vlingo's Android and Android.
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:52.480]   I mean, that is spectacular to be able to do that or say something like
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:55.440]   oops, I got double tap. I forgot.
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:59.680]   Open Calc, open calculator.
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:09.600]   Siri can't do this. So to be able to open apps is like great. Siri can't do that.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:17.040]   We'll do call home oddly large though. I have to tell you, like looking at you holding it. It looks
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:23.520]   I've got a Hershey bar that I can talk into. I hear she bar. I think it might be wider than
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:28.080]   her. It's fat. Yes, it's a little stout. All right, let's do the show. We'll talk more about it.
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:32.880]   Nice and you're reading on it, but I love it.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:38.240]   We have all the eyes you see. We're old and I have a massive head, so it's okay.
