[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, Jeff and Gina are here with the last show of the year.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.720]   And even as we speak big stories breaking out of Sony Pictures Entertainment and the hack,
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.640]   we've got all that news. Plus we'll talk about whether the media has a right to
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.000]   rehash the information the hackers stole. It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.400]   Netcast you love.

[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.800]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. The show where we cover Google the cloud
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.320]   and the Googleverse, the Twitterverse, the Facebookverse. What is your verse?
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.080]   This is our last show of 2014. Jeannie Trippani is here.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.560]   And think up.com. She's also developer and host of All About Android every
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.280]   Tuesday night on this network. Hi. Hi. From her basement, Brooklyn basement
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.560]   abode. Yes. Good to be here. Nice. I can't believe it's our last
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.640]   show of 2014. That's crazy. I'm gonna be around on New Year's Eve. So it won't be
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.200]   not my last time on Twit in 2014. But. Well that's right. And we should
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.560]   mention that next week we'll have a best of show. And then some of you will appear on
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.800]   our New Year's Eve show, which is two weeks from now. By about this time I'll be
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.320]   like my eyes will be gone. Jeff Jarvis is also here, Professor of
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:41.160]   Journalism, City University of New York. Buzzmachine.com is his blog. And also
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.440]   writes a lot on Medium. Hello boys and girls.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.720]   Hello. Even without a New Year's show, I'm tired now. I'm that age. It's time for a nap.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.960]   So the story that you could not reveal to us, of course, last week because you
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.240]   embargoed broke immediately after the show. Oh no, it didn't. It was driving me nuts
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.160]   because I knew the story during the show. As I said to you, I had an embargo, which
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.920]   you advise not doing, but I did. And for other purposes. And I went to them and I saw
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.200]   that it had broken in a Spanish site. So as we're on the show, I'm emailing Google saying,
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.880]   you know, really? Let me go. And I, you know, I respect the
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.240]   embargo. Oh no, I'm welcome to this morning. I said, well, it's guys going over the web. It's
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.000]   going all over. People are asking us about Twitter. Come on. No, no, no, no, no. And then
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.240]   about an hour after the show, they said, Oh, we're going to release it soon.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.960]   Timing. So yeah, the big story was, was that Google News was shutting down in Spain because of the
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.760]   Spanish link tax, which may not be huge news. As I said last week to all of you, but to me,
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.480]   it was huge. Well, and Spain did what Germany did only. They went even a little bit farther.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.800]   A lot farther because they were quiet. The Spanish law required a newspaper to build Google, if
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.920]   new Google even featured a headline from the Spanish news, forget snippets, even a headline,
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.440]   any text at all from the Spanish publication, then the Spanish publication was required by that law
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.280]   to ask for royalties from Google. Google's response was, we don't make any money on Google News. You
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.840]   want us to pay for Google News? That's no, that's fine. No problem. We'll just shut it down. And so
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.720]   they did. They did. And there was finally, finally called a European bluff. And and well done.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.000]   Because just as the German publishers, Google did do this in Germany too, right?
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.240]   Well, no, Google said the difference was Google said in Germany, if you don't give us permission,
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.400]   we will link snippets. Right. We will put up no, while they still put all the lines,
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.240]   no pictures, no snippets, just a headline, because that was what the law allowed. They said,
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:01.480]   okay, we'll put up a headline. And for a developed and three minor built brands, built auto and two
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:09.720]   others, they did that two weeks later, the Germans cried uncle or uncle, and very subtle German
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:18.600]   joke there. Okay. And said we lost too much traffic and we go back up. Now with that lesson,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.200]   having been had the Spanish passed their law and full disclosure here, I spoke on this
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.560]   week that they passed it at a Google event in Spain. Google paid my travel expenses. They do
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.920]   not pay fees to me. And I told them this is, I said, this is dangerous. You're killing that,
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.760]   you're killing the web. This is going to be bad. You're not going to want this. And that, of course,
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:46.280]   what's all of Spain did listen to me. And they passed the law and Google said as of Tuesday,
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.320]   this law is supposed to go into effect January one. But Google said, we can't negotiate with you.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.560]   In Germany, we can negotiate. We could say, we'll put up headlines, no snippets, agree or not.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.320]   Here, there was no option on the publishers of any signs to agree. And then the publishers
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.800]   afterwards was supposedly trying to go to the EU saying help and kind of make Google negotiate.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.400]   But I talked to Google about this and Google sold to their interpretation. The Spanish
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.880]   publishers were trying to say, make them pay and we're not paying. So no, that's it. Google News,
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.320]   Google News, Spain right now is dead. As of 8.30 Eastern last night, they shut it down and already,
[00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.640]   according to Matthew, the income writing a gig, sharp beat is reporting double digit declines
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.960]   in outside traffic to these Spanish news sites. The blue line is today. The green line is the same
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:44.680]   day last week. Double digit declines already. And guess what? This, I love this. This must make
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.520]   Google feel so good. Less than 12 hours later, Spanish publishers have gone to the government
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:57.400]   asking for help. Be careful what you wish for amigos.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:08.760]   So this is just Google News. This isn't just straight Google search. Yeah, that's a really good
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:14.440]   question, Gina, because this is specifically the law specifically written to aggregators,
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:22.360]   to the act of aggregating and search is a different act. So if I come across a headline in search,
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.240]   that is not even though Google News, we know in America, basically provides those headlines.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:32.280]   But if I search for a headline and it comes up in search, that's not a problem. If you aggregate
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.760]   the headlines, this was aimed strictly at Google News, then you're out. But of course,
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.280]   it's not just Google News. Anybody else who aggregates headlines in the same boat,
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.000]   this what's so abhorrent about this, is it is it taxes speech?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.120]   The Spanish Association of Daily Newspaper Publishers said in a statement late last week,
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:55.320]   the closure of Google News is not equivalent to closing of another service given its dominant
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.440]   position in the market. And will undoubtedly have a negative impact on Spanish citizens and business.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:07.400]   They therefore require the intervention of Spanish and EU authorities and of competition
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.960]   authorities to protect the rights of citizens and business. They want the next step, a law
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:19.880]   forcing Google to keep Google News open. I'm trying to understand the logic here. So the idea is Google,
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:24.680]   Google's not allowed to create another front page to our content is like a well, okay, I'll be
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.480]   spent. I'll be a Spanish publisher for one. Please. So we work very hard, we spend on man, man, man,
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:36.440]   I'm in the dollars making a beautiful newspaper. That's a civic. That sounds a talk. And I'll take it.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:45.080]   And these are newspapers. May the fine go to Indian? No, the newspaper. You take and make a page with
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:50.600]   the headlines and it snippets. Nobody going to read the newspaper because you have basically piggy
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:57.320]   backed on our content and you're reusing our content without giving us any compensation for it.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:03.720]   It's as if they Google went out and took clips from all the podcasts, put it on one page and nobody
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.000]   didn't have to listen to the podcast anymore because I got everything I need on the one page.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.640]   Okay. I think that's not an unreasonable, you know, I can understand why they feel that way.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:19.560]   What it does, what ignores is the amount of traffic that Google actually does send to them. And now
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:26.200]   they have, you know, proof of this that in fact it's a net gain for you because it doesn't stop
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.240]   people from going to your sites. More people go to your sites. Indeed, if anyone should be charging
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.200]   anybody, it's Google should be charging for the distribution promotion.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:41.720]   In the words of I, Bakari, I bookery, my name is Spanish newspaper. You killed my circulation.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:52.120]   Now prepare to die. I'm sorry. That's a very bad play on, you know, the princess bride. It's not.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:58.200]   How would you feel if someone, and I know the fans of Twitter have done this, but say someone
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:06.440]   took, did a massively viral supercut of Twit videos that removed all the sponsors and were just the
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:12.280]   best parts. And, you know, it was someone completely unaffiliated with Twit. And it went totally viral
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.320]   on YouTube and people loved it. And that was the video that people were sharing. I mean, I guess
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.840]   this isn't really a great analogy because you don't, you know, you can try. No, I would be thrilled
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.440]   about it. I tell you what, I'll be honest, I would be thrilled about it. Our licensing fact
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:29.800]   explicitly allows that we're creative commons. You can remix our content. The only requirements are
[00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:35.400]   you have to give attribution. It would have to say this is a mashup of Twit shows. And you can't do
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.560]   it for commercial purposes. So you could put it on YouTube, but you couldn't monetize it on YouTube.
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.440]   And that's exactly what Google's doing, by the way, they are not monetizing. There's no ads on
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.240]   Google News. And they're remixing it. And the reason I would welcome it is because it would be my
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.840]   hope. And I'm pretty sure it would be the case that people would watch and go, I like that.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.480]   We find out more about Twit. Yeah. And indeed, you know, when, when, when
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.840]   repost on us was alive and we worked with them and we're working in New Jersey with
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:06.840]   an alternative now I copyright, but the data from repost showed that when people read an embedded
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:13.160]   article, the entire article or the entire blog post was embedded on your site from Buzzmishing,
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.480]   let's say, that the click through rate, which you'd think would be zero, what are the argument
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.000]   you just made because you've just read the entire article, you're a sated, you're full, no more.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.120]   I have no hunger. Thank you very much. Instead, the click through rate ran as a rule three to five
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.480]   percent or five or seven percent interesting, which says that. And those are very qualified
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:35.320]   clicks because they're all saying, Hey, I like you. I want to see what you learn. Yeah. Right.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:41.960]   And what it says is your content is your best app. What we need is new business models to support
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:47.080]   this kind of distribution. But that's not what so so actually, I think that that we needed to
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.320]   do is somewhere I've been trying to find cooperative parties for years who would do a study on this.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:57.000]   I wrote a white paper about this a couple years ago. What I want to do is test the kinds and lengths
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.960]   of links to see what's most effective. And I think that there's an argument that says that
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.960]   something that's too short isn't actually that good that Google's Google's links now on Google
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.080]   News are actually too short because you don't know enough what you're going to get. Now we'll
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.960]   bother clicking. And it's impossible for me to say that the argument you made I think Gina that
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.880]   they're making is well, you're stated, you're full, you knew everything you needed to know. Well,
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:25.640]   yeah, if what you need to know is just simply that you can buy Cuban cigars again,
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.880]   then that's all you need to know. But in fact, you're going to want to know more than that. You want
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.160]   to go say, Well, what is the deal with this Cuban thing? And can I get cigars? And what's the whole
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.520]   thing? And by the way, what's about the human rights and all kinds of things? You're going to go
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:42.200]   look farther. But all you need to know is, you know, rain tomorrow. Yeah, that information stops
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.640]   you. But for the kinds of things that are in Google News, that's just not the case.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.200]   They're not doing whole articles, right? They're just doing snippets.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.000]   Just doing brief, brief snippet. Now, then I think that's one level, right? The other extreme
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.320]   is the whole article, which I just talked about. The question for me is, what's the most effective
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:04.600]   in the middle? If you look at, you know, about business insider, they, and many, many other
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.400]   sites, I don't mean to pick on business insider, but business insider, giga, lots and lots of sites
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:15.400]   basically take out the soul of an article, rewrite it, make it shorter. Now, that's a different
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.680]   argument because what that says is, well, maybe your article is too long and it's actually a
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.440]   service to give me a shorter version. And maybe I don't click through from that because I got
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:26.760]   everything I needed. Or maybe it entice me so much. I did want to read the whole thing.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.920]   There's no research whatsoever on that kind of data. And I want to try to work with some
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.560]   less like Sharpbeat and cooperative publishers to do some A/B tests and figure that out.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:42.120]   That's to say, the way I use Google News is exactly as this is basically just a ad for
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:50.520]   the longer story as far as I'm concerned. So I go to SciTech on Google News and I see top stories,
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.160]   much like Tech meme, which does the same thing. A snippet is no more than a sentence or two. That
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:02.040]   just tells me kind of what the story is about and where they're going with it. And then that
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:07.320]   point, I'm always going to click and I always do on the link and read the story and see the ads,
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.880]   more importantly, on the source site.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:16.280]   Gene, were you making a devil's advocate argument or do you think Google News goes too fast?
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:23.160]   Yeah, no, I'm trying to understand where they're coming from and what they feel that Google is
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:30.360]   taking away from them. So I was asking Leo because I just...
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.960]   Because you like my accent.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:36.200]   Well, I don't know. I thought it would be sort of an analogy.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.320]   No, but I know that your attitude is about this. I know that you know that Twitch's content is
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.720]   an advertisement for Twitch. Podcasts are a little different though because they don't quite,
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.280]   it isn't a blue link to click on.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:55.400]   What if so, somebody took this entire show, edited out the ads because they find them offensive
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.760]   and put it on YouTube. They could do that, by the way. Our license does not prohibit that.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.560]   But that's clearly...
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:05.800]   But it's legal. I wouldn't stop them. And I wouldn't worry about it too much either.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.000]   Now, if we lost our audience so far, it's went and started watching that.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.840]   Instead of watching the ad supported versions, it might put me out of business.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.960]   But I'm not going to change my license because of that.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:25.480]   So anyway, I buy into this notion that this is good publicity, that this drives traffic,
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.320]   this is good. Even with snippets, this is good for Spanish publishers.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.160]   I think they're learning that lesson. I find it very ironic that their reaction to that is,
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.240]   well, we got to go back to the government and get an even stronger law, forcing Google to keep
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:37.960]   doing it.
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:42.520]   Well, because that's the whole real game here. In both Germany and in Spain and potentially at
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:48.280]   the EU level, we're trying to put Google, our competitor, into a bad position so they're forced
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.920]   to negotiate with us. Well, but negotiate for what? There's almost this belief that Google
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:58.760]   took what was rightfully there by competing with them, by saying to advertisers, here's a
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.800]   better deal. Here's bigger audience. Here's, we take on the risk. Here's all kinds of reasons
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:08.120]   why Google itself is making tons of money is because Google knows how to do online and publishers
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.520]   don't.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:14.200]   This seems peculiar to European, right? I mean, I don't think anybody in the US
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:18.680]   no publisher, well, Rupert Murdoch maybe, but no other publisher in the US is saying,
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.920]   oh, I don't want to be on Google News. I think it's well understood the value of being on Google
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:23.640]   News, isn't it?
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.720]   Well, it's also it's the demonization of Google. It's Eurotechno panic.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.160]   So this is almost anti-American or anti-corporate.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.680]   Is that's part of it? I think any corporate and any American both. I believe so, yes.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:40.680]   Well, I mean, and he here, people, you know, publishers put up paywalls, right? If they don't want.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:45.720]   Yeah, but even the Wall Street Journal allows Google to go through the paywall.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.320]   Well, Murdoch took down links and he cried on coal.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.280]   Yeah, he gave up.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.840]   But and I think most other publishers, I mean, if you talk to CNET, the Verge,
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.120]   PC Magazine, all the people linked here, they're thrilled to be linked here.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.760]   This is not a negative. Just as, you know, Tech meme is even worse in this regard.
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.320]   You could make the case of a Tech meme runs ads. Tech meme runs larger than just, I mean,
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:15.480]   they run a fairly big chunk of content. And this is a business for them. And nobody's complaining.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.880]   We all understand this value.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:22.360]   Because all these publishers understand how the web works, right? Like that's the difference.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:30.200]   Exactly. Because, I mean, you could shut down Tech meme. I mean, these, this is an ad supported
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:35.080]   service right there in the middle. Yeah. And indeed, you could learn things. I do learn these on
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:41.560]   Tech meme where I don't want to go through G Apple one iPod suit. I'm so tired of that story.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.080]   That's all I needed. No, I didn't want to. You're right. I didn't click through on that.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:53.160]   Right? I was so tired of it. But the fallacy argument that's made is, aha, you would have
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.880]   clicked through a head and up. But if that's something, no, the truth is, I never would have
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:59.160]   clicked through. I never would have seen that story. But all it said was, here's an Apple story
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.560]   that's going to change your life. I wouldn't have clicked on it. Right.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:09.880]   Well, it's, I mean, look, that that's, I guess that's the point is that probably most people
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:16.280]   listening to this understand the value. Yes. I understand how, you know, in a purely kind of
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:21.240]   theoretical basis, you could be as a content creator, peeved. And this is, by the way,
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.760]   you know, photographer, this is a very common argument. I've talked to many, many photographers
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:32.120]   who say, there's steel in my pictures, there's steel in my pictures. And I said, well, you really,
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.520]   you know, you either put them on the internet and live with that or not. There's really no,
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.000]   you know, middle ground. But I think it's worth putting your pictures on the internet because
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.120]   I look at people like Trey Rackliff, who gives away all his photos and makes plenty of money as
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.040]   a photographer, still selling them, selling prints, doing all the other stuff.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:54.760]   His generosity has been the key on Google+, has been the key. He's made him to his growth.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:19:00.200]   It's made him. Yeah. Yeah. So I know that. And I think the conversation is less common among
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.320]   photographers, but for a long time, it was a very, you know, and record industry. I mean,
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:09.480]   go on and on. Every industry first reaction to this is they're stealing my stuff.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:15.320]   Well, the difference, there's a difference, Leo, is that, and we conflate them in my industry,
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:24.280]   the way we shouldn't. A photo, a novel, a sitcom, a song, or unique performance art objects.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.760]   A news story, the information inside a news story, and it's the information that's valuable,
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:35.800]   is not copy owned. Copyright covers only the treatment. It doesn't cover the actual information.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:40.440]   A society does not want anyone to own information or even for that matter, own ideas.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:46.520]   It's only treatment you can own in that sense. And we conflate that with entertainment industries,
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.200]   and Nick, we should be treated the same as Sopranos. We read a news story and we should.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:57.000]   I've got a question with both of you. So Google is indeed, and I've learned this,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:06.120]   trying to figure out how to help cooperative news publishers, especially in Europe.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.440]   I think they shouldn't just do it in Europe. I think they shouldn't just do old publishers in
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:15.560]   old Europe. That's another question. They're also looking at ways that can help news in general,
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.160]   which I think is the right thing to do. And I'm trying to write a post now, a long post,
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:25.640]   about what Google could do, or put it my way, what could Google do for news?
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:31.560]   What would you guys, if Google comes and says, "All right, forget all this stupid fighting
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.800]   about this stupid stuff." We actually do care about an informed society. We do care about news.
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:41.720]   We do want to help. We do have power and smarts. Let's work with the people who are good and do
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.240]   that. What would you put on that list? What could Google do for news?
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:53.480]   Well, I'm kind of an outlier on this because I don't think Google should be in the content business.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:57.320]   I'm not saying they should be in the content business. How could they help those who are?
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:05.160]   Well, they do it with search. And I guess you could say Google News is a special example of search.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.920]   It's kind of topic-based search. And you're not making the search. You're saying,
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.440]   "What are the topics in Google's telling you?" I don't think that that's really... I don't have
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.880]   a problem with that. I would hate to see Google say, "In the public interest, we believe news
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:25.960]   should be..." I don't want them to get in that business. I know I'm an outlier, especially with
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.000]   you guys, but I don't believe Google should be in the content business at all. I don't think
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.680]   they should on YouTube. No, I agree with that. They can't be. It's a charm. But they are a couple of
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.440]   about it all. YouTube is clearly content business.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:42.680]   I would like Google to stick with search and be a great search engine. I understand they feel
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.440]   like they need to plan for the future. Search won't always be the dominant. Google's a platform,
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.480]   Leo. Wordpress is a platform. I'm like, "Water is a platform."
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:56.680]   Well, I think there's a conflict of... An inherent conflict of interest, if you're a search engine,
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.560]   and you produce content that may be the result of that search. But they're not producing that
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.800]   content. They're the platform for people who do produce that content.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.640]   I see. So you're saying they're not... But now they are benefiting. It's like saying
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:12.920]   NBC doesn't produce the shows on NBC. Well, that's technically true, but that's a difference
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.840]   without a distinction. They're still running the ads and making the money off of those
[00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:24.760]   shows and paying them to be produced. Google has even better model. We won't even pay you.
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.520]   Just put your stuff here and we'll give you a couple of bucks. If you get the ad...
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.120]   First, the search, well, the publishers in Europe would say on search or Google News,
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.280]   we don't get anything from being listed. At least on YouTube, we have the chance to make some money.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.360]   Gita, what do you think?
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:46.840]   So I think that Google has invested interest in making meaning out of information in order to
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:55.560]   serve its users. And so the knowledge graph and knowing the difference between Java,
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:00.840]   the coffee and Java, the computer language, and that's a dumb example, but figuring out what
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.920]   things are and what people mean and what people want when they search for things,
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:10.920]   all those facts, all the intelligence that Google gathers and figures out is based on
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:17.320]   material that's out on the web. So including news stories. So it's in Google's best interest.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.680]   The better the content that's out there, the better the product is for Google, the better
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.840]   the world is and they're accomplishing their mission, making the world's information accessible
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:30.760]   to everyone. I think that the only thing that Google can do is continue to be a platform and
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:36.840]   build the tools that empower humans to put the best quality information out there.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.760]   And but it has... I mean, in a way, it really does have to be a partnership, right? Like,
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:48.200]   there has to be a way to make this a viable business where reporters go out and shake down
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:55.880]   facts and do interviews and make calls and break the stories and write meaningful content
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:01.240]   that Google can then serve its users with, right? So like, all the Google can do is continue to
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:07.880]   create better tools to help humans vet and fact check and help Google create meaning,
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.960]   help us all create meaning for one another.
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:15.480]   I think Google's suffering from severe mission creep. If that's their
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.040]   goal, then they're going way beyond that goal. That mission has changed.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:25.160]   So let me make very clear here. They're not going... They're not thinking about this stuff
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.920]   as a business. They're thinking about this stuff as trying to make nice with at least people who
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:33.560]   are willing to be nice with them and try to help. Why does Google do Google News? That's
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.960]   actually... That's a very interesting question. Well, because I think it was Christopher Rotte,
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:46.360]   who said after 9/11, "I can't get a good sense of an uber view of news and what's going on and
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:51.640]   I want a compilation." And so he just built it. It's a classic engineer's way to look at the world.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.280]   He had a problem and he solved it. That's simple.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:25:03.640]   That's how Google has creeped into other areas. They really do encourage their team to try stuff.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.800]   You make creeps sound like it's a bad thing.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.600]   Here's why it's a bad thing, because if you're a search engine, you have a lot of power.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:12.840]   Who says they're limited to be a search engine? That's the point.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.440]   Well, if they want to be in the search engine business, which they still do,
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.400]   they want to be in the making information accessible business.
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:27.880]   But the problem is, and I don't know if they're doing this or not, but I don't think we can know
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.640]   it, since they have things like platforms like Blogger and they have content like YouTube,
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:40.520]   and they could easily prioritize their internal content in the search results.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:45.400]   I feel that's a conflict of interest. Now, I think you've said that, and others have said,
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:50.200]   well, it's their company. Why can't they promote their own internal stuff in the search results?
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:55.160]   Yeah, I do say that. An example that the European publishers gave is they made a video
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:01.400]   about, "Oh, go to Google search for shoes. What do you see? You see ads on the top for Google's
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:05.960]   shoe advertisers. What do you see below that? You see everything else impossible in the world
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.440]   of shoe." I don't have a problem with that. That's how they pay for shoes.
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:15.960]   If I go to built, which is one of the publishers that's complaining, and there's a whole shoe
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:21.000]   section up there, what do I get? I get nothing built. There's no obligation on
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.920]   built the largest paper in all of Europe to link to their competitors or link to other
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:31.960]   advertisers or link to those who don't advertise to them. Zero, not a. Google does link to the whole
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:39.000]   world, and it pays for that by indeed linking to advertising. The only issue for me is, is it
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   clearly labeled? I believe it is. In the now pulled back agreement, antitrust agreement with the EU,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   or the EC, Google was going to label things they had interested in even more. They were going to
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.520]   guarantee links for outside, and they were going to make sure that guarantee that people could buy
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:01.720]   ads in this position, making them more money. There was a settlement along that line, which Google
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:07.720]   was seeding to. I don't mean to imply that Google is using their power in search to
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:13.720]   favor their own continent, because in fact, it's pretty obviously they're not. If you search for
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:20.440]   Cuba videos, I get a C-SPAN video. I get a history.com video. There's YouTube, a couple of them, but
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:26.760]   then there's Vimeo, a trip films, Cuba videos.com. In this whole thing, there are only two
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:31.000]   YouTube search results. Scoot-a-toe look for maps. Maps.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:39.560]   Pretty clearly, they are not doing the thing we're afraid of. There's a Google map right at the
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.960]   top of Google map of Cuba maps, but then they're rolled out lists in the University of Texas and
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:49.720]   National Geographic. No, I think it's pretty clear that they're making an effort to include
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:58.520]   other people's content. I just worry. I do feel like it is a conflict of interest, but
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:04.440]   I'm not accusing them of taking advantage of it yet, but I do feel like it's a conflict of interest.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:10.840]   This idea that they're building the tools. If I was a mapmaker looking at those search
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:15.800]   results right there, I mean, I think maybe I should get more of a business.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.480]   We get great benefits from Google. Don't get me wrong. That's not the argument.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:24.280]   That's not the argument at all. The argument is merely that. This is
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:35.400]   the essence of monopoly. If a company uses its... This is why there's antitrust laws.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:41.640]   The company uses its monopoly in one sector to take over other sectors, to succeed in other
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.800]   aspects. Behavior has to be demonstrated and proven. But if they don't... I mean,
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.720]   you just the fact that they could do it isn't enough, I agree. It is not sufficient, absolutely
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:57.480]   not. But on the other hand, I do see Google getting into all these other related fields,
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:02.040]   so you wonder, "Well, what are they up to?" Maybe they just want to... They're hedging their bets.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:07.560]   No, it's pretty clear they're not. Although it's hard to prove they're not.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.520]   Because they say, "Well, we just put the results that are most popular there. We don't pay
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:15.880]   pay-pape-tricutate attention to our stuff." But they could be. It would be hard to prove
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:19.160]   whether that was happening or not. Nobody knows how the algorithm... But again,
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:25.240]   I think you have to agree that there's some level of them linking to their own properties
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.680]   that's perfectly legitimate. Because they're private companies. Time magazine...
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.480]   Forgo, I put it the other way. People magazine promotes time magazine. Right.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:37.480]   So then it would be up to me... And this is why monopoly is the important thing.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.240]   Then it would be up to me as a user to go to some other search engine because,
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.920]   "Golly, Google's stuff they're just promoting their own content." And I don't want that. I want
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:51.160]   a objective search result. The problem is because they're a monopoly. Where are you going to go? Bing?
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:58.840]   So that's the issue. That's why there's antitrust rules. Because once a company becomes a monopoly,
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:04.200]   then things that are completely okay to do if you only have a small percentage of the market
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:09.800]   are much more problematic. That's why you watch them carefully and that's fine. But you do not.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:16.200]   Having a monopoly, becoming so huge because you were good. Not illegal to be monopoly.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:22.920]   Now, I understand that in Europe, they are considerably more dominant monopoly.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:27.960]   Here it's 70% of searches. There it's 90%. Well, maybe they're more concerned.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.840]   But it also says that the media coverage and government actions there are out of
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.800]   think with the populace who obviously like Google. They want Google.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.480]   Well, but okay. I'll say one more thing and then we'll drop it.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:47.240]   Just because people like the benefits of a dictatorship doesn't mean it's a good thing.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.920]   That's not the only measurement of whether something should be allowed.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:58.760]   Hey, I love our overlords at Google. They give me great value, great benefit. But that isn't the
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.720]   only criterion for judging with it. They have some trigger for action again.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.640]   I agree. And there is no at this point, there's no evidence. The legal behavior.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.680]   Yep. There's none of them.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.440]   I agree at this point, there is no evidence of illegal behavior as far as I could tell.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.400]   Some of us certainly have it. It's a big American company.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:21.560]   Right. It is really important though. And something the chatroom says,
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:27.560]   yeah, this isn't just any old monopoly. This is free speech. This is information. This is
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:33.000]   the potential for misuse is vast. So I don't think Google.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.520]   Well, but the misuse of power Leo was the Spanish government passing a law.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:44.200]   I agree. The tax on links. That was a far, far greater misuse of power affecting speech.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.520]   No, I agree. And we do have competition. There are other search engines.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:56.360]   Well, it looks like I'm just seeing from the New York Times editor,
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.240]   it'll be a pull green that Sony is pulling the interview.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:05.400]   Well, theaters have all day today because the hackers have threatened
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:09.160]   9/11 style action against theaters that run the movie.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:15.640]   But this is a, this is a real mystery to me because the GOP, the people who are doing
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:20.840]   these hacking, and it's not the grand old party. It's the guardians of something guardians of
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:28.440]   Pupu. The hackers who did this don't look governmental. And the North Korean government said, hey,
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:34.840]   we, we didn't do this, but it is a righteous action. And yet they're pursuing exactly what
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.920]   some say were the goals of the career that would have been the goals of a North Korean hack,
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.200]   which is to get the interview movie that's unflattering. In fact,
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:47.800]   Kim, Kim, John, Kim, John gets killed in this movie.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:53.400]   Oon gets killed in this movie was so I could see why the North Koreans would be unhappy about that.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.920]   Yeah, well, but, but that's also free speech. You know, listen,
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.080]   they don't have free speech in North Korea, dude.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:04.440]   But they can't come in change. But what they've done is they've created the lowest
[00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.040]   common denominator free speech around the world because we're now living under North Korea's rules.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.280]   Yeah. So many theaters, in fact, most of the big theaters have said, hey, you know what,
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:16.520]   we're not going to run this. It's too dangerous. We don't want, I mean, I understand that if you're
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:22.200]   a theater chain and these guys are saying we're going to create havoc in the theater,
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:27.720]   if you run this movie, it's, first of all, it ain't going to be a big money making movie anyway,
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.560]   I don't think. So they just said, well, in that case, you know, we still got the hobbit.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:36.440]   Now it might be after all of those people are going to want to see it.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:41.720]   Yeah, it's one of those those experiences where all of the hubbub about it is going to attract
[00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:46.440]   people to it. Like the real truth is this hack is a mess. This is it could very well put Sony
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.240]   out of business is certainly going to put them out of the movie business. I think there's no
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:53.880]   doubt about that. There's now a class action lawsuit. Why is it that bad? What's the actual
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:34:00.440]   business harm? Nobody wants to do anything with Sony. Every no, nobody wants to make a deal with
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:05.880]   Sony because of the risk that it will be revealed. Nobody wants to talk to Sony. No, no writer,
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:13.000]   no producer, no director, no movie star, nobody wants to work for Sony. That's that's enough right
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.680]   there, not to mention the class action lawsuit from Sony employees.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:21.640]   I think this is a death a death blow to say what difference would
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.440]   encrypted email have made? What difference would a corrupted email mean? This is a very big
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:31.160]   conversation, which we've had a couple of weeks running on security now, ultimately.
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:39.960]   Of course, it's possible to fully secure it, but it would be very difficult for Sony to do the
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:45.720]   kind of business it did in a fully secured environment. You can encrypt, you can silo,
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:53.240]   need to know, for instance, we have here, there's a program called AppLocker that you can run on
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:59.000]   Windows machines that whitelist apps and say you employ, you can't do anything that hasn't been
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.480]   approved by the IT department. Those things are all very good for security, but they're kind of
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:10.200]   bad for business. And Sony made a conscious decision, perhaps wrongly, that it was more
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:16.520]   important than information flow freely for the various divisions than that they fully secure it.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:22.200]   I think they, what I think they underestimated was the damage that could be done to the business
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:30.440]   should this particular thing happen. In any event, you know, it's this is just the beginning. I mean,
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:40.040]   this is really a mess. It's very bad for Sony, I think. By the way, Sony itself, the company
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:45.000]   isn't deep financial straits anyway. Yeah, that's the other thing. I mean, it's not like this is a
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:54.760]   robust company that can fight back. The whole thing is a mess. And I know, and by the way,
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:59.880]   it's not at all clear if this was North Korea, if this was a disgruntled employee,
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:08.600]   there's evidence on both sides. You might see reports in the mainstream media that imply that
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:12.520]   we know more than we do. It's not, it's hard, very hard to know who did stuff like this. In fact,
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.680]   the only time hackers really get caught almost always is because they boast about it. They go
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:23.000]   out in public and say, I did that. If a hacker is a smart guy or works for a government and keeps
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.840]   his head down, it's pretty hard. If he's any good, it's pretty hard. We don't even know how good the
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:34.760]   hack is because there's a complete news blockade on any information. The FBI is not talking to
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:39.560]   Sony, he's not talking. We don't know how they got in. We know more about the target attack,
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:45.720]   for instance, than we do about the Sony attack. Well, we know more about the Google attack.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.640]   That was traced to the Chinese.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:57.240]   Right. You know, traced to in a hacker attack is very difficult.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:05.400]   Unless somebody takes responsibility for it, it's very hard to know.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.640]   In any event, one of the things Steve Gibson said is that,
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:11.960]   well, we've gone back and forth in this, but he said essentially,
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:20.040]   any if whoever did this and had the skills to do this attacked almost any company in the United
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:25.080]   States, they would have the same success. One of the reasons I feel that that's true is the
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:29.800]   story that came out last week, that the Sands Casino was hacked by the Iranian government.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:36.600]   The Iranians are very unhappy with its owner Sheldon Adelson. Adelson is an outspoken
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:41.480]   supporter of Israel, has been very politically active, contributed huge amounts of money to the
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:47.720]   new Gingrich campaign in the last election cycle and has really won the enmity of Iran.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.200]   Looks like we lost Jeff. I'll just finish the story.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:38:02.680]   His casino was attacked and this is the backhand operation, the thing that runs the slots,
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:07.720]   the thing that runs security cameras. The thing that you would, I mean, look,
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:12.920]   Sony may not have known diddly about security. There's a lot of evidence that they never did,
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:22.040]   but you got to think an organization like the Sands Casino, big in Macau, big in Vegas,
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:28.200]   had the top security because that's guarding more than a bank. That's guarding everything.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:34.360]   That and it is an attack target of that. I mean, everybody's hammering at them all the time
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:40.440]   and they got hacked. So that's my, I guess the point is even in a situation where you can
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:46.920]   presume that the security was top flight, top notch, they got in and brought them down. It
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:53.400]   cost them millions, tens of millions of dollars. So in pre show, Leo, you were saying that you,
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.640]   you wouldn't discuss, you made an edit. Oh, let's take a break and we're going to talk about this.
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:01.480]   Okay. Jeff and I are going to get into it on this one. I have a feeling.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.960]   And by the way, Steve agrees with you, Jeff. He thinks there's good reason that this information,
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:10.680]   the treasure trove of information, including movie star salaries, private emails.
[00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:14.600]   Oh, I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that. I think there's a, there's a newsworthy test.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:18.840]   Okay. We'll talk about it. Otherwise, if you say that theft makes the information invalid,
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.720]   then you've, you've, you've erased Chelsea Manning. No, no, no. And I don't want to erase Chelsea
[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:28.600]   Manning, Edward Snowden, or the Pentagon papers. There's plenty of cases where
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:35.320]   illegally obtained material has, because of the public wheel, the public right and need to know,
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:40.520]   but the public has no need to know how much Seth Rogen made to do the interview.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:46.680]   I agree. Oh, well, boy, it's really interesting though. It's such bad gossip. It's like looking
[00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:53.480]   at the naked pictures of Joe J. Law. Don't do it. Although I looked at those two. So I,
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:59.960]   I didn't, I got no standing on this one. I, I did so well. And then I, I stumbled upon them
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:05.240]   accidentally and I felt awful. Oh, it's hard to turn away. Click the, click on a hashtag.
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:08.600]   That I hadn't recognized like, Oh, well, that's the problem with this, isn't it?
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:13.720]   Yeah. But I just feel, and so we editorially, I guess we're in this. So I won't do the Harry's
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:18.440]   Edquai yet. We editor, I had a union, unilaterally, but I do own the company. So I can make that
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:22.680]   decision. You said, I don't want it. We're not going to talk about the contents. Clearly,
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.800]   this hack is a big story for us. It's a technology story. It's huge. But I don't think there's any
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.720]   reason why we should talk about the content. Initially, I did a little bit like, Hey,
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:38.600]   one, one factoid that I thought the story on the rundown is, but yeah, the
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:44.680]   entertainment industry strategy against or in favor of soap of people against Fortan Valley.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:49.160]   We'll talk about that. Sony's, Sony's reacting in ways that I think are illegal or at least
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:53.720]   borderline illegal. Well, but, but that that's the contents. That's part of the contents of these
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:58.040]   documents. That's the newsworthy to this, to this show. So is that something that you wouldn't talk
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:03.560]   about? No report on that. I just wouldn't say. Okay. In fact, Steve gave a list of the kinds of
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:10.120]   information that was leaked out. I think that's fine. It's the information. It's fine for me to say
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:14.120]   naked pictures of Jennifer Lawrence were stolen. It's not fine for me to show them.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:20.200]   Now the news media didn't show them because there's limits on what you can do on TV. They
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:27.320]   went on love too. Are you kidding? Yeah. So in this case, there's no nudity. So of course,
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.000]   and I think it's very self serving of most of them to say, Oh, no, there's a public need to know on
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.800]   this. So let's talk about what the need to know is. There's lots of other news, including the Google
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.760]   change log. This is going to be like an eight hour show though, if I don't do a commercial.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:45.880]   Do you know the, there is a relationship between the commercials and the length of the show?
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:54.200]   Shortest show we can do is three minutes. All right. So this is, this is Harry's. I love Harry's. You
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:59.800]   love Harry's too. I hear Jeff. I do love Harry's. Harry's is so good. And we're not being paid to say
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.400]   this. The Leo does pay me a little bit. But I'm not paying you to say that. You can say anything you
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:11.400]   want. So I use Harry's not frankly, my baby like skin. I use the Harry's first of all done this. I
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:17.400]   use the Harry's razor with no lotion, no nothing. What? Well, you're a mad man. Out of, I forgot
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:23.560]   the shower. I just flopped the head is testament to Harry's. How many blades could you do that with?
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:28.520]   So Harry's bought the factory. And that's what I love. I think that's the real,
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:33.720]   that's kind of the real story here. Harry's was started by a couple of guys who really felt like
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:39.400]   the old adage, you know, you give away the razor and you make it up on the blades. Isn't very nice
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:48.600]   to consumers. They felt like you deserve a good shave at a fair price. Razor blades from Gillette,
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:56.120]   four dollars each. Harry's half that. But are they worse? No, they're better because Harry's actually
[00:42:56.120 --> 00:43:03.960]   bought their own German factory. They make their own blades from scratch, taking high grade steel
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:10.280]   grinding it to sending it right to your door. There's no middleman. You are essentially buying
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:15.400]   the blades from the factory. And these are beautifully made blades. In fact, if you go to
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:21.000]   Harry's, H. A R R Y S dot com, you can see the whole story. They found out that there are only
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.920]   two factories in the world, both of them in Germany that can make high quality blades. And so they
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:32.280]   bought one of them. And the factory continues to make things other kinds of things, but it
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:37.800]   produces millions of precision razor blades every year. And that means you're going to get great
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:44.040]   blades. In fact, they're doing research to make them even better, which I love. And you're going
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:49.320]   to get them at a very fair price, the actual cost, and they ship them to your door. Now, the best way
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.840]   to start Harry's is with a kitten. We've got some great Harry's kids. That's what we sent out to
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:59.160]   all of our hosts. This is the Harry's Winston kit, which is how much is the Winston? Winston is, I
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:05.320]   think, 20 on the site for 25, $25, but I'm gonna give you five bucks off. So 20 bucks. What do you
[00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:10.040]   get? You get the handle. Now that this is the less expensive. They have a nice metal engraved
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:14.520]   handle. You can get your initials on it. That's what I have at home. But this is the steep
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:19.560]   refers is because it has a flat back. So you can really tell the orientation just by touch. I guess
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:24.920]   she Steve shaves in the dark. You get this, you get three blades, three of these great Harry's blades.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:30.440]   They're really remarkable. You get the Harry's shave cream and they have a cream or a gel.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:34.680]   I like the cream. This is the fuming shave gel. Just smell really good. By the way, they now have,
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.000]   if you like that scent, they're after shave lotion too to soothe your face after you shave.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:45.960]   And don't overlook the travel protector. My first couple of Harry's kids, I just threw it out. I
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:50.440]   thought, Oh, that's, that's not important. It's very important. This is how you travel with your
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:55.320]   Harry's razor and blade so that you don't get cut, they put it in your top kit there,
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:59.240]   it dries out. It's got a little ventilation. This is, this is like the best thing ever.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:03.800]   So many in the chat room said I bought two more kits. So I get a couple more travel adapters.
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:09.640]   We're going to save you $5 off your first order. That means $20 for the kit, three blades, the handle,
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:15.880]   the travel protector, the shave cream, the Winston set is awesome. Take a look at that too. That's,
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:21.880]   see, that's 25. What's the Truman? Truman's like less. Yeah, I think it is less. Yeah.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.800]   The Truman's 15. So you take five bucks off. That's 10.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:30.760]   10. I've got the Truman. I love it. The Truman's great. $10.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:37.240]   That's like two blades from Gillette. You get all of this. Just do me a favor. Just try that. You
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:41.160]   know, 10 bucks. What are you going to lose? And if you decide you like it, you can get the
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:46.120]   subscription plan and get your blades delivered to the door. I am up to my third or fourth Harry's
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:52.200]   handle. I like having Harry's everywhere I go. Harry's, H-A-R-R-Y-S, the best shave you will ever have.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:55.640]   Take five dollars off. Use the offer code twig at purchase.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:05.800]   So you don't disagree. What information? Now, see, Steve Gibson said, "Okay, here is the public's
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:14.760]   right to know on this leaked information." If we don't show the pain, we don't talk about all the
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:19.720]   things the hackers learned in detail, then no one's going to learn this lesson. Another companies
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.640]   are going to fall in the same way. I think they learned their lesson.
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:30.440]   If you still think it's okay to get hacked, I don't think you're paying attention. And it
[00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:38.200]   doesn't matter what we report. But you agree. There's no reason James Franco's salary is
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:42.920]   there's no public interest in knowing that. There's gossipy interest.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.680]   Well, yeah, there's public. There's interest by gossip sites.
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:54.120]   But that isn't necessarily... Aaron Sorkin said, "You're helping the Sony hackers if you
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:59.400]   print that stuff." And you are. Really? You're helping them achieve their aims.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:01.720]   Your feeding the trolls.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:09.560]   Trolls, by the way, won in this case because the interview has now been canceled.
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:13.400]   It has not been canceled. If that was actually their goal, see, I don't know if that was actually
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:18.200]   their goal. Aaron Sorkin has a little bit of a dog in this hunt because he, of course, wrote
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:24.120]   the Jobs movie. And our good friend, and I love her, Christina Warren, film girl, wrote a very
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:30.920]   long piece for Mashable in which she, using emails she found in these... the hack trove of data,
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:35.640]   told the whole story of the Jobs movie that Aaron Sorkin wrote. It... the ins and outs, the
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:41.000]   ups and downs and why Sony eventually passed on it, which is of great interest, especially to our
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.880]   audience who was interested in the movie. But I don't think... we didn't report this data,
[00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:51.800]   and I don't think I ever will report this data. I don't want to support the hack. I think it's
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:57.720]   stolen material. But Leo, I do get torn in some... I'm a journalist and so I love a scoop,
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:01.240]   but it's not just a scoop. It's the idea. We go back to the right to be forgotten issue.
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:07.240]   Is that my fear is that if... what if somebody tried to pass a law to say that if you did reveal
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:13.640]   this information that itself is a crime, we don't believe in that. Otherwise, every leak and every
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:19.320]   whistleblower leak to a journalist would then become illegal by the precedent. So I think we
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:25.160]   have to be careful about how we regulate this, not to regulate it, but it goes back to a question
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:31.800]   of us negotiating new norms. It's wrong to... I said this on the show some months ago. I saw the
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:36.200]   beginnings of a new norm and people saying on their own, it's wrong to share and wrong to look
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:42.200]   at the behaving videos. It's wrong to share and wrong to look at Jennifer Lawrence photos.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:47.400]   And now I'm hearing people say with some debate, it's wrong to share and wrong to look at the
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:53.720]   Sony leak material unless there is public interest. And so we're trying to negotiate a new norm of
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:58.120]   behavior around this. Now there is some information that might have public interest. For instance,
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:03.240]   the way Sony looked the other way in cases of sexual harassment and so forth and those things
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:09.240]   have been... Or the campaign about about soap of people, I think is legitimate.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:16.760]   They used the code word "Goliath" to describe Google. They saw Google as the enemy, much as the
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:23.080]   Spanish publishers do. And because Google was apparently you could search Google for BitTorrent
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:30.200]   links. And so they did a lot of stuff to try to shut down Google. So you're right, that is
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:33.960]   newsworthy. I don't think that's... I think that there's a right to know that.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:40.680]   Okay, so we actually all do agree then. Yes. And the difference between this and this
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:45.320]   Snowden leak is that Snowden leaked to a trusted journalist who would... And just released bits
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:49.880]   and pieces of the things that... I mean, Snowden redacted or held back a lot of stuff, right?
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.880]   It makes you really appreciate everything he did, doesn't it?
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:56.760]   Well, what he did know what he did was... He gave it to the journalist and said it was your
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:03.960]   job to do that. Assange off and on has done that. But it said that there is a role of
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.960]   reduction and responsibility and expected that's the role of journalists.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:13.080]   I just... I feel like...
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:23.000]   This is kind of the link-baity world we live in now where anything goes as long as you get clicks.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:29.880]   And there's a lot of people who are practicing as journalists who aren't really thinking about
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:37.240]   the larger picture. Amen, and that's the business model. The business model is an old mass media
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:42.680]   business model, reach and frequency, unique users and page views, clicks for the second clicks,
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:47.160]   and unless we have metrics and business models built around quality, we are doomed to go down
[00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:52.200]   to the sewer. I couldn't agree more. But I do see hope for new business models. And that's part
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:56.920]   of what I think I want Google to invent. Do you want to help news Google?
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:02.920]   invent new business models because hell, you've been vetted in before that encourage quality
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:08.280]   rather than just clicks. Now, this was a big test for Nick Denton, by the way, Gina.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:14.680]   And it kind of went both ways because on the one hand, they did do some actual
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:24.360]   gawk or had some actual reporting, some good stuff. But they also took an opportunity to talk a lot
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:34.040]   of gossip. A lot of gossip. Yes. So I don't... I mean, you know, it depends what your definition
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:39.320]   of newsworthy is, right? I mean, this is... This is what it is. They were doing great stuff on Ferguson.
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:44.280]   They were really starting to do some really good reporting. And then they have a story on how much
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:53.320]   pizza Jennifer Lawrence ordered when she was hanging out with her new bow. And so it's like,
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:52:04.040]   I don't know. There isn't... I didn't see that one. There is a harm in that. I actually do think
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:09.800]   there's harm in people looking at her photos, but the pizza thing, I mean, I don't know.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:17.560]   So much of this is not a publication. Right. About the pizza thing? Well, I don't know. I don't know.
[00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:22.040]   No, the pizza doesn't come. The pizza comes from a source not from the leaked material.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:31.320]   Oh, okay. Okay. I apologize, Nick. That was a legit gossip story. He says,
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:36.840]   tomorrow's news is today's gossip or something. At the bottom of Google, I just put up a Sony
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:45.240]   statement. Wow. I still don't know if it's... I mean, it feels like the hackers have taken
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:52.200]   this opportunity to look like they're South North Korea, but I still don't feel like they are.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:53:01.080]   Here's the Sony statement. Sony says, "We respect and understand our partner's decision." Oh,
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:04.920]   here it is. "In light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film,
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:10.520]   the interview we have decided not to move forward with the plan December 25th theatrical release.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.160]   We respect and understand our partner's decision. And of course,
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.480]   completely share their paramount interest in the safety of employees and theater goers."
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:23.640]   Sony Pictures has been the victim of an unprecedented criminal assault against our employees,
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:28.600]   our customers, and our business. Those who attacked us stole our intellectual property,
[00:53:28.600 --> 00:53:33.880]   private emails, sensitive and proprietary material and sought to destroy our spirit,
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:38.360]   and our morale, all apparently to thwart the release of a movie they did not like.
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:43.160]   We are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie,
[00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:47.000]   and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.760]   We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by
[00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:55.800]   this outcome. So I just tweeted Sony, "If you put this up online, I pledge right now,
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:54:01.720]   I will pay to watch it no matter how bad it is." Interesting. Just to make a point.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:07.800]   Yeah. It feels like this is an opportunity for them to distribute this movie digitally, right?
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   And everyone will want to watch it.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:17.240]   Do you think really this is the North Korean government that did this hack as the guardians of
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:26.280]   peace? It doesn't feel like it. It feels like this is some 18-year-old slob sitting in his
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:33.640]   apartment in Bucharest. With terabytes and terabytes of data? Sure. Nowadays, that's no big deal.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:38.520]   Let me ask you a bigger question, Leo. Is any business safe? You said people don't learn to
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.480]   do business with Sony. Well, why would they want to do business with any company? Any company is
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:45.960]   vulnerable. Well, I suspect we know how this was done. One of the side effects of this will be
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:49.640]   this, and this was, we were talking about this with Steve, will be to move us back to a pre-internet
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:55.880]   era where most of the kinds of conversations that you want to keep secure will be done
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:55:02.120]   either on the phone or in person. And you're not going to-- I got to get a fax machine.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:08.600]   Yeah, you're not going to commit it to email. By the way, I'm now being told that I need to
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:15.160]   apologize to Romania. I'm sorry, Romania. I thought you said Bulgaria. I said Bucharest.
[00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:22.520]   Okay, right. It's just a city with a funny name, folks. It's not--
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:31.000]   And Garner, are you in Romania or are you just decided to be a policeman to the world?
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.160]   Anyway.
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:40.520]   Yeah, I mean, what could Sony have done differently? They could have not--
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.200]   They could have encrypted email, which means-- They could have cryptid.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:48.760]   It's hard to forward, right? And of course, as the way it works in Hollywood, as you can even
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:54.280]   see, if you look at these emails, there's a lot of-- it's stuff is circulated, larger groups and stuff.
[00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.360]   That's not going to work.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:56:00.360]   Well, hold on right there. Hold on right there, Leo. I never thought of that. It's obvious.
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:04.360]   And I think you just presumed it, but the story doesn't like me. If you encrypt email, it's hard
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:04.920]   to forward.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.720]   It's one to one.
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:08.520]   Duh, right. Oh, wow.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:13.160]   So there's certainly things you can do, but in every case-- and this is what Steve's always
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:17.400]   talking about. There's trade-off between security and convenience. And Sony decided,
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:22.600]   I think consciously, it's more important that we be able to work, do our business, than it is
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:28.200]   that we secure our stuff. After all, how bad could it be? And unfortunately, we now know how bad it could be.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:36.040]   But honestly, if you think about the reason this movie is being in cancel has nothing to do with the
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:42.120]   hack. The reason this movie is being canceled is because somebody, maybe even somebody different,
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:47.480]   has threatened the movie theaters that if they release it, there will be a 9/11-style incident.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:53.800]   It's like a bomb, right? It has nothing to do with the hack. Might not even mean the same people.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:57:01.880]   No, it doesn't. Anybody could have done this. That actually could be the North Koreans going,
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:02.840]   "Hey, here's our chance."
[00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:08.360]   Okay, but let Donald pull it further. So now let's say Sony says, "Okay, we'll put it online."
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:14.680]   What does Apple say? We're gonna sell it on iTunes. Apple's gonna say, "Yeah, no thanks. What's
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:22.920]   Amazon gonna say?" Nobody's gonna want it. It's just a movie. What's the one way you can distribute this?
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:25.480]   BitTorrent. BitTorrent.
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:36.200]   By the way, one of the things the GOP, the hackers did, is they put BitTorrent, they turned the Sony
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:44.840]   service into BitTorrent servers for the movies. You're not the only one arguing for this, by the
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:50.360]   way. This is it. You shouldn't laugh. No. Hey, so an interesting story, associate story with Reddit.
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:58.040]   Sony sent a DMCA to Reddit. Reddit was publishing in one of its subreddits, or several of its subreddits,
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:05.720]   contents from the email trove. Sony said a DMCA takedown request and Reddit agreed, and they took it down.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:10.280]   Reddit had to break. They didn't have any choice, right? Yeah.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:14.840]   And now they're starting to ban users who are sharing Sony hack documents.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:23.240]   Reddit is mainstream media. Let's not forget they were bought by Conde Nast. I guess it's kind of
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:27.720]   spun them off, but there's still some association, right? But creep shots of teenage girls, those
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:35.320]   are totally out there. No problem. So discussion and news stories regarding the heck will still be
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:40.600]   allowed throughout the site. But Sony has been sending notices, warning of legal action against
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:46.280]   the posting of information discovered by the hacked documents. So in theory, they could send us one
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:51.160]   if we had started talking about the contents as well. That's not why I didn't. And I actually
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:59.000]   don't celebrate these heavy handed techniques from Sony. I sympathize, but
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:05.240]   it's a weird news day is a weird this is a
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:12.840]   up park. This declares a a truce. North Korea by some accounts gets a movie killed.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.400]   Here's wild, isn't it?
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:20.440]   I want to cheer everybody up. Let's do the Google change log right after this word
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:26.520]   about my shoes. You want to do that? Yeah. Yeah. So Jeff, we haven't sent any Jack Erwin yet.
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:32.280]   But you're a professor. You don't walk in the class wearing sandals with socks, right?
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:39.160]   I have weird feet. Oh, what do you mean weird? You really want to know? No, no, I know.
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:46.280]   Yeah, no, we're good. We're good. That's TMI. That was the limit, right, Gita?
[00:59:49.960 --> 01:00:00.040]   Finally, we can know that you're colon, but your feet no. So choose, they say, make the man. And I
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:05.560]   have to say there are times when having a nice pair of shoes on your feet is going to help you
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:09.480]   on a date at that Christmas party when you're talking to the boss for a raise, when you're
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:14.280]   talking to venture capitalists for funding. You don't want to be wearing the Tenny runners.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.960]   You want to be wearing some nice shoes. Yes, these are comfortable. Don't feel like you're going to be
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:23.560]   hobbling around. These are beautiful. You know what? The real problem is you're going to wear
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.280]   these and you're never going to want to wear anything else. These are Jack Erwin's. Now,
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:33.400]   normally shoes like these hand made in Spain of the finest leathers from the traditional leather
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:41.880]   craftsman in France and Italy, hand sewn uppers, hand sewn lowers, leathers, soles. Normally shoes
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:47.640]   like these would cost you a pretty penny. You get them about a third of the cost at Jack Erwin.com
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:52.680]   because they sell direct to you. Although you New Yorkers, you they have a showroom in New York.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:59.080]   So you might want to stop by. These are beautiful shoes. You just go to Jack Erwin, J-A-C-K-E-R
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:05.800]   W-I-N.com/twit. And you can see our picks. I have been loving these Jack Erwin shoes.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:09.960]   They're, you know, I want to warn you because people are going to say, oh, it's $200. No, but
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.360]   that is for a shoe of this quality. I know you've only been running wearing Nike's with $140.
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:19.160]   So you pay a little more, but these are all leather. These are beautiful. They last forever.
[01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:24.280]   Every pair of Jack Erwin's shoes comes with a second pair of insoles made in Portugal and a
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:31.160]   beautiful travel bag. You can carry your Jack Erwin's and your suitcase without fear of damage.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:38.120]   I love my Jack Erwin's. If you do order, order one size smaller than you do usually. If you're a
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:43.080]   size 10, order a size 9 because all Jack Erwin's shoes are made one size larger so that you have a
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:50.280]   skosh more rim. If you've never had a great pair of shoes, you owe it to yourself
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.400]   to have a great pair of shoes from Jack Erwin. They have driving moccasins too.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:01.640]   I haven't, I'm going to get those for myself for Christmas. Jack Erwin.com/twit.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:09.720]   The best shoes you've ever worn. And by the way, if you don't like them, shipping's free and
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:16.200]   it's easy to return them. They'll pay the shipping. Jack Erwin.com/twit.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.800]   Don't buy cheap. It's too expensive, said grandpa.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:28.440]   Right? They're spiffy. They're spiffy looking. They're not all. Gina. They are spiffy looking.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:36.680]   Gina. These are great shoes. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the Google change lug.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.600]   The Google change log.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:50.680]   Ginger Penny has the latest from Google. New feature on your Chromecast. Your friends can come over
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:56.040]   and cast your Chromecast without connecting to your Wi-Fi first. Damn it. Yeah, it's called,
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:01.560]   it's called guest mode. Yeah, I have my Chromecast. I know the the Engadget headline is at
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:06.200]   guest mode. Let's anyone comment here your TV. It's not quite as aggressive as all that.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:11.480]   This is often, of course. If you want to enable guest mode on your Chromecast,
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:15.960]   you can open up the Chromecast app and you tap devices and you select your Chromecast and you
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:23.240]   turn on guest mode and then anybody can walk in and cast a video. You have to enable it. Yeah,
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:30.360]   exactly. Exactly. But nice for the holidays. Throw some YouTube videos up on the TV, relative
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:35.720]   TV. I've been doing so much Chromecast lately. I love it. The Chromecast is great. It's still my
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:43.000]   main media. Tell me what YouTube now. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. I love it. Let's see.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.760]   Watch the interview. I'm going to watch the interview on my Chromecast.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:53.480]   It looks like a really, can I just say it looks like a terrible movie? Oh, it looks awful. I was
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:58.840]   trying not to say that because that's not the point. But it looks terrible. I can get, I tell
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:03.640]   you it is the point in a way because if this were the Hobbit, I don't think there would be that rush
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:09.240]   to not run it. But anybody. The neighbors was just awful. I went to see the neighbors.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:14.440]   No, I hear. No, that also looked terrible. The end of the world movie they made. Oh my god,
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:23.320]   was it bad? So it's like that. It's not the point though. It's not the point. It's art. It's art.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:29.640]   Let's see. What else we got? Oh, inbox. The app that I'm dying to use my Google apps account,
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:35.960]   Google. I know you're listening. They got a little new feature in assist. So they've got this
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:41.320]   feature called assist, which helps you give you kind of contextual information as you enter
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:47.720]   reminders into inbox. Well, assists are getting a new kind of boost to suggest as you type
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:54.200]   based on what you're entering. So for example, I just got it. It's really cool.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:59.320]   So it's killing me because I really want to use inbox on a daily basis. So if you tap
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:05.000]   compose, you say, I'm going to start a reminder. I start to type the word return and the assist
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.040]   actually start to auto fill items that I had just ordered from Amazon and had just been shipped to
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:15.880]   me. So it's amazing. It's a really, really small personal contextual information saying like, oh,
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:20.360]   I want to return this thing. I just ordered it works with local businesses. It works with calling
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:25.640]   people. Remind me to email Jeff about lunch next month, which we have to do, Jeff,
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:30.520]   and it'll fill it in and put just contact information. You'll know it's an assist when there's a little
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:36.040]   icon and the suggest as you type drop down. Jeff, did I cut you off? Did you have a question?
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:40.120]   I was just making a joke that we're going to hear immediately. This wonderful new feature is creepy.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:45.240]   It's the most convenient creepy thing you'll ever see.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:53.320]   Hangouts in Gmail got updated. You can now set a status message. So
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:06:00.680]   if you log into Gmail on the desktop and you turn on Hangouts, you can click on your name and you
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:05.640]   can set your status to whatever you want. Tappy holidays, I'm available, I'm not walking the dog,
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:10.040]   whatever. And I think you can also use emoticons and stickers as well. I think I saw that in some
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:15.720]   of the examples. So people will see your status in their friends list. A couple of Google Drive
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:24.280]   updates. You can now share Google Drive files through Gmail as attachments and not those share
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:29.080]   links where you use the wrong Gmail address to the person and they say I don't have access and
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:34.040]   can you give me access? It's all complete pain. You can now share the Google Drive files and it
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:39.000]   just attaches it to the Gmail and sends the whole file through email when you select the insert as
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:45.240]   attachment option from Google Drive. So that's handy. Yay! Because I love Google Drive and I love
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:49.240]   sharing but I also have a couple of Google accounts and people always share to me and with them when
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:55.320]   using the wrong one. Next up, the Google app on Android has voice searched for Google Drive. So
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:07:01.400]   you can say, okay Google search for a certain file name on Drive and you'll get the file without
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:09.640]   opening the app or typing keywords. Google Fit got an update that brings 100 new activities to the
[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:16.680]   app. So Google Fit can automatically detect if you're walking or biking. Now you can manually enter
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:24.600]   activities like skiing, skating, biathelon, volleyball, circuit training, boxing, cricket, dancing.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:30.200]   So when you go to the gym, you can hop right into Google Fit and have that be your kind of one
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:34.760]   stop shop of all your activities. Of course, manual entry, not the most convenient thing in the world,
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:39.480]   but nice, nice if you want to use Google Fit for everything. And another upgrade to Google
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:45.400]   Fit at the Google Fit app is Android new Android Wear of support. So Google's still calling things
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:50.280]   experimental here but your smartwatch will measure your step count when it's not connected to your
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:54.200]   phone and the washer. Remember and sync it up to your phone and the Fit history the next time that
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:58.760]   it does that it reconnects. So that's really nice if you want to go for a run without carrying your
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:07.000]   big fablet. And finally, Google for Android and iOS got updated with Nest integration. So you can
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.880]   now set the temperature of your home through Google. Now you can say, of course, if you have a nest and
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:16.120]   you have it set up and you've opted in on your mobile device, you can open the Google app or tap
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:21.880]   the mic and say, okay, Google, set the temperature to 70 degrees and your nest will will do that.
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:27.240]   If you try that search right now and you don't have it set up, it will say, you know, it'll give
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.680]   you a prompt that says this works with nest and you can tap through and actually configure your
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:36.040]   nest to work with that. So, you know, it obviously doesn't work unless your nest is unless you've
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:39.880]   opted in your nest is set up. And that's it. That's all I got.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.840]   And that is the change.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:48.920]   Well, a few, a few updates since well, well, while we were away at the change log,
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:56.840]   one is that deadline reports that a Steve Carell new Regency thriller set in North Korea has
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.040]   now been canceled.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:07.240]   Newt Gingrich tweets, quote, no one should get themselves with the Sony Collapse America has lost
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.600]   its first cyber war. This is a very, very dangerous precedent.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:15.000]   Yeah, I wonder if it's a cyber warfare. I wonder.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.400]   Well, it kind of doesn't matter because because the weapons of cyber warfare aren't necessarily in
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:23.720]   the hands of government. And so anybody can.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:28.120]   Right. Yeah, it's a very good point. So it doesn't really matter if this is
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:34.680]   in this future era, the power of government diminishes immensely because, you know, whether
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:41.640]   you're anonymous or occupy or GOP or, you know, whoever, you have tools at your hand that you
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:47.080]   don't need to be a government to have anymore. Wow. Not saying that anonymous or occupied
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:50.680]   or anybody could put a letter doing that or anything else. I'm just saying that. Okay.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:55.560]   I can imagine a very ugly future where this kind of stuff is just going on all the time.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.880]   It could have been worse though. They could have attacked the power grid or something. I mean,
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.200]   it's just Sony pictures. Let's let's get this straight. It's a step broken.
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.280]   Just that's what I'm going to do. Yeah.
[01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:11.000]   Ryan Bishop at the verge just put up a piece. Why Sony pictures to release the interview online,
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.400]   not even North Korea can stop the internet. It does. It does kind of feel like at this point,
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:19.240]   the only way we can prove we need to invoke the Streisand effect.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:22.440]   Yeah. I'm serious. How?
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:27.560]   If you're Apple, are you going to come along now and say with stores and every mall,
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:32.680]   say, okay, we'll put the movie up on iTunes? No. No, no, you've been sorry. You said it.
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:35.880]   Bit. Sorry. Well, then you don't make any money on it.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:40.760]   Well, that's fine. I think they should just release it for download for free. Everybody gets to
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:46.120]   watch it. Yeah. This is how you screw North Korea. It's good. More people are going to see this now.
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.520]   Well, here's the thing I wonder is what's what's the cause it was interesting discussion just on
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:54.840]   Twitter, Leo, because I said, I wonder who holds the insurance on the movie and what
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:00.280]   clauses are being invoked. And somebody said, well, there's usually a terrorism exception.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:03.560]   Well, that goes to your point. Is this terrorism an insurance sense?
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:06.840]   Well, and usually insurance is a completion bond. The movie was completed.
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:12.920]   I don't know if they have insurance for this. I wonder. Interesting.
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:19.800]   Well, all I could say is that hacker in the basement in Bucharest has now moved to Budapest.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:24.120]   [laughter]
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:28.920]   Take that. Where our ambassador said the new head of government is a schmuck.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:36.280]   No. I'm going to be in Budapest in June. Please don't please don't cause problems with Budapest.
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.440]   Yeah. Well, I'll ask the shoes there.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:47.000]   The year in search 2014, and this is a happy bright upbeat story. Yeah, this is good.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.920]   Google does this every year, right? Do they still do zeitgeist? Is that now?
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:55.480]   Is this a sound place that? Yeah, I think this was kind of a part of it.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:01.000]   Every year, they say we reflect on moments that made us laugh, smile year to year,
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.440]   or stay gripped to our screens in our annual year in search, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:16.440]   2014, we searched trillions of times. What do these searches say about us? We search for? Oh,
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:23.400]   oh, Malala. Nobel Prize winner. Fear. Science.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:31.080]   More than fiction. That's fiction, by the way. The hoverboard. We search for things we love.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:38.040]   Feral, adioso cards, game of thrones,
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:46.040]   Nicki Minaj, and for greatness. Sochi. We searched to make sense.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:57.960]   Oh, wow. Here's what gives us hope. The world knows how to fight this disease. Ferguson, Ebola.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:05.560]   Ebola. No. Search to remember Joan Rivers, Maya Angelou, Robin Williams.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:12.600]   We searched to be inspired. This is really just an ad. I love this dancing guy. That's true.
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:18.600]   And there's a bit of a Big Cumberbatch getting doused with ice water, and that's what I've been
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:24.920]   waiting for. You know, this reminds me a lot of, and we spend some time talking about it on
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:33.480]   Twitter, the YouTube yearender, the rewind, which really celebrated all the YouTube stars.
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:39.480]   This is the things we searched for, but there are many viral videos in there.
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:46.280]   This is the old person version. Like I recognized everything in this one.
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:50.520]   I had no idea those YouTube stars were. I actually had to ask a 12 year old.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:56.040]   Michael knew he knew at least half of them. He said, oh, yeah, that's the no. Yeah, that's
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:02.360]   the. And I only knew Jai Justine was the only one I knew. So here are the top global searches of
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:09.960]   2014. Robin Williams, number one, world cup, number two, Ebola number three, MH 370,
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:14.920]   the Malaysian Airlines flight. They still haven't found even Google can't find even Google can't
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:20.520]   search for that one. ALS, the ice bucket challenge. This was this year. That was the, that was the
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:26.440]   thing of the year, wasn't it? Flappy bird made it to the top 10. Number six, flappy bird.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:32.840]   That was this year. I guess it was. Yeah, Conchita versed the winner of the Eurovision song contest,
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:38.280]   Isis. And I hope people weren't searching for beheading videos, but somehow I feel like they were
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:44.280]   frozen Disney movie and finally Sochi. So that's a pretty good mix of the big,
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:48.040]   you know, this is all done programmatically, but that's those are the big stories.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:55.080]   Yep. Those really are the big stories. And then they have a nice little page at google.com/2014
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:01.720]   that you can scroll through here and we'll go there. I like it when they do this. I really do.
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:13.560]   This is fun. What is la de thima? Touchdowns, knockouts, trophies, Formula One royalty.
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:17.720]   And this is very global, right? Because Formula One, you know, it's big worldwide,
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:22.680]   a US less so. Yep. It's the grip, the world. Jared Leto into Instagram.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:25.480]   That's how Jared Leto made it here. But.
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:34.440]   Okay. And by the way, that's a Facebook property. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's a
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:39.960]   see. You see? Yeah, right there. You don't mind.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:49.640]   Conchita versed the man who rose like a Phoenix. Are you sure you ever watch? I didn't. You know
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:54.760]   that is. Yeah. She won the Eurovision song cut is but is she a man or exactly? I don't understand.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:16:00.360]   I'm confused, but that's pretty much my life nowadays. Did you ever watch Conchita versed?
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.280]   No. I mean, I think I might have seen a video.
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:10.360]   Yeah. Oh, there she is. That's Tom Newers. His stage persona. He created a character.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:16.120]   So he's a guy. He's not he's not transgender. He is. He's a guy who has a character. Right.
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:24.440]   Huh. Yeah, I honestly hadn't heard hadn't heard of this at all until this. Her most
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:33.000]   beauty secrets beard is number one by a long shot. The world wanted more.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:40.040]   The beard is a statement to say that you can achieve anything no matter who you are or how you
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:46.760]   look. That's why I'm growing a beard. I'm gonna stop tweezing. No more tweezing.
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:52.760]   No more tweezing. I can be who I want to be. Anyway, that's probably more than you wanted to know.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:58.760]   No, no, no, not at all. All right. What else?
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:08.680]   Vessel, a YouTube rival. Who cares? YouTube. Who cares?
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:16.360]   Who cares? There are no YouTube rivals. The model is that you get the videos three days early
[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:22.200]   then they go up on YouTube and you're gonna pay for that privilege. I don't. Oh, that'll work.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:28.040]   Yeah. Okay. So now here is a kind of cool thing and I hope they roll this out for everybody.
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:37.880]   This is you can make an animated GIF. But it's only on a couple of channels right now. So do we
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:43.400]   know how to do this? We go to share. How do I make an animated GIF? This is the channel,
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:47.800]   the Rhett and Link channel. Good mythical morning.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:57.400]   But suppose maybe I don't have. Oh, there it is. GIF. So you pick. You pick. This is cool.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:00.360]   This is good. This is good. And you can see what the GIF is gonna look like.
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:03.960]   This is how videos. Yeah. This is how some Twitch stuff.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:08.280]   Yeah. You have to make a lot of silly faces. I'm good with that. I don't mind.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:13.320]   Okay. Let's just correct. Let's just correct. Yeah. Let me just show me here.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:21.960]   Okay. There's a couple for you. Just gave me some faces to work with.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:26.920]   There you go. Let's see your turn.
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.880]   All right. You know what I have to do. I just said it.
[01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:36.760]   Like Stokeshut's right. Yeah. I don't think there's audio on these. Maybe there is.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:40.200]   That's okay. Because they'll do the read by Lipp. Yeah, exactly. They'll do the words on the
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.360]   screen thing. There we go. All right, Gina. You got to get one. People seem to really like what
[01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:51.880]   I'm like. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's real like what I'm like. Very good, Gina.
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:58.440]   So there we go. Start turn. That'll be my head shake. I want to find the one. Oh, yeah. Here we go.
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:05.880]   The Kate Middleton Eyeroll. They had this on The Daily Show. So I guess she was wrapping gifts.
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:12.680]   In New York City. Oh, no. And she's she'd had enough. She is a princess.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:21.800]   And the woman at the gift wrapping station says, no, no, you're not done. Wrap more.
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:27.720]   And Kate Middleton gave her quite an eye roll there. Watch it. Watch. Whoa.
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:32.440]   What? Whoa.
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:36.840]   that's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one.
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:36.840]   That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That's a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That is a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That is a good one. That
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:50.840]   I love that. That's an animated GIF. She's a real princess. Apparently there's a lot.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:56.840]   I don't know. Anyway, so that's you can now at least on a good mythical morning of the idea channel.
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:20:04.840]   According to this article from Sean Buckley and Engagit, or maybe it was from Gizmodo, or maybe it was from
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:08.840]   Wax Pancake, Andy Bao. Yeah, I guess it was. Yeah.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:13.840]   Oh, I think that's cool.
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:21.840]   Well, we're talking about GIFs. I have to plug Adam Pash, who was my co-editor at Life Hacker.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:26.840]   He does. And then I was like .co. You can use your webcam and make a GIF of yourself.
[01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:29.840]   That's his? I love that. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:32.840]   We showed that a couple months ago. I love that.
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:37.840]   Yeah. I had to bring that up again because it's a great. It's an easy way to do your own eye roll.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:45.840]   It's called, and then I was like .co. .co. And then I was like .co.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:51.840]   And then I was like .co. And then I was like .co. So I don't think we have it yet on our, no, we don't have it yet on our
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:59.840]   Twitch channels. But you'll see a share embed. When you click the share embed email and then you'll see GIF or GIF.
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:05.840]   Google, please enable. Please enable. It is getting out there on more and more channels.
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:10.840]   Do we care about the top apps, movies and music or 24 times?
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:14.840]   I'm sure you talked about the apps on all about Android, right?
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:19.840]   Yeah, we did. Well, we talked at least about Google's lists.
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:22.840]   Yeah, I'm not sure we talked about this one specifically.
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:30.840]   They had a section on the Play Store a few weeks ago that was like our favorite apps of the year, but I don't know if that's pulling from the same list.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:34.840]   Yeah. Oh, I see. They did a, they did like their official top.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:37.840]   Best stuff of the year. Best stuff of the year. Most downloaded apps.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:43.840]   Duolingo in education, my fitness, pal and health and fitness, Pandora in music,
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:51.840]   Flipogram and photography, Facebook and social Netflix in entertainment, NFL mobile and sports and TripAdvisor in travel.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:55.840]   The year's fastest growing app category, health and fitness.
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:22:02.840]   And the top games of 2014 won't surprise you much either. Candy, Crush Saga, number one.
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:05.840]   Then don't tap the white tile, which is a lot of fun.
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:08.840]   Flappy Bird isn't on here. Yeah, and farm heroes.
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.840]   I would have guessed that would have made it.
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:17.840]   Subway surfers and Clash of Clans. Play games users unlocked 3.5 billion achievements this year.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:22.840]   Nice. Top movie of the year, Frozen. This is purchased on the Google Play Store.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:28.840]   The Walking Dead, the top TV show, the comeback movie, the Toy Story and the most searched actor on Google Play,
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:33.840]   of course, Robin Williams. Album of the year, the motion picture soundtrack from Frozen.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.840]   Clearly a lot of parents use Google Play.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:37.840]   [Laughs]
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:41.840]   Song of the year, Dark Horse by Katy Perry, Song of the Summer.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.840]   Yeah, so fancy.
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:51.840]   Hey, hey Gia Xela, Isaiah. I'm so fast growing genre soundtracks,
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:56.840]   fueled by Frozen Guardians of the Galaxy to Spickle, maybe two, the LEGO movie and the Great Gatsby soundtracks.
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:01.840]   Oh, this is one for you Light Song Schutzrecht, the news sources of the year.
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:03.840]   New York Times is number one, TMC.
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:04.840]   And you're talking about TMC.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:04.840]   Follow by TMC.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:05.840]   Number two.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:07.840]   Jesus.
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:10.840]   Forbes, now, number three.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:12.840]   Well, at least BuzzFeed's not there.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.840]   It isn't.
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:14.840]   The Verge.
[01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:16.840]   Which actually has some of the fun of it.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:17.840]   The Journal of the Journal of the Beast.
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:18.840]   That's the Broadway Journal.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.840]   Journal of Gizmodo, Android Central.
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:31.840]   The most read article of 2014, "Flavor Pill," 1590s teen heartthrobs who have resurfaced on TV.
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:32.840]   What?
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:37.840]   Well, three of them are listicles.
[01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:38.840]   What is happening?
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.840]   Three of them are listicles.
[01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.840]   Then, "Metal Floss," 50 more awesome facts about everything.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:46.840]   Then, "Market Watch," 10 most miserable cities in America.
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:48.840]   "House," which I really like.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.840]   I'm glad to see it's getting some traction.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:54.840]   "Bathroom Workbook," how much does a bathroom remodel cost?
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.840]   Now we're talking.
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:57.840]   That's the news you can use.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:01.840]   And finally, "The Verge" awards the best of CES 2014.
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:04.840]   There's no Iraq there.
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:05.840]   Nope.
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:08.840]   Book of the Year.
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.840]   "The Fault" is in our stars.
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:13.840]   That's a young adult that was made into a movie.
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.840]   Fifty Shades of Grey, that's an old adult that was made into a movie.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:19.840]   "The Virgin," that was a young adult that was made into a movie.
[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:22.840]   Twelve years of slave, that was just depressing.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.840]   But true.
[01:24:24.840 --> 01:24:27.840]   And "Insurgent," which I don't remember.
[01:24:27.840 --> 01:24:30.840]   So there you go.
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:33.840]   Is Fifty Shades a movie yet?
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:34.840]   No.
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:35.840]   Soon to be a major motion prediction.
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:36.840]   Soon to be a motion prediction.
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:37.840]   Okay.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.840]   Despite the crap casting.
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:43.840]   Now, North Korea, if you tried to block that, I wouldn't get in your way.
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:45.840]   No, it's not joking.
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.840]   Well, the S&M army will come after it.
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:51.840]   [laughter]
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.840]   Um, and then, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.840]   just want to make sure we don't miss anything.
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.840]   That's a sad story, the one plus one story out of India.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.840]   I'm sure you talked about it all about Android.
[01:25:00.840 --> 01:25:02.840]   The "Scienogen Mod," did a deal.
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:03.840]   Terrible.
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:06.840]   An exclusive deal with another company.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:07.840]   And--
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:08.840]   Another Max.
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:12.840]   And "Micro Max" is now complaining about one plus sales in India and they've halted
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:13.840]   them.
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:14.840]   Terrible.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:15.840]   Oh, man.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:16.840]   That sucks.
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:18.840]   Next is five.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:19.840]   What is going on there?
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.840]   Is Google going to continue to sell that?
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.840]   Apparently so.
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.840]   They are a limited number in stock, but they are saying we're going to continue to sell
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.840]   it to early 2015.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:31.840]   This because a lot of people who want a Nexus phone say, "I'm not buying it.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.840]   I'm not buying that giant whale of a phone."
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:35.840]   Right.
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:36.840]   It's their small phone.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:41.840]   Well, further, if you try to buy the darn thing on the Play Store, you can't still.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.840]   Is it still-- is it out of stock?
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.840]   Right now, it's still out of stock.
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:48.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.840]   Which was fueling rumors and they weren't going to do it.
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.840]   They were just just worth stopping altogether.
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.840]   And basically, it was like, "No, no, this is six."
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:56.840]   Oh, the six?
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:57.840]   You're still kicking it.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.840]   Well, can I just share a little problem?
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.840]   I just did a word of warning about the Nexus 6.
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.840]   It's very easy to root a course.
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:05.840]   You can easily unlock the bootlooter and root it.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.840]   I found a one step root and unlock.
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:13.840]   But remember, Google and I am really questioning this decision, but they decided they wanted
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:18.840]   to make-- they wanted to do an Apple, make it hard for law enforcement to see what's on your
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.840]   phone, so they have encrypted this phone.
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:23.840]   Remember, if you used Android before, you know that after the fact, you go in the settings
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:26.840]   and say, "If you're giving it a pin, you have to give it a pin or password.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.840]   I want to encrypt it from then on."
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:33.840]   This comes encrypted, which caused me a bit of a hassle now because I've rooted it and
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:34.840]   I have a special recovery.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.840]   I've got twerp recovery on here.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:38.840]   And I got 501 this morning.
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:39.840]   I was so excited.
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.840]   By the way, I got on the watch, too, Jason.
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.840]   Yeah, I got my notice, but it's not charged up yet.
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:45.840]   Me neither.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:46.840]   Too low.
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.840]   Damn, that's what that is.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:54.840]   This is the one moment out of every-- you know, all the days in the year where I regret
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:57.840]   the fact that I can't just plug any micro-USB into this.
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:58.840]   The only moment.
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:02.840]   Otherwise, the while I have a charger-- I have two Qi chargers in my office that work.
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:03.840]   Well, there we go.
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.840]   You could put it on the Qi chargers in there.
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:06.840]   Yeah, okay.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:07.840]   All right.
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:10.840]   That's the nice thing about the Moto 360 is it supports Qi.
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:11.840]   Yeah, which I love.
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:16.840]   So that weird cradle is a standard Qi charger and you have to position it carefully, but
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.840]   if you position it just right, you can charge the watch on any Qi charger.
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:20.840]   Good news.
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:21.840]   Excellent.
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.840]   However, I was talking about this and I'm screwed because I rooted it.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:32.840]   And now it's-- in order to install 501, Torp is saying, "Well, what's the password for the
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:33.840]   encryption?"
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:34.840]   I don't know.
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.840]   I didn't give it a password.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:37.840]   Oh, man.
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:39.840]   No, it's not your Google account password.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:40.840]   It's nothing.
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:43.840]   Well, that was when I was trying to joke before, trying to imagine what a Google-- what Google's
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:44.840]   own password is.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:45.840]   Maybe it is.
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:48.840]   Actually, I didn't try my Google account password.
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:49.840]   I should try it.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.840]   I shouldn't say it's not.
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.840]   Did they use a password when they encrypted it?
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:54.840]   They must have, right?
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:55.840]   They're a page.
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:00.840]   Page-ing Larry Page, Dr. Fine.
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.840]   Dr. Howard, Dr. Fine.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:06.840]   CNN's list of 28 internet acronyms.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:07.840]   Have you been studying this?
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:08.840]   Every parent should know.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:09.840]   Gina, you need to know these.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.840]   Oh, I'm scared.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:13.840]   Ed is going to be a teenager any day now.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:14.840]   Oh, God, please.
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:15.840]   Please.
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:16.840]   I got time.
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:17.840]   Oh, God.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:18.840]   Oh, no, no.
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:24.840]   This is a great article by Amy Graf on the San Francisco Chronicles website, SFGate, in which
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:32.760]   the banks, this bogus list from CNN of 28 internet acronyms every parent should know.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:34.000]   She did the research.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.960]   She looked them up on Urban Dictionary.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:39.840]   These kids aren't using these.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:41.360]   I WSN.
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.840]   I want sex now.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.840]   Now.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:45.840]   GNOC.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:49.920]   Get naked on camera.
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:50.920]   See you.
[01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:51.920]   Oh, my God.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:52.920]   Four, six.
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:54.760]   See you for sex.
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:55.760]   That's it.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:56.760]   We're going on this.
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.800]   I can't know.
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:04.000]   No one THOT that ho over there.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.640]   No one uses these.
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.800]   These are made up.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:08.800]   Sugapit.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:09.800]   Yeah, they are.
[01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:10.800]   Right?
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:11.800]   This is not.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:12.800]   This is CNN.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:20.240]   This is some old farted CNN that found a 1997 acronym dictionary and thought it'd make
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:22.920]   a good clickbait.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:23.920]   This is not true.
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.240]   Don't worry about it.
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.360]   Not true.
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:31.000]   And she debunks it quite nicely.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.960]   CNN has no idea.
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:41.400]   This is a line from Steven Grabowski who is her 24-year-old cousin, but also a staffer
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:46.760]   at New York magazine called Relics, which is a music festival and youth culture magazine.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:51.400]   He says, "CNN has no idea what sexting is, but they're pretty sure it has something to
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:54.280]   do with acronyms."
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:57.720]   I love it.
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:00.240]   Anyway, don't worry, Gina.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:03.280]   The kids are not having sex.
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.280]   Thank you.
[01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.280]   Thank you, Amy Graf.
[01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.280]   That's a great article.
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:08.640]   Nice job, Amy.
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:13.040]   So I've rebooted this thing now, and now it's because foolishly I wiped it, so now I have
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.840]   to start all over again.
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:15.840]   Yeah, starting fresh.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:16.840]   No.
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:17.840]   It's going to start fresh.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:20.160]   I mean, I'm hoping that I will zip in your kick.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.880]   I'm hoping I'll have 501 on here.
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:26.960]   That would be really depressing if I wiped it, and there's still no -- well, we'll all
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.680]   let you know.
[01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:33.680]   Any other story before we get to our last ad in our tip pick and number of the week?
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:35.160]   Uh, I'll update.
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:40.600]   So Jake Tapper, the most over-the-top tweet I think I've seen in ages.
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:42.240]   Jake Tapper of ABC.
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:44.240]   I like him normally.
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.240]   I normally do.
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:48.240]   His tweet is, "We are all Seth Rogen."
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:49.240]   Oh, no.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:50.240]   That's horrible.
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:51.240]   We're not.
[01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:53.240]   We're really not.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.240]   No, we're not.
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:56.240]   Okay.
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:01.240]   Seth Rogen called his dealer man, and he's getting a lot of weed right now.
[01:31:01.240 --> 01:31:03.240]   I can't breathe, man.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:07.120]   You think there'll be a new -- no, I got to stop.
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:11.600]   Michael Moore, "Dear Sony Hackers, now that you run Hollywood, I'd also like less romantic
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:14.680]   comedies, fewer Michael Bay movies, no more Transformers."
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:15.680]   That's right on.
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.680]   I dig that.
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:17.680]   I dig that.
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:18.680]   That's pretty funny.
[01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:21.840]   That's right on, man.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:29.800]   I think we're going to be talking about this Sony Hack for a long time to come.
[01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:30.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:32.800]   All right.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:33.800]   Let's take a break.
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:34.800]   All right, I'm sorry.
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:35.800]   I'll break the kick.
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:40.920]   Yeah, if you have other stories, but keep following that breaking news, breaking tweets,
[01:31:40.920 --> 01:31:45.520]   celebrity tweets, celebrity tweets on the Sony Hack.
[01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:48.760]   It's just in.
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:49.760]   Well we got Rob Lowe.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:50.760]   Rob Lowe.
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:51.760]   Oh, what does Rob Lowe have to say?
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:53.800]   Rob Lowe says, "Two tweets.
[01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:54.800]   Wow.
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:58.760]   Everyone caved the hackers one, an utter and complete victory for them.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:31:59.760]   Wow.
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:00.760]   Two hours.
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:01.760]   It's a two-hour tweeter.
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:05.880]   Gina right now is rushing to find out the Wow count in everybody's tweets.
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:15.400]   I have some sympathy for the exhibitors because even if they had the movie, no one's
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:16.400]   going to go see it, right?
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.400]   Or would they filled theaters?
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.400]   What do you think?"
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:23.160]   Well, here's the way I looked at it.
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:26.520]   I would go, but then would I take my child?
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:27.520]   No.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:28.520]   No.
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:30.280]   Let's not get crazy.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.880]   These guys aren't going to attack.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.720]   No, I know, but it's...
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.720]   Who knows?
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:38.560]   Second late breaking Rob Lowe tweet.
[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:39.560]   Oh, boy.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:43.760]   So, all Seth Rogen at JFK, both of us have never seen or heard of anything like this.
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:46.800]   Hollywood has done Neville Chamberlain proud today.
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:49.560]   Oh, capitulation.
[01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:52.000]   What do they call it?
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.000]   When Chamberlain...
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.640]   No, no, it wasn't a quizzling.
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:58.400]   What did he do with Hitler?
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:59.720]   Anyway, there was a word for it.
[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:02.200]   Yeah, I'm getting old.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.440]   That's when you really old.
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:06.480]   When you remember the story, because it was...
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.000]   The words is out there somewhere.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000]   A piece of it.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000]   A piece of it.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000]   Thank you, Stoic Swirl.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000]   He did it.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:13.000]   It's like a fire flag.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000]   He did it somewhere.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000]   Very good.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000]   Peasement.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.200]   Well, we need a chat room to follow us around all the time to give us the words we don't
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:20.200]   know.
[01:33:20.200 --> 01:33:22.560]   Thank God for the chat room.
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.720]   That's such good stuff.
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:26.440]   I'm mainlining the chat room now.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:28.640]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:29.640]   This was a...
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:30.640]   Talking about good stuff.
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:33.760]   This was a lifesaver when I was sending out invoices.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:38.080]   I used to use Microsoft Word to create invoices, and it was such a pain to do it, and then print
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:40.040]   it, and then mail it, and all that stuff that I would never do it.
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:41.120]   I would wait months.
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:44.320]   And then they would get the invoices and go, "Wait a minute.
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.160]   You can't invoice for stuff six months ago.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:49.000]   What are you nuts?"
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.080]   You can get paid faster.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:51.360]   You can send out invoices faster.
[01:33:51.360 --> 01:33:56.960]   You can actually make invoicing fun and easy with FreshBooks, the cloud accounting solution,
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:59.920]   designed from the ground up for entrepreneurs and small businesses.
[01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:05.320]   And I can tell you from first-hand experience because I used FreshBooks for years.
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:08.480]   Get a fresh start for 2015 with FreshBooks.
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:12.800]   It's the easiest way to invoice clients to organize expenses to track your time.

[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:20.240]   They've done research that says that the FreshBooks customers free up two days a month,
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.840]   that they would be normally doing all this junk.
[01:34:22.840 --> 01:34:26.960]   On average, FreshBooks customers double their revenue in the first 24 months, and this is
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:27.960]   the one I cared about.
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:31.920]   And you get paid an average of five days faster, and I will vouch for that.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:34.280]   Absolutely true.
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:38.160]   They have mobile apps now that allow you to track time and hours and put them right
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.520]   into your invoices.
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:42.560]   You can also take care of expenses.
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:45.680]   Snap photos receipts right from your phone track expenses easily.
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:49.320]   The report system, your accountant will love it.

[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:09.680]   And that Coleman, who's a web designer and developer, says, "I seriously don't get excited
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:10.880]   about accounting.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:11.880]   Who does?"
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:13.040]   But I love FreshBooks.
[01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.520]   I love setting up recurring hosting invoices.
[01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.720]   It's true.
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:22.280]   Go to freshbooks.com/tweg, and enter this week in Google when they ask you how did you
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:24.280]   hear about it.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:28.680]   Freshbooks.com/tweig starts a 30-day free trial today.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:32.160]   And all we ask, when they ask you, "How did you hear about us?"
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:34.160]   You say, "This week in Google.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:40.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, Gina Trapani has our tip of the week."
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:41.760]   Oh, wait.
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:43.160]   Can we do one last story?
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.160]   Yes.
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.160]   Really quick.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.160]   Sorry.
[01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:49.840]   I just thought that this Microsoft knucklehead blog post, did you do this on the week?
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:51.680]   I put that one up there.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:52.840]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:54.000]   This thing is just funny.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:36:00.480]   Microsoft does a company blog post, which is clearly about Google, but it's weird.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:05.240]   And they pulled it, but it's still in Google's cache, ironically.
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:12.400]   It's basically saying that Google Apps is terrible compared to Office 360, but it's
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:15.920]   got this long story about this guy's knucklehead son.
[01:36:15.920 --> 01:36:19.840]   Yeah, if you click on the cache version link, there's a link like it.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:20.840]   Oh, Lord.
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:22.840]   You got to go off.
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:23.840]   This is the first time.
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:25.680]   Remember G-mail man reading your email?
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:26.680]   Yeah, and scruggled.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.680]   It's along those lines.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:31.280]   This is not the first time.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:34.080]   This post is gold.
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:36.080]   It's kind of gold.
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:37.080]   Yeah.
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.720]   My knucklehead son does want to go to college.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:44.800]   No, instead he wants to wander around the country in a Volkswagen camper van, posting
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:49.480]   his adventures on YouTube for legions of adoring fans, pausing just long enough to
[01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:54.360]   cup his hands under a gushing spigot of money piped by grateful advertisers.
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:56.080]   I tell him he sounds like Google.
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.360]   And it just goes from there.
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:02.240]   It's crazy and weird, funny.
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.560]   So anyway, yes, that was my last.
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:05.560]   Thank you, Mark Pan.
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:08.600]   And I'm going to give you one more breaking tweet.
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:09.600]   Oh, yes.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:16.600]   The situation room.
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:19.600]   U.S. investigators determine North Korea is behind Sony TAC.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:20.600]   Oh.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.600]   And then Perez reports.
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:23.600]   Oh.
[01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:24.600]   Interesting.
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:30.920]   So then the whole GOP guardians of piece thing was probably, uh, there's a video.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:33.760]   I'm going to run down right now.
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.320]   That's from CNN.
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:39.080]   I don't, you know, the FBI has not been talking about this.
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:43.480]   Just put up the video under, uh, we're going to put it bottom of Google.
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:44.480]   Is it?
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:45.480]   Okay.
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.480]   You'll have to get it because I've closed out.
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:52.880]   Oh, you're ready to think about it was already.
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:55.600]   I'm on my way home in my mind.
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.400]   In my mind, I'm on my way home.
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.680]   I'm getting a sign in thing for, uh, cable services.
[01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:01.680]   Oh, crap.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:02.680]   Oh, no.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:07.080]   Oh, I hate you, exfinity.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:08.080]   What are you doing?
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:09.080]   What's that?
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:11.760]   You can't watch CNN unless you prove you get CNN.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:15.120]   Uh, but in the embedded tweet, it appears.
[01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:16.120]   Well, thank you.
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:17.920]   It appears in the tweet.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:18.920]   You can.
[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:22.840]   On behalf of the North Korean government, the question now is what do we do about it?
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:26.560]   Uh, we expect that there's going to be an announcement tomorrow from the US government,
[01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:32.160]   uh, that, uh, will, uh, assign attribution as they describe it, uh, you know, for responsibility
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:33.360]   for this hack.
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:39.160]   And then the question will be what the US government's response will be because obviously,
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:43.880]   you know, nothing happens in North Korea without orders from the, from the leadership of the
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:44.880]   regime.
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:45.880]   They control the internet there.
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:51.160]   Uh, so there's no way this attack could have been done by anyone other than if it was
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:54.760]   ordered by, by the leadership of that country.
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:55.760]   Okay.
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.760]   Wow.
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:00.240]   So I'd like that's very light on facts.
[01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:04.840]   So it's, it's, it's, it's, I would like to know which, which, which apartment of the
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:08.560]   US government announced that and why they think that.
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:10.840]   And of course, none of that was available.
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:13.040]   US investigators is that the FBI?
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:14.040]   I don't know.
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:15.040]   Yeah, I know.
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:16.040]   We don't know.
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:22.160]   US who was a deputy, uh, secretary of state under Hillary Clinton, uh, was the social person,
[01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:23.160]   very, very smart guy.
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:28.680]   I just put up a link to his piece on Huffington Post, uh, where he talks about, uh, this is
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.640]   as, as cyber warfare.
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:32.440]   Where does it stop?
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:35.480]   Um, and he, and he, and he has a, it's a light hearted in some ways.
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:39.720]   He says that it's only a matter of time before some hot shot group of engineers recognizes
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.520]   and stalls a cyber attack.
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.880]   And instead of calling the authorities who can't do anything anyway, the VP of engineering
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:47.360]   orders a counter attack against the aggressor.
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:51.600]   If Sony had a better engineering department, if we're a little more Northern California,
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:55.000]   instead of Southern California, I wonder what would have happened.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.280]   If they had identified the source of the hack and shot back with a DDoS attack, would
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:01.720]   North Koreans have considered this an invasion by the United States or Japan where Sony's
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:05.200]   actually had, or I'm going to call BS on this CNN report.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.440]   Yep.
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:09.440]   I don't think I would like to see what they got this one.
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:10.440]   I would too.
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:14.440]   I think there's a lot of, first of all, if North Korea did it, why would they deny they
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.440]   did it?
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:20.280]   Well, oh, wouldn't they want to crow?
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:27.280]   You're just looking for sane motivates, sane activities around Kim Jong-un.
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:28.720]   Come on.
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:34.880]   And then there's a wired magazine or a wired online article about that says most Korea
[01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:37.320]   almost certainly did not attack Sony.
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:43.520]   Now, the problem is I don't know what investigators they're saying.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:45.360]   We just, there's so much more we need to know.
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:46.600]   And I'd like to see their evidence.
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:47.600]   True.
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:48.600]   That's true.
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:49.600]   Yeah.
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:50.600]   I don't mean to jump to anything.
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:53.160]   Breaking news, the situation room.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.480]   US investigators is not sufficient.
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:04.080]   So this will make your head explode just like Kim Jong-un's.
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:05.480]   Time magazine is a piece.
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:08.160]   Three reasons people think North Korea hacked Sony.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.840]   Main head, sub head.
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:12.040]   And four reasons it might have been somebody else.
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:13.040]   Everybody.
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:14.040]   Right.
[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:18.080]   Which is to say we don't know.
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.560]   We don't know anything.
[01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:25.600]   I think it wasn't Sony North Korea, but I think that the Guardians of Peace once they
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:30.160]   sniffed that possibility, you know, decided to play along.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:33.640]   I think you're a wise voice of sanity here.
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:38.240]   I'd just like to see the, yeah, I'd like to see more.
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:41.480]   We know so little because they haven't revealed much.
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:42.480]   Sorry.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:43.480]   Sorry.
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:44.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:45.960]   I'm going to take a break in interruption.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.440]   Your tip of the week.
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:49.440]   Let's start the tip of the week.
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:54.600]   So the new, the Hangouts Dialer app is now a full fledged system dialer.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:56.520]   That's on Android.
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:02.360]   That means that you can switch over to using Hangouts for your phone calls for everything.
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:06.960]   You can say, you know, when you, when you tap on a phone number and your email or calendar
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:10.600]   or whatever, you'll get prompted what, which dialer you want to use.
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:14.160]   And now Hangouts Dialer, it was not before a full fledged system dialer that you could
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:15.760]   set to, but now it is.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:20.360]   You can say, always use your Hangouts dialer and you can always use Hangouts for, for your
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:21.360]   phone.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:26.280]   So moving farther and farther away from depending upon carriers for your number and your, and
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.280]   your costs.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:31.440]   Gina, would you trust Hangouts as your always choice?
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:32.440]   I do already.
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.920]   I mean, I use Google Voice and I switch over to, to Hangouts.
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:40.080]   And I do it on my desktop all the, that's how I make phone calls at home.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.080]   I put on my head.
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.720]   I want to hear my headset and use, and it's just sounds better.
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:43.720]   It's more relaxed.
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:48.120]   But my question, Google Voice was not VoIP.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.440]   That's this is VoIP.
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:52.200]   This does not use your minutes.
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:53.960]   It uses data only.
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:54.960]   Is that right?
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:56.560]   That, yeah, that's true.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:57.560]   It's hangouts.
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.560]   Yes.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.720]   When you make call this is not the Google Voice system.
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:03.240]   This is a different system that is data only.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.240]   It's VoIP.
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:05.240]   Wow.
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:07.240]   It's great.
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:10.360]   Yeah, it works great in my basement where I don't get bars.
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:11.360]   Right.
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:16.200]   The only issue for me is there's a little bit of lag, more lag than there would be in a
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:17.200]   cell call.
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:18.200]   Right.
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.200]   Right.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:21.000]   For me, it's like kind of less or two evils though.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.200]   I mean, I feel like cell calls can be so bad.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:24.200]   They can be bad too.
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.200]   I mean, they can be bad too.
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.040]   So it's like one or the other.
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:31.320]   But if you do want to switch over to, to Hangouts, you can, you can make the switch now.
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:32.320]   It's a full dialer.
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:33.320]   Awesome.
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:36.200]   And of course you get the choice always or just this one.
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:38.200]   So you don't have to commit to always.
[01:43:38.200 --> 01:43:39.200]   Try that.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:40.200]   Interesting.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:46.200]   Jeffrey, your number of the week is 20.
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:50.480]   It's the last of the three links in my number section.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:52.600]   And I don't know why this fascinated me so much and I tweeted it.
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:57.000]   I got tweeted like crazy genius will soon tell me exactly how much I'm looking.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:58.000]   Oh.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:01.880]   And I think, I think, I think I've already did.
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:07.760]   And it's the top 20 websites every December from 1996 to 2013.
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:08.760]   And it's really small.
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:11.640]   But if you just click on the chart and it doesn't work well on audio, but it's a, it's,
[01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:15.160]   it's a, it's a, it's a stroll through memory lane.
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:25.240]   So 1996, two years after Netscape AOL was tops AOL was tops for two for six, seven years.
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:31.960]   crawler, info. seek prodigy copuserve you miss.edu, Below,
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:36.000]  hold, I just found that people just were digging into this and
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.280]   having all kinds of fun. I'm trying to remember, you know,
[01:44:39.280 --> 01:44:42.480]   tripod switchboard of course, altevista. Of course,
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:47.220]   like ghosts of course, info. Seek this is really cool. It
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:50.840]   pin house was a top 20 website in 1996
[01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:57.120]   for one brief, shining naked moment. I read it for the
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:00.180]   letters, man. I read it for letters. Um,
[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:05.120]   I'll either way right right right after Penn has excite. So
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:06.760]   that's appropriate.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:13.360]   Now AOL disappears in 2003. And I noted that but then as
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:15.520]   somebody said, no, no, no, it just just mixed it with time
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:18.960]   Warner. That's why time Warner is number two in 2003.
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:20.920]   Exactly. And five. But the other thing that struck me about
[01:45:20.920 --> 01:45:24.920]   this is that in 2013, the last year of this Yahoo, which I
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:27.800]   think we said at the time came back was the top was the top
[01:45:27.800 --> 01:45:30.160]   website, which also shows you that being the top website is
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:32.800]   not necessarily a great business doesn't mean much.
[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:36.200]   Nope. Hey, Google's business is not about being a website at
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:37.680]   all. Who's glam media?
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:42.720]   Well, you funny, you should ask. I'm a advisor to clam.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:46.400]   I'm there. Number what eight on the list. They're phenomenal.
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:49.400]   Now they're number seven and glam is glam is amazing. The
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:53.360]   reason I like glam is the CEO. He came into my office one one
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:56.000]   day many years ago and he read what would Google do it. And he
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.720]   said, I have to show you this. You're going to understand this.
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:03.440]   Glam is a network. Glam is 6,000 sites as a network and they
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:06.440]   sell ads across all of them. And it's the power of the network
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:09.240]   and it amazes me to this day that no one in media has
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:13.760]   understood the power of Glam's model. And it's not about
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:16.840]   creating all your own content, owning your own content. Glam
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:21.240]   at first was just a women's brand. And it fought against
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:25.480]   I village. I village was the was the queen of women online.
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:29.760]   I village recently has been fully shut down by NBCU. Glam
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:33.520]   one glam is gone to other areas men and other things. They've
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:36.400]   done foodie, which is a great site. They understand how to
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:41.120]   aggregate how to how to create ad networks. And nobody knows
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:45.560]   them. I was just talking to Samir only only yesterday and
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:49.400]   their first goal was to get this they bought Ning and they
[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:53.720]   believed every day. Yeah. Yep. So they say that every social
[01:46:53.720 --> 01:46:57.400]   site needs content and every content site needs social. And
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:00.120]   they're going to be doing some new things soon around that. So
[01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:03.480]   pardon the little ad for Glam, but I think Glam is a fascinating
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:06.440]   story. What was the only one of that list? I didn't know. So
[01:47:06.440 --> 01:47:10.320]   there you go. Exactly. And they're huge and they grew huge by
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:12.840]   creating networks to enable bloggers basically.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:20.480]   That's cool. So my tool of the week kind of tags on something
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:23.800]   that we talked about last week, Android studio now out of beta
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:30.360]   and available to all and go the language go from Google, which
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:33.240]   is a really nice, elegant, concurrent programming language
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:38.160]   designed for web. But the confluence is they've just released
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:41.160]   go 1.4 and you can write Android apps and go.
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:47.880]   Wait, what? What? Wait, what? Not? Not? Not? They say simple
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:52.120]   Android apps, but I'm going to investigate. But it's very
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:57.480]   interesting because I hate Java. I hate it. I don't want to use
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:01.360]   Java. And so if and I have a simple app, I want to write that
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:04.840]   would be a purpose build app for me that would I want to put on
[01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:08.600]   my Nexus six that would just do the account down timing for
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:11.680]   the radio show. And I did the Hello world, as you said, and it
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:14.920]   was very easy. I got it on my nice and I kind of added to that.
[01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:18.080]   But then I saw, oh, no, now I have to write the rest of this in
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:18.640]   Java.
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:25.160]   Well, I've written Java and I don't like it. I guess I can go back
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:29.200]   and learn it again and do it again. But I'd be much happier if
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:32.240]   it were and go. So I will investigate. But the newest
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:37.160]   version of go go 1.4, which is the fifth release. One of the
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:40.240]   new features is there it's going to be more than just kind of a
[01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:43.720]   system file system language. They're going to start supporting
[01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:48.240]   Android development and go much as Apple now is moved or is
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:54.760]   allowing swift in the X code. So I think what makes I asked you
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.200]   this last week, what makes a good language and a bad language?
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:00.640]   I'll ask it again. Why? Why don't you like JavaScript? Java
[01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:03.960]   script is not what I don't like. I actually Java Java Java.
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:07.160]   Well, it's just that's personal. I just don't like it.
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:13.400]   You really like languages. I like interpreted languages,
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:15.600]   because it's really easy to iterate. You know, you write
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:20.000]   compile run very quickly. And but the disadvantage of a
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.640]   traditional interpreted languages is that they're slow.
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:29.640]   There's a lot overhead. So Python, Ruby, Pearl, these are all
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:34.000]   interpreted languages go as well. Kind of sometimes it comes
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:39.760]   kind of pejoratively scripting languages. But I feel like
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:44.400]   if you, you know, there's a certain advantage to having this
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:49.520]   quick iteration cycle and a very clean, simple syntax. The other
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:51.560]   thing about go that was written specifically is sport
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:55.640]   concurrency and and so forth. So it has nice features for that.
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:49:58.680]   That's probably won't benefit you with Android programming. But I
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:01.080]   just I feel like I could much more easily write the program I
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:04.120]   want and go. So I but I don't I don't have to investigate. I'm
[01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:07.640]   still investigating what does that mean when they say Android
[01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:11.040]   support. Yeah, yeah, this is I'm reading about it. And this is
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:13.840]   interesting. Right? Isn't it? Yeah, because you when you write
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:18.720]   your to do text, it's written in Java to Java. Yeah, yeah, I love
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:21.160]   Java. And I mean, Java was the first sort of truly, you know,
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:23.360]   the object oriented languages, the language that I kind of cut
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:26.560]   my teeth on on. Yeah, that's why you like it. Sure, languages.
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:29.840]   And so I do like it. But I do agree that, you know, me a
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:31.880]   language like go I haven't played with go a lot, but it sounds
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:34.880]   like it's similar to Ruby or PHP or, you know, a scripting
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:37.600]   language. It's just easier to easier to start with for sure.
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:41.640]   Yeah, lighter, lighter. And just for something like what I want
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:44.520]   to write very simple, I wouldn't want to write even to do that
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:48.040]   text and go. But but for what I want to write, which is really
[01:50:48.040 --> 01:50:51.120]   a very simple app, it might be more than enough. And that I
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:54.240]   would sure prefer that. Go is fun. If you know, I know the
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:57.280]   hour of code is over now. It was a minute of code.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:02.400]   My hour code is never. Can we make this a year of code? What
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:07.560]   about it? How about a decade of code? Let's go for it, man.
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:13.960]   So partially you don't believe CNN. We believe the New York
[01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:17.640]   Times. Yeah, they say it too. I do believe that American
[01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:20.400]   intelligence officials have concluded that the North Korean
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:23.520]   government was centrally involved, quote unquote, in the recent
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:27.360]   attacks, that I believe your administration officials. So
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.720]   they become the record about the intelligence finding said the
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:32.000]   White House is still debating whether to publicly accuse
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.280]   North Korea what amounts to cyber terrorism campaign. So this
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:39.520]   is all travel. This is all travel and see what the reaction is,
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:43.640]   particularly from North Korea. At this point, some with the
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:46.720]   Obama administration argue that the government of Mr Kim must be
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:49.440]   directly confronted. But that raises the question of what
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:52.000]   consequences the administration would threaten. We're going to
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:58.120]   force you to read to watch the interview. What about is that
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:03.000]   torture? Or how much of its evidence is the government's
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.160]   evidence? It would make public without revealing details of how
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:08.760]   the United States was able to penetrate North Korean
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:11.440]   computer networks to trace the source of the hacking. Others
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:13.800]   argue that a direct confrontation with the North over the
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:17.000]   threats to Sony and moviegoers might result in escalation.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.360]   What are they going to do? Get rid of into the woods next.
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:23.960]   North Korea, the kind of confrontation it often covets
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:27.320]   feed the troll. Well, this is a lot. This is more effective
[01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:31.080]   than their nuclear weapons program. Yep. Uh, you know,
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:33.880]   the success they've achieved. If this is North Korea, the
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:37.400]   success that they've achieved is absolutely going to know who's
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:39.920]   watching the Putin's watching this saying this is going to get
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:43.080]   me out of the currency. This is good for the get oil dollars.
[01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:48.080]   I'm going after the sunny. That accents better.
[01:52:48.080 --> 01:52:52.080]   Spanish accent just not so good. I apologize. It doesn't work.
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:57.080]   You ought to hear my Romanian accent. Japan for which Sony is
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.080]   an iconic person. It's a good thing. It's a good thing.
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:02.080]   But the British Sony is an iconic corporate name that has
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:05.080]   argued that a public accusation could interfere with a delicate
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:08.080]   diplomatic negotiations underway for the return of Japanese
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:29.080]   nationals.
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:31.080]   They were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. So, you know,
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:33.080]   let's hold up a little bit. Yeah, really, all they're saying is
[01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:37.080]   the senior administration officials say off the record say
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:41.080]   right. So let's go. So why would they say that if they didn't
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:45.080]   think it was true? Because that is inflammatory to say that.
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:51.080]   Wow. Wow, wow, wow. Anyway, that is this at the end of this
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:57.080]   show. What a good show. Good show. Good year. I love this.
[01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:01.080]   What a good year has been. Next week, if you tune in at this
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:05.080]   time, you will see the best of twig. Some of our best moments
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:10.080]   from 2014. Rance Raves liked like the Zichrecht.
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:15.080]   Like the Sier. Was that this year or last year? Oh, God, it all
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:18.080]   blends together. I believe it was this year, wasn't it?
[01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:21.080]   You know, it's probably so 2012. Yeah, we're not talking about
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:23.080]   Glee this year. Yeah, no.
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:27.080]   Yeah, no. It's really, really. So it's what he taught. We've been
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:31.080]   through this show for five years now. Yeah, yeah. My new favorite
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:34.080]   is Master Chef Junior. Did you watch the finale last night? I just
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:38.080]   saw the promos for it and I thought I really don't want to watch
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:42.080]   Gordon Ramsay's scream at children. No, he didn't though. And
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:45.080]   it was just these kids were amazing. They looked like they
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:48.080]   really are good cooks. And you know what? Maybe so happy about
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:51.080]   it is let's be honest. Every one of these kids has probably treated
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:55.080]   like a food geek at school. Right. Right. And they're going to go
[01:54:55.080 --> 01:55:00.080]   back heroes. Yeah. Food, by the way, is the new tech. I have
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:05.080]   decided. Yes. It is the new information technology. It is
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:09.080]   it is the new thing. And I am announcing now today on this
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:13.080]   show for the first time ever, Twitter is abandoning technology.
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:16.080]   We're going to cover food nonstop from now on this week in
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:22.080]   Asparagus breaking news. Asparagus. I'll do a livestream from my
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:25.080]   mom's Christmas Eve dinner. Don't you think we really we just be
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:30.080]   happier in general? If we forgot about all this tech stuff and
[01:55:30.080 --> 01:55:34.080]   just talked about food. This is a good way to end this
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:40.080]   end here. On the show. Oh, come on. We're renaming the show
[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:48.080]   this weekend. Grub. Last. Ever. No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no,
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:51.080]   no, we'll be back. We live in an amazing time. We do and we're
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:55.080]   watching it. Ring seat ringside seats on the revolution. The
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:58.080]   two weeks from now will be New Year's Eve and we are starting
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:01.080]   at three in the morning on New Year's Eve Pacific time. We'll go
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:05.080]   to three in the morning New Year's day Pacific time as we greet
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:08.080]   every time zone across the world and wish them happy new year. And
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:11.080]   I think we have calls from almost every time. So do you mind if I
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:14.080]   do a short list of time zones we're still looking for and you can
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:20.080]   go to twit.tv/nye and sign up. We need Norfolk Island. We need
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:24.080]   the Northern Marianas Islands including Guam, Micronesia
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:32.080]   and Vladivostok. If you're Vladivostok. Burma. Cocos. Afghanistan.
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:38.080]   Iran. That ain't going to happen. Azores. Cape Verde. Trinidad.
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:43.080]   South Georgia or Sandwich Islands. But most importantly, our last
[01:56:43.080 --> 01:56:48.080]   time zone of the 24 hour period. Three AM New Year's day.
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:53.080]   Jarvis Island. A bird sanctuary in the Pacific.
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:58.080]   Blimey there. I don't do it. Jeff. Jeffle Dude's got just name
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:02.080]   written all over it. Literally. Literally. It's apparently
[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:06.080]   it's a bird sanctuary. And the problem is it wasn't really
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:10.080]   named after a guy named Jarvis. It's a typo. It's a typo? Yeah.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:14.080]   It's some other name. It's not Jarvis. You're kidding me.
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:18.080]   No. Here it is. No trespassing. U.S. Fish and Wildlife
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:22.080]   Service. Jarvis Island. You sure Jeff? We can't get you to go
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:27.080]   there and I'm thinking so. It has a flag of its very own.
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:32.080]   It's an unincorporated, unorganized territory managed by the U.S.
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:38.080]   Fish and Wildlife Service. So it belongs to all of us. It
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:44.080]   belongs to America. It isn't very big, but it has to have its New
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:49.080]   Year's Day just like every other island. So we need somebody from
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:52.080]   Jarvis and then we're then we then we will go home after that one.
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:54.080]   That'll be the last one.
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:59.080]   So if you're in those time zones, twit.tv/nye, we are doing this
[01:57:59.080 --> 01:58:03.080]   all for UNICEF. We hope to raise lots of money for UNICEF. We've
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:06.080]   got auctions and prizes and all sorts of stuff. We're going to do
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:10.080]   it just like the Jerry Lewis telethons of my youth. I'm going
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:13.080]   to wear a tuxedo. We're going to have a tote board. We'll have a
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.080]   drumroom.
[01:58:14.080 --> 01:58:18.080]   The platform we're using for the contributions. United Nations
[01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:21.080]   Children's Fund UNICEF has a platform for us.
[01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:26.080]   In fact, right after this, I'm making a video, a video for them.
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:31.080]   It's UNICEF USA, but it is the money will go to children all
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:36.080]   over the world. And we were looking for an international charity
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:39.080]   that was highly rated. Charity Navigator gives them four out of
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:44.080]   four stars. 91% of every dollar spent goes right to children.
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:48.080]   And everybody's familiar with this, at least in the U.S., because
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:52.080]   we all went around with those orange boxes on Halloween trick or
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:57.080]   treating for UNICEF. And they're doing a lot to help children
[01:58:57.080 --> 01:59:02.080]   in Africa from Ebola. So I thought this would be a good one for us.
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:07.080]   >> Hindi Gogo just made its personal campaign platform free.
[01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:10.080]   >> Neat. >> Neat. >> It's almost a few times when you want to
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:13.080]   raise something for charity or raise it for yourself. >> That's
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:18.080]   really neat. >> I need to send my kid to college. That's not an option.
[01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:21.080]   >> Isn't that great? That's appropriate. >> Yeah.
[01:59:21.080 --> 01:59:26.080]   >> Anyway, so do join us. Anytime in the New Year's Eve time frame,
[01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:30.080]   3 a.m. New Year's Eve, 3 a.m. New Year's Day, I'm going to be up all night.
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:35.080]   And we have so much stuff planned. It is just going to -- I mean,
[01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:38.080]   we had so much fun last year. We said, let's go all in this year.
[01:59:38.080 --> 01:59:42.080]   And it's costing us a pretty penny. We've taken over the street out
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:46.080]   of the front. We've got permits from the city of Petaluma.
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:51.080]   Please don't rain. And -- >> What happens out there if it does rain?
[01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:56.080]   >> It'll be wet. >> It'll be a lot easier to fall off the mechanical
[01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:59.080]   bull. >> That's true. >> It'll keep the line moving.
[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:03.080]   >> Yes. >> It's going to be weird. >> I'll give you one more.
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:07.080]   >> Oh, no. >> More tweets. >> Donald Trump.
[02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:12.080]   >> Oh, Lord. >> Oh, boy. >> Just go to twitter.com/realdontaltrump.
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:17.080]   >> Oh. Oh. What does he say?
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:22.080]   >> I haven't even watched it yet. How can you avoid?
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:26.080]   >> There are a lot of tweets on this, aren't there?
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:31.080]   >> Oh, yeah. It's going crazy. >> Donald Trump, a sad day for freedom
[02:00:31.080 --> 02:00:34.080]   of speech. No, I got it right here. I got it right here.
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:38.080]   Let's play the video. Wait a minute. I guess I don't have the video.
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:42.080]   You got the video. Play the video. Trump vlog, the interview movie, a sad day for
[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:45.080]   freedom of speech. I post something on Instagram.
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:50.080]   >> Is it playing? >> Well, I hear it was a terrible, terrible
[02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:54.080]   movie. Sony has absolutely no courage or guts.
[02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:59.080]   They should have never pulled it. >> King John in your fire.
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:07.080]   >> I like it how he has to preface it. Although I hear it was a terrible movie.
[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:15.080]   >> That was gratuitous. >> Hey, hey, Kim, you want to mess with this
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:20.080]   man? I don't think so. Look at that hair. >> Well, I said, who has
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:24.080]   weirder hair? Donald Trump or Kim Jong Un? >> Yeah, there you go.
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:29.080]   >> It feels like they should know each other. Happy Christmas, happy new year,
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:33.080]   happy Hanukkah, Jeff, Gina. Love doing this show with you.
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:36.080]   Take the week off next week. Enjoy your-- >> Merry whatever.
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:40.080]   >> It's not at his first Christmas or second Christmas. >> It's her second Christmas.
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:45.080]   >> Oh, she's going to start to know what's going on now. >> Wait, what am I talking about?
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:50.080]   It's her third Christmas. >> Third? >> Yeah, yeah, yeah. She was born in September
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:54.080]   so she was only tiny little. >> Baby's first Christmas. Yeah, she didn't remember that.
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:58.080]   But she'll never remember this one. >> Yeah, it's pretty great. We get to watch.
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:02.080]   >> Oh, it's so much fun. >> We just sort of Rudolph and yeah, she's starting to understand a little bit more now.
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:06.080]   So that's good. >> Now, do you do that new thing, the elf on the shelf? Did you do that?
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:10.080]   >> We love the elf on the shelf. Grandma has one of those. >> Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:14.080]   >> We didn't have that when I was a kid, right, Jeff? That's new. What on the shelf?
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:18.080]   >> Yeah, see? >> That's all you need to know. >> This is something new.
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:22.080]   >> It's an, I don't know if you can have a new Christmas tradition.
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:26.080]   But apparently you can't. >> You can do the elf on the shelf for a couple of days and it quickly becomes a tradition.
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:32.080]   >> It's kind of cool. >> Oh, now I understand. >> Yeah, you're seeing this everywhere, right?
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:36.080]   >> Well, so now it makes sense on Shark Tank for their holiday,
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:42.080]   the first business in was a guy who did Mench on the Bench. >> Oh, yeah, now you get it. >> I think that's what it is.
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:46.080]   >> Yeah, I'll get it. >> So, it's kind of a hallmark tradition, because there's
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:54.080]   this whole elf on the shelf.com. And they have kids. >> I mean, they have tons of merchandise here on this.
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:03:02.080]   >> It's been heavily merged, although I don't know if they own it. But you hide the elf every day in December?
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:08.080]   >> No, no, we don't hide the elf. >> Sorry, the elf hides himself.
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:15.080]   >> The elf flies back to the North Pole to tell Santa how the kids have been and then positions themselves in the house
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:21.080]   in a different place for the next morning. >> Wait a second, Jason. So now your kid has surveilled.
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:25.080]   >> Yeah. >> Just the NSA. >> So getting ready for the NSA. >> Yeah.
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:35.080]   >> Pretty much. That's exactly what it is. >> But you see, this is the thing. They opt in, because they are genuinely curious.
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:44.080]   So they opt into their location tracking. It's okay. >> Actually, the Washington Post has an article that says the elf on the shelf
[02:03:44.080 --> 02:03:52.080]   is preparing your child to live in a future police state, Professor Warren's. >> I was joking.
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:04:02.080]   >> They've taken your quote and they've made it a story already. So here's the thing on the elf on the shelf. It's a registered trademark.
[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:11.080]   To me, Christmas tradition should not be registered trademark. Santa Claus is not a registered trademark.
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:19.080]   >> He's saying capitalism, man. >> Somebody owns the elf on the shelf. >> I just searched elf on the shelf creepy tons of wicked, please.
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:27.080]   >> Yeah. >> Tons. Elf on the shelf is terrorizing our kid. >> Really? >> Elf on the shelf is good. >> No, I think kids like it.
[02:04:27.080 --> 02:04:32.080]   >> That's creepy reality. >> Don't kids like it? >> Yes, because they name it. They give it a name.
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:39.080]   >> Where did you get your elf on the shelf? Did you hand make one from sticks and old rags just like Grandma did?
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:44.080]   >> No, you don't want one. >> You got it at the store, will you? >> Not at the store, but here's the story behind it.
[02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:52.080]   >> Is that Santa creates all these elves and puts them in a box in the store. So when kids see them in the store, they aren't magical until they name them.
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:58.080]   >> Oh. >> So you bring it home, you give it a name, and that's when they start moving around at night when they don't watch.
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:03.080]   >> All right, all right, if you dirty words here, but I recommend elf on the shelf will kill us.us.
[02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:11.080]   >> It's a little chucky. It's a little bit chucky. >> Elf on the shelf is creepy, says the headline.
[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:17.080]   >> Apparently Rudolph was created by an apartment store. Santa Claus as we know him comes from a Pepsi commercial.
[02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:23.080]   This is a long tradition of Christmas commercialism. God bless it.
[02:05:23.080 --> 02:05:31.080]   >> Merry Christmas. >> Merry Christmas everybody. That's it for this week at Google. We'll see you in two weeks in 2015. Bye-bye.
