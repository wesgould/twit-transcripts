[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.400]   watching the show and you were here on Sunday and you left your nice Google baseball hat Mr. Google
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.360]   I think Larry Page was in the audience. We have it we'll hold on to it for you joining us now to
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.200]   talk about Google and the cloud from right to left Gina Trepani from smarterware.org founding
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.440]   editor at Life Hacker. Hello. And host also of all about Android hello Gina. Hello good to be here.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:07.120]   And new mama. Yeah. How's that? She's wonderful. She's just cute every day. Oh gosh. How's it how
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.320]   is she looking the Google Glass? She looks good right? Oh man I cannot wait to use that for her. I just
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.280]   cannot because she definitely smiles a lot when you know direct eye contact. So I haven't gotten my
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.240]   pariot but she's absolutely gonna be my first you know we're just gonna do it. Hang out to grandma.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.600]   Mom is looking at you. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So she's gonna be like what is that thing on your face mom?
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.120]   I don't recognize my mother. She doesn't have a bump over her eyebrow.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.200]   Joining us also Kevin Marks. Hey Kevin good to see you. Tomovision.tv
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.720]   over at Sarah's Force now but he's been at Google. He's been at Apple. He's been at British
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.040]   telecom. He's been everywhere. I've been everywhere man. I get around right now he's in his garden.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.800]   That's right. Any sort of song is my fault. I love it. Are you kidding? That really adds to the show.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.920]   Yeah. That goes orange. It brings a natural feel to the show.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.680]   It matches our wussy theme.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.800]   I haven't seen this in bad. I can't imagine Steve Gilmore ever using anything like that.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.480]   Also here Aaron Newcomb of Oracle fame but he's gonna disclaim himself. He's wearing a raspberry
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.320]   pie t-shirt which I'm really digging. Yeah everybody should get one. He also is a part-time host at
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.320]   Floss Weekly our open source show. Great to have. Floss Weekly. I was on all about Android last
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.120]   night in Jason's absence. Jason had a baby. We got to we have to do breaking news last night. It was
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.000]   really fun. 3 p.m. Pacific last night right before the show Stacey and had the baby Jason watched
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.800]   and baby's name is Savannah for those of you who were betting. We knew it began with an S.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.680]   Isn't that a great name? Great name. Yeah. She is such a cutie. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.160]   Edda's good too. I love the new baby names. They're kind of old-fashioned and sweet and I just love them.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:00.800]   Yeah. So I got to say speaking of glass we're seeing a lot of pictures now from Robert Scoble
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.520]   and everything is just from his point of view right so it's slightly tilted and at a weird angle
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.480]   and great for taking baby pictures. I'm not saying that Gina but I got to tell you if we are all of
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.960]   a sudden just going to be a world full of Google Glass shot photos I'm not going to be happy.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.960]   They're just weird looking. Yeah. I mean you know it's not high art photography right?
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.920]   But Scoble's here. Here's the sad thing. Scoble's a really good photographer.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.840]   So instead of using you know his camera now he's taking a lot of pictures from his right eyebrow.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.440]   Yeah it's a quality versus quantity thing right. I actually haven't seen Scoble's. At some point I
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.800]   just sort of unsubscribed I'm looking him up on the scene just hashtag scene through glass. I guess
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.280]   I'm thinking this must be done automatically whenever you take a picture. Is it seen through
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.040]   glass or oh now it now that doesn't that didn't come up with anything.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.360]   On cheap glass? Well he's using hashtag through glass. Through glass you're right and that must be
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.880]   done automatically. So if you do the hashtag through glass you'll see a lot of pictures taken
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.640]   through glass. Wow there's one that's just blur a blur but something is kind of cool. I mean
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.800]   there's one where he's on stage and you can kind of see the other audience. Yeah. That gives me
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.720]   the butterflies just looking at it. You don't like public speaking? I don't. I don't. I mean I do
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.640]   this show partially because I want to get over my fear of getting up on stage but do the show is a
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.520]   different thing than getting up on stage. Oh yeah come on we're biologically programmed to feel like
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.400]   you know we're about to get trampled by a herd of of blood sucking. That's one thing I know nothing
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:43.200]   about. I actually I don't say anything unless my my ex-wife used to say you don't talk unless
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:51.440]   there's a hundred people listening. You're a special employee. I was born to be in front of a live
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:57.840]   audience. Unfortunately. So I guess I'm guessing that this tag through glass is automatic. I mean
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.200]   because you can't type and I'm sure somebody's not hashtagging only. So yeah go to Google plus
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.120]   hashtag through glass. Oh yeah if you're on the search there's quite a few
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.200]   yeah through glass. And so this is this is a good example of one where you can see the
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.160]   point of view is somebody's right eyebrow. I mean it always is and I'm just I don't know if this is
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.200]   this if this I mean I guess you know what it has is it's kind of got that photojournalism
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:32.560]   you know you know in immediacy. Right. Yeah at some point there was a taken through glass
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.720]   hashtag which Vic Gondotra used but it looks like they should get to just to just to just
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.840]   make sense because you don't want to take up you know in a concert. I'm saying what's the
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.640]   good was using through glass through glass. It must be the default because you can't you're not
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.360]   going to type. The for one it's five megapixels the image quality is fine.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:56.880]   Oh good. Let's see. Steve Lee I want to see video. Let's see what the video looks like. This is
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.000]   apparently at Disneyland. California. The video we've seen have been in the commercial and it's
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.920]   been highly edited. Right. Oh I did see this one. This is actually pretty cool. So this is first
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.720]   person on the this thing. I think you get up to 90 miles an hour in the beginning of the it's like
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.840]   catapult. Is a roller coaster. Yeah. Yeah. You get. Oh this is just made for glass right. Like
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.240]   this kind of thing. Except you only get the first 10 seconds. Oh no. That was another one with the
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.480]   whole thing. I think it just restarted California adventure. Oh it just restarted. Okay. Okay.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.560]   Yeah. My son went on this a few years ago. He came off at his hair was sticking straight up.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.640]   Oh my god. This is the only way you're ever getting me on this. This is like a fun ride.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.000]   Yeah. It's like a real gun. Exactly. Yeah. It's an amazing thing. You get up to 90 miles an
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.320]   hour and two seconds zero to 90. Two seconds makes your hair stand up. This is a very good use of
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:51.520]   glass because you're not going to hold a camera. Right. I mean I went on the cyclone in Coney Island
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.080]   years ago and brought my digital elf and shot video and sort of you know took the risk of just
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.960]   dropping it at some point and it came out great but it was you know I didn't get caught by the
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:05.920]   attendance and you know I was losing the fun using losing the camera. I mean this is really cool.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.160]   This is a good use of glass. But the reality is most people are not doing anything like you
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.400]   know things like this every single day. Well I also have to wonder if Disney knew that he had a
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.720]   camera would they have taken it away from him. Yeah. That's how long before they start looking
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:24.880]   for glass. Well maybe a long time according to Eric Schmidt. Google's been saying end of the year
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:30.720]   Eric Schmidt. I don't know if he made a mistake or if he let slip not till next year about he said
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:41.360]   about this time next year. Is the world going to suffer? Or will we all be greatly relieved?
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.680]   By the way there have been I have a pair of glasses that have a camera right over the nose
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:53.440]   and you know I mean it's called the pivot head and it's been around for a while.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:58.000]   Is it a Wi-Fi enabled? I mean can you share and you know no no no no no I just
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.480]   records to memory and then you take it off. And you have to yeah yeah. Did you see Tim
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:09.760]   Arilie's commentary on on glass? No I'd love to see now here's a guy I trust. If Tim says it's good
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:15.600]   I want to know. Me too. Me too. I put it in the in the rundown here. He loved it. He said it's a
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.560]   magical experience. Yeah. Huge grin. A long time since it's been a long time since the tech
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:25.840]   gadget had me grinning ear to ear so often. It's not at all what people expect. It's a magical
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.960]   experience. I mean this is this is a love. Yeah. Yeah and he I haven't been able to quite put my
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.680]   finger on why it feels that way but I think it's the immediacy. And this is exactly what what
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.600]   Brynn was saying rather than fumbling for your phone opening the camera app you take a picture
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.960]   of video with a touch and share it with another touch. You can talk the advice taking pictures
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.520]   doing Google searches getting directions without ever touching the device. So you know this is
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.960]   this was the emasculator. This is what he was supposed to he was trying to get to when he said
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:59.280]   it's emasculating. But I like this post by Tim O'Reilly because I trust Tim as well.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:04.080]   He's not you know he doesn't he criticizes when things are. Oh yeah. He is not so there's a
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:08.000]   category of people that I just love everything new and he's not one of them. He's not one of them.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.920]   He's very thoughtful and he kind of he listed a couple things he said you know people have this
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:17.360]   notion that it's privacy invading it really isn't it's very easy to see when the device is on.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.760]   The lit up screen is viewable from the other side. So I'm talking to you with Glasson you can tell
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.200]   when it's on. He says yes you can quickly take a photo but either with the voice command or
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.720]   push the button on the frame. So it's clearly noticeable. Now it's interesting that he said
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.040]   that because there are some stories this week as someone dug into some code and saw that there's
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.280]   an there's an eye wink gesture right. So it's possibly you'll be able to wink and take a photo.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.800]   That does not sound like it's enabled right now in the explore edition that that Tim had on.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.560]   And it may never be enabled because I think that that is one that sensitivities people have is that
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.400]   you could be taking a picture without anybody knowing. You know even on some cameras now
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:59.440]   by law or by fiat they make a loud audible noise when you take a picture on some camera phones
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:05.920]   and you can't turn it off. I think that that seems to be societally acceptable.
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.640]   You know if what Tim just described is exactly the experience people had with something like the
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:16.720]   iPad were on paper. I remember this when the iPad was announced I had I was at the
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.960]   debt went to the demo room and handled it. The people who just had heard about it and seen the
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.320]   presentation were much more skeptical than those of us who held one. And it's not unusual for a
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.440]   technology not to be the appeal of it not to be apparent until you use it. And then you go oh
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:40.000]   it is magical. Yeah. So I'm now okay I you know I've been very skeptical of glass I may I may have
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.120]   to rethink this. I may not get it because unfortunately Google's being somewhat restrictive
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:52.800]   about who can have it. So Kevin you didn't buy one when you were at Google I/O.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.800]   I didn't because I was there impersonating you. So see on I wish you had now.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:03.120]   No it didn't work. So you had to like show more from the idea and give them a credit card that
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.200]   had the same name on it and stuff. So this is going to work. So what we did what I did is
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.440]   Jason Howell was there from all about Andrew I'd producer of TNT and I said Jason get it
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:19.040]   and I'll pay for it. Well it looks like I'm never going to see it because it's now tied to Jason
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:26.240]   right. Google's being very finicky about they they're preventing loaning of it even right.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.400]   Yeah you can't even you can't give it to someone you can they'll say they'll turn it off. They'll
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.600]   say we have the ability to turn off the device if you do this if you give it to someone else or
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:39.920]   loan it or give it to anybody. We will turn off the device is what it says in the terms of service
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.360]   that you have to agree to. I don't like this at all.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.840]   Is this just for the Explorer edition or you feel like this is going to be the case going forward.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.880]   You can't do that with something people buy for real. Yeah.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:59.200]   I feel like $300 is buying it for real. I do too. That's the thing is if you pay $1,500 for a
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.160]   device like this granted it's for early access and stuff but I just I mean that really roused me
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.120]   the wrong way to say we will turn off your device if someone else you know signs into it or logs on
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:15.040]   with it. It's within their rights because right because you're well I've you know I've had
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.720]   prototype events like this before but that was for prototypes where you weren't actually wearing
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:24.640]   them in public. You know we need work I've had prototypes map all when I you know before I
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.400]   worked there which meant that I couldn't we couldn't take them out of the room and things
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.800]   and I've had prototypes from game game development companies we could do early access to a console
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.520]   where you get some like version of a console isn't finished yet and they have these kinds of
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.000]   things but it's a bit weird applying to something that is actually being all around in public and
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.960]   walking around with it. You know you know my initial reaction is maybe this is to prevent a lot of
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.360]   scalping on eBay because people have tried to sell it for thousands of dollars on eBay.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.760]   And it sounds like this thing is just not ready. I mean Tim was saying there are certain things
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.360]   you can do like you can't call someone and choose their phone number if they have a home number
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.440]   and a mobile number set up. He had trouble and I think he had trouble getting SMS. I mean he said
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.760]   this is this is a lot the Explorer edition is pretty pretty buggy and clearly not ready for
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.320]   consumer adoption so part of it might be just like hey you know we we want to give it to developers.
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.520]   I mean when I was standing in line at Google I/O last year to sign up for Glass the woman there
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.560]   the Google representative was saying us you know just so you know this is for people who you know
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.520]   are actually going to develop on the device and what are you guys going to do with it this is
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:33.520]   for academic or research purposes only. She was really really stressing that this was not about
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.880]   playing with a new toy. It feels like they loosened up on it though they released that commercial of
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:44.400]   you know the ballerina and the bubbles and the kid and maybe it seemed much more consumer friendly
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.880]   but I think this Explorer edition is actually just I think they're trying to get developers to
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.480]   build for it. I wish they would say that though I mean if you look at the terms of service on the
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:57.120]   Google website I mean it doesn't say like this is an early adopter thing this is a review unit it
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.520]   doesn't say anything like that it's just glass terms of sale so by purchasing the device this is
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:07.120]   what you agree to. But it isn't a gather a review unit it is for developers and of course I want to
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:12.080]   use it as a review unit. Yeah yeah right. And that's the point I think that they're trying to do a
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.120]   developer release and so this agreement looks like what you get when you've got prototype hardware.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:23.760]   Although remember now when they did the contest on Twitter they didn't make
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:29.840]   people be developers. Oh yeah so I suspect you know they've they're dancing back and forth with it.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.880]   But I have to point out that despite the fact that I have a lower number
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:41.440]   well Jason has a lower number than either Scoble or Drew Olenoff both of whom have received their
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:48.080]   glass that they did in fact jump to journalists ahead in line. Scoble and Olenoff are not developing
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:53.280]   for it they're journalists and they're posting like crazy on Google plus pictures from glass.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:58.640]   I would be surprised if this is an internal struggle at Google between marketing and
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:05.120]   engineering. I'm a little pissed off because yeah we pay you know we we lined up I mean at least
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:11.200]   Jason should have it. I can live with that. Okay I take back what I said before there is
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:17.440]   the vice specific addendum in the addendum it does specifically say glass explorer edition right and
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.520]   that's where they give those. I doubt very much they would do this with the commercial versions
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:26.320]   when they sell it next year. So this must only apply to the early versions. Still it kind of stinks.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.160]   I mean it's got to be like a phone right you signed in with your Google account right I mean
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.240]   I mean this is the thing if you have the floor edition and someone says hey can I try it I mean
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.520]   you hand it to a person you sort of you're signed into your Google account. Other person
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.720]   wearing them sort of has a full access to your account. It's like trying someone else's phone
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:49.920]   when they are signed into all their stuff but even more personal. So I mean it just seems like
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:53.600]   it seems like the production edition is going to let you know other people sign into the
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.200]   sign in the device but the explorer edition they just want to they want to keep it mapped to the
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:03.920]   people who who got in and you know if I had glass contest Leo it was focused on what would you do
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.640]   with glass. I mean granted the bot who chose the winners was obviously completely arbitrary.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:14.640]   I mean I'm not saying that the implementation was right but they framed the contest you know in
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:21.200]   like what would you do. But not as a developer. Right. Not as a developer. So to me that's proof
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:27.840]   positive that this program is not just for developers. Yeah they're looking for lots of cool
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:31.840]   videos and different uses that they haven't thought of right and they want celebrities like
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.640]   Neil Patrick Harris doing the live tour backstage at How I Met Your Mother and you know that kind of
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:42.720]   right. I'll do a live tour backstage at Twig. Well I'm not going to get one apparently and
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.680]   now that Jason is busy with a new baby I doubt very much he'll kill. He's the one who I mean I
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.840]   you know I'll pay for Jason if you're watching I'll pay for it wear it I can't wear it no one
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.480]   else can wear it but you wear it take pictures of Savannah but not of Stacey because that's not nice.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:04.560]   Anyway I understand people's upset but I think it's if you say this is a very you know you're
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:10.080]   saying it upfront if they were then to do this next year and say oh yeah you buy it you use it no
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:17.520]   that's not going to happen. That probably is illegal right. Isn't it? You can't say to somebody you
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.080]   can buy something but well maybe that's exactly what terms of service for software and books and
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:27.120]   digital. Yeah. First our doctor replies to physical codes it doesn't apply to the account you have
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:32.720]   attached to it so they can they can still cut you off. Don't we didn't didn't court say though that
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:37.520]   for instance with CDs because the record industry would love to kill the resale or it's too late now
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:43.200]   but for some years would have loved to kill the resale of CDs and tried and the courts said no no
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.880]   you can resell something you have. Right but there's a court case going on about resale of MP3s
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.920]   which is much messier. That's different that's digital. It's completely different. Yeah. This is a
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:58.400]   physical code. This is a physical good. Yeah but you can take every bit off the CD and get a
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:03.920]   perfect copy of it. Well the courts still ruled that you that you can resell CDs and nobody can
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:10.800]   stop you. Yes. So I think that that's pretty obvious but not MP3s. Not MP3s because it's pure
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:17.040]   digital. Well do you think Eric misspoke or do you think that we're really waiting till next year
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:22.400]   for glass? I think it would be a mistake for them to wait. I mean they've got all the problems.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.200]   Well they might have to. They might have to. You're right but I mean I think that it would be if
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.400]   there's a way to avoid that or if there's any way to accelerate the development.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.560]   And I think that they're it's in their best interest to do that with all of this great buzz
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.720]   they're getting right now. There may be other things that come out in the meantime. You know
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.680]   that right now they've got this niche and they can either they can either fill that niche or
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.800]   someone else is going to do it. I've already I mean you how many knockoffs have you seen a
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.120]   glass? I mean they're not the same but I mean I've seen like at least five knockoffs. You can't wait
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.000]   too long. You can't. The market moves fast. And it seems I have to say let me ask the chat room.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.080]   The glass as it stands given all you know whatever flaws people are talking about is
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.160]   something people would want not at the fifteen hundred bucks. No. What's the price point? But I
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.920]   would think that you would all buy it if it were say three ninety nine. Three ninety nine was
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:13.680]   exactly the figure in my head. I'd buy it. Yeah I would probably go to five. I would go as high as
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.160]   like high end smartphone. Yeah fifteen hundred's way too much but but three ninety nine I could see.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:24.160]   Uh chat room saying yes they buy it. And a lot you know some people say three ninety
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:29.280]   nine is too much others say that's about right. I think for first generation I think that's
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:33.360]   that's that's a that's right on for me anyway. And I think it's going to be hard to make less
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:38.000]   expensive. Maybe not. We don't know what it is. I think over time they'll be able to get the price
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.480]   down right. But yeah it's not it's not got anything particularly magical in it. It's just got what
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:48.160]   about that screen is that magical? Um I don't think so. Compane of the screen on the phone you're
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.200]   holding your hands. No. So it's just a little LCD screen with a prism. I mean how is it? Yeah it's
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.240]   it's it's way way lower res. It's kind of you know it's got a slightly higher image than it's
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.360]   didn't that but yeah it's even it's tiny. It's more easy to make. Right. Easy to make small LCDs.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:09.680]   They've been putting these into wearable. This technology has been around for a long time.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.920]   Maybe not quite to the quality that they're using but there's been technology around for
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:19.840]   quite a while where they project that image. I remember back in 2002 I was looking into wearable
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.560]   technology and they had an available then. So that's so hard. Yeah I mean the challenge is
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:29.280]   doing it brightly enough that it's not like you don't have to work over was completely over your
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.040]   eyes like a like a plastic VR set up. So you've got something that's bright enough that works
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.680]   in overlay. Right. Right. So that's all the sensors. Yeah. You know that's that's pretty
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.520]   important. All the sensors that they put into it to do potentially the eye blink take a picture
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:46.720]   thing which may or may not be available. Those types of things I think were not definitely
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:52.000]   were not available and just just recently the sensor technology has really gone crazy.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:22:00.800]   So well we'll see. You know all will be revealed in time. I didn't know Facebook was doing this.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   Facebook is using a new image format developed at Google called WebP. It is not compatible with
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:13.280]   JPEG and it's making some people a little irate supposedly web and you know who's it's good we've
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:18.400]   got you on Kevin because you're an expert on standards and so forth and I imagine you know a
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:25.520]   little bit about this WebP is but you know why would you want to replace JPEGs is it smaller?
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:33.520]   Um it's potentially it's small. Yeah I'm not quite sure what you know JPEG is a fairly old spec
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:38.320]   it has certain artifacts that are built in and WebP has picked up something slightly you know some
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:44.400]   newer stuff. They say it's faster too. Um it's I guess that means it's smaller. Yeah.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:49.200]   You get a slightly better compression. I think you don't get a lot of benefit from it really.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.400]   Right. You don't get a great deal of compression doesn't follow Moore's thought. It's almost the
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.360]   opposite. Um we've we've got a thousand times faster computers than we're when we were using
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.320]   JPEGs and yet we can't compress more than two to one better. So it compression is actually really
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:09.760]   hard and also horribly tied up with patterns. So there isn't a lot of massive improvement in that.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:16.240]   Compression follows Zeno's law not Moore's law. Remember Zeno's paradox? You get halfway there
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.920]   and halfway there and halfway there. You never reach the end. Very good. Yeah. That's about right.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:27.040]   It's true. I mean and WebP I haven't looked at it in detail. My understanding is it's kind of
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.880]   similar to what they're doing with the video the Google video stuff and just a still version of
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.800]   that. So it's just the interframe version of that without without any difference frames.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:45.280]   Um what they what they use as an example is complex very complex ish images. Water seems to
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.480]   come up a lot and they say they're more accurate when the image is complex. I'll tell you I'm looking
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:56.160]   side by side. If you're watching the video you are too left is JPEG right is WebP. I can't tell
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:01.440]   a difference. I just don't see a difference in that example. But is one much smaller than the
[00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:06.720]   other? Yeah. If that's the case then that would make a difference. Yeah. Those are identical fairly
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:13.200]   identical images. So well and then it's recompressed back into JPEG. Oh and this is a JPEG. I assume
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:22.960]   I mean I can. Oh yeah you know why? Because only only Chrome can read a WebP. So if you're if
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:30.640]   you're using any other browser uh you. Oh Chrome and Opera Opera supports WebP.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.560]   I haven't actually I don't understand why they why they're doing this. There are other you know
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:40.240]   there are other compression techniques that are more interesting. JPEG 2000 stuff that's actually
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:47.280]   wavelet based and therefore has the ability to um download the first part and give you a particular
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.400]   resolution and keep down on to get higher resolutions. And that would be something that would start
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.840]   to make sense. Now you've got to build a page that works on um different pixel and states. If you
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:25:02.400]   got to make it work on your shiny new phone with 400 whatever it is DPI and an old phone that is
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.440]   72 DPI um then having something that lets you download higher resolution once over time will be
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:14.480]   better. And that's where we've had that for 10, 12 years with JPEG 2000. What about ping? They sometimes
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.440]   say this is a comparable to ping PNG because it does have apparently has transparency which ping
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:24.560]   has. Right. What I what I understand from WebP is that it's a combination of basically it's a
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:30.000]   combination of JPEG and PNG. So you get the good compression of JPEG but you're still able to
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:38.400]   support things like transparency with which PNG PNGs were placing. So you can do transparency with
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:42.960]   PNG but you can't do transparency with JPEG. So this is kind of a balance in between and and
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:48.640]   the alpha channel. Is that it? Yeah. They you get an alpha channel as well and it's a 45%
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:56.720]   reduction in size when starting with a PNG and then transcoding that into WebP. So there could
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.240]   be of course it's going to depend on the image and blah blah blah but you know there could be a
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:04.800]   significant savings. The issue though is if you go to Facebook and you're using Chrome or Opera
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.480]   Facebook delivers you not a JPEG but a WebP image which you could download but you can't open
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:14.240]   anything and that's kind of you know there's this why we have standards.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:21.440]   This from this article good article by the way from Stephen Shankland on a CNET.
[00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:28.000]   We have some images and I'm going to have to open these in Chrome. This is an image of Sunflowers.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.960]   First let me open the JPEG and then open the WebP and I have to do this in Chrome.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.640]   Here's and this is from Facebook. So this is a JPEG version of Sunflowers
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:46.720]   which looks quite lovely and this is the Web. I'm switching back and forth but as you can see
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:53.440]   there's no difference. Now here's the key. The one on the right is about half the size of the
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:27:00.640]   one on the left. So now you see why. Remember Facebook's serving lots of images. I don't know
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:08.640]   what the so the those two images were 159k for the JPEG and 103k for the WebP. That's pretty good.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:14.640]   Here's you know we've had other compression algorithms over the years that were better at
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:21.200]   this kind of thing. So the JPEG 2000. And by the way all browsers support JPEG 2000 right?
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:27.760]   I'm not sure. It seems that what JPEG 2000 support is pretty widespread. I've seen it around for a
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:32.800]   long time. It's been around for a while but I think there's still some lurking pattern crap that
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:38.720]   means it's not there. Interesting and I presume that Google's other argument for WebP is that
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:45.680]   encumbered. It's like WebM. Yeah. Yeah. That's the point is it's not encumbered. So here look at
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:52.640]   this one. This is a JPEG compared to WebP. This is almost 50% smaller file in the WebP. And again
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:58.800]   as I flip back and forth I don't see any shift at all. Maybe at a higher resolution I might but
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   that's you could see why Facebook would want to do this. That's saving them 50% bandwidth.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   But the browsers don't all support it. Only Chrome and Opera. And worse of all of course
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.600]   you download this and try to open it in Photoshop and it's going to go ahead.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.840]   Yeah but that's easily fixable. You can get a plug in the Photoshop.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:24.560]   But yeah, JPEG 2000 has got Safari as well. I'm not sure if it's got support in everything.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.120]   Google has added a WebP except header support to Chrome.
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:37.440]   So if I enhance. So this is the waves. Now this is the waves on the JPEG.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:42.720]   Okay. This is the waves on the macro blocking on the web macro blocking difference.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:48.160]   Right. You see a lot of junkie. So this is of course when I am zoomed in very far.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:53.760]   Right. So here's let me and then that's where you see it is in the solid. Right. So JPEG
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:29:02.000]   WebP Kevin Marx is leaning in to his laptop as if you'd be able to see that over the stream.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.720]   You won't be able to get it. This is like the TV adverts where they show you look how good this
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:16.800]   screen is. Right. Only as good as your TV. Exactly. Yeah. I mean the reality is that 99.9%
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:21.680]   of Facebook users are not trying to open these images in Photoshop or an external viewer. They're
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:27.360]   not going to view it at a size that's larger than the browser window. Right. I mean this is huge
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:32.720]   savings for Facebook and it's going to affect a very small percentage of designers or whatever
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.840]   who are perfectly capable of downloading the plugin. I mean it's a little weird but I imagine
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:44.160]   that they save billions of dollars. Yeah. No. This is not insignificant for Facebook and
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.760]   but as you say we could they could have chosen JPEG 2000.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:55.440]   So I don't know why they didn't. And I'm sorry. Did you say JPEG 2000 was
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.920]   encumbered or unencumbered? He says slightly encumbered. I think it's still encumbered. I am.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.840]   I'm not sure. I'd have to go and read a bunch of stuff. Who owns JPEG?
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:10.800]   No one anymore because the the patterns have expired. Okay. So it's not like and it's the joint
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:16.000]   photographic experts group. It's a group. Right. But it's old. It's like mid 80s. So sold and nobody
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:23.440]   cares. Yeah. But JPEG 2000 was obviously ratified. I think it was ratified in 99 and has
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.720]   as a few leftover patterns. A couple of years left though and then we're done. 20 years right.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:35.360]   Yeah. It should be. But you can get submarine bastards who come and get you. I'm becoming such
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:40.800]   an expert on patent law lately. I don't know why. But the difference between JPEG 2000 and the
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:47.440]   point of it is is that it uses what they call wavelet encoding which means you encode a sort of
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:53.120]   low-resversity image first and then you successively encode differences of that as a sort of
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:58.640]   higher frequency components you add in. But also the file format has designed such that
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.440]   you can stop reading any point and you've decoded that level of the image. And if you then read a
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.360]   bit more, you decode the next level. Oh, that's interesting. Which means you can now really
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:11.840]   say bandwidth. So the theory of that was you could, you know, just as you get, you could have
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.120]   progressive JPEGs that kind of do that, but actually have several copies in this would
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.840]   give you part of the image and let you stop. But the problem is you have to know where to stop.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.960]   And that's which means you've got to have your renderer in the fetch loop, which is not really
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:33.760]   how the browsers work. So it's sort of it's a sort of it was a solution to that problem that
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:39.920]   but it was designed 15 years ago. And it doesn't actually solve the practical problem of no,
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.840]   I wanted just wanted load the low-res one at this point because you don't have to wait to stop.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.640]   You actually have to be decoding on your read thread, which is not how the browsers tend to be
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.840]   on. Yeah, you remember those bad old days where you'd go to a web page, it'd be a
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:56.800]   progressive download and the picture would be ugly and then slowly get better and better.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.640]   I don't miss those days. We can do without that. Thank you very much.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:05.440]   Right. But the point would be that this is the challenge we've got with web design at the moment,
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:10.160]   which is because the pixel density of the device is varies so much. A lot.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:16.080]   Yeah, by by, you know, factors of, you know, this phone is over 460 TPI.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:21.360]   Right. So, you know, what do you do to that? One answer is you use SVG, like I was saying a couple
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:27.360]   of weeks ago, which is which is a really good answer because it works everywhere. And it literally
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.480]   does work everywhere because all the browser mobile users supported. But the if you actually
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:38.000]   have an image like that, you know, that you want to want to have extra crispness in,
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.400]   then you end up having to store multiple versions of it and making that work on the web is still a
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:49.840]   little bit messy. Google find a hundred, fifty, forty five thousand euros by Germany.
[00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:55.120]   We talked a little bit about this on security now and how absurd this was. This goes way back to
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:01.520]   the Google Street View cars collecting Wi-Fi little snippets of Wi-Fi information. One of the
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:07.680]   ways, one of the things Street View was doing, quite reasonably, I think, was mapping its GPS to match
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:14.400]   access points open and closed because then they can do a skyhook style triangulation service that
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:19.280]   doesn't require GPS. They could say, ah, I see four access points. This one's this strength,
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:22.400]   this one's this strength. I know where you are. And it's actually a really good service. You have
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:26.480]   it in your phone. Apple's doing the same thing. There was a company as I said, so I'll call Skyhook
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:32.160]   that was doing this. Google's mistake and it was a mistake I'm convinced was that in the process of
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:37.120]   looking at these Wi-Fi signals, they were capturing a packet or two of data and saving it.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:42.720]   I'm not in any attempt to snoop because in most cases it was encrypted. And if it wasn't, well,
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.680]   then somebody was sending it through the air unencrypted anyway. And I think even they said that
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:52.880]   this was this was one guy, the guy who was writing some of the software did this. The bigger Google
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.280]   didn't even know it was going on at the time. In fact, it was the bigger Google that notified
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:03.360]   Germany and others. Oh, we made a mistake. Sorry about that. Well, this has been going on for a
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:12.000]   couple of years. This was happened in 2008 to 2010. And Hamburg data regulator Johannes Kaspar,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.240]   who had reopened the probe after prosecutors dropped the case, the criminal case last year.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.960]   In my view, this is one of the biggest data protection rules violations known.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:28.080]   Internal control mechanisms have said, oh, no, that was Google. They probably didn't say that
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:33.200]   in a German accent. Internal control mechanisms must have severely failed said Google. And so
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.320]   Johannes said, well, I don't care. You're going to give me 145,000 euros, which is 189.
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.080]   I really wish Jeff was just for the story.
[00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:49.760]   Oh, my son Zhechrock, $189,230. It's cigarette money. This is money in Larry Page's sofa cushion.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:57.040]   However, come on. You know, that's just a blatant grab for it. We want some money.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:03.040]   Yeah, it doesn't surprise in saying there where how the money's going to get distributed, right?
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:07.440]   Is it going to get distributed? Not the victims. Oh, here's your free dollars.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.280]   If you produce this to improve the infrastructure of the city of Hamburg.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:16.480]   I don't know. They didn't say I doubt very much they're giving it to charity.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:23.600]   French regulators levied a hundred thousand year old penalty in 2011. I'm sure Google kind of
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:29.760]   is not happy about this. But at the same time, at least it's over. And it isn't really a lot of
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:35.200]   money. I don't know how many minutes of or seconds of AdSense revenue. I'd be $9,000.
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:38.800]   They spent on lawyers for it. Say for I'm sure. Oh, yeah, the lawyers. That's right. You know what?
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.120]   That's the real expense. The millions and lawyers. They knew they did. And, you know,
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:47.280]   yeah, they're going to pay, right? They'll pay a little fine. And I've served my time, man.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:54.720]   Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Keep your eye on the sparrow. Google's airport
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:36:01.920]   dreams take off. San Jose private terminal approved. You'd think having a Hindenburg size
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.920]   blimp hanger would be enough for Google. But no.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:15.440]   They were the big people behind adding an elite, according to the San Jose Mercury News,
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:22.960]   elite corporate jet center at San Jose International Airport. They rent right now,
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:28.640]   they rent space. Oh, it's pretty. They rent space for the private jets of which they have numerous
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:34.160]   at is it Moffat Field where the blimp hangers? Yeah. Yeah. You see it when you drive down one
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.440]   one. You know, that's actually right next door to Google. Yeah. That's the thing. I don't
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.200]   understand. Man, it's worried about losing the government contract. It's controversial.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.480]   Well, it could be. I mean, there says they're leases up and they've got to find someplace else.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.840]   So so building elite. It's too bad though, because it is. It's like right next door to Google's
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.680]   headquarters. I'm sure it's way more convenient than driving down to San Jose airport. But
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:57.520]   well, they probably what they'll do is they'll store a helicopter at the Google campus that gets
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:03.520]   them to the airport. Then of course, when you got more money than right Europe.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:10.720]   So I told you my business idea. This was speedboat service from San Francisco Airport to
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.840]   Facebook and Google headquarters because they're both on the water. Cigarette boats.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:17.920]   Richard Branson. I love that.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:24.000]   Is this a business idea or? This is just like,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:30.480]   it's I was just amused by how it takes to get from San SFO to Google or Facebook when you fly
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.320]   over them to land there. Right. Right. You could just drop us out of the airplane right here.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:39.440]   We'll get out of here. Let's give me a parachute. I think some Google Glasser use on the way down.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.760]   I often think that when I fly south because I fly over Petaluma, if I fly down from Seattle,
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.040]   say, I'm home. I'm right here. Just let me out. Just open the door.
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:53.920]   82 million dollar facility to be on the west side of Manetta San Jose International Airport.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:38:02.480]   Not really any any dissent. Some people didn't like the noise idea and so forth. The airport
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:06.880]   gets three million dollars in rent. That helps pay for the construction.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:12.560]   Is it just a big construction project down there? I wonder how many Google employees fly private
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:16.320]   jets. Oh, it's just it's just Larry and Sergey. Maybe you're Eric.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:23.920]   It's private. Private small planes probably more. This is corporate though. Right. This is
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:28.640]   these are these are G threes and G sixes and that kind of thing. I never got to do it.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.840]   When I was working at Procter and Gamble, my management did, they would take the corporate
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:36.240]   jet. If they had a meaning that he'd be at in Brussels very quickly, they would say,
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.760]   hey, is the corporate jet available? And like five of them would get on it. It didn't have to be like
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.600]   the president of the C and G or CEO of P and G. They would just get on and go because it was
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.520]   cheaper. I mean, they've got crews sitting there, manning the, you know, maintaining the jets.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.760]   And so it was cheaper for them just to get on the corporate jet and go. So there of the seven
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:59.280]   hangers, five will be used by Google, the company blue sitting holdings, manages aircraft for Larry
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:05.120]   Page, Sergey Brann and Google's chairman Eric Schmidt. Their private jets are now at Moffat Field.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:09.040]   By the way, they have more than one as I remember, Larry has a couple three, maybe four. We don't
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:15.520]   know. It's hard to count. The real problem. You can't fly more than one and at one time.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:23.600]   Because you can. Because you have family and friends who may be flying somewhere else.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.920]   And I'm sure they're used for the other executives and stuff.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.080]   It must be a nice feeling though. You see, you know, hey, can I have the jet this afternoon?
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:35.040]   I'd like to fly to Brussels. I'll take the blue one today. Yeah, I'm in the mood for blue
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.920]   Park my pink batmobile.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:46.320]   While I do that, thanks. The only issue is that there is there is a curfew, a flight curfew to
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:51.360]   protect residents 1130 p.m. to 630 a.m. for the airport. And there's some concern that
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:57.520]   these private flights might go during off curfew hours. There's no evidence that that's
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.800]   yeah, they said they're not doing that. No. You know, if you got it, flaunt it.
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:14.400]   Let's see. The birds agree. Tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet. Tweet, tweet. I like San Jose airport.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:19.600]   It's a nice one. If you can fly out of it, you know, I often think I should I should be. It's
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:24.960]   pretty. It's empty. Yeah, like most of San Jose, you go to San Jose, you go, is anybody live here?
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.800]   Because it's a beautiful city, but the streets of dessert is like a zombie plague hit it a couple
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.520]   of years ago and nothing. Is it? Am I wrong? No, I agree. I completely. They have light rail,
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.720]   but it's always empty. You know, there's these trains going by. There's not even a driver.
[00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.120]   Unless it's rush hour. I mean, unless I guess I think that's what it is. Everybody's inside
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:45.840]   working. So hard trying to keep the economy. Well, the other other way thing about San Jose is
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:50.640]   if you look at it, if you go up, look at it from above, it looks like trees because
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.920]   it was all orchards and they kept a lot of the trees. I mean, none of the buildings very high
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:02.320]   except downtown. So it's very odd. Primarily, prune orchards. In fact, the big mall in San Jose is
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:09.120]   called the Prune Yard. Yeah. But it's you know, I live in San Jose for a few years is where I started
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:13.840]   my career on radio and I actually enjoyed living there. I was there in the, um,
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:19.440]   must have been the late 70s, early 80s during the, you know, Apple boom. It was just it was really
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:23.760]   exciting time to live there. But I go back there now and you know, you go to the computer museum.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:28.160]   There's some, it's a beautiful little town. And it just feels like it's, it's kind of quiet.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:32.560]   It is, it is pretty strange. You know, I don't know if it's overbuilt or what.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:37.200]   The climate's lovely. I mean, I think it expanded at the wrong time. Yeah. And so it's very,
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:42.720]   very spread out and suburban and very hard to get anywhere without driving. Right. And the
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:48.080]   downtown doesn't really make much sense. Mr. Mike said owning a jet for Larry Page is like me
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:54.320]   owning a used huffy that I got from Goodwill. It's just a couple of bucks. Give me a jet.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:42:01.280]   It's a good, I think that's an apt analogy and probably pretty accurate.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:10.320]   Google has a new ad size, richer user engagement, they say, which means you can't avoid it.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:17.440]   It is 970 pixels tall. No, why? I'm sorry by 90 pixels tall.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:22.880]   So it's fitting my browser. No, 970 is pretty wide, isn't it?
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:28.640]   I think I thought 960 was this standard. I know it's probably non standard. Yeah.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:34.000]   Yeah, it's interesting. Maybe I'm wrong. I thought 960 was the standard width though.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.800]   Well, how, how wide is your, I guess on modern screens. I mean, you're assuming it's going to be
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:45.360]   no more than 10, no smaller than 1024. Nobody runs 800 by 600 screens anymore.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:52.320]   Except me. Well, no, what I do is I run the browser in part of my screen and I have another
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:57.600]   window open on the left. That's right. That's right. I'm not a, you shouldn't assume people are going
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.400]   full screen. No, that's right. And that means everyone's, you know, half the pages that are
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.160]   stupidly designed end up getting scrollbars on the bottom, including Google.
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.760]   Because they've assumed that, oh, if you're on a computer, you must have 1024 pixels wide. No,
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:18.480]   I didn't want to fall screen you today. Right. And it's frustrating. But, but is,
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.320]   is this really new? Is it going to be care about this? No, I don't care. I just, I look at,
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.600]   it's in the rundown. I'm reading it. We're going to take a break. Let's talk. All right. You know
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:28.880]   what's in the news? It should be in the news. Google now on your homepage. I like this.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:35.600]   I can't wait. But first, a word from squarespace.com when you're talking about websites and well
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:40.160]   designed websites, squarespace leaps to mind why because they're all their designs and they

[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.280]   why I'd like to give a coupon for my product? And then I say, I have to call the engineers,
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:47.440]   we'll have it, you know, in a few hours. Oh, with squarespace, you go and click a box. It's done.

[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:08.240]   website. They've got a API based importers from blogger and wordpress and type pad.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.680]   Really? And by the way, the import is amazing.
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:16.000]   Imports all the links that SEO has preserved, all the images, even all the comments.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.760]   So if you want to see what your page would look like at squarespace within, you know,
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:25.120]   15 minutes, you can. It's very easy to do. And by the way, and another great thing I love about
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:31.840]   this, this is, you know, done right. So your content is separate from your design. You can try another
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:35.520]   template, another template, you can go through all the templates with the same content, kind of
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:40.720]   like a Zen garden, right? CSS Zen garden. So you just, oh, it looks nice. Oh, nice. And then drag
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.920]   and drop. You don't have to know any code. If you are a JavaScript or a CSS coder, they've got a
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:51.200]   great developer platform with a, you know, syntax, color coding and the editor and all of that stuff.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.880]   Just everything you want. I'm telling you, including this great e-commerce.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.280]   And then so go and try it for two weeks. You don't need to give them a credit card. If you decide,
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:04.480]   hey, you know, I kind of like this. I could, I could live with this. Take a look at the pricing.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:09.920]   $8 for the standard plan. $16 for the unlimited plan. That means unlimited bandwidth. You'll
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:15.040]   never get a bandwidth bill on limited pages and galleries and blogs, unlimited storage and limited
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:21.760]   contributors. If you buy the annual plan at $16 a month and they'll throw in a custom domain name,
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:27.120]   register for it, you for it and hook it up and all of that. Now, if you want the e-commerce,
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:33.200]   it's only $24 a month for the annual plan. It's amazing. Amazing. Squarespace.com.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.480]   Look, if you're looking for a new website or maybe you want a better host on your old website,
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.640]   you owe it to yourself, at least try it. Squarespace.com. If you decide to buy,

[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:58.240]   You don't need this offer code until you decide to buy and then use it though, if you would. Twig
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:04.080]   and the number four. We thank them for their support of this week in Google. I'm excited. I
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:09.040]   can't wait. When are we going to get Google now in our browsers? I already am a huge fan of Google
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:15.600]   now on my smartphone. And I guess there's code in here. Yeah, this is, I love when these leaks happen
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:20.080]   because somebody's going through Google source code. It looks like somebody found a page and
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:24.720]   viewed the source and found some JavaScript that seemed to indicate that that Google now is going
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:30.080]   to come to the home screen. You can see some JavaScript, some variables here, string variables,
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:33.680]   and say, Google now uses your home location to show relevant information, like weather traffic
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:38.240]   conditions and nearby places. You can set your home location, set your work location. This is all
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.480]   familiar to those of us running it on Android, which I am. I don't know when this is going to
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:47.760]   show up. We don't really know what it's going to look like. But it looks like the code is there.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:53.120]   We've got a couple stories like this where code is embedded. Yeah, like code is indicated that
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:58.160]   something is kind of on its way. So I guess this is a page, Google operating system, the blog,
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:04.480]   reported on this. This is a page hosted on Google somewhere, which looks like it's been pulled.
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.920]   We're sorry. There's no such thing.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:12.000]   Maybe no attention to a 1% test or something. So they need to host it.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.120]   Yeah, this is not the now you're looking for. This is an old school Google error page, by the way.
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:24.560]   Wow. This looks like Google circa 2004. So I don't know what it's coming, but it seems like
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:30.000]   Google now is kind of like the obvious, the direction that things are going, design-wise,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:37.440]   and product-wise. Yeah, there was a leak a couple of weeks ago I saw on Google Plus,
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:42.720]   from a Google employee that said, if you know the address of the Google now server, you can
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:46.960]   actually get it to work in Chrome. Oh, but yeah, in the about flags, right? There's a
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:52.560]   in the there's a flag you can set in Chrome, right? Yeah, exactly. Local storage. You have to set
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:57.360]   local storage to a certain URL. But the problem is like not very many people actually know because
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.640]   the servers aren't they're in development right now. So you have to know like you have to be in
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.920]   Google and know what the addresses are. But you can get it working in Chrome, apparently,
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.320]   if you know what that super secret address is. So I'm really excited about it. I think it makes
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:13.840]   total sense, especially with some of the services that are going away, like reader and iGoogle and
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:19.360]   things to have this be the or one of the solutions to replace those things that are going away, I
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:25.440]   think is great. Google now seems to be one service that Google has had great that everybody
[00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:31.200]   universally likes. And when when I first heard about it, I thought, Oh, this is going to scare
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.760]   people because it's based on stuff Google knows about you from your email. So it'll if you get an
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:41.680]   email confirming a flight, it'll put the information in Google now or if you search for the San Francisco
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.440]   Giants, it'll put ball scores in you. And I thought, Oh, people are going to be a little
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:50.320]   concerned about the pro and nobody is because it's so useful. And so it really, really illustrates
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.760]   is you give me some value. I don't mind if you take some information. Just give me some value for
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:59.840]   it. And I think this is a great product from Google that really will help them convince people.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.800]   It's all about glass, Leo, like they announced Google now and Google glass or they talked about
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.120]   them kind of back to back at Google last year. And it was so obvious. Like, it seems so obvious to
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:13.680]   me that Google now was going to be the interface for glass at this idea of like just in time,
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:18.640]   context really relevant alerts, which show up in your heads up display makes complete sense. And
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:23.440]   even the mirror API guidelines now, you can see the cards look very similar to to the Google now
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:28.800]   cards. So yeah, let's hope, you know, maybe Google now people really like Google now that the
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:34.800]   transition to glass, you know, won't be as scary. Some speculation that Google's acquisition of this
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:43.440]   company, wavy for $30 million is also for Google now. It's a summary. It's a natural language
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:47.760]   processing does some summary stuff. Apparently, Apple and Google were both bidding for the Seattle
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:51.440]   startup startup. That's where you want to be in a bidding war between Apple and Google.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:01.440]   The smile on the CEO's face and he just comes out of that. Yeah, I can't really lose, can you?
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:10.240]   So wavy, maybe a little bit better than for Google now than Siri according to TechCrunch
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:16.800]   should be interesting. They had raised a mere $2 million in angel funding. And so it sounds like
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:22.640]   it's a bit of profit there. Nice. Nice. Nice. What do they call that? There must be a phrase for
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.160]   venture capitalists have for that. Ten bagger. A ten bagger.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:31.120]   Ten times what you put in the ten bagger. Wow.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:36.160]   Which I guess is a take off on the baseball for bagger, which is a home run, right? Because you hit
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:42.880]   each ten bagger. I think it's time to play some trumpets. What do you think Chad? Should we get
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:52.560]   ready for the Google change log? I just said that. I got to remember not to say that.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:52:00.960]   Gina, Japani here for our change log. Google launched a new app this week called One Today.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:05.680]   It's an invitation only pilot program in the US only. So you have to have an invitation to
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:13.600]   actually use it. You can go to google.com/OneToday, one spelled out, One Today to sign up for an
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:18.400]   invitation. I haven't got an invitation yet, but the app is available in the play store. It's
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:25.760]   called One Today. It's a way to feature charitable causes, charity organizations, and let users very
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:34.080]   easily donate a dollar. One dollar today to a cause that they inspire by. I kind of really like
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:38.400]   this. This is kind of right in line with Google. They're sort of a philanthropic organization. I
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:43.200]   really like the idea that each day a different cause gets featured. You can donate a dollar. It's
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.240]   got to be, I'm sure that it's going to be tied to your Google wallet account. I'm sure that it's
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:50.160]   going to be as easy as an in-app purchase. It's social as well. I'm not really sure how this is
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:55.200]   going to work, but I think it's going to be tied into Google+ circles. If all of your friends
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.920]   donate a buck, four of your friends donate a buck to a charitable cause, you can match their
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:04.480]   donation as well. There's a little bit of crowdsourcing social. There's a social aspect in there.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:09.680]   We were joking about this last night on all about Android. It's kind of crazy that you have to
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:14.640]   get on a wait list in order to donate your money, but they must be just trying to beta testing this
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:19.440]   out or alpha testing this out with new nonprofit organizations. I just love this. I think that this
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:25.760]   could be a really cool platform for raising money for good causes. Go check that out at google.com/1
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:33.200]   today. Other big launch this week, Google+ comments for any website. Well, I shouldn't say that. It's
[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:39.840]   not for any website. Google has launched Google+ comments for a blogger blogs. Just enabled those.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:45.120]   If you have a blogger blog, you can see Google+ comments on the blog. This is pretty cool. We
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:49.760]   know how this works. Facebook comments, Facebook has had this for a while. Similar deal with Google+
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:54.400]   comments. Someone can come to your website and comment on the content right there on your website.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:59.040]   So when you embed this on your page, you've got a little input box to comment. If people on Google+
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:04.880]   are discussing your webpage on Google+, you'll also see that activity on your webpage, which is
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:09.920]   really nice. People can comment publicly, which everyone can see those comments. Or people can
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:15.120]   comment on your stuff privately or to only particular circles. And of course, the author of the webpage
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:19.520]   can only see the comments that they're allowed to see. So people who have had them in their circles.
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:24.640]   So this is looking pretty cool. I mean, we've been sort of waiting for this, I think, for a while.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:30.160]   Google has only released this for a blogger, but it turns out that the JavaScript snippet to make
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:35.920]   this happen is very, very simple. So there's already a WordPress plugin out there that lets you add
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:43.440]   these to your WordPress blogs if you want them. So nice, nice commenting system, Google+ base
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:48.640]   commenting system now available. What else do we have? Oh, Google search results.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:53.200]   Google's constantly sort of tweaking the design and functionality of their search results.
[00:54:53.200 --> 00:55:00.560]   There's a brand new green dropdown menu next to search results when you search for something.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:04.640]   If you click on that down arrow, it's a little down arrow. I think it looks like, yeah, Chad's
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:09.440]   zoomed in there. Yeah, you get that little green down arrow and you get a couple of options
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:14.560]   cached, which lets you see the cached page if the website is down. Similar, which shows you,
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:19.040]   and actually not an example, not everybody has similar, but some results do. It shows you
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:25.520]   similar search results and share, which just pops up at Google+, of course, prompt to share the web
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:32.240]   page in Google+. And finally, I talked about this a little bit last week, but applications open.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:39.040]   Google's Summer of Code is a project that basically pays college students $5,000 to hack on an open
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:43.840]   source project over the summer from June to September. It's a really great program. Student
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:48.720]   applications just open this week. You've got like, I think a week and two more days to get your
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.640]   application in. If you're a student enrolled at full-time university or college, you can apply
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:57.920]   to Summer of Code. You choose the project you want to work on, and then what project you want
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:02.000]   to work in within that project. You get assigned a mentor. You only get paid if you ship your
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.960]   stuff, but it's a great experience, a great resume item, pretty good money, better than Flippenburger.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:12.080]   So definitely check that out. That's at Google-malange.com. You can see all the organizations.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:16.960]   And the open source project that I run, think up, was accepted as a mentoring organization,
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:20.960]   so I'm going to be mentoring hopefully one or two students or definitely one,
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:26.320]   hopefully two students this summer. So check that out. And that's all I got. The change log.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.320]   Play the drums.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:36.000]   That's the change log. Every week, Gina gives us the latest new features in Google. This is a
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.760]   listener's idea, and I think it was a great idea. Just all in one place. Everything that's new.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:46.560]   Did you get to pick your interns or whatever they are? In the summer code?
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:53.760]   Yeah, exactly. So students submit an application through Google System, and we put out a series of
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:57.440]   questions that we want them to answer. And they actually, they get a couple of weeks before
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:03.040]   applications open to interact with the mentors and the leaders in the community about, asking
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:07.200]   about proposing projects that they want to work on and getting some guidance. So they submit
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:11.280]   applications, and then we accept certain applications and assign mentors to them.
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.120]   Okay. So yeah, we do get to decide.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:17.920]   You think about doing that for, yeah, I just signed up for a course at San Jose State. Maybe I can
[00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:25.360]   weasel my way. You want to be an intern? I want to work for Gina. I think Gina would let you in.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:30.400]   No, I was just, I was just curious whether Google decided or whether you got to decide who it is
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.280]   that works for you. So, yeah, I mean, there are eligibility requirements. Like you have to be
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:36.720]   enrolled full-time. There's a series of eligibility requirements for students, but as long as you
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:40.320]   Google deems you eligible, then you can apply to whatever projects that you want, but then the
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:47.440]   projects have to accept you. Yeah, cool. Yeah. We continue to move along and the move in cell
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:52.480]   phones from using the cell infrastructure to the data infrastructure. Facebook in March
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:58.960]   allowed Canadian Android users to make free calls from the Facebook Messenger app now.
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:06.800]   It's in the US version as well. If you're in a Facebook chat in Messenger, you tap the
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:11.440]   I button inside the conversation, select free call and you're talking.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:18.080]   You're talking? This makes home more. Holy cow. Yeah, more useful, right? Like this is like,
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:22.960]   oh, yes, this is my Facebook phone. I can now make calls with it. And it's sort of an important
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:26.880]   piece of it. I presume they're using Skype, which is integrated into Facebook, the Microsoft
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:33.200]   product, but I don't know. You do not need to update Messenger app or be running Google Home.
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:39.520]   You'll have the chat heads feature is in there and just tap three info dots next to a person's name
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:44.800]   to move the comment. There it is, Messenger. You probably have it. I mean, I think it's just
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:53.680]   probably a database. Yeah, I have that. That's pretty cool. I just, you know, I think Apple's
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:59.280]   doing this moving towards this. And if you're a carrier, you just kind of wonder if you see the
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:03.600]   writing on the wall, you're going to become a data provider, not a voice provider. Yeah, if you're
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:08.400]   right, if you're a carrier, you better be working on making your pipes bigger or serving more data.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:15.040]   Yeah. I just set my mom up. She's she's been visiting for a month at 80 years old. She has an iPad.
[00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:21.200]   I just set her up with a Galaxy Note 2, her first smartphone. She loves it. I thought, you know,
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.800]   it's a big screen. I can get the text pretty big. She loves the stylist. She's an artist.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:30.480]   She sketches on it. And I put Skype on it. And I said, watch this mom. And we had a little video
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:36.160]   call and she said, you know, first of all, now she can text and she had to have a smartphone
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:42.080]   because the grandkids meet. We don't respond to email. If you want to reach somebody this day and
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:45.760]   age, you got to you got to use text messaging, right? Yeah. Yeah. And phone calls go right to
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:50.800]   voicemail, right? Yeah. So you got to have so she had to have a smartphone. And this is kind of
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.560]   a nice additional thing. So on her, I put it on her laptop on her iPad and on her
[00:59:54.560 --> 01:00:00.400]   Note 2. Do you want to do a call? Oh, look, Kevin Marks has messaged me.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:04.720]   Oh, on Facebook. On Facebook. But now that came.
[01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:07.920]   I just press the free call button and see what happens.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:14.160]   Do I have to have a messenger launched? Let me let me just see here.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.960]   Facebook messenger. Oh, you know what? I don't think I'd ever use it on this phone. So I'm going
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:27.760]   to log in now you should be able to try to welcome the messenger, reach friends wherever they are.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:32.960]   You're calling me? Well, come on. Yeah. So how do I answer?
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.800]   It's not running in your came up on my laptop. I wonder if it's confused.
[01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:45.040]   Let's press the I Kevin Marks free call. Please note your carriers data rates may apply.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.280]   I mean, you're trying to call me now. That's going to really confuse things.
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:50.080]   It says you're calling. I'm going to answer.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.680]   Wait a minute. Do that. Hang up. It was read. Oh, crap.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:59.680]   So the new Facebook voice calling works really well. It's hard to figure out.
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.720]   I don't understand how I pick up. We have the same problem. You're calling Kevin.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:07.040]   No. Okay. Now I'm talking to Kevin. I know I can hear you. There we go.
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:12.640]   But it's not video. It's just voice. Let me let me just put it to my ear and see how it sounds.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.080]   How are you doing, Kevin? I'm doing okay. It's actually not bad.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:18.720]   You know what? It sounds better than a cell conversation.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.840]   What you should do. I see me in the music. It's good.
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.520]   It sounds really good.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:30.480]   Wow. Some lags though. Yeah, but there's lag even in a cell phone call.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.880]   You only notice that because you can hear me unlagged.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:38.240]   No, it's like two seconds. It's not subtle.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.320]   Well, you are on Skype too. Oh, but no, this is your this is a different connector.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.600]   It's like double scotch. I know it's not because you're on Wi-Fi. Can you put it on speakerphone?
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:50.800]   Yeah, let's let's put them on speakerphone with those great speakers on the get on the
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:56.560]   Yeah, these big speakers, but yeah, it's breaking up a little bit. It's also frozen.
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:02.880]   So now I'm going to be unable to speak properly as I get three acres of myself coming back.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:12.240]   Say this. Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:19.120]   He doesn't. He's British. He doesn't know. He doesn't know from Lou Gehrig.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:22.880]   Well, this is good. He knew what I like. It's very chat-heady. You know, this is the new Facebook
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:27.280]   Facebook home look, which is he's got a big picture of him on his, you know,
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:31.680]   they really know how to make it pretty. Look at that. I mean, that's great. Yeah.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:33.360]   All right. I'm going to hang up.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:40.400]   Wow. You know, what mom does not have is a Facebook account. I said, mom, you know,
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:44.160]   that's where you'll see pictures of me and the kids and stuff and you it's a great way to keep up.
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:48.880]   And she said, I don't want anybody to know where I am.
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:56.240]   So my my job tonight is to see if I can make a Facebook account that's invisible to all.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:01.920]   You can, right? Yeah. Well, kind of kind of sort of. I bet I could turn up the privacy to 11.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:10.080]   But then she could do that too, right? That's easier than Skype. Pretty amazing. What a world.
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.760]   That's actually easier than Google Hangout too. Yeah, it was very easy.
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.600]   Yeah, it was very easy. Hangout, but that was that was pretty easy. Yeah.
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.920]   Oh, and it says, I've known it says, Leo, Mr. Call from you at the bottom because you didn't
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.200]   pick up the first time. I didn't pick up the first time. Yeah. Well, I mean, the thing is it's
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:33.440]   it's showing you the I mean, what it's what it's like is the calling in Google chat,
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.480]   right? But they haven't actually made that work well on the phone yet. Right. They need and
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.640]   that's where Babel will solve the problem, right? Because it'd be cross platform. Let's hope.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:45.040]   Anyway, this this is what Google could do in Babel. And this is, you know,
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.760]   this is fascinating for me because this is when I was at BT two years ago, this was like,
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:53.360]   you know, you realize we could do this to everyone's phone and make phone calls and they didn't
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.160]   quite get it. Yeah, because it kind of undermined their business model.
[01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.000]   Well, no, it didn't because they can connect out and charge for that.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:04.640]   This way Skype does, but we can make this bit, you know, they don't care about within us
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:09.680]   calls. But if we call the UK, then that's my name and money. Interesting. Anyway, I still think
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.440]   carriers must be a little threatened. First, they're losing their SMS business and now they're
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.560]   going to lose their voice calling business. It's the same thing. A cable companies are going
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:22.880]   through. We don't want to be wholesale bits on pipes. We want to be premium bits on pipes.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.680]   Right. But the challenge is no, you can't say what a premium bid is. Right.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:34.800]   I'm afraid the future, the die is cast Netflix, approving that its strategy was correct all along.
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:41.200]   They showed a strong profit. They said we have paid for all of our new programming that we're
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:46.400]   creating like a house of cards with Kevin Spacey, which was a hundred million dollar investment.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:53.520]   They now are besting in the United States, the subscriber list for HBO. They added two million
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:59.360]   new subscribers and that more than, you know, two million times seven, 99 a month, 16 million a
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:05.680]   month. Yeah, that that's a good way to pay for it. Pretty impressive. They're up to 29 million
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:10.480]   online users, which is more than a home box office in the United States.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:17.280]   Why does our rest of development soon? May 26 May 20. Yeah. Yeah. I'm waiting for the second
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:24.080]   season of House of Cards. Yeah. That was a good show. Now you're British, Kevin Marks.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:28.160]   I am indeed. Yes, indeed. And I watched the British House of Cards, which is about Parliament,
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.720]   not Congress, but very, I mean, it's the same idea. It's the same basic plot. Yeah.
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:40.320]   Which did you like better? It's funny, you know, there's 20 as difference in production
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:45.120]   style as well, which makes it hard. Yeah. I really liked the British one, but I enjoyed this one too,
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:47.440]   but they're different things and they had to take them slightly different places.
[01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.240]   Plus you can watch both on Netflix. Yeah. But the the
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:58.160]   somehow, I don't know, the scheming has seemed slightly more plausible in the English one to me,
[01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:04.320]   but and that maybe because, you know, he was the author was in Parliament at the time and had a
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:08.560]   sense of the mechanics there that wasn't there in the Washington one because some of the plot
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:13.280]   mechanics in the Washington one were a bit weird. Right. You know, he was roughly corrupt.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:17.440]   I went I went I went and spoil it, but no, it's some of the things that I does. He's like,
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:22.880]   he did what? Why would he do that? He he's a chief whip and he just did what?
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:31.280]   Because he's a master strategist. Right. He knew three moves ahead what it was going to happen.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:36.240]   But you gotta watch it. Oh, you haven't seen it? I haven't seen it. You guys are making me really
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:40.720]   want to see it. Time to work 30 hours of TV. Yeah. Well, there's so much good TV going on right
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:44.240]   now. There's a game of phones and madmen. And like I just haven't and I fired up Netflix and was
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:51.200]   like, oh, yeah, I know. It's very competitive. And it just shows you that the secret is not to be a
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:57.520]   pipe, not to be a conduit, but to be a creator. You want to make money, create content? Well,
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:01.920]   you can do both. I mean, you know, they're different kinds of business. The commodity business is
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:05.840]   a really good business to be in because it means everybody wants to buy your thing. So, but how do
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:09.760]   you do with yourself as a commodity business? Good. You don't need to. You're a quantity business.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:13.840]   Just do it well. Do it well. That's the mistake is saying, oh, we need to not be
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:17.280]   coming to business. No, actually, a commodity business is a really good thing to be. It means
[01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:20.880]   you're in a business you understand that people actually want. There's a price for it. You can just
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.880]   you can just iterate on that. Is it that there are fashion businesses much harder?
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:29.360]   But there are people who are good at that. And that's what the production companies are in.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:34.160]   What you don't get in a commodity business is the multi insane multiples that you get in
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:38.880]   the tech business. And unfortunately, everybody's stowed stock market driven these days
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:43.360]   that they're not real happy with, hey, we're going to grow 5% a year. It's like,
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:48.000]   who cares? I take it.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.920]   I think there's an apple stock hasn't gone up. That was the weird one for me. It's like, okay,
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:57.600]   apple is announced. Yes, they've made more profits than anyone else ever again. Oh, and they start
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:02.160]   still. Well, this future. Yeah, we had a good conversation on this in Mac break weekly. We
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.840]   hadn't seen it yet, but we knew the results would come in. And it's, you know, it's all about not
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.840]   what's happening today with apple, but what the future looks like for apple. And I think the market
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:14.480]   and many of us have started to think maybe apple's losses mojo and what will the future look like.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:19.360]   Apple's Apple's a perfect example of a company that does not want to be in a commodity business.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:25.840]   That's Dell. Mm hmm. Yeah, well, yeah, they're kind of in the fashion. Sure. They're at the
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:31.040]   fashion end of a commodity business. You know, they're selling the expensive version of the
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:35.600]   premium version of the other things. Right. And they do that supremely well, that and they
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.640]   do that. And this is, you know, cooks genius is making that actually profitable. Right.
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:49.040]   But yeah, it's, but it is tricky because it is easier to replicate some of the stuff. Sure.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.880]   Netflix is going to add a $12 a month plan that'll let you get four different streams. This shows
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:59.680]   where people are going with this. We got four people in the family all watching at the same time.
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.880]   Oh, wow. That sounds about right. Yeah. Yeah. He does.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.080]   Isn't the Netflix of making house of cards? I thought I heard a quote that they basically said
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:13.200]   that they wanted to become HBO before HBO became them. Yes. Right. I mean, they're scared of HBO
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:19.120]   Go. Right. Yes. And but they're not tied to the cable companies the way that HBO is. Right. So,
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:23.680]   I thought that this is more about them being like, oh, we've got to make a move and start off.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.840]   Well, it's also very simple from a financial point of view. They spend $100 million. All they
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.480]   have to do is get a million new subscribers. They've paid for it and they got to. So it's a very
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:38.080]   straightforward thing. What they've proven is that people will get a Netflix subscription just to
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:42.160]   watch a show. Yeah. And that's why. Because that's been always the ding against Netflix is that the
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:47.600]   selection isn't always the best. So they got arrested development. They're going to they have a new
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:54.160]   horror series called Hemlock Grove, which just launched. And what's really interesting to me is
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:10:01.360]   instead of dribbling this episodes out once a week, they just here. Yeah. 13 episodes.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.920]   Full of things. That's how I want to watch it. Right. Right. I think they get that. And this is
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.760]   the same thing that I mean, YouTube is doing something similar. Right. I mean, they're paying
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:13.360]   people to create content. I mean, in their case, it's not a subscription they're looking for. It's
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.800]   ad revenue. Right. But I think it's the same thing. I mean, they've kind of maxed out what they can
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:20.400]   do or maybe maybe not. Who knows? Maybe they'll surprise me. But YouTube's kind of like at the
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:23.680]   top of their game. So it's like, where do we go from here? And I think their answer is, hey, we
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:29.360]   create our own content. We doubled down. So I think Netflix is doing something similar and good for
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:33.680]   them. It also shows that people are honest and willing to pay for content because you could easily
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:38.560]   game the free trial given that they put 13 episodes in. You get what? A two week free trial?
[01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:42.960]   You could do a free trial, watch all 13 episodes and move on. But I think people are honest.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:48.560]   They're rewarding read Hastings for creating this content and looking forward to these other
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.040]   shows and saying, you know what, I do want to pay $7.99 a month. I mean, I think it works really
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.520]   well for us is a series. You find a series you want to watch and go through that. So
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:01.760]   they're sort of with this, they're teaching you that and saying, okay, here's the thing you just
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.920]   watch as many as you like. Then you go, Oh, there's a UK version with 19, none. And I never saw that.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:11.120]   Oh, it's now recommending I watch this series. Am I flying from the UK that's kind of a political
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.880]   thriller? Right. And they have seven series with that. And you can watch that. And then they've
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:19.520]   hooked you in and you've, you know, I, and we, this is how we end up watching stuff. We watched
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:25.120]   our way through the tutors, which is, which is, um, show time. Yeah. But that's, that was on
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:30.080]   Netflix and worked our way through that. Awesome. I wonder if Netflix could fund those programs
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:35.120]   that like those beloved shows that get canceled too soon. So like, so like, like the Veronica
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:41.040]   Mar's movie or like a new season. Firefly. Yeah. Yeah. Firefly. Firefly, right? Like, so instead of
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:43.920]   doing a Kickstarter, which everyone started getting annoyed about all these rich celebrities
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:49.360]   doing kick starters now, they can sort of get funded through Netflix. If they negotiate the rights,
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:56.880]   you know, yeah. Why not? That would be awesome. I mean, firefly alone would triple Netflix's
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:02.000]   Yeah. Remember, Netflix is not becoming a production company. They don't, they just say
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.800]   they're an investor. You know, uh, Josh Whedon's got a production company. Uh, you just say,
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:11.120]   Josh, we're going to give you a hundred million. Uh, you know, this, this house of cards, they were
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:15.360]   shopping it to everybody and Netflix stole it out from under, I believe it was HBO. We don't
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.200]   know for sure, but stole it out from under somebody else. It might have been a network
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:24.080]   by offering them a hundred million. And they said, Oh, okay. Deal. But how did the arrested
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.720]   development? How did the arrested development though work out? I mean, is there a, I mean,
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.320]   is there a, well, somebody has the rights to that. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah. So that was
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.080]   the production company that has been passed on by the network. That's right. So the production
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.240]   company book puts it together and makes it and they would probably have to go and, um,
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:43.040]   would get all the actors to recommit because that whatever options ahead of that would have
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:46.800]   expired. Sure. But, but you know, that they could, doing those kinds of things that that will work
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.360]   happens all the time. Happens all the time. It's all about money. That's all. You can write a check.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:57.680]   Sure. I'll come back. I'll do the show. Yeah. Uh, now I'm an interesting, what you thoughts are,
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:01.120]   and I shouldn't do this without Jeff Jarvis here because he's such a lover of the Chromebook.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:09.120]   But, uh, oh boy, oh boy, oh no, you can channel him. Okay. Net market share, which measures traffic,
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:17.280]   um, monitoring, uh, operating system traffic by looking at what browsers are coming into websites.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:23.920]   Uh, just started monitoring a worldwide usage of Chrome OS, the percentage of web traffic from
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:33.680]   Chromebooks to 100th of 1% a figure so stunningly small as to not earn a place at the rankings at
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:40.960]   all. Two years they've been selling Chromebooks. How do they tell that from Chrome? Uh, I guess
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:44.560]   the Chrome browser in there probably reports the user agent probably is Chrome OS. I don't know,
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.240]   they must use a user agent. No, you know what? As I remember there, it's more than user agent.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:52.960]   They're a little bit smart about that. Okay. But you can, you know, you can tell what, right? Yeah,
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:57.120]   you can tell from ways to do that. I thought he should be reported not only the browser,
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:01.280]   but the operating system as well. Maybe. Yeah. And it could be spoofed and all that. But, uh,
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:06.720]   so, uh, but we knew this was a specialty price.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:14.640]   This is where Google changes the Google bots browser signature to be
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:22.320]   Chrome OS. I'm really genuinely curious at what are not Chromebooks are going to be at Google I/O,
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:26.480]   the way that they have been the last two years. So the last two years we've gotten Chromebooks,
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:30.400]   right? For free. Like they've been giveaways. They've been a thing. I wonder, I wonder if
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.840]   they're going to be there at all. Depends how many pixels they've already made.
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:38.560]   They got a couple of thousand extra pixels. I think you might. You think they'll all load them?
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:47.040]   Last year, which I plugged in once and haven't used. Yeah. The Chrome box is not exactly a
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:50.800]   hideously useful product. Now, I'm going to try and look at what to do with that.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:56.720]   Yeah, it's not portable. You need to, you need to have a keyboard screen and mouse to attach to it.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:02.240]   I don't understand the product at all. Well, it makes sense as if you're trying to replace a
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:06.240]   school or business, a school business, those kinds of things.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:10.800]   These things appeal to people who have admins that want to lock everything down.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:15.040]   And it's great for that. Well, what in theory they do in practice that those admins are so
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:18.240]   tied into windows that you can't get to change their minds half the time. Maybe.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:24.160]   But yeah, it makes sense as someone who's trying, who hasn't got admin can do that.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:26.000]   You don't need to submit for it. You just plug it in.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.360]   Well, Jeff, Jeff, we're here. He was saying, hey, this is a, I love my Chromebook. I love my
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.280]   Pixel. I do everything with it. Jeff's been doing an experiment for many months now, right?
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:39.360]   Gina, where he just uses that. It's been a while. Yeah. He's living the little V to Google.
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:44.160]   He said in service of the show, which we appreciate. But I think if I think about it,
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.640]   the people who really are most happy are people who write because their needs are few.
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:57.200]   They don't have any program reason going to want it. Although I just read a long Google plus post
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:01.840]   from, I think he's a Linux. I don't know if he's a kernel hacker, but he's a Linux programmer
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:06.960]   who said he loves his Pixel. Loves it. But of course, what did he do? He put Linux on.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:10.960]   Right. Yeah. I've seen lots of tutorials pop up lately about how to get it.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.600]   True time. These are fun programmers saying, here's how you get it to work.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:17.120]   You know, the people that really aren't going to be happier gamers, anybody that uses any third
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:22.080]   party software. Yeah. If you're doing media production, media production, exactly. I mean,
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:26.160]   it's just not going to be good. And so, you know, who knows though, they might get there.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:32.320]   But yeah, there are a lot of drawbacks. I mean, I'll tell you this. I mean, I'd rather be hampered
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:38.880]   and use a Chromebook than I would use Windows 8. I'd rather give up all that stuff and not use
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.560]   Windows 8. You don't know what I'm using right now? Windows 8. Yeah, it just looks like any other
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:47.360]   computer, especially if you're using Chrome. I don't like it either. If that's a question,
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:50.240]   when Chromebook or Windows 8, I think I would choose the Chromebook. Maybe.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:54.240]   I mean, if you didn't have any of those things that I mentioned, right, if you're not trying to
[01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:58.560]   run games or you're not trying to do something specific, I'd much rather use a Chromebook
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:03.360]   than Windows 8. If it's just for that online, you know, email, word processing, those kinds of
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:08.480]   things. Do you know anybody who's purchased this Dell Linux UltraBook, the project Sputnik?
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:13.120]   It's gotten good reviews, but I don't know anybody personally that's used it. It's an Ubuntu
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.600]   chips with Ubuntu. It's got it's aluminum. It's apparently fairly nice. It's not cheap.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:25.040]   USB 3, not USB 2, we need a DisplayPort. And it all works. Yeah, which is really nice. He's a
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:30.400]   hardware and good on for Dell for making sure that the drivers are there. I mean, that's difficult.
[01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.080]   That's the biggest hurdle is to make sure that all the drivers work with all that new hardware
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:39.760]   that they packed into that thing. It's a really nice machine. But if you can't, I mean, if Dell
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:44.000]   can't do it, who can? Yeah. Yeah. And Dell's the one to band wagon for a while. They've been doing
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.720]   this for a number of years now, making machines, you can buy them just that have that come with a
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:56.160]   bun to the, you know, the first real major, you know, hardware hardware vendor or laptop vendor
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.960]   that has actually done this. There's been other ones around for a long time. I'm not crazy about
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.680]   Unity, but I could put another, you can put something else on there. That's the thing.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:07.040]   Put Linux Mint on there. It's easy to do. Yeah. You want to buy me one or review for you?
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:12.320]   I was thinking of buying it. I was thinking of buying it. By the way, 1920 by 1080.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:18.480]   I don't know how they're doing that. Because that's something that classically Linux kind of,
[01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:24.080]   you get little tiny icons and stuff. No, I mean, actually not. Absolutely. Especially if you've
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:28.320]   got a dedicated, you know, Nvidia graphics card driver, right? Yeah, that's great. And even,
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:32.880]   even the Intel chips, you know, with the built-in graphics are doing that now. So
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.920]   three hours battery life, that's a little disappointing. I'd like to see more nowadays.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:44.640]   Interesting. The opposite of the, to go back to the Chromebook story, did you see this slate story,
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:50.240]   this writer on slate basically got locked out of, I think it's a him. Yeah. Yeah. He said it was like,
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:57.760]   clear reason. It's a her. Okay. So what happens is you've got a Chromebook and you just can't
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:02.880]   and you, I mean, it's, it's right. The Chromebook's useless if you can't sign into your account. So
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:07.440]   sure, her account got shut down. Just, you know, it was the generic message just saying it's,
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:10.640]   you know, you must have violated the terms of service somehow and she couldn't, she couldn't
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:15.520]   get to anything. And she had to go to Google and still took six days. Yeah, that was this. Yeah.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:20.720]   She has friends at Google. She said, I asked all of my Google, like, Google friends, what should I do?
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:24.320]   And then she got different answers. Like one of them thought they should go to account. So
[01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:27.920]   another one thought they should go to policy. This was a bit of the terms of service that I
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:32.480]   actually didn't didn't know about. She said, I felt, I felt like I'd been dumped.
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:37.280]   I felt like I'm in love. In its terms of service, Google limits its total liability for stolen data,
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:43.120]   lost data, anything to the amount you paid us to use the services, which could mean as much as
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:49.040]   the two 49 per month, you shelled out for 25 gig or more storage or in my case, nothing. So,
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:53.440]   that's essentially saying if you're not paying Google anything to host your data, the data is lost
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.200]   or they, or they shut down your account, which also in the terms of service, they say that they
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:03.040]   have every right to do for any reason whatsoever, then, you know, that there's nothing, nothing going on.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:08.640]   So I mean, we've talked about this a lot here on the show about backing up your stuff and using
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:11.520]   takeout and doing exports often because, you know, this kind of thing happens.
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:17.520]   Could you run takeout after the fact? No. No. No. I mean, this is what's wrong with,
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:22.240]   so I love the concept. I love the day deliberation kind of concept, right? And I like the concept of
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:26.880]   takeout. But the reality is, is that unless you do it once a month or every two weeks or
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:34.160]   whatever diligently across all your products, you know, the export file becomes, you know,
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:38.160]   gets out of date at some point. If your account did get shut down and a lot of times the export
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:41.840]   files are just not as useful without the service. You know, when you separate the data from the
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:46.080]   service, it's just like, well, okay, you know, now I've just got this, you know, this.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:52.720]   What good is this XML file? Yeah. Yeah. This 500 gigabyte XML file I can't use.
[01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:57.200]   Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, this story, this is kind of my nightmare story about sort of the using,
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.880]   moving all my stuff to the cloud. Is that at some point, you know, and Google just does not have
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:05.520]   the mechanism set up to appeal this. There's no like structured appeal process. They don't tell
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:11.200]   you what part of the terms of service you violated. In fact, I think she said she was working on a
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:17.360]   spreadsheet that involves some phone numbers or something, some private information. And she
[01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:22.000]   thinks that that might have been the terms of service violation. But I don't even think she's sure.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.640]   That's scary. That's what's really scary is you don't, you still don't know. And if you haven't,
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:32.240]   you maybe you could, you could learn Python and query the Python user script and ask,
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:38.240]   talk to me what day and I do. Yeah. She said that my data was intact when she got one of her
[01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:41.120]   accounts. Everything was there six days later, except for that spreadsheet.
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.280]   Except for the last thing I worked on. Yes. Spreadsheet,
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.280]   container clients account numbers and passwords. It seems that Google's engineers determine the
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:51.040]   single document violated policy and locked down my entire account. I don't know if that's the case.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:54.160]   That was just the last thing she worked on. Maybe it wasn't saved in the backup.
[01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:57.360]   I wouldn't jump to that conclusion by any means. Right. And I think there's also,
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:00.320]   could have just been an algorithm failure. You know, I don't think you may have
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:04.480]   Google engineers that actually said, Hey, look at this check. We're going to shut her down. She has
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:11.120]   a Chinese name. Tian Lan Hao could have been a confusion and name. Maybe they thought she was a
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:14.800]   Chinese hacker. I mean, there's all sorts of, we just, but the problem is Google's opaque. You don't
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:19.680]   know. She was, it was a Googler who got it restored after six days and escalated it. She said to the
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:26.000]   right person. She had to know somebody inside Google to escalate. I mean, not everybody knows
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.760]   someone. I mean, we, I don't know about you, Leo, but I often get people to say, Oh, you do this,
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.880]   we can Google like I'm having this problem. Can you get me a pixel for cheap?
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:42.560]   You please, you know, there's someone that I can, it's tough. I get that all the time. And
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:47.600]   what I tell them is, no, I intentionally avoid conversing with anybody from the companies we
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:50.960]   cover. I don't want to have any relationship with them at all.
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.320]   I wonder if this is an opportunity. Maybe I should start a Google support business.
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:58.640]   They're a party third party Google support. Call me and I'll help you fix your phone or
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:04.240]   help you fix your well. I still have, I think, wasn't there a company that did that backup thing?
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:10.960]   What was the name of that? Oh, yeah. They back up all your social networks on a Mac storeify.
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:16.480]   No, no, not storeify. That was the tweet creation. I know exactly what we're talking about, Leo.
[01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:21.360]   And I and I got because I got in early, it was free for life. So I presume they're still backing it up.
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:27.680]   I'd have to find out who it is. Back up. Was it back up? If I might have been the, it was back up
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:32.000]   before I think back up a five backup. I thought getting the emails from them. I was maybe they went
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.200]   out of business because it wasn't a very good model. Don't see their ignorance and that did an
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:41.120]   automatic that would be an example. It does an automatic backup of all your social networks,
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:47.600]   including Google and Facebook. And if that runs automatically, then you're all right.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:51.040]   And you're good. You're up to date, hopefully. So I'll just have to recover that account when
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:55.440]   Google kills my account. Yeah. Yeah. I'm wearing a hat Google. See, you told me where the hat
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:24:01.680]   and all would be well. They have wheeled a lot of power. They do. That's the bottom line.
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:05.840]   All right. We are going to take a break, come back with your tips, your picks, your,
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:09.200]   nobody does do a number, but that's all right. I want to talk a little bit about a number

[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:51.360]   jumpsuits. Go straight to jumpsuits. A onesie, right? Onesies. When you're born, right? You get a
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:56.560]   lot of onesies, right? Ed has got onesies galore. Oh, yeah. Stacks with them. Yeah, when you're born
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:01.600]   and then a little later on in life, it's back in the onesie. Just put the little hatch in the
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:05.040]   diapers too. And diapers, yeah. And diapers. And diapers. And diapers. And diapers. And diapers.
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:13.200]   Kevin Marks hung up on us. I think he was offended. 99designs.com/twit. All right, it's time for our
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:20.320]   tips of the week. Let's start with you Gina Trepene. Well, now that Google+ comments are available
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:25.760]   for bloggers sites, you can also add them really to any webpage. I said there was a WordPress plugin
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:29.360]   that already came out. This is all kind of unofficial, but it totally completely works.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:35.200]   You can add Google+ comments to any webpage. There's a little snippet of HTML. Just Google,
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:41.200]   Google+ comments on any website. This link will come up. You just drop the little snippet of HTML.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:47.120]   There's also an HTML5 version that you can use. And you can show the number of comments,
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:51.680]   comments counter, how many comments they have. You can load the comments dynamically. That replaces
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:55.840]   discus. We should have probably used that instead of discus. Yeah, I mean, this is, you know,
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:29:02.000]   Google hasn't announced that this is an official thing yet. So I use, I would say, it seems like
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:08.000]   this is going to become official very quickly. But use this initial bit of HTML, knowing that
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.600]   you might have to adjust it later if the API changes. I don't think it will. It looks like this is
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:16.240]   going to be the official way to do it. But yeah, so you can get Google+ comments on any page,
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:22.560]   which I personally like a lot better than Facebook. Discus is pretty great, but really nice that
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:27.040]   you also get the exposure also on Google+. And you also get the comments that people are making
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:31.440]   on Google+. Yeah, see, and it's free. It discusses a page service. I mean, that's pretty tempting.
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:35.200]   I really like it. I really love the Google+ commenting system. It's a very smart thing for
[01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:39.200]   them to do. It's really smart because it gets you plugged in. And I mean, if I ever get my website
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:42.880]   up and running again, you know, and modernize, I don't know if I'll ever do it. But if it ever
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.840]   happens, I'm definitely going to check this out. I think it's awesome. I might have to try it too.
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:49.280]   I think it's great. I wish you could have more than one commenting system, but that's really
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:54.000]   probably another good idea. You got to pick one. Well, this is a challenge that's integrating
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:00.160]   them, isn't it? Right. Yeah. There was a completely geek out story, but Tantec,
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:06.800]   you know, Tantec-Chellic, we're going to post on the first indie word cross-site commenting system
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:11.040]   that's they've actually put together a way to do this, where three different people with their
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:15.680]   own sites hosting is doing cross-site trackback and thinking again. Wow. So there's
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:21.360]   still trying to make that work. And the challenge is dealing with competing with these unitary systems
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:28.240]   because you want the stuff to stay there and not be, you know, disappear when that company goes away
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:33.280]   or vanish in those ways that a lot of these coming systems has. And that's kind of hard.
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.320]   It's like actually return didn't track back when we had we've had trackback.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.880]   Yeah, it's just bringing trackback. It's bringing it back.
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.880]   Oh, so in a way, you remember trackback? So cute. Never worked.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:52.400]   No, no, it worked. It worked so well. It worked. It worked. It worked. It worked. It worked. It worked.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:58.480]   But it was confusing because it was like, well, there anyway, the trackback is back, baby.
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:00.720]   I put the link in the chat room. Thank you.
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:04.880]   Indie web types. You want to play with that. So the Google+ thing is interesting because it lets
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:09.440]   you have comments on a site that only you and your friends can see, which is kind of weird.
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:15.040]   Google+ private commenting. Yeah. You're very young, Google+. And there might be comments that
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:20.720]   you can't see, right? That other people could see. Well, as you all know, April is the cruelest
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:26.960]   month. So it's time to talk poetry with Kevin Marx, who actually has a good public school education.
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:32.800]   Indeed. Well, in the UK, we call it state school because public school means private school.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:37.120]   Oh, I'm sorry. So you don't have a public school. You didn't go to eat in their hero.
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:43.040]   All right. So these are a couple of sites that I think are very cute. There's this one called
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:50.480]   Google Poetics.com. And if you go to that, it's a list of when Google auto complete turns into
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:59.840]   little poems. Let's not do the first one. Do the one at the bottom of the list from yesterday's
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:04.800]   world poetry because that's a good one. Apparently, there's some very horny people who've started
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:09.760]   using this because they're all holding me closer. Holding me closer. Tony Danza.
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:20.000]   Why does that come up? Because people think that's what John singing.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:28.400]   Oh, my God. Tony Danza. I think that's the blog. It's made that joke. So I think that's
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:34.400]   her got that one in there. But I love the blog as God bless her. What is it to be human? What is
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:41.360]   it today? What is it that makes tears without sorrow? What is it that given one? So the idea is
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:46.960]   this is from auto complete. Yeah. So it's all a commitment suggestions that look like modern
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:52.160]   poetry. So it's. And so there's that one. Then the other one that's fun is is pentameteron.com.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:58.800]   And what this one does is it looks at Twitter, the tweets that are in iambic pentameter.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:06.960]   And then it finds two that rhyme and put them together and you get this sort of very strange
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:12.720]   found. Advising holly to become a nun. Thanks for the birthday wishes everyone.
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:17.920]   You always have a little more in you. I want to follow from McDonald's too.
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:26.000]   Got me a baby brother on the way. Heart turns a little colder every day. Time for a shower.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:33.280]   Gonna go apply all Polish people going crazy. Si. This is good. This is better than Shakespeare.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:38.320]   So nearly got a Gary Neville squeal. I'm such a jealous person. It's unreal.
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:45.360]   Bors. Then a bitch in a little Mexico just had a great idea for a show. Is this done algorithmically?
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:50.160]   Yeah. So they know where the beats the beats fall in English. So they look for the
[01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:58.160]   pentameter sentences. Which is done. That's hilarious.
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:02.800]   So you see it's just like we look for the meter and create the poetry. So I thought those two were
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:09.920]   very cute and also very dada. This was cut up perky was this like early 20th century thing
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:16.800]   where you love this. I want to put a smiley header but just saw an Asian with a mullet. What?
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:23.600]   This is better than damn you auto correct. This is awesome.
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:30.320]   It's wonderful. You just sit there. It's amazing that people. This is how code should be. This is
[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:37.440]   what codes for. Yeah. Stop writing apps. What are you doing? No, I do have an actual tip.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:43.120]   Which is my blog post. I've linked there. And this is something I discovered you could do
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.240]   while trying to solve another problem. So my problem was my son's old blog. The picture
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:52.160]   had gone away because the pictures were on at was I disk and they broke the sites link.
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:58.160]   So I thought oh, but I can you can make it. You are the roles from Google Drive. So I stuck
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:03.760]   on Google Drive did that. And then I thought wait a minute. You can download your Twitter archive.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:07.120]   Then you can just throw it into Google Drive and then you've got your Twitter archive on the web.
[01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:12.880]   So I put this steps to do that. And it's slightly annoying in that you get a URL that's like 25
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:18.240]   feet long because it's a Google URL. But you can use a short of that. And so now I've got my
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:23.040]   archive of my tweets up on Google Drive and you can go and find them. And this is you could
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:27.920]   already download your tweets and do this locally. But they actually designed it well enough. You
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:32.720]   just throw it on the server and it works. And as long as Google doesn't go out of business and
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:38.080]   they don't break up with you, it's somewhat permanent. So as long as I'm now relying on two
[01:35:38.080 --> 01:35:43.040]   flaky services to deal with each other. Now I want to back up my Google Plus on the Twitter.
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:47.520]   I'm not sure that works. Yeah, I mean, this is this is the usefulness of the HTML export,
[01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:50.960]   right? Like this is really nice that you could just do the next, you know, if Facebook offers
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:55.600]   this as well, right? Can't you export all your stuff and you get HTML? And you do actually,
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:59.920]   I should do it with the other stuff that Google dumps is because you get that from bars as well,
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:02.080]   don't you? You get an HTML dump from bars, I should put that up to you.
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:09.440]   So if you go to J.mp, this is Kevin's shortened URL for all of his tweets ever.
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:13.280]   Slash Km tweets slash Km tweets.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:18.400]   Well, it isn't. It only goes up to the beginning of April when I did this. So you have to
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:24.240]   you have to set up a cron job. It's a cron job. There you go. Yeah. Well, you said that it's
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:30.000]   a manual process with Twitter, but oh, come on. As it as it's monthly, you know, you can do it
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.240]   once a month and update it. So I need to update it in that April.
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:38.560]   And what's nice is it's nicely formatted Twitter. Obviously, he's doing this in HTML and XML,
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:42.960]   right? So there's some formatting. What they actually do is they download all the
[01:36:42.960 --> 01:36:51.200]   tweets as JSON as if they were coming from the API and then they have some code that runs there
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:58.160]   in JavaScript that renders them in HTML. It's very nice. So this is a large HTML file that Google
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:02.320]   Drive is just rendering for you. Yeah, actually, browser is rendering it. Google drives is
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:06.400]   storing it for you. Just storing it. Yeah, Google is just being a dumb server. And then the
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:09.440]   Twitter stuff is working quite nicely, which is, you know, I'm going to do this. That's cool.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:14.960]   Team. It's not a think up replacement, but it's cool. I had to say that.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:18.400]   Thank you. You should feed. You should feed to think up.
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:23.040]   Now that's the next. Yeah, yeah, we're working on the import right now.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:26.560]   Kids, this is why web standards are so important. Now you know.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:31.840]   Yes. So now you know the rest of the story. Aaron, you got anything for us a little tip?
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.320]   Yeah, actually, you do. I use what you use. Yeah. So this is something if you're not familiar
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:40.240]   with it. I think a lot of people probably are if you're not familiar with this particular
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:45.120]   program, that's called Wi-Fi analyzer. And so a lot of people have trouble connecting to Wi-Fi.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:48.960]   Maybe they have intermittent Wi-Fi service Wi-Fi connectivity at their house, whatever.
[01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:52.960]   So it's a little tool that you can get. You can download. Let me make sure that in frame.
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:57.840]   There we go. So I'm actually running this here at the at the Twit brick house and you can see
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:01.120]   all the different problem. Yeah, you can see the problem exactly. This is why there's so many
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:08.400]   problems. These are all the Wi-Fi. It's cool. Connections that I can see from my phone and it
[01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:12.960]   tells you along the bottom, it tells you what channel it is and it tells you what the signal
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.720]   strength is. So if you're wondering and I know that you can you can look at this if you're selecting
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:20.240]   a Wi-Fi network, it'll give you the little the little bars and says, oh, this is a stronger
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:24.480]   signal or whatever. But but this is good in a couple of ways. So one thing you can do with this,
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:28.800]   if you're setting up a Wi-Fi, a new Wi-Fi router or if you're not getting good service and you
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:32.560]   wondering why, you can go look at this and say, oh, I know why. It's because everyone's on channel
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:36.480]   11. Right. Then you go back to your Wi-Fi router and you can turn it to channel 6 or channel 1.
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:44.000]   And you'll get much, much better throughput and better signal strength if you're if you don't
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.440]   have as much conflict on those channels. So that's one thing you can do with it. It's really simple
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:53.040]   to use. There's different modes you can do. You can do a time graph, which is a kind of messy
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.720]   actually in this case, because there's so many different Wi-Fi signals that doesn't really help
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:01.040]   so much. Holy moly. Yeah. Well, it tells you something. You can do a channel rating, which is really
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:05.680]   good. So if you were, this is really an easy way to set up a new access point on your system. If
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:09.680]   you want to know, you know, right right off the bat what to set it up on right here, you would
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:16.000]   choose channel 14. And you can just do a simple AP list and it'll tell you the green bars are good,
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.480]   more green is good for all these things. And then the last thing you can do is a signal meter,
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:24.960]   which is really cool if you're running what version of the Apple phone was it that had the
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:30.960]   antenna problem for four. So like right now, the whatever I'm connected to is getting a little
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:36.320]   above negative 60 dB. And I think if I, oh, I actually got better signal quality by putting my
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:42.960]   hands around it. Usually you'll see that drop off. It's not supposed to happen. What phone are you
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:46.880]   using there? This is the this is the guy was apples contention as it happens to everybody.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:50.800]   Yeah, and it actually does. I'm not going to course, it's a lot of demo. It depends because
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:54.560]   your hands can act as an your body connects the antenna. It could if I was actually making
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:40:00.240]   contact with it, but I've got a case around this. So anyway, so that's it. I mean, it's a pretty
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:05.840]   simple tool. And if you're having trouble, I actually use this at my house. My wife's Nexus 7 was
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:09.440]   not getting good reception. And I was like, what is going on? Everybody was complaining.
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.560]   I went looked at it, sure enough, verified that my phone and the Nexus 7 were way off. And so then
[01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.560]   I started looking and the case had popped open in the back to see if somebody had dropped it.
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:22.080]   The case had come open just a tiny little crack. And that's where the antenna is.
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:25.920]   So it wasn't making good connections. So I was able to to fix that. And of course,
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:29.520]   then the signal strength went right back up to where it should be. So check it out. It's
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:36.400]   Wi-Fi analyzer available on the Google Play Store for free. This is a really good example of a
[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:42.240]   program that you couldn't do on a, I tried to on an iPhone because it doesn't give you access to
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:46.000]   that, you know, that information only Apple can access. I was so glad you mentioned that earlier.
[01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:50.240]   I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I used that in my apartment when I was in an apartment and I had
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:55.040]   lots of signals. And it was really very, very helpful. That's one of the reasons I love Android
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:58.320]   because you can get access to that kind of stuff. Apple walks up this. This is a. I can see all
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:05.520]   my neighbors networks now. This is great. Yeah. Yeah. You can. And this is a similar program.
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:10.080]   Every smartphone, all the Android phones have an auto brightness feature. But as you may remember,
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:15.600]   I was having trouble with the HTC One battery life. And one of the problems, one of the, it had
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.800]   several problems that I was I think mostly able to correct was that the auto brightness was set
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.880]   artificially high because it makes the screen look better. So it was a super bright screen. I kind
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:31.440]   of felt that I was dimming the screen artificially. But this is for real geeks. And Russell Tammany,
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:41.120]   our IT guy told us about it. It's called Lux. And it let's you program your auto brightness.
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:47.920]   Based on I have it set here and this is this is the dashboard based on the brightness here. So
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:54.080]   the sensor on the phone is measuring 320 luxes lumens here. And I'm going to I can say, you know
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:57.760]   what this screen is a little dark in that kind of brightness. I want to I want to whenever I'm
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:02.640]   in that's anything that's this bright, let's set it for 77% brightness. And it will do that. And
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:08.400]   there's a variety of other features. This is the most complex program you have ever seen
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.360]   for auto brightness. But you know what, if you're a geek, this is why if this is the kind of thing
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:17.440]   you say, why would I ever want to do that? Get an iPhone. If this is the kind of thing where you go,
[01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:22.160]   Oh, that's that's pretty cool. I'd like to do that. This is why you like Android. These are
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:25.760]   the measurements I've done in the settings I've set at different brightness levels for different
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:32.320]   Lumen levels. It's called Lux. There's a free version, but for a couple of bucks, you can get the
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:38.960]   the paid version Lux auto brightness by Vito Cassissi. Very nice app. The other app that he told
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:47.360]   me about, which is kind of handy is a widget to monitor milliamp draw by the off the battery.
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:56.560]   And the temperature of the battery is called current widget. And it is a fabulous little tool
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:06.640]   that will I even have a log file that I can look at the power drain from my my my phone over time,
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:11.280]   the temperature. And when you're charging on some phones, not all phones, this is something that
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:16.880]   seems to be hardware specific. It'll even tell you how many amps the charger is drawing at any
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:21.360]   given time. Oh, that sounds handy as well, because very useful. I've got a problem that I've got
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:26.880]   some cables that you're never quite sure of their plugged in properly. Exactly. Or you know,
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:31.040]   there's two kinds of charging depending on the amperage of the charger you're using. There's a
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:35.760]   trickle charge where there's a last charge and you may not know what you're getting. This this is
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:40.320]   very useful for that. And I but it was helpful for me to diagnosing am I drawing a lot of powers
[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:46.000]   or program drawing a lot of power rights out right now using 271 milliamps. And it goes up and down.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.200]   And that's very handy. Very, very a nice little program. So a couple of tools to improve the battery
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:56.560]   life or at least to have more control over your Android phone. We got to run Mitch Cape
