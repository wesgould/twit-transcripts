[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.360]   I always love hopping on to this week in Google talking all about Google
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.400]   But this week like there's stuff all over the map
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.960]   But we've got some really big news to dive into Jeff is out this week, but we do have Stacy Higginbotham
[00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.960]   Of course joining us. How you doing Stacy?
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.560]   Hello, I'm well, it's great to see you once again also joining us Matthew Ingram
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.520]   From CJR or chief digital writer. How are you doing Matthew?
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.800]   Great good
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.920]   good, I
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.600]   Like just getting to the point on that one. So I appreciate that Columbia journalism review. It's not just CJR
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.480]   I should specify it's great to see you guys. Thanks for yeah. Thanks for hopping up beer
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.200]   Yeah, it's a good day to do this because I don't know if y'all well
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.920]   I know that you probably are very aware of this you two
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.280]   But there's some big stuff happening in Washington, BC right now
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:01.320]   I had to I read Matthew's article on it. So I was I was excited. Yeah, I mean there's so many reader so many facets to all this stuff
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.280]   I feel like the last week has been a whirlwind of
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.760]   Well, I have a big tech reckoning like big tech is suddenly there's a huge a giant microscope
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.600]   Being placed in the middle in the middle of a sunny day right on technology tech is the
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:25.200]   Yes, I clear it off. Yeah to the bottom of it. Absolutely. I mean things kind of started that that way, right?
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.720]   Last week I know on last week show you guys talked a little bit about kind of what where Trump was at by the time of the show
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.800]   I think the story kind of evolved through last week. So as you probably mentioned that before we kind of get into what's going on today
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:45.120]   You know Trump was saying better be careful treading on very troubled territory. I think this is all the stuff that you were mentioning last week
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.360]   He also ended up posting a video which I don't know if you guys talked about
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.120]   That showed the Google homepage every year during the inauguration and on all of those years
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.240]   There was a link present to watch the inauguration through the Google portal
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.520]   Except in the video it does not show those links present when it's Trump's
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.360]   Inauguration so this was used as fuel to say hey see Google really wants to stamp you know
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.240]   stamp out conservative
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.920]   Stuff yeah, and we said and in classic Trump fashion. It was wrong and just like the
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.320]   the research quote unquote that he was
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:32.080]   That he was quoting about how you know social media and particularly Google searches biased against him which was also wrong
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.880]   There were
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.560]   There was a part of the video where I think it was like 2016 it actually showed an older logo
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.560]   Because in 2015 Google had redone its logo
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.960]   So of course there was all sorts of Internet sleuthing going on as far as like hey wait a minute
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.960]   That doesn't make sense if you pulled this screenshot
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.800]   It would have had the new logo not the old logo therefore yeah was this being doctored or
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.760]   I'm not sure what the explanation ever was on that, but it certainly cast a pretty large shadow over it
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.360]   And I think the thing like I'm trying to remember who made the point but
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.360]   It's really irrelevant. I think to Trump
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.000]   whether any of this is true or not
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.960]   As it is so many times I think he gains or or he sort of wins
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   If we all spend a lot of time talking about whether it's true or not
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.740]   Like like I think his his game plan
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.720]   Consciously or subconsciously is just to raise doubt
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.160]   Yes, is there by it's you know is there a secret cabal that is against me?
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.840]   I don't know but we're looking into it, you know, and then that's it just throw it out there planning the seed
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.120]   Right classic classic discrediting kind of efforts there. Yeah
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:52.880]   Yeah, it makes sense and he I mean as as an individual he benefits from any confusion
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.640]   He can sew in this manner so it makes total sense. Yeah, and I guess I
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.720]   would like to
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.960]   talk about what the the congressional hearings today because
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.840]   Are they still ongoing but they just end I know I am not watching this woman
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:16.000]   The house one was going on I think before we started but it was wrapping up and Google
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.260]   Did not show up no one from Google showed up
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:26.800]   Well, Facebook and maybe the invisible person showed up because there was a chair there with Google's label on it and no one sitting in it
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.960]   So it's possible Google has some advanced technology and they were able to make someone invisible that was actually there
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.800]   But I doubt that happened it appears like a lot of not send anyone which is weird
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.240]   Yeah, someone said we haven't paid as much attention to an empty chair as when Clint Eastwood
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.840]   Exactly. I'm oh, I'm empty chair
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.320]   Talk to it. It would have been fun. Yeah, so okay, so the congressional hearing happening
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.040]   Obviously Google's absence Cheryl Samberg from Facebook Jack Dorsey from Twitter
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.880]   They're all there to sit on the hot seat
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.440]   They had invited either Eric Schmidt or
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.680]   Larry Page to sit down after
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.960]   Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, but there is a darn centaur. That's right. It was a dollar. Um and
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.120]   They instead offered up Kent Walker's the SVP of global affairs to which they said no
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:24.120]   We need someone more senior than that. We need you know Twitter and Facebook are doing it. Why aren't you and why is it?
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.160]   Yes, several companies. He's trying to run, but he showed up. Yeah
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.240]   He showed up
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.960]   Why do you think Google decided to bow this out?
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.880]   What do you think about them?
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.800]   They have a lot of other stuff going on and they may just be like trying to play
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.440]   one upmanship with these
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.640]   With Congress. I mean let's let's be real
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:52.740]   All these things all these hearings are are a chance for Congress to like grandstand and show off either a
[00:07:52.740 --> 00:08:00.040]   How ignorant they are about how the internet works or be berate people so honestly I
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:06.320]   Don't blame Google for being like yeah, we're gonna sit this one out
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.040]   I know that most people go to these but
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.040]   Yeah
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:18.680]   Yeah, and I know what you mean. I I have to say though. I think they made a mistake by not they may have going I
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.760]   Mean so even if some nargos he looks, you know
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.160]   Nice, he looks ashamed or whatever they want him to look
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.080]   He says he gives a statement
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:35.920]   He gives kind of vague answers to most of the questions, which is what Cheryl injected
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.440]   but he looks kind of
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.040]   Contrite or whatever boom like wind whereas now it's just
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:50.760]   Hey didn't show there's an empty chair look Cheryl and Jack are busy people, but they came
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.560]   Google has historically been very
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:04.640]   They're tech nerds they don't show up for BS and I mean they've done some BS, but for the most part I
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:13.400]   Just don't associate that with Google. You don't see them when when I see people at Google talking about politics and in the areas that I've covered
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:19.680]   it is very technical coverage their arguments are very oriented in like
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.240]   physics and the way things work and so
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.600]   It may just be
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.360]   At the same time they spend
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.720]   tens of millions of dollars on lobbying
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   Because that's what they want to send right but unfortunately, that's you know
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:44.280]   Like so now became a big thing can can't walk or might actually be the best guy to talk about the topics that
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:51.160]   The senator the house allegedly actually want to talk about but but the but he doesn't make enough of a statement about
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.440]   We got the heads of these things to come and bow before us
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.400]   Yeah, I'm curious to know I
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.080]   Mean they're there there've been strong words obviously
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.960]   throughout this and
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.960]   What was it? What did I read here?
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:18.160]   Did it the senator mark Warner says you know says during the hearing that these companies have all come a long way
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:25.760]   But they still have so much further to go and that Congress is going to have to take action here the era of the Wild West and social media
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:32.320]   Is coming to an end and I wonder if like I get what you're saying Stacy as far as Google just being like, you know
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.360]   What right it off? We know what we're gonna get if we go there at the same time like Google
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.920]   Has spent so much of its efforts
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.360]   lobbying to certain causes connected to this not being there at a
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.120]   What could potentially be a very pivotal point for the future of these companies?
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:55.360]   Basically removes Google from the conversation from being a part of where they get it from there
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.280]   Maybe they wouldn't maybe they wouldn't have any power to do much of anything anyways, but I don't know
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.680]   It just I wonder what that says about Google's kind of dedication to the
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:12.320]   Seriousness what's lobbyists are still talking to the people the senator's aides who are going to draft the legislation
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:19.680]   Google is not stepping away from the equation. All this is is Google saying, you know this public remonstration. I don't I'm not here for it
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.800]   They're still going to have the same
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:32.080]   Cred with the people who are actually making the laws when the time comes and they may be able to gamble on that being like, yeah
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.760]   We
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.600]   We don't need to be here, but I don't think this is going to really hurt them. I could be wrong
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.920]   But no everything I've followed in politics and how the laws get done
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.800]   It I'm not worried
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.560]   I wish what you said was true though because it would be awesome
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.640]   For like that to be true. Yeah. Yeah. Well
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:12:00.640]   And it was just a it was just a fleeting thought. I don't know how important these things end up being somewhere down
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.680]   But if they are theater
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.080]   But if they are theater, it still matters that you
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.200]   Show up for the performance in a way. I mean
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.560]   There could be senators who decide to make that right, you know, they're kind of go to
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:20.240]   Wipping stick for google. I do think that google is kind of trying to have in both ways
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.600]   To they're trying to you know a lot of their public statements have suggested that they're not really a
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:32.160]   Big part of this problem that it's and they they did that at the other hearings as well. Try to suggest that
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:40.240]   Well, we we're not really social networks like them and so it's mostly a facebook and twitter thing and kind of
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:45.840]   You know kind of wave their hands around and hope that nobody starts talking about youtube
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:51.040]   Um, which which is a big part of the problem is that the direct comparison, right?
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.240]   Like it's obvious
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.440]   We're we're used to hearing so much about facebook and twitter as the networks that have been
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.800]   Incredibly abused in this regard. Uh, I guess I guess that would be google's
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.520]   Definitely. Yeah, I mean
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:09.840]   Of worry like regardless of what trump says about search and the algorithm and all that that's
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.920]   Ridiculous, but the but youtube does have a problem and I think
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.120]   They have acknowledged it to some extent and tried to do things about it
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.560]   But they really don't like to talk about it, but it is a problem particularly misinformation-wise
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.040]   Just the same way facebook and twitter
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:35.440]   That actually brings me up. So I was inspired this weekend by I think it was a thread on twitter go figure
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.040]   but um
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.920]   It was based off of uh at kennifer is zenep to fecky is that how you say zenep?
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:48.880]   zenep, um, she she did an article back in march in the new york times on youtube being the great radicalizer
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.200]   And this thread basically talked about
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:58.000]   You know go through your kids youtube accounts because this is where a lot of this so I actually went through my daughter's history
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.480]   and started looking at some of the stuff that she was looking at and
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:08.320]   Probably 98 percent of it was fine, but there there were two things that I was like
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.680]   Oh
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:14.080]   This is like and again you guys know my daughter's obsessed with star stables the online horse game
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.440]   um
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.560]   This was like a star stables in group that um
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:27.120]   Was was not radicalizing her exactly, but it was promoting some really crazy ideas
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.240]   Uh, and I was like holy cow
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.480]   These people are nuts and my daughter may not recognize that they're nuts
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.200]   So I actually sat her down and talked to this talked about it with her and
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.200]   And
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.480]   I guess the the takeaway there is a if you have kids
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.240]   Especially in this kind of impressionable age range
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.280]   They really are putting
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.280]   crazy content everywhere
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.680]   and like
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:02.000]   It can be things like pita for example my my daughter had some wacky ideas about dog food for a while thanks to youtube
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.840]   um
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.600]   Some of them are kind of amusing and some of them are like really scary
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.680]   so
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.440]   And I don't I don't think it's just kids. I mean, I think there are lots of
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.080]   adults who may be their critical thinking faculties are not that great or
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:26.720]   You know youtube is just something they use for entertainment and I know I talked to giom shaslo. I think is his name a former
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.360]   youtube
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.800]   uh, recommendation algorithm engineer and he was describing how
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:37.920]   You know, it's only a couple of levels away from virtually any search
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.560]   Gets you some wacky conspiracy theory whether it's that the earth is flat or the moon landing never happened or
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:50.080]   9/11 was an inside job or it's really staggering. You don't have to go
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.200]   Like you don't have to go down the rabbit hole very far
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:16:01.280]   You only have to click a couple of links and all your recommended videos are kind of nut jobs and I mean that's bound to have an effect eventually
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.680]   Well, and I remember
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.960]   Coming into my first journalism class actually and the journalism professor
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.840]   He he sent us a
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.560]   It was the equivalent of a press release, but it was on paper
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.720]   and it was like
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.400]   It was a done in that format and it was that toothpaste was made with sugar
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.560]   and
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.960]   You know the whole thing it had like stats and whatever
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.400]   Associated with it and then we did and this was like literally the first day
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.080]   And he's like I need you guys to write something based on this this
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.520]   Press release. So you're an i'm your editor. You just got in here you go
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:40.160]   And most people just rewrote the press release and didn't question
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:47.600]   the the underlying fact that it was always that toothpaste is causing too many uh cavities because of
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.560]   the high sugar content. No one
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:59.440]   Very few people asked wait, does toothpaste really have sugar and right so it was a really interesting exercise in
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:03.680]   Thinking critically and yes, whatever
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.840]   And I think we probably should do more of that
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.880]   Yeah, we definitely should we definitely should then and I think the
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.360]   You know we a lot of attention gets focused on
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   uh the big stuff like russians and
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.480]   the iranians or whoever trying to manipulate
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.160]   This or that facebook group, but I think there is a lot of kind of
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:34.960]   Low level misinformation of all kinds with I mean vaccines and autism is is one example
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.520]   There's a staggering number of people
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.160]   at least staggering to me
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:46.320]   Who believe that vaccines are bad for you and they believe that there's scientific evidence to show this
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.120]   um, and it's so it's not just
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:55.280]   It's not just the big stuff that kind of gets headlines. There's a lot of just crazy
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:02.720]   WAC job conspiracy series out there and I think there's a very receptive audience for them and these tools
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.520]   You know, there were conspiracy theories all the
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.280]   throughout history, but
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:13.760]   You didn't used to be able to share them so widely and spread them so quickly for virtually nothing
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:19.840]   Yeah, the worldwide community kind of aspect that that every little pocket of of
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.120]   Obsession or belief or whatever
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.880]   There is throughout the world any number of people that also
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:32.160]   Agree with that or buy into that thought and the internet is a way to connect that
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.880]   The other thing that
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:40.000]   That is really powerful is because I mean if you go on any parenting blog, you will find people who
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.400]   I don't care what the science says when I gave little jimmy his vaccine. He turned weird the next day
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.000]   I mean, I'm not I'm not kidding. That's that's out there. Yeah
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.040]   anyway, so um
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.040]   Where will we go in with all this so congress? I feel like we're in congress because we're not
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.600]   Anything
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.640]   What are these to act? What do they need to do?
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.680]   What do we have what are what are they going to do? What are they threatening to do?
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:15.040]   What so those are two different questions. What should they do versus what are they going to do? Yeah, and I you know, I'm
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.000]   I keep trying to um
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.720]   remind myself that
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:28.880]   There are actually so yes misinformation is clearly a problem troll Russian trolls and foreign actors are clearly a problem
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.240]   But the solutions could actually wind up being worse
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.360]   in some ways than the problem and if we
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:39.440]   If we put so much pressure on facebook and twitter and google
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.040]   To solve this problem and or we have
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:49.360]   Legislation designed to solve this problem. We could wind up in a you know a really bad place where
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:56.560]   the government's trying to legislate truth or legislate who's allowed to say things or
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:01.280]   Facebook and google are you know effectively deciding who has
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:09.440]   A place to say things and which things are allowed to be set and that's you know, that's a dangerous road to go down
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.480]   Yeah, absolutely
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.440]   This is kind of ties in with another kind of thread of news
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:24.000]   Today about attorney general jeff sessions who has apparently been meeting with state attorneys general
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.160]   this month
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:31.360]   About these companies saying they're intentionally stifling free speech just go back into the free speech discussion
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.600]   We had just a few moments ago
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.680]   Their statement said there's a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:44.640]   Intentionally stifling the the free exchange of ideas on their platforms and that they're you know, that it potentially
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.000]   There they would move to do what you're talking about to
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.200]   legislate around this to or regulate around it rather and what is the
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.880]   kind of the long-term ratification of that from a freedom of expression standpoint
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:03.600]   When the government comes in to say all right well, we're gonna gain control of this platform now
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.800]   And these are the things you can and cannot say and uh, yeah that really
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.640]   Change
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:16.080]   That's wrapped up with section 230, you know the communication decency act that protects
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:22.240]   the platforms for speech that appears there there's all sorts of pressure inside washington to
[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:25.120]   weaken or soften
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:31.520]   Or even get rid of certain parts of section 230 and force the platforms to be responsible
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:36.160]   For the content so you know, that's a double edged sword. It could be
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.280]   Good in the sense that you could hold them to account for certain types of speech
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.520]   but it could also be
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:45.200]   Bad because they are
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:51.920]   They would kind of then go out of their way to remove speech because they'd be afraid of being sued or or having you know
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   Uh the government come down on them
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:22:00.800]   God, this is such a hard problem sitting here thinking and I don't want the government involved
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.200]   maybe if the government
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:06.080]   Or we had a truly authoritative
[00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:13.520]   Thing that the business models are the problem and and honestly the business problems are the business model is what got us in this
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:15.040]   role and
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.240]   Trouble kind of in the first place because it heavily incentivizes
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:24.240]   clicks and pushes up content that that generates excitement basically
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.800]   So i'm like what we really need it's like a government funded encyclopedia
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.560]   It doesn't really need to be government funded, but you you basically
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:39.040]   You need a place for authoritative information. You need a populace that is educated
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.240]   So one way to deal with this is teach people a little bit better and add this to the curriculum
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:50.480]   And the federal government does have a stake in curriculum. Thanks to you know the common core stuff
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.680]   Uh rules whatever those are
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.440]   Um, so that's one aspect and then another would be something
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.720]   I don't know along the lines of
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.520]   Libraries or a place where you can
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.120]   You can get authoritative information
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:13.600]   Some people even if you teach them how don't want to think for themselves though, so I don't really know what to do about those people
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.320]   And I think that you I mean part of the problem is that people
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:24.480]   Think they are getting authoritative information because they're reading Breitbart or watching Fox News
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:26.960]   They they would say on a survey
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.520]   You know, I trust these outlets to give me the information that i'm looking for and they
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:38.320]   Have the correct worldview and uh, so i'm totally taken care of information wise and they would be wrong
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.960]   But they but they firmly believe that
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:47.440]   And there are also a lot of people who you know, obviously there's a lot of mistrust in mainstream media
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:54.160]   And so where they where a lot of people end up turning is places like youtube where they find an independent voice
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:59.120]   That that they trust that they say is more trustworthy than the mainstream media
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.720]   Arguably probably because their worldview matches
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:09.520]   The the viewers worldview and yeah, that's just a big challenge. Maybe and I think that's why trust is so hard
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.680]   Yeah to you know every media outlet says well, we
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:19.040]   We're trusted by our readers and so that's what we base our business on is trust
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:24.480]   And i'm sure they believe that um, but there's just as many people who don't trust them maybe more
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.840]   There are people who trust implicitly outlets that are publishing just outright lies
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.600]   Because those lies can form to kind of the way they see the world
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:39.760]   And then facebook shows them lots of other outlets like that because that's what it does
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:45.520]   You know, it's a confirmation bias machine sure and all the engagement metrics are
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.040]   You know oriented to and I thought that was one thing that
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.960]   Kamala hair is
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.400]   In particular brought up
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.560]   You know that it is the business model that and that's where I was going with the
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.160]   The piece that I wrote about it that why did this take so long?
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.240]   Why did it take 10 years for us to even start talking about?
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.800]   How these platforms could be used for for ill instead of good?
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   Because the business model didn't encourage thinking about that
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:20.000]   All you all you want is clicks and engagement and comments and likes and and emojis and so on
[00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:25.760]   And what you know, there's that famous comment from the former facebook news feed engineer
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.600]   What facebook cares about is engagement and you know, what's really engaging bull
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:40.800]   Yeah, there was a no no consideration it seems on the scale to which a lot of this would happen
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.240]   um
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:46.240]   You know, it always seemed like no matter how successful an internet company was
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:52.880]   There were other ones out there to kind of keep one from becoming, you know a multi-billion user
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.720]   Uh service like facebook has just as one example
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.960]   It's just the scale that we're dealing with now is so completely different compared to anything
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:06.880]   We've seen before as relates to the internet that poses a huge challenge and I don't I don't maybe maybe they should have seen that
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:13.840]   Down, you know years ago and and planned for an eventuality of something along those lines, but apparently
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.920]   I mean, I think they were told
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.360]   You know, they were told it's not like so mark planning about this forever
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.840]   Yeah for years and so it's not like mark, dr. Burke can say well
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.520]   No one was talking about it. So we didn't know we were going to be that lots of people
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.200]   Lots of people were talking about it about the potential downsides and they chose not to pay attention to it
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:40.000]   Maybe the solution is to do what so many uh apparently some
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:45.360]   Pew has pew research has a study and says many americans anyways
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.040]   Are changing their relationship with facebook just as one example
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.040]   They say more than half of in their survey
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.000]   More than half facebook users 18 and older have changed their privacy settings in the past year
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.400]   42 percent have said they've taken weeks long breaks from facebook
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.760]   26 said they've deleted their accounts and
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:11.520]   4% of all the people they asked said they've done at least one of these things over the course of last year
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:14.480]   That's a lot of deletions. That is a lot of the likes
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:22.000]   Yeah, that is that is surprising. Um, I guess we'll see that in facebook's numbers, which I would think oh
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.840]   Crikey, you're gonna have last of last earnings was so terrible imagine this coming one
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:34.400]   Yeah, but the question is are they getting enough users in new markets to sort of make up or
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:41.360]   You know a certain percentage deleting and it feels like they're running out of really highly internet connected places
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.920]   like they
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.920]   I'm like there's seven billion people on earth. They estimate like 3.2
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.520]   Don't have access to high quality internet connections that are kind of constant
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.160]   And facebook is at where is it?
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:59.440]   Anyone what how many members it has died are now facebook
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.440]   2.2
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.400]   2.2
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:07.040]   Okay, 2.2 billion so that's a pretty narrow gap and you got to think some of those people
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:13.040]   A probably aren't that interested or B might be an authoritarian regimes so they can't get on it
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.600]   So yeah, they're they might be hitting close to their ceiling. That's why they're like hey
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.960]   Let's invent new ways to get people on the internet. Yep. That's why they want to get into China so badly. Yeah
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.840]   Absolutely
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.840]   So that's okay. So that's changing
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.240]   I mean it really seems like a lot of the younger users are the ones who are more likely to do these
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.880]   Accountability and everything there's actually also another story in here. There's totally related down at the bottom on
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.120]   Generation z
[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.120]   and about this kind of growing
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:45.040]   desire to log off to disconnect, you know that they're
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.560]   They're finding that their relationships and in
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.680]   You know in the real world are not as as fulfilling as they should be and they
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.400]   kind of point to the use of these social
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:02.160]   Media platforms as as part of the reason why so in many ways that would be
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.240]   Happening. I don't know how I wish I could read that article
[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:12.800]   I was thinking if we could if we only have one really truly screwed up generation
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.480]   Which is the millennials that you know without would be okay
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.560]   We'll figure out how to in the grand historical arc
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.160]   There'll be some sort of chart and it'll be like now will be like this huge dip
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:30.240]   And then it'll be back up and right it'll it'll even out as we figure out
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:34.720]   I mean because I do think I mean these things do take a little bit of time to be like whoa
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.280]   That probably wasn't good for anybody
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.040]   Uh, I mean everything from you know, I don't know
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.080]   Television, you know, we had to learn some
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:52.000]   Moderation and things. I mean we had to build a rating system and I just but there's more television than there's ever
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:59.200]   Being there. I'm not saying that there may not be more social media than ever, but I think we will figure out ways to
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:08.560]   Police police it may not be the right words, but to label it or to help it help people understand the effects on them
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:15.200]   Healthier relationships with it. Yeah, and it does feel like we're we're kind of I mean we are still so
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.560]   Early in even the web let alone social networks. I mean
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.200]   it's such it's like a
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.280]   fraction of a second in sort of
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:30.000]   Internet time or world time and so I think in a lot of ways we are still trying to figure out
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.480]   How does this work like the early days of the telephone or the telegraph or television or you know?
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.280]   I was reading about I think it was
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.880]   Revolving doors were apparently a huge social
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.600]   Policy issue because no one could figure out how to use them and there was no kind of
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:53.680]   Way to go in and out of a revolving door. There's no there was no etiquette
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   So some so people had to like research it and then decide oh, this is how you go through a revolving door
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:04.160]   And it sounds ridiculous now, but you know, maybe we're still
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:10.000]   Maybe we're still developing kind of you know a common
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.760]   Etiquette or language about how to do these things and we're so
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:20.560]   We're like right after the invention of gummy bears or something everybody wanted to eat gummy bears all day long
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:26.240]   And you know eventually people figured out that's not really good sticky sugar is not a good thing for your teeth
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:28.400]   Yeah
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:36.400]   Think about how many relationships have broken up over whether to roll the toilet paper over the roll or under
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.640]   You know these things they got it. They got to get figured out at some point
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:44.240]   I don't know if anyone still knows the answer. Everybody knows over the top is right
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.160]   Over the top
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:50.880]   Everybody knows I think that's established. Yeah, that is established. All right. You're my daughter
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.040]   That's settled. That's settled case law
[00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.680]   The over the top as far as that's concerned
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:01.600]   All right, uh, that's about as political as I think today's show is going to get maybe after the break
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:07.280]   We'll have some stories that aren't quite so politically charged, but uh, it's you know, it's the top news. I would say
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.720]   So
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:14.080]   Absolutely necessary to discuss so we got it out of the way for those of you trying to avoid the politics on the show
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:19.120]   Let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this episode that we'll get back into more this episode of this week in google
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.960]   Is brought to you by rocket mortgage by quickalones?
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.520]   Uh, you've all kind of been paying attention. I'm sure to interest rates
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.400]   There's a whole lot of rising happening there expecting more rising to happen by the end of the year
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.400]   So the trend is up right now
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:38.080]   Uh, there's a lot of unpredictability when that happens. You don't really know what's going to happen
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.840]   You don't know if now is the time to jump or whether you wait to buy a home
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:47.440]   At that causes anxiety. It's not the easiest thing to kind of maneuver or manage
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:52.720]   So, you know, you want you want someone that's going to help you through the processing and inspire confidence
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:59.840]   Uh that you're doing the right thing. Well, our friends at quickalones are doing something about that and they call it the power buying process
[00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.440]   It's actually very simple and very powerful for you
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:07.680]   Uh step one is you answer a few simple questions
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:12.640]   And they're going to then check your credit for a pre-qualified approval
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:17.920]   So step two quickalones will verify your income your assets and your credit
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:22.720]   It only takes less than 24 hours to do that and they'll give you a verified approval
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:29.760]   And this actually gives you the strength of a cash buyer and that's I mean, that's that's the best when you're looking for a home
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.280]   Being a cash buyer is as good as it gets
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.920]   Uh, so it's super powerful to have that step three
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:42.720]   Once you've verified you qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:48.160]   Now what that means is that they're going to lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:51.440]   So whatever the rate was right then it's locked in place
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:54.240]   If uh, the fed raises interest rates
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.200]   Your rate is not going to go up within those 90 days
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.000]   And then here's an even better part if rates happen to go up like I said it's going to stay the same
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.840]   But if rates go down
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:10.960]   Your rate also drops so no matter what your you win and that's uh, that's pretty awesome
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:16.080]   They can do that. It's the kind of thinking that you'd expect from america's largest mortgage lender
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.760]   So to get started you want to go to rocket mortgage dot com slash twig
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:27.040]   Rate shield approval is only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:33.440]   Additional conditions or exclusions may apply so you want to check that out based on quickalones data in comparison
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:40.400]   to public data records equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states nmls consumer access dot org
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:47.760]   Number 30 30 that's rocket mortgage dot com slash twig twig put that in there get the uh
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.880]   Get it all locked up and enjoy your new home
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.840]   When when the dust settles anyways, uh, all right
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.240]   so
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.240]   moving from
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:05.520]   Kind of what's going on in the congressional hearings on to other google things which
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.680]   Feel feel maybe a little less important. Are you are either of you guys?
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.760]   um kind of
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:16.240]   Anticipating the new pixel announcements whenever they may be the new pixel phones
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:22.720]   I mean, I want to see them, but i'm not going to buy a new phone. I don't think what is your phone right now?
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:27.360]   It's a pixel too. So I usually i'm a die hard two years because i'm not
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.960]   obsessive
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.520]   Over updating phones. I get it. Yes
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:39.200]   Sorry, I think if I didn't do it for a living if I didn't do, you know review phones here for a living
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.040]   I probably would do the same. I would yeah
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.920]   I mean ask me how long how often I changed my thermostat or light switches and I got a totally different answer
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.960]   Every few weeks. Wow. That's so opposite for me
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.240]   So, yeah, I'm like I know it's that yeah
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.120]   What about you, matthew? What are you using right now?
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.960]   I have the sim sung s7
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:02.560]   Which is smashed beyond
[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:09.120]   Believe and you're ready to have function well in a bunch of different ways. So yeah, I'm definitely ready to upgrade
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.720]   And I i'm really interested in the pickle pixel. I've always liked
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.960]   the phones
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.560]   It sounds like
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.560]   It's going to be a great phone
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:21.360]   To be honest, I was looking at the
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.360]   I don't know if you guys you've probably talked about these the walway p20. I was looking at that
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.240]   Um purely for the camera
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.800]   Yeah, yeah, the p20 has a great camera
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:38.960]   Um from what I understand I haven't had a much personal experience with the p20 but um
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.520]   does walway have
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.280]   Have any have significant retail presence in canada
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:49.360]   Like so we while way out in the wild in canada
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:53.440]   You see them. Yeah, and in fact, I've seen I know
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:59.680]   Lots of people not lots of people but there's a significant number who have them they used to be
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:06.160]   In best buy but of course they're not going to be anymore, right? So that's probably going to reduce their visibility quite a bit
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.440]   Yeah, yeah, I mean walway is a gigantic brand
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.960]   Worldwide it's just here in in north america where it's kind of
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.720]   Pinged off, you know as far as that's concerned. It's harder for it
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.160]   And I did say people say oh, you can't buy a walway. That's a chinese phone
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.480]   um, you know, they're going to be tracking your text messages or
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.280]   whatever and uh
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.680]   And I said, you know, I
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:34.080]   I probably should care about that, but I don't
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:43.520]   So like if they want to save my text messages or i'm not involved in any kind of, you know secret government projects that I know of so
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.920]   I don't
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.120]   I just don't think they would learn anything interesting. Yeah, yeah
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:54.560]   Well, it sounds like you're in the two-year camp then and as well with your device. So that's good. Yeah
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.680]   That's good. Are your two years are up. Yeah
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:01.360]   If the smash screen was any it wasn't an indication
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:08.080]   Uh, and maybe a whole bunch of other hosts a host of reasons but so basically the pixel three
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:11.120]   I think you guys talked last week about this whole like Ukrainian
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:16.960]   Black market like leak of pixel three phones. We basically know everything about it at this point
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:22.880]   We do now. I was curious does it it still has the fingerprint pick or fingerprint reader on the back
[00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:28.720]   But I know some of the sam-sung phones are according to some body having them on the front
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.480]   So sam-sung
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:39.600]   Well, there's been an ongoing rumor and I don't know when this is going to happen or if sam-sung is even going to follow through on it
[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:44.640]   But it's possible that it would happen with the s10 that they would have a fingerprint sensor
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:49.440]   In the front underneath the display so it wouldn't be a separate button on the front
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.680]   It would just be exist underneath the glass which there are other phones that have done this
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.240]   Uh, but not really a mainstream like
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.680]   You know premium smartphone from one of the major
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.920]   Manufacturers has done this yet and I think the rumor is that there have been patents
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.200]   Well, that's not a rumor. There have been patents that sam-sung has filed
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.400]   Uh for in display fingerprint sensing
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:15.040]   Um, the question is whether that's actually going to appear on one of their future phones
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:21.360]   Okay, I would buy the pixel three if it had wireless charging like good wireless charging
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.600]   I think I think you'll have wireless charging
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.800]   Yeah, it looks like they might and so then I'm like, oh that kind of changes things for me
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.440]   Yeah, and see wireless charging is one of those things that I've never I've never really kind of
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:40.480]   Excellent I mean I've used it a handful of times, but it's nothing that I've invested in let's say I still plug in that always slower
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.800]   Like is it gonna be anywhere?
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.320]   Yeah
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.560]   So it's a good overnight on the night table
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.920]   Yeah, exactly that's what I use it is overnight. Yeah, that's it. See that's what I I just want to like
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:57.120]   Get a charging pad basically and stick it somewhere and then be able to put my headphones
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.080]   My watches my everything because like
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.720]   You know right now I I have many different varieties of
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:11.200]   Charger and there was that thing right there was the pad but you had to add these
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:16.000]   Stickers. I'm not gonna add stickers. Yeah, yeah, a case a certain case
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.480]   No stickers
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:22.560]   Don't add stickers sam song actually on there at their note nine announcement
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:29.360]   They showed off a piece of hardware that was like a dual charging station. So it would charge your phone and your watch but
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:37.920]   But yeah, I mean I think the dream the the hopeful destination is some sort of larger pad that is big enough to drop through your four devices on
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:45.280]   Well, wasn't someone was working on wireless charging through the air where they know there was a startup. Oh you beam
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:48.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever happened to that
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:51.360]   Um, they're probably
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.960]   I suffer. Oh, okay
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:56.720]   The hardest part about wireless charging through the air is it tends to generate
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.680]   You know, it's it's not as efficient one and it generates heat. So you'd hate to cook people
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.440]   We do have of course tesla was working on wireless
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:13.680]   Electricity and we already have that it's called lightning and uh, it's very unsafe. So yeah, that didn't work out so well. That's true
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:20.800]   Yeah, so you know little frightened of uh of a walking into a room where everything inside of it is changing
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.400]   You know, they're actually very
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.680]   Very low power chips that use wifi to recharge thing
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:34.720]   So it's a energy harvesting mechanism that people are researching using wifi too
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:40.640]   But it's it's super low power. It's not like it's not gonna be charging your phone anytime
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.680]   Huh, but maybe your water wouldn't hurt
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:51.040]   It'd be more like a like a motion sensor or something that maybe not even something that big but like a temperature sensor
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.440]   Right, I have to admit it bugs me. So I have the moato 360
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.560]   a second generation watch and I
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:03.120]   You know, I'm always not where the charger thing is and so then
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.000]   I I wish I could just
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.160]   Put it down or or even plug it into a regular usb or do something
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:16.240]   Instead of like you're in the car or something. Well, I'm not gonna bring the little stand thing that charges fit
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:23.200]   Yeah, that is super annoying that like hockey puck stand up thing. Yeah, you have to set it into and
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.000]   Yeah, super proprietary
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.560]   Yeah, no super proprietary no
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.840]   No, but everybody wants proprietary
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:36.480]   So we all wanted to not be proprietary and they all wanted to be the people making it
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:44.640]   Yeah, yeah, we are like consumers are so screwed. I'm like god tech. We really just like hose that up real bad
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.560]   Yeah
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.280]   We are track records. Not not so hot right now
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:54.240]   Uh, so yes, so pixel three three excel apparently hit the FCC so
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:43:00.320]   And in that filing it looks like they did call out something that a wireless charge the wireless charging
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.320]   So I think you're gonna be happy with that
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.400]   um, yeah
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:10.640]   And I'm hearing a lot of people like like the three excel has well and all about android
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   We don't call it a notch. We call it a bucket
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.040]   Uh
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.040]   The pretty deep notch
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.680]   Uh, okay. A bucket is a deep notch. Thank you. Right
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.320]   Uh
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:30.720]   So it has a bucket up at the top, but the pixel three non-excel does not so I'm seeing a lot of people who are like seeing these early leaks and thinking
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:35.120]   Yeah, well, I'm gonna go for the smaller one. You know, you you make some concessions there within the display
[00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.560]   I don't think you could have a not but or gouge or bucket
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.360]   Why does the larger one have a notch?
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.960]   Yeah
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.760]   I mean, I think they're doing it a because you know as app because apple did it
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.920]   Uh, be they're doing it because there's this constant push towards bezel-less
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:55.120]   And if you have a notch then you can get the majority of the display out there
[00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:56.960]   Close to the bezel. Yeah
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.360]   I just find it for best dating that
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.520]   That a notch which is something arguably negative
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:06.800]   Is people are copying it?
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.080]   Because apple has what so if apple had
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:16.640]   When apple dumped the headphone jack, but everyone not everyone but many companies copied that too. Yeah. Yeah
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:19.280]   It's just a rest of revenue
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:23.200]   Everyone can hate it and then everyone copies it because it's apple
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:27.120]   Yeah, people get used to it with apple and then they think this is weird. This phone has no notch
[00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:33.120]   I need a not to market power and consumers getting hosed again. See see it was so short. We were like food
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:39.680]   But also but also it's how people can perceive things differently. So if apple does it
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.720]   It's going to be good. So even the fact that it's actually a kind of
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:44.960]   Clergy solution to something
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:51.120]   Right, it looks great because apple does it so that everybody perceives it as a benefit somehow even though it's clearly not
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.520]   It's a transitional thing
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:45:00.800]   Yet, I think there are some hardware manufacturers that see it as a gamble, right? Like apple has a pretty good track record of doing
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:06.960]   Certain things that may or may not have been done before but then put but then making it more popular
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.880]   Just by doing it. And so I'm sure some of these manufacturers are like well
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:15.120]   Let's take a bet on some of our devices. What do that too? And if our cells are
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:20.080]   Really impressive as a result that we know we we bet correct. Yeah, you know
[00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.360]   I use must have happened
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:28.720]   I just want to point out that high heels were originally a thing for men
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:32.560]   I am women actually adopted them. I did not know that
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.480]   Yeah, really
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:39.600]   They were mostly for riding horses. Uh, and so a lot of loyalty had high heels
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:43.040]   Oh interesting. So it's our fault. And they kept your clothes out of the bud
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.000]   True
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.320]   And they showed that that you did not need um that you didn't have to walk very far. It was all part of this. I'm so lazy
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:58.400]   Not lazy. I'm so privileged. I don't have to walk and kind of like with the chinese long fingernails
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.360]   I'm so privileged. I don't have to use my hands work
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.920]   Right exactly right
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.560]   Okay, are either of you smart watchwares? Oh
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:12.320]   No, you you mentioned the moto you mentioned them. Uh, the the moto 360
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.880]   What about you? I know it's not
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:18.800]   Super popular, but oh, it's just like it. Yeah, exactly
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:24.320]   The main reason I got it was because it was cheap and it was circular and I didn't want to watch that was square
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:31.920]   So yeah, um and do you use a fit bit? You have the tip it. Okay. Well, apparently all these rumors
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.440]   I don't know why we expect that rumors are gonna happen because
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:41.680]   Uh, there was an exclusive that the pixel watch from efah anyways that the pixel watch is not going to happen
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.880]   It's not gonna happen this year anyway
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.520]   So if you were holding out for a pixel watch at the event that still is not yet announced
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.000]   Even though I feel like we know so much about it already
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:56.800]   Uh wait longer because there will be no pixel watch though. They're why why don't they have one yet?
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.200]   I thought it was so
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.960]   Qualcomm had it they they use a Qualcomm chip in reference design in there
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.280]   So some people were talking about how Qualcomm
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.440]   Didn't have a chip ready, but then Qualcomm did release their chip
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:11.280]   So
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.520]   I don't know what the hold on this it may just be like
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.600]   Screw it. Nobody's buying this thing. Everybody's apples won this war with their
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:22.800]   Inexplicable apple watch remember how we used to all make fun of it back in the day when it came out
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:28.400]   I still do make fun of it. I I mean, I don't I don't need it, but you know, yeah
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:35.280]   Well, google says they they're not interested in developing a watch yet because there's no perfect watch for everyone
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:41.760]   There isn't well, and this is this is what's going to happen if we let the tech people
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:44.800]   like dictate
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.960]   We're gonna suddenly be living in a world where
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:50.320]   Driven by instead of customization and kind of
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.400]   In I craft sensibilities and artisanal blah blah blah
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:48:02.560]   May not make sense and feels kind of pretentious, but right now we do have lots of options in things like jewelry and clothing and furniture
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.840]   And in the tech world, that's terrible
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:07.680]   You know
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:10.160]   so unless we get like this really
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.440]   Huge push towards modular modulae
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.600]   What's the word of modules?
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:20.800]   Modularity or modules that you can just pop into things and design that kind of functionality into
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:31.840]   Everything so your appliances or whatever's you're gonna get this weird stupid tech obsolescence focused change it every couple years model
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:34.400]   And we're gonna hate life
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:38.960]   And this is my sort of nightmare of you know, I feel like
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:42.240]   Everything is going to look like
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:46.800]   The instant messaging world did when you couldn't talk to another person
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.680]   Unless you used their instant messaging service
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:57.680]   So when there were three or four and they were all battling except it'll be light bulbs and stoves and cars
[00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.280]   and
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.880]   classes and
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:05.040]   implantable chips or whatever and so you won't you know, I think that's a world apple
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:09.520]   Would like to have where you just use apple stuff and if you don't use apple stuff too bad
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:13.040]   If you want your stuff to work with some apple stuff forget it
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:18.240]   You guys have depressed me again
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.240]   We keep going here
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.800]   We're just like the negative we're just
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:26.720]   They're gonna be everything is gonna work properly
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.440]   someone that someone I know
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.760]   mentioned that it was a
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.920]   T design failure
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:38.480]   That john luke bacard has to specify what he gets every single time
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.640]   And you know, I never thought of that but it is
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:44.800]   Shouldn't it know by now how many cups of tea has the man ordered for kat's sake?
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.920]   You know, it's the 25th century. Yeah, there should be some sort of predictive tea algorithm in there
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.560]   It's like oh, you
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.440]   Okay, so the last 10 days come out at 4 30 right
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:50:03.760]   I listened to a google product engineer talk about this. This is actually really interesting. Um, it was art space
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:06.720]   Not john luke bacard, but it's so close
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.880]   So it's talking about when to use
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:15.040]   Algorithms to predict things and take action. So he said if you're hold on. I'm gonna. I'm even gonna
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.600]   Article so I don't screw up his percentages because this was actually really
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.800]   It ties directly to what you're talking about. Um, if you are
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:30.400]   Uh, nine. Oh, oh, okay. Talk about something while I google go go
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:34.720]   This is what happens when stacey goo was
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.800]   Okay, here we go
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.560]   appropriate tea
[00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:40.080]   Why?
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:43.840]   Well, okay. Yeah, I'm not gonna question his tea things his tea
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:49.040]   So he says there he he divides it into three things so a curated experience
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.080]   So think about things like netflix or suggesting songs
[00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:58.320]   From pandaora. He says your ai model should be 70 confident. It has the quote unquote right answer
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:01.920]   Okay, the next one is a corrective experience
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.160]   so like
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.840]   if like
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:11.520]   A light is on and there's like a motion sensor on a light is his example. So if you're sitting there
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.440]   um
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:17.920]   And the lights go off you can actually wave your hand and the lights turn on
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:24.080]   So you can correct it pretty easily. So in those cases you need to have an 85 percent confidence interval
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:30.880]   And if you actually want to do something that's going to cost money for something or a cost a resource
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.960]   So like dispensing a cup of tea
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:39.680]   You need to have that be like 99 percent accurate. That's fair. That's that's predictive
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:46.640]   But I would argue john luke meets that test. I mean he drinks a billion cups of tea
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:51.440]   He's been a starship captain for probably years
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.480]   You know they should figure out that he is
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:01.120]   What he wants? Yeah, he's old enough. So his his age could come into into the factor
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:06.720]   Into the math equation. That's a great point. Oh, but predict. Yeah, he says it seems to be five nines confidence interval
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:14.800]   So yeah, that's ridiculous. I mean you may for most people you won't even have that that amount of data to even give them that john luke per card. Yes
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:22.640]   Just before he dies. He'll be like here's your black tea cold and then he'll die
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:29.840]   But yeah, I mean I think that's I know that we're always like oh this should anticipate this
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:36.880]   But as someone who's built like who's tried to program automations and my house and stuff. This is actually a really
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:44.560]   It's a tough problem to solve and I don't think I mean I know that's where we're like, oh, how should you just know this but
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:51.680]   Well, and I do know if the I don't want the people running the advertising algorithms to
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.720]   To do that because then
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.800]   They'll just suggest things that you just bought or they'll suggest
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:02.960]   The tow fungus cream or whatever that they get paid a lot to suggest
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:05.200]   You know, there's there's no
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.040]   Like
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:13.520]   Those ads the amount of data that facebook takes in should be able to serve me the most targeted ads and I still get crap
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:18.480]   And it's still would you like to buy the pair of shoes that you literally just bought
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:26.640]   That's always the example, but it's always so true like still that and that seems like the easiest one for them to like not
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:31.520]   Yeah, and every website does it. Yeah, every website you go to
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:38.080]   Maybe just don't shop online enough. I see a variety of products based on all of my shopping history
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:43.440]   I don't know I shop online a lot, but a lot of a lot of times. It's it's just through amazon
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.440]   So maybe that's my limiting fact. Yeah, you know, oh, yeah, you need to go to other places
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:54.560]   I mean I get I get ads for anthropology. I get ads for servers. I get ads for like
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:58.160]   Plus the sharing of I don't know if this is true, but
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.080]   It feels like the sharing of actual acquisition behavior
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:08.560]   Is not as so there's lots of sharing of hey you search for this or you went to this page and it's about this
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:16.240]   But there isn't a whole lot of sharing of you acquired this at a specific because everybody wants to hang on to that data. I guess
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.560]   Because it's so important
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:22.480]   Because I think it's so important. I argue that actually a lot of this data is
[00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:27.360]   Not just useless, but it's actively irritating. So yeah, I agree
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:33.200]   And they tout the benefits, but I don't know doesn't feel like a whole lot of benefits there
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:35.360]   You were talking about automation a little bit
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:41.680]   Kind of ties into an amazon announcement, which when I read this I was like, oh, this this Stacy probably
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:44.960]   This might be right up your alley amazon announced support for
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.240]   Contact and motion sensors with its
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:52.880]   We just talked about that this morning. Okay. I'm sorry. I just totally got excited finish your saying good
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.280]   Excellent. That's what I was hoping for
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:55:00.240]   So, I mean, yeah, I mean it's just tying into the capabilities of automation in your home
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.320]   So open the door for example
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.400]   For home automate as a trigger for
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:11.840]   Oh a home automation. Maybe that you know sets something else off when a contact is is removed from a motion
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:17.440]   Sensor or a zigbee sensor. I'm not really quite sure. Maybe you should describe it because I feel like i'm a little confident
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.120]   Okay, you're so excited so go for it
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:25.680]   Amazon Amazon has created an api for manufacturers
[00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:29.120]   So this isn't for you and I this is going to be companies that make products
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:35.440]   They can add this to their mattel meh a there. Do we say the name here on the show? What do we do? No, we don't
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:41.280]   I like I like mattem a let's just do that that that works. All right. So the mattem a is
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:48.400]   So your skill will have this so the first company that is doing something with it is smart things
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:53.440]   So if you have one of two zigbee related smart things sensors, you can actually
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:57.440]   They've are you can actually bring them into an amazon routine
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:03.600]   So that's one the other is the amazon echo plus which has the zigbee radio in it
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:05.760]   but so far
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:09.360]   It's only works with the central light and salvania sensors
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:10.800]   so
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.640]   Really what this is is a notification to all the manufacturers of
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.080]   zigbee devices basically hey
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:22.480]   You could totally tie your sensors in and I am really excited about it
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.960]   but
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:31.040]   This is my one beef with the amazon this okay. I have lots of beefs actually, but this is a big one
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:34.160]   Every time they do this because it's so key smeal
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:41.200]   I have to go through and rewrite and rename and redo routines and it drives me absolutely bonkers
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:43.200]   so
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.480]   That is how I feel about that and I have not tried this out with my
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:52.560]   One smart thing sensor that can use it yet. So I I don't I haven't done it yet. That's the other part
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:56.960]   So what would be the benefit like walk me through what what would it allow me to do?
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:07.360]   So I could create a routine it basically gives amazon the ability that a lot of like smart home platforms already have so like if I have
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.320]   Certain types of hubs
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:12.320]   I can already like program
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.080]   uh
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.040]   When detecting motion at a certain time
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.880]   uh
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:23.760]   Turn on the porch light right okay, so that gives you that kind of routine
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:29.600]   I still don't know how that's going to be implemented as an amazon routine
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:32.640]   So that's that's the part where I'm like I need to play with it and try it
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:37.120]   But I haven't been home since well. I've been home a day, but I haven't done it yet
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:42.720]   I know i'm so lazy not good enough. Yeah, come on get on get on the ball
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:47.280]   I was installing light switches this afternoon and yesterday. I was kind of trying to figure out where I was
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:54.960]   Yeah, I like the idea of triggering other things with these sensors. I think I actually I was reading through this
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:57.120]   I was like yeah, google home needs to have this too
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:00.240]   Obviously that's how I feel. Yeah, they all will
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:07.760]   Eventually so what what they need to develop in what i'm unclear as if this is going to do something like this is
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.240]   You could just tell
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:16.160]   Hey madam a if my front door bell camera sees motion
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:19.840]   Do this and then it actually writes that routine for you
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:28.240]   That would be amazing. Yeah, and that's where they're trying to get to but I don't know if that I don't think this actually does that so
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.640]   bummer
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.000]   Yet
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.160]   Yeah, that's going to happen. Yeah
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:36.480]   It will happen
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.480]   It will happen
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:42.400]   Speaking of amazon one trillion dollars
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:48.880]   To do this thing, but yeah, there you go. That's all right. I'm not i'm not sitting in leo's doctor evil chair
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:51.520]   So I can only have a way to do it. You're hairless cat too
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.760]   Exactly
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:58.480]   Uh one trillion dollar market cap milestone has been achieved it was brief
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:04.400]   But it happened on tuesday and I think it dropped down to a paltry 995 billion
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:07.600]   It's at all whatever
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:11.200]   I don't know where it's at today, but
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.560]   Uh
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.920]   Not bad amazon. Maybe someday i'll be a trillion dollar company too
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.240]   I find it
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.080]   Well, I guess as a as a former
[00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:29.600]   Stock market reporter. I find the obsession with sort of round numbers bazaar. Yeah, I mean I know it's it's it's human nature, but
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.280]   um
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.960]   you know the
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.880]   If it's worth 999 billion, that's still pretty good. Yes
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:40.640]   I would agree for 800 billion
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:49.440]   Um, yeah, I would agree, but and you know, this is not the first time that the sap and apple did this early august
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:55.680]   Um, so, you know amazon playing second fiddle to apple as far as that's concerned, but
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.080]   It is it is guys it is
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.680]   But what what?
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.080]   Well, so this is this is their market cap
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.640]   I'm just I'm just thinking about
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:11.920]   All the ways we could divvy this up and compare and contrast and what would be useful and what would not but yeah
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.920]   It's the same point you're making big round numbers
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:17.840]   Well, and and I do think the the sort of
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:20.640]   Flipside is that those
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.480]   Round numbers do kind of make you stop and think a little
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.960]   um
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:31.360]   You know just about how big these companies are yeah and and maybe it isn't
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.160]   You know revenue. It's it's the stock market and they're anticipating all sorts of
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:40.880]   Future benefits that may never appear, but that's still a pretty staggering
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:43.680]   some
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:47.440]   Scooter access today 972.96 billion so
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:49.920]   Oh, yeah
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.920]   Yeah, come back next week
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.360]   Back again and actually related I moved away from
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.600]   uh matinee, but I should mention also that apparently
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.640]   uh Amazon says matinee
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:08.880]   operates on more than 20 000 devices now so amazon is clearly winning the
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:11.840]   compatibility
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.760]   Game, but it extends the ability. Yes. Well, okay. Yes
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.640]   And it is the number one when I talk to
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:25.200]   Anybody who's building a device there like yes matinee is our first option or first priority followed by google
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:28.320]   but
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.320]   That's also a lot of crappy
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.480]   There's a lot of crappy things on there, right?
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:37.360]   So it doesn't matter if you have 20k if you don't have the most important ones right
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:43.200]   Amazon does tend to right now still have the most important ones so i'm not worried about it, but again, i'm like
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.000]   Let's be real you guys
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   Yeah, it's a good point. I remember that with uh
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.120]   With the google play store before it was the play store when it was at the android market
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:58.080]   And it was like yeah, well, we've got tons of apps to compare against apple and it's like yeah, but
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:02.800]   Yes, we have 80 000 pieces of garbage that will crash your pal
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:08.960]   It's most of the stuff that you're gonna find is not very good. Thankfully they've they've improved that over the years, but they have
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:14.960]   Actually, I had an interesting this is a tangent, but I was talking to someone about
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.840]   Google's desire to get into china and facebook's as well obviously and
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:26.240]   They made an argument that obviously I thought well google wants to get into china. It's a massive market, etc, etc
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:30.080]   Um, you know, they want to compete with bydo and so on but
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:36.560]   His point was be interested what you guys thought but his point was that he saw the big
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.480]   Draw as being android so that's something like
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:48.160]   80 of devices in china are android but that it's a kind of lawless frontier because google can't
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:55.440]   You know can't act in the country and sort of control it the way they do elsewhere and that that's a big
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.760]   kind of driver for them is to just get in there and get control of
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.560]   That massive android market
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:07.680]   Mmm
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:14.720]   I think that's a justification as opposed to a rational or rationalization not a justification. I don't know what i'm saying interesting theory though. Yeah
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.280]   It is. Yeah, I don't yeah
[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:22.320]   Let's see here. Let's uh, I don't know what I have to say
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:26.160]   I want to talk about the URL because I was I thought that was kind of cool, but I don't know if you want to talk
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:28.640]   Yes, I do. Let's talk about that
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:36.480]   After we take a break after the break after the break stay tuned the URL may be changing all that more coming up next

[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:38.320]   I'm really I was never very good even though I wanted to get a wiziwig editor and prove to myself that I could do it
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.640]   WordPress makes it super easy
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.880]   Uh lots of awesome designs to choose from
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:48.640]   It's hassle-free. So wordpress takes care of the hosting the security the software updates

[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.520]   Which is a pretty staggering number when you think about it
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.680]   Right now get 15 percent off any new plan purchase

[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.640]   The URLs are a change in
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:23.280]   As they say, um, but we don't really know what they're changing too like this is a wired story
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.040]   Uh
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:28.240]   That basically says that like it's pretty up in the air. Yeah, google's
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.400]   Google's focusing some efforts focusing time and resources
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:38.400]   To fix what they say is is just a big problem in the fact that URLs are complicated. They're complex
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:45.920]   They're confusing p they uh, they say, uh, that it's going to be controversial, but everyone's unsatisfied with them
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.680]   What do you think state so?
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:49.680]   I I saw this story and I was like, well, you know
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:55.360]   One of the reasons this is a problem is because URLs are often turned into like tracking URLs, right? Yeah, yeah
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:01.440]   So not always. I mean, there are definitely pages that have poor naming but a lot of the
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:07.600]   Weirdest golly gook is totally tracking stuff. So maybe if we didn't have to track that
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.640]   We should just get rid of tracking maybe
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:14.080]   Maybe if no one needed to make money, right?
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:17.360]   Get rid of tracking and ads. So you're right
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:24.080]   Whenever I share links or post links. I I remove all the golety go deliberately. Yeah, so that I try to
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:26.400]   money from that link
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.680]   But it is although I will say as a as a publisher who puts
[01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:35.440]   I my ads have tracking boots. So tied to I clicked on this from Stacy. I'm like, hey, don't remove that
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:37.440]   That's really helpful to me. Thank you
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.680]   See
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:45.440]   Now the shoes are the other yeah, I know everybody has a reason for those tracking and once once it's your reason
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.840]   They did try this before though, right?
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:52.080]   I think the word story mentions that they did try because I remember a period where
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.400]   If you clicked on a link in chrome, yep
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:04.560]   The URL bar would just show you a truncated version. So it just showed you I think the main domain and maybe one
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.160]   kind of
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:08.880]   Slash market didn't show you the whole thing. Yeah, subdimate
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:12.400]   Well, yeah, if I remember correctly it showed that to you
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:18.560]   But if you actually went up there and copied it and then pasted that link into another browser window, you'd get the full
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:23.840]   The full thing. Yeah, and I don't know if that if that full thing included the tracking information or not
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.600]   Yeah, but I think they just hid the actual URL
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:33.120]   Yeah, so it would show you something but if you clicked and pasted it, then you'd get the real one
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.680]   What do I they didn't keep that?
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.920]   Yeah, I don't know some people complained
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:45.360]   Because because I mean I guess we're always staring at the URL bar. Sometimes that can be a great indicator of something
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.360]   Um something well. No, I mean I'm not good or bad, right?
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:55.040]   Like you would check the URL and and maybe there's clues in there that if it's hiding it from you
[01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:59.520]   You'd be less likely to detect that something bad was happening or I'm not really quite sure
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.520]   And you're wondering in other words something
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.560]   Yeah, I know I find it irritating
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.560]   when I'm checking links in a newsletter or
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:14.640]   Some places that deliberately obscure the URL like I hover over a link
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.800]   Yeah, and then I look down to see
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:22.640]   Where is it going? You know, is it is it something that I actually want to click on and go and look at?
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.560]   And if the URL is obscured, it's harder to make that decision. Yeah
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:31.280]   Yes, so
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:38.480]   I wouldn't imagine changes anytime anytime soon. Well, this it really sounds like it's a very nebulous discussion happening right now
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:44.560]   But at least they're trying to do it sounds to me like they're trying to do it for a good reason unlike say facebook
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.520]   Which deliberately obscured URLs because it didn't want you to click on them and leave facebook
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.400]   right
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.200]   Right
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:03.600]   Scooter x put something in the chat room that might be worth talking about it's about google buying at google's deal with mastercard that came out
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.320]   That's right. Yeah
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.720]   A few days back. I don't know if that's in our rundown because
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.800]   That was over they were getting purchase activity
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:18.720]   Well, so this is the question I have so bloomberg reported that google has apparently paid
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.640]   Millions of dollars to get credit card data from mastercard
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:28.320]   Now and this is a recent story and bloomberg says it's it's just it's new reporting
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.000]   But back in 2012 or 2012 2017
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:40.240]   Google actually had talked about a deal with an unnamed data broker or data provider to get credit card information
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:47.600]   So i'm not sure if the unnamed data provider from that story was mastercard or if this is new
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.080]   in so
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.080]   I remember reading do you follow loren?
[01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.760]   Weinstein
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.760]   Weinstein Weinstein
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.480]   The privacy forum so he's caught up. Yes. Yes
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:05.440]   Yeah, so he he said that he thought this was kind of a trumped up story sorry for the verb but
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.920]   um that it that it
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:15.040]   Was a deal that they announced last year and it's doesn't involve individual purchasers by identity
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.000]   And so he saw it as a kind of you know, they were
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   Trottting out an old story, but I don't know if that's I haven't looked into it
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.880]   I mean I read the story and it's tremendously unclear if it's the same
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:30.800]   I will say that google's not alone in this. I noticed this
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:35.520]   In a couple other places for example, north stroms does it deal with facebook
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:39.200]   So anytime I buy something at north stroms it actually shares that data with facebook
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.680]   Which is on your wall
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:44.560]   Uh, it's not hosted on my wall, but facebook does know
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:50.000]   What I thought which or just that somebody bought that no that it was me it is
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.560]   It is some of the direct tracking
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.080]   Which is why i'm like, I don't sign into facebook a lot of the time, but
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.640]   Now that i've got a site. I do have i am signed in
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.560]   We were talking about that acquisition data like people actually buying things is the most
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.840]   At least lots of companies think it's the most
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:16.960]   Salient, it is because we're speaking with our our dollars and so that's how you know someone's about to have a baby
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.960]   Because they're buying baby stuff
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.280]   Yeah, or
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:26.720]   So it makes total sense, but it's like really creepy. So there we go
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.960]   It is definitely there's that sort of target example about the
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.440]   girl who was buying
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.440]   Pregnancy related stuff and right
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:38.160]   They sent an email to her dad
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.120]   Like what a couple of years ago
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:45.680]   Well, yeah, they didn't send it to him as like a by the way your daughter's pregnant they sent it
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:51.600]   They sent it by the way you could buy more stuff. Yeah, would you like work? That was totally innocent totally innocent
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:59.280]   Um, so I think this this does look back because the the justification and the bloomberg story and the justification in the original
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:03.680]   Washington post story from 2017 is the same it's basically tying the data
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:07.920]   From me clicking on an ad to actually purchasing something
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:12.080]   And that's the holy grail right like you clicking on an ad means
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:18.160]   Little to nothing you actually buying something shortly after you clicked on an ad is huge
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.200]   right
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.240]   so
[01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:24.400]   Google did point out you can opt out of this
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:31.840]   Ad tracking as you know, if you didn't already know web and app activity you can go into the online console and do that
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.840]   And that would and then you won't get anything useful. No, but
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:42.960]   Yes, that's true, but then I really think about it. I'm like, how much do I really care about
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:50.080]   Whether my ads are targeted like is that okay trade off? I do care because um
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.200]   Not that I buy weird stuff, but I
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:14:00.080]   I feel like the things because once you know what I'm buying you know, it's in my home and you know way more about me than
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:05.360]   One, I'm aware that I'm sharing maybe but also I don't think
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:11.600]   My ability to determine the weather for example, so google offer like there should be different
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:16.880]   different levels of tracking associate like if I turn this off
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:21.280]   What do I lose if I if I just lose google giving me better ads?
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:21.920]   That's fine
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:25.360]   If I lose the ability for google to like they're like well fine
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:29.120]   Then we're gonna pretend we're like we don't have access to your location or other information
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:34.160]   And so we won't automatically show you the following things that you rely on and think are convenient, right?
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.760]   so
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.760]   if the question is
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:40.640]   Do we have some sort of striations in
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.800]   what I
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.160]   Like what I share versus what services get taken away
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.120]   If does if that makes sense
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:52.000]   Kind of the trade off with
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.400]   So master card said no individual transaction or personal data is provided
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:02.640]   Yeah, but the example they give is incredibly misleading then the example they give in this story
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:10.720]   Is I click on an ad for red lipstick a lady clicks on an ad for red lipstick and later with her master card goes and buys that red lipstick
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:13.920]   The advertiser gets a report indicating as such
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:21.520]   So it may not say Stacy does but it is definitely linked right to my activity in google because I am
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:26.800]   Logged in knows who I am so master card may not get it, but they know it was me
[01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:30.560]   They know
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:36.960]   Like someone knows that it's you presumably master card. No presumably that with google
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:40.000]   Yeah
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.880]   They have to share that with google if google's tying it to my click
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.840]   Once it's tied to my click it's tied to me
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:49.040]   I mean, I'm not saying maybe it's a really terrible example
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.160]   But if that's the example then somebody's not telling the whole truth
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:56.240]   Yeah
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:03.600]   Seriously, who's buying red lipstick these days, huh? Yeah, I buy I buy all I have 16 red lipsticks
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.840]   I have been on the hunt actually
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:11.440]   And google google is aware of that
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:15.600]   Google knows google knows Stacy layoffs a for a man
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:22.000]   What else do we have here? I think we've got a kind of
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.680]   Pieces and bits and pieces here and there like there were some analysis announced to be fun
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:30.800]   I don't know how interesting that is for for you guys
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:36.400]   I mean there was a there was a number of smartphones that were announced there sony xz3
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:44.320]   The wahwey honor play a lot of like mid-range devices HTC U12 life
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:48.240]   Actually the HTC phone looks very similar to the pixel 2
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:51.200]   Which if you remember?
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:56.560]   HTC was involved in the pixel 2's design so it makes a lot of sense that they would right have some similarities
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:00.560]   But the backing on that looks very very similar very familiar
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:08.240]   uh zte axon 9 there was a new black berry phone, I think but I don't know if there were any like
[01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:15.840]   There were some new home appliances that are connected to the internet. Oh, so okay, so you were you were probably paying more attention
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:20.240]   Yeah to kind of the iot stuff that was happening at efa was
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:23.760]   What do you think of efa as far as a a
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:29.440]   Conference for that type of product? I was devastated that I could not go except
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:33.600]   I didn't go because I was in bamp doing the hiking thing so I was not stated
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:38.080]   I was I was I was definitely worth it. I was also like yeah, I'm not gonna give that up, right?
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.280]   So
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:43.920]   I did try to convince kevin to go on her behalf and kevin was like eh and I was like oh fine
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:50.320]   Fine, would you normally be there if you weren't there? I would next year. I would be there. Um next year. I'll play in a little bit better
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:54.000]   Um because I I think it's a really interesting show
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.840]   uh
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:59.840]   A lot of the higher end appliance vendors are showing off
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:03.440]   Fully integrated kitchens for example
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.640]   so
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:10.320]   Couple things worth noting ge announced that you no longer have to talk to its digital assistant with its kitchen stuff
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:13.120]   You can now just talk to madam a so instead of saying
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:16.960]   madam a asked janeva to set the oven to
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.400]   350 you can just say madam a set the oven to 350
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:24.080]   Why does this matter because it makes interoperability a little bit easier?
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:29.040]   So as long as now that madam a has native support for ovens
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:35.280]   Anybody who makes an oven can do it and we no longer have to worry about you know remembering that my dishwashers by Bosch
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:39.840]   My ovens by janeva or ge and my fridge is by samson
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.960]   So that's cool
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.960]   We also saw
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:47.680]   This is a maybe a worrying trend is
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:52.800]   Is it me lee how do you say the really high end meal me lee?
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.600]   uh, me lee
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.920]   um, they launched some
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:01.600]   Products including a new disc for their dishwashers
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.920]   Which you're like, oh, okay
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.840]   But what it really seems like is a way to actually buy especially branded soap
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.920]   And it's unclear if you're gonna be if you're gonna be able to not
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:16.880]   Buy their like through their channels with this particular product
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:18.960]   um
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.240]   It is
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.960]   Another company did the same thing with refrigerators and water filters
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.040]   And kind of used connectivity to insert some extra drm there
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.680]   So that's something to keep an eye on
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.400]   And I think it's a really crappy thing
[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:40.560]   Why are consumers ridiculous a power a power disc around puck that dispenses
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:45.200]   Powder detergent so you buy these discs or do you fill up the
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:50.320]   The disc you you do you you buy the you I think you buy the discs
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:57.680]   Cool, let's why to what benefit other than me lee or me or whatever
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:03.280]   Well, they're gonna argue that it cleans your dishes better or does something fancy and reduces buildup in your dishwasher
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:08.960]   You know all the typical. I mean we we know what they're gonna say. That's lame though
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.840]   It is lame and it's
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:17.280]   It is frustrating that instead of offering
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.800]   Truly better services and and maybe they are
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:24.080]   Maybe that's how it gets you in like I would love a dishwasher
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:29.440]   That can detect exactly how much filth is on my dishes and clean them appropriately
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:34.960]   Using the minimum amount amount of water for example that would be something worth paying for
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.800]   but
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:40.080]   I don't know if it's worth paying for it, but it also locks me into this stupid
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:43.760]   proprietary revenue generating dishwasher soap, right?
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:46.560]   so
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:49.840]   Yeah, and they're not small either those discs are actually pretty large
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:54.720]   They're gonna take up a lot of space and if you're running your dishwasher once a day
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.440]   It seems like that's gonna be a pretty expensive endeavor
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:00.960]   Although the trended dishwashers you guys is drawers
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:06.160]   Having multiple drawers with your dishwashers that you just put open the drawer in your counter
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:10.320]   You stick the dishes in you set it to wash overnight and then you've got maybe another one
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:12.640]   And you can just open that pull from there
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.400]   What huh?
[01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:16.400]   So multiple drawers that operate
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.400]   in the present dishware
[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:24.400]   So yeah, so it's it's aimed at smaller households who don't run the dishwasher everyday
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:28.480]   Okay, I love them. They're very pretty. I'm like, oh
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:32.720]   So like little mini dishwashers throughout your kitchen
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.200]   Yeah, just two that oh just two
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:38.400]   I mean, I guess you could
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.360]   Every drawer is a new dishwasher
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:47.280]   Put your dirty dishes in the car and they come out clean. That's so why does some people might only have one
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:50.880]   I would have two
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.200]   That's so bizarre
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.440]   No, it's it's really neat. Oh, someone's asking for both
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:59.360]   Yeah shows picture
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:05.200]   Uh, i'm googling dishwasher jars just to see yeah, I have I have never heard of this. I haven't either
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.960]   No, this is okay. Never. I don't I'm not up on
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:12.400]   dishwasher technology. So I haven't really here. Okay, there's a
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:18.320]   And remodelista if you google dishwasher drawers. There's a story Jason just a little bit down called
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:21.760]   uh remodeling one on one the ins and outs of dishwasher drawers
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:24.480]   And they show okay
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:30.080]   They show the drawers. So you can putting this in other in the dock because it is definitely other
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.560]   Uh, yes, sorry
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:35.840]   I love the tangents like this
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:38.400]   Okay, so I put the link in there
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.960]   And you scroll all the way down at the bottom
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:44.720]   There's like the third picture down if you if you end up by going there and here
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:46.400]   I'll put it in chat so people have it too
[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:50.880]   There you go. If you go down to the third picture, you'll get a good shot of it
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.160]   That's a risk of its interior
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:56.400]   And look at that
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.920]   See so you have ideas
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:03.520]   It's for you know, it's space saving and you run that dishwasher just once a day for small households
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.880]   And then you you basically could just you don't even have to put your dishes away
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:12.000]   You you pull from the clean one and run from the dirty one. I would put mine away, but that's just me. Yeah
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.520]   Yeah, I probably would too. I had my kids do it
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:18.000]   Right
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000]   So it's yeah, that's what kind of doesn't matter. Um, that's interesting. I had not heard of this
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.720]   Okay, so that's a big that's like a trend
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:28.800]   Bareless. It's not smart and has no tech. I was gonna say
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:34.320]   Is matime integrated with these dishwashers? Can we rope it into technology stuff?
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:36.960]   Eventually they will be yeah, I mean
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:38.880]   Sure
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.880]   Madamay, watch the dishes
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:46.240]   One of the most exciting things I was talking to somebody about connected appliances actually and they were talking about
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:50.080]   Once something's connected to the network, you could have accurate timing
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:57.920]   And so for people like me who like want to sync my microwave and my oven clocks because they're right next to each other all to the same time
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:02.960]   That's perfect because the internet will actually do it right now. I have to set them like
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:04.800]   God
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.800]   Mm-hmm. I don't see
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:11.600]   Some people this really obsess like my husband and I we all have a person in front of their
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:16.400]   We all like are like synchronized with the the time set and we're all okay. Yeah, go
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:18.960]   We all know our buts
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:20.960]   That will be a thing of the past. Yeah
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.280]   Good the future looks looks bright
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:26.000]   For OCD people everywhere. Yes
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.320]   Exactly
[01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:34.720]   It's enabling our own everyone's OCD inner OCD. Hey, you know, I'm I had not realized last time
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.720]   I was on there was no
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:42.720]   There was no slot in the the rundown for the changelog. Why don't we do the changelog?
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.600]   You're on it, man
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:48.640]   I love that this is back
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:54.160]   Although I have to say those those icons and the the google logo
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.200]   little dated
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.280]   But I guess the changelog hasn't hasn't done
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:02.000]   been a thing for a while
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:07.680]   Happy birthday to google one year shy of drinking age here in the us 20 years ago yesterday
[01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:11.840]   Was the date that google incorporated was incorporated
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:16.160]   Google equals it cooperated 20 years ago
[01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:21.920]   Uh, so happy birthday google. It's good to see you you're looking good get a job
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:24.480]   um
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.160]   Chrome is also celebrating its 10 year birthday always
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.000]   Always living in google's birthday's shadow about halfway
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.880]   Uh, there's a new look to the desktop browser. I don't know if you guys saw this actually my chrome
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:43.280]   My pixel book updated and I was surprised I hadn't read this story. So I wasn't expecting it and things look awesome
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:49.120]   What do you think I like it? Yeah, I really like google's current kind of design
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.120]   uh
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:58.240]   Design era aesthetic. Yeah, the aesthetic the material theming that they're doing. I don't know. It's it's very pleasing
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:02.080]   I think that they've done a good job kind of refining it to where it's at right now. So
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:08.160]   Now that's integrated with chrome. We got some other updates like improvements to auto fill password management
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:13.200]   Including integrated password creation. So that's something I love about last pass
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.400]   And now chrome's going to have that embedded as well so you can create
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.320]   Uh, your your passwords and not keep reusing the same ones over and over again
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:26.240]   Uh, so make sure and check that out the chrome update is is available to you now
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:32.320]   Um, google assistant is apparently now bilingual. So if you are in a home
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:40.000]   With you know, and maybe there are two languages spoke in your home assistant can now interchangeably
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.560]   Uh talk and recognize and all that uh between two languages at once
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:48.880]   That's neat. It's gonna help that is neat. Yeah, good idea
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:54.320]   And uh that will work obviously across all assistant functions. So controlling your smart home
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.920]   Uh, you know, all all other functions. I think it'll be good for the home
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:05.760]   And then this is important stuff google is offering a free content safety api toolkit
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:13.040]   Uh to non governmental agencies. This is going to put it's it's artificial intelligence work and its neural network kind of efforts
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:19.120]   Uh to task on recognizing and flagging child sexual abuse material online
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:21.760]   Um, also known as c Sam
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:26.960]   Uh, this basically what this means is it's going to allow for recognition at scale
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:34.320]   Uh and kind of minimizing the interaction the need for human operators to filter through a lot of the stuff
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:39.840]   Up until now it's been that would be helpful. Yeah, it's it's been the task of a lot of you know humans to have to
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.800]   I can't even imagine. Yeah
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:44.400]   so
[01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:46.560]   They've got their ai on the case
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:50.480]   It's going to help assist in uh like flagging known
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:56.960]   Uh c Sam content for review and then also recognizing content that might not have been previously flagged
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:03.040]   Uh, but that would likely fall into that category. So it's all about kind of minimizing how much the humans actually have to be
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:05.120]   Um involved in that process
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:10.240]   So and then that is that's free. So people are going to be able to put that to work right away
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:17.200]   Uh, oh man. It's been so long since the google change log. So how do I close this? That was the google change log
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.640]   About a practice on the change log. I love that it's back though
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:28.080]   I really appreciate your like thinking of things like oh, how do I close this which is like
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:35.120]   When kevin and I are recording we're always like and uh that I guess that's it. Yeah, we're done. Yeah, we're done
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:38.880]   Oh hello. Oh, it's coming in with a snack
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:42.000]   Hada you got mail
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000]   I got a device yay
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:50.160]   Yeah, snack or plus a wine or something or no. No, no, it's it. I'll show I'll show whatever it is
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:56.640]   I'm not 100 sure what it is, but i'll show it. Oh, yes. This is where where legendary tv is made
[01:28:56.640 --> 01:29:01.200]   Good payoff exactly. So surprise. I'm pretty sure it's a smart home device
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.320]   Probably something really interesting
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:07.120]   Like red lipstick
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:10.160]   You ordered it on amazon and it delivered 20 minutes later
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:16.640]   Um, anything else in here before we take a break and then come back and do our tips and and all the other stuff
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:24.480]   Did I miss anything? I mean snapchat spectacles apparently there's a new version of them and they look more even more like normal sunglasses
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:28.720]   But do they look enough like normal sunglasses that is the question
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:37.200]   Wait, are we are is anyone buying these? I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think I don't know snap seems to really be losing
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:40.400]   Yeah, no kidding. Eh
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.440]   Kind of crazy. Is that a Canadian a right there? Eh?
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:52.560]   Uh, I'm always liked I've liked a is an expression pretty much my whole life
[01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:57.120]   Great expression and and I lived in Montreal for six months so I can at least like name to it
[01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:00.560]   Yeah, your park. Yeah, your park. Very small part
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:03.360]   related to the a is uh
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.240]   in french nespa but in in
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:12.480]   Louisiana where my family's from they say for true so it's the same concept but they're like oh for true
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:15.520]   For true for true
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:19.200]   Doesn't quite say Canadian
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:23.760]   Canadians don't say a nearly as much as americans think they do
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:30.560]   Oh, they do too. It's actually not not that it is common in some parts of Canada, but not all parts
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:35.040]   It's like I've encountered many Canadians saying a including you Matthew
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:38.320]   Maybe they said it for you. Maybe they said it just for you
[01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:43.840]   I always thought a was was a pretty efficient way to to prompt someone to reply
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:51.360]   That's yeah, that's why I always used it. It's a great way to like you put that out there and someone feels the need to respond so
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:59.360]   It's in the in the midwest, you know in sort of Minnesota, North Dakota. It's yeah, yeah
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.520]   Yeah, yeah, you don't need to nest them. You don't need to stack them
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:10.160]   Then then it's not as efficient, but hey everybody everybody has their own way of Aang
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:20.160]   Stacy could tell us about the proper conjunction or you know derivation of all and all the all all y'all all fan. Yeah
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:30.080]   That's not acceptable, but y'all is acceptable. Yeah, but all y'all y'all. Yeah. All y'all is it. Oh, I thought that was standard. No
[01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:32.160]   Oh, okay
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:34.960]   All y'all know what no, that's just silly
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:41.600]   That grew that so y'all is just you and then all y'all is the group but
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:46.640]   But no, but y'all is all it's already a group is already all
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:53.440]   But y'all also just y'all to me implies more than one person or the person but but uh correct
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:56.960]   We have I'm wrong people use it for just a single person as well. Yeah, probably
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.760]   However, they are wrong
[01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.960]   Carson has ruled okay
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:06.000]   Thank you
[01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000]   Glad we got to the bottom of that
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:13.360]   All right, let's uh, let's take a break. Thank the sponsor of this episode and then we'll get back and do some tips tricks numbers
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:17.280]   Whatever we happen to have in store things is another one
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:21.440]   But before all that this we can google is brought to you by
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:27.040]   digital ocean digital ocean actually provides the easiest cloud platform
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:35.120]   Uh, if you want to deploy managed scale applications, you can use droplets virtual machines that are a scalable compute platform
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:40.000]   Uh with add-on storage security and monitoring capabilities
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.520]   You can actually choose from standard or cpu optimized droplets and then customize from there
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:52.320]   And you know, if i'm talking your language, that's probably because you're a developer digital ocean is designed for developers
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:59.520]   It's the it has an easy to use control panel as well as an api that let's developers spend more time coding
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:05.840]   Which is what they always want to do anyways and less time managing their infrastructure. That's what digital ocean can do
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:12.960]   Uh industry leading price to performance can access the compute resources that you need at the lowest rates
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.040]   That's going to save up to 55
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:21.200]   When compared to other cloud providers nothing to sneeze at and you'll always know
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:26.960]   What you'll pay per month with a flat pricing structure across all data center regions
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:34.960]   Not only that you get a whole bunch of other stuff included at no additional cost you get 99.99 up time sla
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:37.520]   You get cloud firewalls
[01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:39.520]   Monitoring and alerting
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:47.360]   Full dns management global data centers enterprise ssd's and easy to use api developers are going to love this

[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:27.600]   All right, so let's see here
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:32.000]   I'm going to scroll down here and uh stacey. Why don't we start with you
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.400]   Do you have a thing that that was just shipped? Is that what that was?
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:39.200]   So this thing I can't show you yet. Okay, sadly
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:44.640]   But I do have a thing that I can show you the website for because I don't have the thing
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:46.800]   Yet, but I really want it
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:51.280]   And it is weird. So this is part of the stacey shows you weird things that you may want
[01:34:51.280 --> 01:34:55.200]   This is the lumos sleep. Yeah, that's a segment to jalna know that
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:35:00.320]   Lumos sleep mask and what it does is
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:04.080]   It flashes light in your eyes to prevent jet lag
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:10.240]   What huh? It is a $200 sleeping mask that you can purchase
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:11.840]   um
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.120]   And it will
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.720]   That like
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.560]   You tell it when you're going to fly
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:25.200]   And where you're going and then it starts with through the app prompting you to sleep with it the night before or spend some time with it
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:30.880]   The day before and it flashes lights in your eyes while you sleep to help
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.520]   acclimate your brain
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:35.040]   Got it. Yeah
[01:35:35.040 --> 01:35:36.240]   so
[01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:39.120]   Cnet tried this which is where I found out about it and
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:43.360]   This person actually said that it seemed helpful for her flight to australia
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:49.040]   As someone who's been to australia from the us it is not going that is problematic. It is coming back
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:50.880]   So i'm kind of like
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:55.200]   Uh, we'll see but I really want to try it before I go to europe in a couple weeks. So that's my goal
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:58.320]   I want to know what you got. Why can't you tell us?
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:03.280]   Because it's uh secret for a certain amount of time between us
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:05.920]   Just between us
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:11.120]   Yeah here let me turn off the stream one second. Yeah, yeah, hold on
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:17.360]   Okay, carcentered after the carcentered off the stream. Okay, seriously. No, you can tell us now. No one will ever know
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.840]   No one will ever know
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:26.240]   Uh, yes, no, I'm i'm sorry you guys. I got excited but then I was like, oh, this is not what I thought of us. All right
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:34.160]   Fair enough. Uh, matthew. Why don't you why don't you tell us what was delivered to you? Huh? What's what's uh, what did you get delivered?
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:37.280]   We want to know the last thing I had
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:39.280]   The last thing I had delivered
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:41.360]   Now
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:45.520]   Actually, you can talk about anything you want. Do you have a matthews stuff or a number?
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:50.320]   I think I had delivered with a lightning to ethernet connector because my ipad
[01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:58.080]   Uh, y5 bluetooth radio suddenly stopped working. Oh for no reason. Okay. Um admittedly it's an old ipad
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:03.120]   But okay anyway, so I was gonna mention I saw this in the rundown. We didn't talk about it
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:04.640]   I don't have a thing
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:07.040]   Um, because everything I use is old and busted
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:14.240]   And so I don't have anything new like stacy my light bulbs you have to twist and then they they don't change colors or
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:19.760]   Do anything like that. So but I did notice that twitter was talking about some new features
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:22.800]   And I this company never ceases to amaze me. So
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:26.240]   The they were saying they're experimenting with new
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:32.240]   Features to help make the platform more conversation. So for example, they would show you
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:35.200]   When someone was online
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:37.520]   And I thought
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:44.240]   So and I saw a couple people responding to it like that is the last thing that we really want so
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:47.920]   twitter arguably is too conversational already
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.480]   in a lot of ways in terms of
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:53.520]   Bad conversation. Do we need to show people?
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:58.800]   When we're online so they can come and you know beat us up about something or troll us
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:04.400]   Hard about whatever it was we just said I just found it. I don't know. It's like there's
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.040]   There are parts of the company that
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:09.360]   You know, there I mean this is all well-meaning
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:15.360]   Features, but there are parts of the company that don't seem to be aware of the real problems
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:20.960]   Was twitter and how these features might not help? I guess
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:30.800]   Yeah, it's like they had their their different departments are it's like business as usual just continue iterating and coming up with interesting features
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:36.160]   And I mean this this is not the only time this has happened to where twitter's put out an update and then there's you know
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:42.640]   I've seen many times where an update to the service happens and all I see on social media is like, you know
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:48.720]   Why don't you instead focus on fixing your your social network? You know, like it's become a meme though
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:51.520]   As soon as twitter as soon as jack says something
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:54.240]   About we are doing x
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:59.760]   The number one response is why don't you get rid of the Nazis first right or
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:03.200]   Give us an edit function. Yeah, and then you can
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:06.720]   Change hearts to stars or stars to hearts or whatever
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:10.480]   Do you want an edit function on twitter matthew i'm curious
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:17.600]   I actually sort of go back and forth. I think I think it could be done provided
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:22.720]   There was a very short window. Yeah, so if there was a window where
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:28.560]   Right after you typed it, you know, some email programs have this right after you typed it
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:36.320]   You're like, oh crap, you know, I said that and I meant this or I I spelled this person's name wrong or then you'd have
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:40.240]   I don't know a minute 30 seconds. Maybe to change it
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:43.440]   Obviously, there's all kinds of trouble you can get into if there was just an
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:49.760]   A unilateral at all times edit function. So I seem definitely see why that would be a bad thing
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:56.240]   Yeah, I would agree with that if it's like or maybe it's even as short as it is on
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:03.440]   Like in google in inbox or gmail. Yeah, I have my undo send and I think that only holds it for 10 seconds
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:05.760]   It's a short window
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:08.160]   But it's but it's long enough, you know what I mean?
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:12.320]   It's long enough for me to send it and then do that quick scan and be like, oh man, I typed
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:17.840]   Person's name wrong. You know and knowing that it doesn't actually post maybe in the twitter feed
[01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:24.960]   You send it it appears in your feed, but it hasn't actually appeared for everyone for another 10 seconds that way you see it in context
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:28.880]   You know you make it the change and yeah, I think that would be there to do it
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:32.960]   What do you think I mean obviously they they have other things they need to work on. Yeah, yeah
[01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.640]   Well for sure for sure, but they've also got to iterate
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:40.480]   What do you think Stacy edit yes or no edit yn
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:43.200]   Twitter yes or no
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:49.280]   Are you even on twitter anymore? I'm like god. I've I've done some stupid tweets
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:52.000]   But I understand why they don't want us to have it
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:55.440]   Uh n n I'll be controversial
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:05.680]   Go I thought you're I think you're about to be controversial. Oh, no, I said n no, I don't think we should have an edit button. Oh, okay
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:07.840]   All right, that's controversial. Yeah
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.400]   Okay, I don't like puppies
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:18.560]   I know that whenever there is an immutable immutable twitter law or maybe it's a law of the universe that when
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:22.800]   Ever a tweet of yours goes viral. It will have a typo in
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:24.000]   Oh, yeah
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:28.880]   All the all the tweets that you type that where you check everything and spelling is perfect
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:34.560]   Nothing happens to them, but the one that everybody will share will have some dumb mistake at it
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:37.520]   I'm gonna start misspelling every single tweet. I send out
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:40.400]   See how that goes
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:43.520]   You don't want it to go viral because then you know you don't I don't actually
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:46.240]   And in the times I mean I had
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:48.720]   I had that unboxing video
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:52.080]   Of the amazon box that would that you know, there was an Oreo cookie
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:56.160]   I mean the box was gigantic and there was a single Oreo cookie package in the bottom of that
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:58.000]   And I mean
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.560]   In the case of my twitter feed that may be one of the most viral things i've ever had
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:07.920]   And that quickly a box with Oreo cookies quickly became political in my feed
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:13.600]   I mean it totally like immediately like I'm a horrible person because blah blah blah. I'm just like whoa
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:18.080]   They're cookies. I didn't know that we're gonna pack them so poorly
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:24.080]   Yeah, he did he did this on purpose to blah blah blah. It's like I promise you there's no conspiracy theory
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:27.760]   I just wanted to eat some cookies. That's a classic twitter experience
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:31.840]   That's like you and I are chatting and I say yeah, I just never really liked
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:36.320]   You know pancakes that much and then 20 minutes later
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:43.280]   Someone is being calling someone a Nazi or alleging that you know, it's a conspiracy of some kind
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:45.840]   But twitter doesn't need fixing
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:49.600]   No, it's a great conversational platform. It's a town square
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.320]   Yes
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:54.320]   I still like twitter
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:59.680]   I mean, I still use twitter. I don't use twitter as much as I used to it. Well
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:04.400]   I'm proud of twitter pretty regularly. Yeah, I don't post much of it. Yeah
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:07.120]   I'm the same comment all the time
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:11.440]   I've started. Yeah, matthew. You have really tapered off. Where do you talk now?
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:16.800]   Well in the summer I talk actually to people in real life. Real life
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:19.600]   Yeah, what is that?
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.240]   It's an overlooked medium, but I
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:27.280]   I guess I scaled back partly because it was summertime and I have other things
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:33.040]   That you know in the winter. You're just sitting in your house and it's freezing cold in Canada not in Texas. Obviously
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:40.720]   Yeah, so there's nothing else to do, you know, but shovel the driveway or get on twitter. So I'll probably be back
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:43.280]   uh more
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:46.240]   than before but I have been reconsidering it. It does
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:50.560]   I'm not sure it's good. It's a great news source and it's a great
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:53.600]   way of getting information. I'm not sure it's a great
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:58.560]   place to spend a lot of time and it can be kind of emotionally
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:05.680]   draining and it can be kind of uh, it's certainly a time suck. So I'm trying to find other ways to
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:08.320]   occupy my time. Yeah
[01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:10.560]   agreed
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:12.160]   uh, my
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.360]   thing
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:19.680]   I yeah, I guess this is this would constitute a thing google you may have remember you may remember a few weeks ago or a little while back
[01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:26.320]   um, made mention of the titan security key, which was its two factor. Yeah, no, yeah, that's great
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.640]   security key
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:31.520]   It's now available and actually I think it had been sold out for a while
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:36.480]   I just checked the store you can buy it right now the kits available for $50 ships immediately
[01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:42.320]   You get a usb key a bluetooth key and then you get some adaptive adapter connectors
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:50.080]   Which I included a screenshot of one of their promotional photos google's photos for how you would plug this into your pixel book
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:56.720]   Uh, so it's right underneath this link because it doesn't have a usb c version of the key
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:45:00.080]   So every time you want to use your whole secure
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:03.520]   Titan security key
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:08.320]   You gotta have another dongle in there, which is just you know, but seriously
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:11.280]   better
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:12.800]   What's up, are you going to wait?
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:19.040]   Is this sorry placement for the ub key or different from ub key similar? Yeah, it's basically the same thing. Okay
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:23.280]   It's google's own version of the ub key. Um, and our ub keys
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:28.000]   So maybe I don't know if you guys know this but if I use a centicator
[01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.560]   You know on my watch or whatever
[01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:36.720]   Is a hard key like that noticeably better security like is it dramatically better?
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:41.360]   I think that they yeah, they consider it to be a step up
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:46.160]   From something like that actually having a hardware key that has to plug into the port
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:54.960]   Um, I haven't used one myself and actually this kind of ties in with google has the advanced protection feature that they announced
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:58.240]   Like late last year. I think it was that's really
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:06.240]   You know, it's like this next level hardware two step verification kind of account setting that was really designed for people like
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:11.040]   You know journalists or politicians or people who have high
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:13.200]   high risk
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.720]   uh, sort of
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:19.040]   Sort of jobs as far as their data and you know that what would happen if that got out so
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:24.560]   And I used to factor on almost everything. Yeah, I used to factor for like drop box and
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:27.520]   Gmail and like just about
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:30.800]   Everything and so I'm definitely a believer in
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:32.240]   um
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:37.440]   Actually zeta too fucky who you mentioned is a big fan of the ub key and says that every
[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:40.880]   Sort of activist or journalist should have one. Yeah
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:43.520]   And I think this might be I
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:49.280]   Think I read somewhere that this is more than anything built for google accounts specifically
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:54.560]   So I don't I don't know if that means that it won't work on other accounts that support hardware keys
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:57.520]   Be surprised if that was the case, but um
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:03.280]   Anyways, there you go $50 you can get it right now if you like I think I might order $50
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:06.240]   What tested out? Yeah, it seems pretty steep to be honest
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:09.280]   It seems like you can get a free ub key if he's subscribed to wired
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:12.880]   Um, yeah, that's what i was thinking subscribed to wired got a ub key
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:15.520]   uh, so uh when you um
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:18.080]   When we're talking about two factor
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:24.960]   I have been following efforts by companies to like really push this so google is very like hey by the way
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:28.160]   You should you should add two factor. It's much better, right?
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:31.040]   And then male chimp which I use for my newsletter
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:34.240]   They actually give a 10 discount when you use
[01:47:34.240 --> 01:47:39.920]   Two factor which is a nice incentive and then a couple weeks ago like two weeks ago fortnite
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:48.480]   Basically introduce kids to two factor by giving them a premium dance for free if they enabled it. Well. Oh, that's right. Yeah, cool
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:52.960]   So since since we're talking about two factor and I think it's a big deal and important
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:48:00.480]   I think like pointing out when companies do things to encourage their users because it is I mean people
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:07.360]   It is inconvenient. So you do have to make it convenient for people to actually change how they're already doing it. Yeah, so
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:13.840]   Go for it night. Yeah, that's that's uh, I do remember reading that that was I was pretty interested in that
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:16.800]   Hopefully kids don't end up locking themselves out because
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:22.400]   Because I mean there is that that significant risk with uh two factor. Yeah, yeah, they're sure
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:27.120]   It looks like android police said uh, the titan security key
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:32.400]   A hardware or two factor bundle with outdated connectors. That was basically they're some nail
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:39.760]   Review because it's no no c and bluetooth NFC only for android and iOS
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:44.160]   So they've got room to grow
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:46.960]   Top for another good idea about their product line
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:54.160]   Um, all right. I think that's it. We've reached the end of this week in google for this week and
