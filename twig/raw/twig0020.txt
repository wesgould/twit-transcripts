[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.320]   We're going to talk about Google and the cloud today
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.200]   with three wonderful people starting off, of course,
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.280]   with Gina Trapani from SmarterWare.org,
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.160]   founder of Life Hacker and the author of the fabulous new book,
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.840]   Google Wave Guide, the complete guide to Google wave
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.360]   at completewaveguide.com.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.040]   You got it.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.000]   Greetings, humans.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.040]   Greetings, humans.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.720]   She is not one of us, but we can only aspire to be one of her.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.200]   Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.080]   He is the man behind the Buzz Machine at Buzzmachine.com,
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.360]   professor of journalism at the Graduate School of Journalism
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.160]   at City University of New York.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.000]   And a podcaster himself, his guardian podcast, is called--
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.600]   Media Talk USA.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.560]   Media Talk USA.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.400]   And today, joining us from the Googleplex, Mr. Brian Fitts
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:06.880]   Patrick.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.600]   Brian is one of the guys from the Data Liberation Front,
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.000]   which we've talked about before.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.080]   But I thought it'd be great to get him on and talk in more
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.840]   detail about what DLF is all about.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.000]   Brian, it's great to have you.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.280]   Oh, it's great to be here.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.880]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.880]   When did you start working for Google?
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.120]   And what did you start doing when you started at Google?
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.160]   I started in 2005.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.720]   And I was asked to move to Mountain View,
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.840]   and I respectfully declined to do so,
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.440]   because I'm a big fan of staying in Chicago.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.840]   And so I started off working on Google Code, actually,
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.880]   a project hosting feature, which we're very familiar with,
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.600]   especially Gina, of course.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.680]   That's neat.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.480]   And you're still in Chicago?
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.440]   Still in Chicago, it used to be me and 45 salespeople here.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.280]   And now it's not--
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.960]   One developer and 45 salespeople.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.680]   That's about the right ratio, I think.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.920]   That's a bad ratio.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.560]   Only for the developer.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.680]   We're doing a lot better now.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.840]   We're almost 100 engineers and about 300 salespeople.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.840]   So odds are a lot better.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.800]   You can fight them off.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.640]   If they should turn into zombies, you'll be OK.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.360]   I don't know if 300 zombies sounds a little scary.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.760]   You've got to be able to barricade that door.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.440]   I just start planning now, just in case.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.320]   So what is the idea behind the Data Liberation Front?
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.800]   Well, the idea is that we're coming into a sort of--
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.360]   it's a big paradigm shift in general.
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.200]   You're not storing data on your computer or your laptop
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.080]   so much anymore as you're storing it on the internet,
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.240]   in the cloud.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.440]   And I think that it's a big shift for some people.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.640]   And some people feel more comfortable with it.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.600]   Some people feel less comfortable with it.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.360]   And we want people to trust us with their data.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.440]   And so if we're going to do that, I
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.800]   think it's important that you can get your data out again.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.200]   That it's easy to be able to take your data with you
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.480]   and maybe go somewhere else if you decide to.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.400]   And I think people in general just don't think about that
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.320]   so much when they're putting their data in.
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.960]   They only think about it when something happens,
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.480]   whether it's extended downtime or they find a better product
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.920]   somewhere or something to that extent.
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.400]   And they want to take their data out.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.520]   Only then do they really look and see.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.160]   Did this come from--
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.800]   where did the initiative come from?
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.760]   Was it from the ground up?
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.680]   Was it from you guys or was it from the front office who said,
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.600]   Brian, we've got to do this.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.440]   No, it was definitely the ground up.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.040]   I was sitting around talking with some other engineers.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.760]   And even before I came to Google,
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.520]   I often heard Eric Schmidt talk about the fact
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.680]   that we don't block our users in.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.880]   He ended his talks with it for years.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.720]   And we realized that we were looking through some of our products.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.080]   And while it's true, you could get your data out.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.600]   Sometimes it was a little bit of a pain in the butt.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.840]   It took you a long time, or it was a matter of jumping
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.600]   through hoops or pasting something into the URI bar,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.080]   and then at a number at the end, et cetera.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.840]   And if APIs and that sort of thing
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.840]   are accessible to engineers and that sort of thing,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.200]   but we thought that it was more accessible to your average user.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.600]   So is it something new or just exposing something
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.840]   that was already there?
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.400]   We started about two years ago, actually,
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.520]   working with I-Google.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.240]   Our first engineer working in the project
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.480]   came from the I-Google team.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.360]   So it was a logical place to sort of get our feet wet.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.440]   And then we moved to Blogger.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.720]   And then Google Docs was our real big launch last month.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.040]   We've done Google Sites, Notebook, Finance.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.560]   And then other products are actually sort of starting
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.800]   to do it themselves as well.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.480]   And we're really happy to see that,
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.200]   because obviously we can't keep going to every product
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.560]   and doing it for them.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.960]   You guys, if you've got any questions,
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.240]   oh, it looks like we lost Gina.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.160]   I'll bring Gina back in.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.960]   But Jeff, if you've got a question at all.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.920]   Yeah, well, I just see an opportunity here.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.080]   I wish there were a business.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.200]   Someone other was trying to business.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.200]   That would make it easy for me to back up my entire cloud.
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.920]   Oh.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.720]   Right.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.360]   That used the API for the deliberation front
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.440]   and used whatever Facebook has or hasn't.
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.240]   And what Gina's doing in Twitter--
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.760]   Wouldn't that be great?
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.320]   Wouldn't it be great that I have--
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.920]   I know that my life is being stored somewhere off
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.520]   of all of those places in some standard formatted way.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.120]   So that's just a wish for somebody
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.120]   to go make billions of dollars on the idea.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.620]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.280]   There are a lot of these online backup services
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.000]   we just interviewed at Ubuntu 1.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.600]   Microsoft has theirs.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.480]   There's a lot of commercial services.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.400]   That's a great-- you're right.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.920]   I think that's a natural.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.640]   It's a great opportunity.
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.960]   So does the DLF end up becoming part of standard setting
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.560]   for the whole idea of data freedom and backup?
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.640]   Well, with regard to standards, we're
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.520]   making sure that we use existing standards in open formats.
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.080]   Because we don't want to get sort of down the rat hole
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.760]   of defining formats or anything proprietary, that sort of thing.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.920]   Because you can actually have a copy of your data
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.320]   in proprietary format and not be able to access it.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.080]   So we're hoping that just what we're doing
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.800]   is something that other companies pick up on
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.760]   and see the importance of doing it just for users
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.260]   in general.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.960]   It seems like, again, if you look back to 10 years ago,
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.240]   you'd have to go buy a piece of software at a store,
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.680]   in a box, on a floppy.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.760]   You're talking about 500-quarter inch floppies
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.920]   in your last show.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.760]   And you take it home and install it.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.960]   And that was a high barrier to entry.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.960]   Nowadays, if you want to try a piece of software,
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.120]   it's just a matter of typing a URL in.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.560]   So with the ability to switch so easily
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.840]   and try to other software, I think
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.640]   trust is coming into the picture much more than it has
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.520]   in the past.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.400]   And so I see this as a contributory measure
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.520]   to making sure that users still trust us.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.920]   Seems like a good marketing move.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.080]   But Amy, I guess-- what are you going to say?
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.920]   It's a good idea from a point of view of marketing.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.880]   And as long as you walk the walk doesn't really matter
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.280]   if you're just saying it for marketing or PR purposes or not.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.600]   You get the sense that there's a serious commitment to not only
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.600]   doing this now, but an ongoing commitment,
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.840]   that every time there's a new product from Google
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.480]   that there will be an interface, there
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.520]   will be an API, there will be access to the data.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.080]   Absolutely.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.880]   And it's even going beyond the API
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.160]   to a point where it's easy for--
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:20.280]   our end goal is to click a button and take everything with you.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.240]   So there's a big launch.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.240]   As you guys said, there's a bunch of launches this week.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.360]   One thing we launched is a one click button
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.280]   to take all your docs and spreadsheets out of Google Docs.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.040]   And also all your documents, you can sort of roll them up
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.040]   into a format that you choose and give them to you as a zip file.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.800]   That's cool.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.560]   That's really great.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.160]   That's great.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.440]   That's a useful one.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.480]   Is there a set of principles about this as emerging
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.280]   and best practices that are emerging that if we take the list
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.880]   that you have and go to Facebook and say, we want that?
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.520]   Well, so I mean, on a very high level,
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:02.360]   there's three questions that we sort of say
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.960]   that you should ask whenever you're putting--
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.040]   before you're putting your data into any sort of cloud product.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.040]   The first question is, can I get my data out at all?
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.640]   And the second question is, how much is it
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.640]   going to cost to get the data out?
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.800]   And the last one is, how much of my time
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.320]   is it going to take to get it out?
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.880]   So if you can't get it out at all, it's a non-starter.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.400]   If it's going to cost you extra, we'd say that we don't
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.040]   think everything needs to be free.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.800]   If you're paying $10 a month or a year for a service,
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.800]   then that should include the ability to get your data out.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.960]   And lastly, how much time?
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.120]   Again, going back to the Docs example, my wife and I
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.200]   use Google Docs a lot to collaborate on stuff.
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.960]   And we have 200, 300 Docs.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.160]   And if I had to get all those out one at a time
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.440]   by clicking through the export process,
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.120]   that's going to take me a whole afternoon.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.320]   It might as well be locked in.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:50.880]   Right.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.320]   Right.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.120]   That's a really good point.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.960]   We're in that same boat.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.320]   We use it all the time.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:54.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.320]   I got to ask, do you and your wife collaborate
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.880]   on software or on life?
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.840]   It's shopping list to do list.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.340]   Yes.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.960]   There's going to pick up the kids.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.560]   We've got definitely not collaborating on writing software.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.560]   We've got a 100-year-old house here in the city
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.080]   that we've been in the process of restoring.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.760]   And there's a whole lot of stuff to track on that.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.520]   Brian, I have a question for you.
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.600]   I'm one of these crazy people who, once a month, I go in
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.780]   and I pop all of my Gmail locally so that I have all my mail
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.320]   kind of saved onto my hard drive.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.360]   And I actually have a calendar reminder for a while.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.140]   I had this sort of cron job running,
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.640]   but I didn't want to keep my computer all the time.
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.500]   And now, by hand, I launched Lunderbird
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.500]   and download all my Gmail, because I feel like,
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.940]   if I'm locked out of my Gmail account,
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.540]   I at least want to have my archives on my hard drive.
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.340]   But I'm crazy.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.740]   And I don't think a lot of people do that.
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.340]   So I'm curious to know if you back up your Gmail
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:47.540]   or export your Gmail in any way and how you do it.
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.940]   Well, I don't think that's crazy at all, actually.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.180]   I mean, interesting note.
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.700]   When we first launched the Blogger Day Liberation,
[00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.900]   we started seeing users downloading their entire blog
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.980]   every week.
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.020]   And we were trying to figure out what was going on here,
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.960]   but we finally figured out it was exactly
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.880]   what you're talking about.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.500]   People were backing up their blogs locally,
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.200]   because they felt more comfortable.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.600]   I liken it to flying in an airplane.
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:12.000]   It's arguably safer than driving in your car,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.080]   especially in Chicago.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.640]   But most people tend to feel a little less safe
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.160]   in airplanes.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.920]   It tend to be more tentative about flying in a plane.
[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.680]   I think the same applies, in general,
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.120]   to cloud-based computing.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.880]   So anything that you have--
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.720]   the lockout example is a great example.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.360]   Most people don't think about it.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.860]   But anything you have in our clusters
[00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.820]   is going to be stored multiple times
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.080]   across multiple data centers, and that sort of thing.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:42.620]   And again, one of my goals-- so in particular,
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.260]   friends of mine take a lot of digital photos.
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.620]   They're kids, that sort of thing.
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.620]   I always tell them, for this sake of having back up
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.580]   your pictures.
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.900]   I know somebody lost a heart.
[00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.820]   I've lost the first two years of their children's photos.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.820]   And I think I'm on a crusade, I guess,
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.380]   to get people to think about that.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.320]   And about data liberation, to some extent.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.920]   And the analogy that I like to use
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.040]   is if you're living in whatever--
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.320]   insert your city here.
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.880]   And you've had a nice apartment.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.280]   But you find a nicer apartment that's
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.640]   bigger, a better view with a better price.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.080]   And you call your landlord, and you say, look,
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.760]   I'm going to end my lease in two months when it ends.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   Not going to renew.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.760]   Just weren't going to let you know
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.080]   when you must secure deposit back.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.920]   And the landlord says, that's fine, no problem.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.040]   But when you move out, you can't take any of your photos
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.780]   or your clothing or your furniture or that sort of thing.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.780]   Your cat.
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.220]   That's sort of--
[00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:34.720]   your cat.
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.340]   I don't know if they want the cat to.
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.020]   No, I don't think about that.
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.260]   In any case.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.100]   That's really great.
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.140]   So are there requirements in place?
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.660]   Like when you start to build a new product at Google,
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.600]   is export an initial consideration on the requirements
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.100]   list?
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.660]   Or is it something that gets patched on later?
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.820]   It seems like things are getting the ability to export
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.220]   like Docs later on.
[00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.780]   I mean, is that data liberation part
[00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.800]   of the initial product specification process now?
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.300]   Well, Docs already had exportability.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.540]   It wasn't what we would call as liberated as we'd like.
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.180]   It wasn't as easy as it could be.
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.780]   We're hearing more from products earlier on.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.860]   They want to talk just a little bit about what we think
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.100]   is better for them to do.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.860]   Looking for advice and wanting to basically sort of get
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.220]   a thumbs up on the data liberation side.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.260]   It's not always the kind of thing that teams
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:26.340]   are thinking about in depth at the beginning
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:26.840]   of their product.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.540]   Because things are so fluid, you don't want to actually
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.260]   typically wind up writing any code to liberate your product
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.180]   until you sort of a good idea of what your product is
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.020]   and what your data is going to be like.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:38.340]   Right.
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.740]   That makes sense.
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.580]   But I mean, it's definitely something that's here.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.540]   I've had different products call us up and say, hey,
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:48.260]   we've looked at dayliberation.org.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.940]   We think our product needs to be easier.
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.860]   What can we do?
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.820]   What would make you guys the day liberation front
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.060]   happy to do that?
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.900]   So are you as punk works within Google?
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.100]   I mean, how is it treated within Google?
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.180]   The data liberation front doesn't sound like you're
[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:01.980]   part of the company.
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.620]   You even don't even have a Google address.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.620]   Well, that's what happens when you let me name the product.
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.300]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.140]   We actually had a whole bunch of discussion
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.940]   about what we'd name our team when we first started.
[00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.860]   Because we were in Skunkworks.
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.420]   We did get some actual headcount from--
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:19.100]   and the ability-- we said we want to try this out.
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.980]   We'd like some headcount to try it.
[00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.940]   And we went ahead and did this.
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.020]   But we were just sort of an internal team helping out
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:26.820]   other engineering teams.
[00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.340]   But back to the name, we couldn't figure out
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.860]   what we were going to name ourselves.
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.660]   And sort of that bickering, money Python, life
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:35.620]   abrion thing, we wound up with the day liberation front.
[00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:40.020]   Because we figured either the front of the liberation
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.660]   or the people's front of day liberation.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:43.500]   It says something.
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.500]   Yeah.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:47.940]   The reason we chose the website and sort of somewhat
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:52.940]   subversive logo is because we think, a, dayliberation.org,
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.100]   we want this to be seen as more of a general movement,
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.540]   not necessarily just Google.
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.460]   But we'd love to see more of it across the internet.
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.620]   But B, it's for a big company to do this sort of thing.
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.020]   We think is rather subversive.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.580]   Although within Google, everybody I tell,
[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:09.220]   this is what we're doing.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:10.860]   And they're like, oh, yeah, of course.
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:11.940]   That makes complete sense.
[00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.940]   Exactly what the right thing to do is.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:14.420]   You have a--
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.100]   Never I've seen-- sorry, go ahead, Leo.
[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.580]   You have a Twitter account.
[00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.780]   And do people give you requests for--
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.740]   use this to say, hey, can you liberate this data?
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.180]   Can you liberate that data?
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:25.820]   We do, actually.
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.420]   We get people ask us questions.
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:29.660]   People mention stuff to us.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.420]   You found the photo.
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:30.740]   Our team's on there.
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.300]   There they are.
[00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.900]   They look a little scary in the uniforms.
[00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.740]   Very civil war.
[00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:40.500]   But we set up a Google moderator page for people
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.780]   to put up things that they want to see better liberated
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:44.580]   in questions.
[00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.140]   And one of my favorite things is every once in a while,
[00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.740]   we'll get somebody in the moderator page
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.180]   will ask us to liberate a product that
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.340]   isn't even our own.
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.820]   Please, free this product.
[00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.380]   That is an interesting thing to start to set up, you know,
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.780]   maybe a new independent organization that
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.740]   does become an arbiter of what it means for data
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:03.980]   to be liberated.
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.380]   And that is one of the things that we're--
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.340]   where we are talking about is what is it--
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.380]   because it gets kind of--
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.940]   I don't even want to go into the legal aspects of data ownership,
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.500]   especially when more than one person's working on a document.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.500]   I'll leave that to the copyright lawyers.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:23.100]   But to think about data from a control point of view,
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.700]   if you write a document and you put it in Google Docs,
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.220]   arguably, you should be able to do what you want with that.
[00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.540]   If I send you an email, arguably, you have a copy of that.
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.220]   You should be able to do what you want with it.
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:36.660]   But what if you and I collaborate on a document?
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.020]   How much of that is quote unquote, "mine" date?
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.740]   Well, that leads to my next question, which is "wave."
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.260]   Right.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.940]   A is an exportable now.
[00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.340]   And B, for the reasons you just mentioned,
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.060]   also for the kind of data issues, you have something
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.220]   in an entirely new format, an entirely new way
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.420]   to record collaboration.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:59.140]   In what form do you export it?
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:16:59.700]   Gina, have you tried?
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:00.700]   Exactly.
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.540]   We've actually--
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.060]   There's an early bot, an exporty bot,
[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.900]   that can apparently publish a wave to HTML,
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.140]   but it only works in the sandbox.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.420]   And things are still really early.
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.180]   Brian probably knows better than I do.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.260]   Well, we've actually talked to the wave team
[00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:17.780]   since it took quite a while.
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.460]   And since the first time I saw a wave demo,
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.100]   which was a long time ago, and they're
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:25.220]   very interested in doing the right thing as far as--
[00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.380]   they're open sourcing, they're federating, et cetera.
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.460]   And the ability to export your ways in some sort of format
[00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:33.860]   is definitely something they're interested in doing.
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:38.980]   You have a Google moderator page where people can vote
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:45.260]   or suggest, I guess, which products should be liberated.
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.020]   I guess it's not the way to say it.
[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:47.660]   I guess it is.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.900]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.660]   And 2,768 people have participated.
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.380]   15,000 total votes.
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:55.180]   That's fantastic.
[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:55.660]   There's obviously--
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.260]   Have you learned anything new there, things
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:01.260]   that you hadn't thought of in liberation terms?
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.060]   Well, one of the things--
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.460]   one of the things that comes up off-- a lot of the things
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.420]   we get are people actually wanting new features.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.740]   They want to ask for, oh, I'd like
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.660]   to be able to put this type of data in here,
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.380]   but it's been there, that sort of thing.
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.740]   But it sort of brings things to the forefront of what's
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.340]   of our attention.
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.340]   We know what people are more concerned about
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.700]   or more thinking about with regard to liberation.
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.220]   And it's not always backup either.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.940]   I mean, I noticed here somebody's saying,
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.260]   we want an API for Google moderator.
[00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:37.140]   When they say, when people see liberate, it's not just data.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.700]   Right.
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.780]   But is that part of your mission or do you stick with the data
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.900]   sign?
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.260]   Well, I mean, we try to leave a trail of APIs in our wake.
[00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.620]   I mean, we really do stand on the shoulders of giants.
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.860]   And so far as the Google data, the GData team,
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:55.420]   they've been working on APIs for years and years.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.980]   And there's sort of quietly in the background opening up
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.220]   all these products to developers.
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.300]   And we've sort of taken that and wrapped that up all
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.460]   in a nice neat package and given a nice HTML button
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.460]   or something to that effect.
[00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.100]   So it's kind of part of the API solution.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.180]   Yeah, I mean, if we encounter a product that doesn't have APIs,
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.460]   obviously APIs are step one and the liberation is step two.
[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.460]   Right.
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.300]   That's great.
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.940]   Well, we're really glad you could come and explain it.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.220]   Guys, you got any other questions for Brian before we let him go?
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.820]   We're just glad you're doing it.
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.980]   Yeah, I'm really glad this is happening.
[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:33.620]   I still have a nagging feeling that, like,
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.260]   exploitation isn't quite enough.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.260]   I mean, I wish that my Cloud Data could just sort of seamlessly
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:42.140]   and automatically sync to my local machines in the background
[00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.140]   that you have me to worry about it.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.700]   But that may be going sort of beyond--
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:47.940]   I mean, that's going beyond--
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.340]   Oh, no, we can ask for that.
[00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:50.340]   We can ask for that.
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.420]   We can ask for that.
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.420]   You're saying instead of exportation, we want integration.
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.300]   I mean, because I hear from people all the time,
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.220]   you say, I'm locked out of my Gmail account,
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.660]   and I can't get it and I'm screwed or whatever.
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:06.740]   Either lock out is usually the issue or I think lockout
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.780]   is probably the thing that most people
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.260]   are concerned about, especially for free services,
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.060]   where it's hard to get someone on the phone or that kind of thing.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.580]   So it's not backup, it's sync.
[00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.580]   I like that as a concept.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:16.820]   Yes.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.820]   Yeah.
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.020]   And I don't think that's an unusual thing to ask for either.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.060]   I mean, I think this is sort of step one.
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.980]   And there's a lot of different ways
[00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.580]   we can go with with the liberation in the future.
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.340]   But I mean, I think that the simple thing to say
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:36.300]   is that closed data, lack of integration,
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.180]   walled gardens are not sort of the way of the future,
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.340]   and it's not where it's going to be.
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.780]   And the real interesting thing happens
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.100]   when you have more access to your data,
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.220]   things are more transparent, you have more control,
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.180]   that sort of thing.
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:51.740]   Well, we're all for that.
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.860]   Yep, definitely.
[00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.660]   Glad that you are doing what you're doing.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.660]   That's for sure.
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:57.420]   I love to hear about--
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.700]   And I'm glad to get up with the company move if I want.
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.100]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.300]   And the company's supporting that.
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:01.820]   It's unusual.
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.660]   It's really kind of unheard of that a company would support that.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.140]   And it's part of the openness that I really like about Google.
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:12.460]   Yeah, the not evil part of Google.
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.260]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.780]   Really appreciate it, Brian.
[00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:15.380]   My pleasure.
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:15.940]   Take care.
[00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.220]   Brian, financials, Patrick.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.820]   Dataliberationfront.org.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.460]   If you--
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.620]   No, dataliberation.org.
[00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.940]   I'm sorry, dataliberation.org.
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.300]   Hey, where can we get those cool uniforms?
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.820]   I don't know about the uniforms.
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:28.940]   Well, we've got some stickers.
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.100]   We could definitely set you up with some last top sticker.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:31.980]   The Fis stickers?
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:32.580]   That's good.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.100]   Oops.
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:35.180]   I hung up on them by accident.
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.780]   Now we'll never know where to get those stickers.
[00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.580]   Oh, man.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.700]   My finger's on the button.
[00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.100]   I made the fist and he went away.
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:42.740]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:43.900]   I apologize.
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:44.820]   Well, I'll email him.
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:45.700]   And maybe we could find out.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.820]   That was extra bad.
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.980]   Stickers, screw you.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.180]   I don't want those stickers.
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:50.860]   I want the damn uniform.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.500]   I told you that.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:51.860]   What the uniform?
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.340]   What the uniform?
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.780]   I want the uniform.
[00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.140]   It was a little creepy.
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:55.940]   Did you see the uniform?
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.540]   It's on their Flickr page, or you could follow.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.460]   It's cool.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.620]   It's a little weird.
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:07.620]   It's a mix between Devo meets the 1984 commercial from Apple.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.620]   It's very, very strange.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.580]   But I'm glad-- I'm really glad Google's doing it.
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:18.260]   And I wanted to give them a little extra plug for doing that.
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:23.820]   And continue to urge them to keep their eye on that.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.580]   Moving on in just a bit with some of the other big stories
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.500]   in the Googleverse, and there are quite a few of them,
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.140]   they released about 80 tools this week.
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.140]   It was a big week for Google before we do that,
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.020]   though I would like to mention our friends at Citrix,
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.220]   the makers of GoToAssistExpress.
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.580]   If you're a programmer or a support person,
[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.780]   if you've got IT chores that you need to do,
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.020]   you need GoToAssist.
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:48.940]   This is a really fantastic product.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.100]   I'd like you to try out from the folks at Citrix.
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.180]   They're kind of the experts on Remote Access,
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.220]   and they've taken their Remote Access platform
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.140]   and made an IT support platform that
[00:22:57.140 --> 00:23:00.540]   is second to none with some great features, things
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.820]   like the ability to do eight sessions at once,
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.700]   unattended sessions.
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:07.020]   I don't have to tell you why you'd want eight sessions at once.
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.300]   I mean, it's really nice to be able to start a scan or a backup
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.100]   and then move on to the next computer without having
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.940]   to wait around for the first one to finish.
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.820]   It also does a survey of what software is running,
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.540]   what the operating system is, what security software
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:23.540]   is running in the background.
[00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:24.260]   Very useful.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:25.860]   You can drag and drop files from your computer
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:26.580]   to the Remote computer.
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:32.660]   It works PC to PC, Mac to PC, Mac to Mac, PC to Mac.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:35.780]   And it's just about as easy to install as you would expect
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.740]   from the folks at Citrix.
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:40.740]   Try it right now for 30 days, absolutely free.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:41.700]   That's right, free.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:46.420]   Go to gotoassist.com/twig.
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.580]   G-O-T-O, assist.com/twig.
[00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:49.220]   And give it a try.
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.940]   I've used it for--
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:54.940]   I think we started using it at the beginning of the decade
[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:56.540]   with the screen savers.
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.980]   And it's just been a great boon to us.
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:01.500]   Gotoassist.com/twig.
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:04.660]   We thank them for their support of this week in Google.
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:10.020]   I want to go back a little bit to a story that we did
[00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:13.940]   and was changed immediately after the show came out.
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.620]   And that's the Etherpad story.
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.140]   Yeah.
[00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.140]   Oh, yes.
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:17.980]   And minutes after.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:18.540]   Minutes after.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.140]   Minutes after.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.660]   As soon as we got off, we all changed.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.580]   Yeah.
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:24.140]   And so we mentioned last week that Google had acquired Etherpad
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.380]   and really fumbled.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:26.900]   Flubbed it.
[00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.220]   Yeah.
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.540]   There's the F word I was looking for.
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:33.860]   Flubbed the transition by just turning it off.
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.100]   And I know, Gina, you were upset.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.780]   A lot of programmers who use Etherpad were upset.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.620]   What happened?
[00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.820]   They did a complete 360.
[00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.780]   Yay.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:44.420]   Yeah, which is great.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:45.340]   They listened to the users.
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.140]   I was impressed.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.540]   They reopened Etherpad.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.740]   You can now create new pads.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.220]   And they promise that they will keep it open
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.100]   until all of the source is open source.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.140]   And can live on in other ways.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.420]   So at least until it's open source.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.300]   So I was pretty impressed.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.940]   They should have done this to begin with.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.100]   I mean, at this point, Google has acquired enough products,
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:04.460]   I think.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.420]   They should have known.
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:05.780]   Yeah.
[00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:06.180]   Works.
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:06.980]   They should have known.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.620]   But still, Kudos for the quick turnaround.
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.420]   I mean, I think this was like a Thursday to Saturday 360.
[00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.100]   So Lars's cool was great.
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:13.740]   Did you hear that?
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:14.740]   No, Lars Raskman.
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:15.380]   I forget where he was.
[00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.220]   But he just said, what were we thinking?
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.820]   That's the way to handle it.
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.180]   That's just so great.
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.300]   That's just the way to handle it.
[00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.460]   And he's just saying, we made a mistake.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:25.620]   Sorry.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:26.620]   And then to fix it.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.420]   Now, there has been some skepticism
[00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:31.620]   of the opening it up claim.
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.380]   Like, well, we'll believe that when we see it.
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:38.300]   Do you think that that's something they have a bad history
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:38.820]   of that?
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:39.860]   I don't know.
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.500]   But--
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.420]   Well, I mean, they're integrating into the wave team.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.700]   And the wave source code is open.
[00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.660]   I don't see why it would be an issue.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.980]   I think there was an issue with maybe some of the libraries
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.780]   that they're using not being open source.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.180]   There might be some licensing issues.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.220]   But I mean, I don't have any reason to think that they wouldn't
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:54.740]   do it.
[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.700]   I mean, the wave team really is one of the most open--
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.220]   And the--
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:25:59.820]   --pros they have, so--
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:00.940]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.500]   Well, and I'm just opening it up again,
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.340]   because people were just really missing the functionality.
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.140]   I think it was just a really smooth way to handle it.
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:07.660]   Yeah.
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.820]   So we just wanted to correct ourselves.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.580]   It's just sometimes that happens.
[00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.860]   It covers something.
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.180]   And one week between shows, we don't
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.780]   have any way to update an audio show in the middle.
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.940]   So I guess I could have come on and said, never mind.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:21.940]   They fixed it.
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.900]   And they fixed it.
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.900]   They were writing this blog post while we were talking.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:26.380]   I know.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.300]   It's so funny.
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.220]   They must have been.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:28.900]   They must have been.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:30.500]   Maybe they were listening to us and said, whoops.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.100]   That's right.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.100]   Whoops.
[00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:32.740]   Whoops.
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:33.580]   You know, last week I was--
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.780]   If Twig says it, we got to do it.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.300]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:35.900]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:36.980]   I swear they've been listening to us,
[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:38.220]   because last week I was complaining
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.660]   that Google Wave doesn't have Control Z, Undo, and Redo.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.740]   And that got it added in this week.
[00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.860]   So I think we've got somebody's ear.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:48.620]   We have a bully pulpit.
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:49.500]   Let's use it.
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.420]   What do we want to fix?
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:52.100]   Let's fix it.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:52.900]   So Leo.
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.580]   Yes.
[00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:57.740]   I just got a tweet from Brad Davis-Seal,
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.500]   who says that the company that I imagined only minutes ago
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.100]   exists.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:04.740]   This is how powerful we are.
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.700]   This is great.
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.780]   I wish this happens.
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.140]   And it occurs.
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.860]   So it's what the site is called Back Up If I, B-A-C-K-U-P-I-F-Y.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.180]   And it says that it supports backups of Twitter, WordPress,
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.260]   Google Docs, Gmail, Facebook, Zoho,
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.820]   Delicious Flickr, Basecamp, Photo Bucket, and more.
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.300]   Wow.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.540]   I mean, you couldn't back up everything,
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.340]   but the fact that it backs up those big names.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.580]   You can back up today.
[00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:26.100]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.180]   Yeah, I mean, it's a neat idea.
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.460]   Well, I'm sure it doesn't operate as smoothly as it could
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.020]   if there were cooperation from those companies.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:33.420]   Yeah.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.580]   Well, I mean, maybe these all have APIs.
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.100]   So let's see.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.740]   It's free Twitter backup.
[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.220]   Of course, Gina, you've been doing that for a while.
[00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:45.260]   Basic comes with two gigabytes of storage.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.300]   Yeah, you're going to be spending $5 a month
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.500]   for 10 gigabytes or 15 bucks a month for 50 gigabytes.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.380]   That's pretty cool.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.100]   Yeah, but it's a great idea.
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:54.500]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:54.860]   Start.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:54.860]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:55.860]   Yeah.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:56.660]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:57.180]   Yeah.
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.180]   Yeah.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.700]   You know, but I think it's interesting
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.060]   that he talked about integration.
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.980]   And you talked about integration, Jeff.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.900]   I think it really has to be more than just
[00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:06.020]   getting a lump.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.340]   That was a decourosed Gina.
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:07.860]   That was Gina.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:08.340]   Yeah.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.180]   I think that's right.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:10.860]   Because otherwise, you're going to back up the backup
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:11.700]   to back up the backup.
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:11.900]   Right.
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.220]   And then when you actually eat it,
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.860]   it's like having an old, as you said earlier,
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.860]   five and a half inch disk.
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.140]   What the hell do you do with it?
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.460]   I think the next generation of all of this--
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.340]   I've always bugged me that we create all these little silos.
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.740]   And the next generation really has
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.820]   to take a look at integrating it all across platforms.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.780]   So we don't just have--
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.740]   I mean, it's OK for a Twitter to exist
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.020]   for an individual event or to do it.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.220]   But it's not OK for it to be a data silo.
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.500]   It has to interoperate somehow.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.500]   Well, what Gina really said, I think,
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:43.180]   is that the import of this is that you have to have not
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.740]   only the right to your data, but the right
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.860]   to a player for your data.
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.100]   Yes.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:49.260]   Right.
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.220]   Just having the VHS tape is no good
[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:54.420]   if you don't have a VHS machine.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.060]   So just having your Gmail is no good,
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.420]   if nothing else can read it.
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:00.740]   But I'm even thinking, you know, I'm pumping a lot of content
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.540]   into a variety of places--
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.820]   just use Facebook and Twitter.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.380]   There needs to be some way of--
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:08.500]   I guess we're getting there of kind of interoperating
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.940]   between them so that you can have a presence in one place,
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:13.260]   second presence in another place,
[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.700]   so we can follow each other even across--
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:16.980]   it's Federation is what it's called,
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.740]   even across these different silos.
[00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.620]   So it's not merely for backup and play,
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.980]   but it's even while we're doing it--
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:25.340]   Current use.
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.460]   --all the time, yeah.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.860]   And I know it's a thorny one, and I
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.300]   know that we're a long way from solving it.
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.740]   But I would hope that that's kind of the web 3.0,
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.060]   the next generation of it, is we figure out a way to do it.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.980]   Do you see the-- now, I would like to know your--
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.580]   this is the Kremlinology here.
[00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.820]   We've been talking in the past about whether Google has
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:47.460]   a phone or not.
[00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.100]   You know?
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.460]   And there's a blog post--
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.740]   Don't worry that we'll not--
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.380]   Yeah.
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.700]   The Times now says that Google appears closer
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.420]   to releasing its own phone.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:01.260]   This is in the bits blog on December 12.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.020]   Google employees, according to the Times,
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.940]   is Miguel Health writing of the Times, who
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:06.700]   asked not to be identified, confirmed recently.
[00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.340]   The company was indeed helping to develop new hardware
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:11.780]   and software for Android phones.
[00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:16.900]   They said the project wouldn't alienate allies.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:21.380]   On Friday, Google began distributing new phones
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:26.420]   to employees who began tweeting about them.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.380]   Some of them refer to the device as the new Google phone.
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.060]   And on Saturday, today, Google confirmed
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:38.860]   that it's testing a new concept in mobile phones.
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.460]   I don't know.
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.900]   Here's the Kremlinology.
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.500]   The blog post says it's--
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:45.860]   well, I'll read you.
[00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.260]   We recently came up with a concept of a mobile lab, which
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.580]   is a device--
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:54.740]   a mobile lab, which is a device that combines innovative hardware
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.660]   from a partner with software that runs on Android
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.780]   to experiment with new mobile features and capabilities.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.820]   We shared this device with Google employees across the globe.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:06.620]   This means they got to test out a new technology
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.580]   and help improvement, unfortunately,
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.940]   because dogfooding is a process exclusively
[00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:15.220]   for Google employees who cannot share specific product details.
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.180]   And that's where the Kremlin's shut up.
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:18.700]   So--
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:20.820]   This video is where you want to have one of those things that
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:24.660]   changes your voice and what's a black mark on the face.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.580]   Where's the new--
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.580]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.180]   I don't think that you can read this.
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:32.900]   Now, here's where we go in interpretation and say,
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.060]   oh, Google's doing a device themselves.
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:38.020]   I mean, they're just testing stuff, right?
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.620]   But they are trying to taunt us here with the idea
[00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:43.900]   that they have something that is otherworldly.
[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.740]   And it almost strikes me as a kind of Apple-like game.
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.860]   I'm saying you won't believe what we have next.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:50.620]   We're not telling you.
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:53.020]   But oh, what do you see it?
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.820]   So now TechCrunch is saying this is an HTC device, which
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:01.140]   is unlocked, an unlocked HTC GSM phone.
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:02.060]   God bless it.
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.020]   The passion?
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:06.740]   Really?
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:09.620]   The passion?
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:10.100]   Really?
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:11.740]   Will it come out on Easter?
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:12.740]   Yeah.
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.260]   I was thinking something else, Leo.
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.940]   But--
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.660]   Early, January.
[00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:21.780]   Not Valentine's Day or Easter.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.060]   The passion.
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.580]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:26.660]   But so it's not a Google phone.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.540]   It's just another provider doing another phone.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.300]   But it is Android 2.1, right?
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.300]   It's Android 2.1.
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.820]   It's not specific to any carrier.
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.020]   So they're going to release it.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:35.700]   It's unlocked.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:38.860]   So you can pop a SIM card into it, which I have on it.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:42.180]   And Google has a hand in the hardware development as well.
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:43.660]   They are working with HTC.
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:45.060]   It's completely Google branded.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.300]   So there's no HTC branding.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.700]   But that doesn't make sense because it's called the passion.
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.860]   And that doesn't strike me as a name that Google would have chosen.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.020]   No, that's an HTC name.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.020]   They like that kind of stuff.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.180]   They get the hero and the touch.
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.460]   And yeah, that's an HTC name.
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:56.820]   Yeah.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:57.340]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:57.620]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:58.180]   I love this, too.
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:03.300]   It's becoming Google's monomaniacal fetishism toward fast.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.340]   The TechCrunch piece says the phone is, quote,
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.420]   "really, really fast" says someone who's seen it in action.
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:13.220]   Well, it should be because that was the knock on the G1,
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.820]   was it was really, really slow.
[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.740]   And that must have really annoyed Google.
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.540]   But now that the droid and the aress are out,
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.180]   and these are pretty snappy little devices.
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.740]   Well, here's the other little trick here.
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:28.180]   It says it has a camera that is, quote, "weirdly large" for a phone.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.340]   But if you put that together with the other thing that came out
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.540]   this week, which is Google Goggles--
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.060]   Oh, yes.
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:35.780]   I've seen Schmidt talk about this at the Force--
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.900]   What the hell is Google Goggles?
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:43.580]   You can point the camera on the phone to an object, a place,
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.660]   or I've heard from certain people
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:47.780]   soon a face of a person.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.180]   And that becomes your search query.
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:50.660]   What?
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.860]   This is awesome, by the way.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:53.060]   What?
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.060]   So you're scanning a face?
[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:55.940]   Well, OK, OK.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.780]   So it's an Android application.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.060]   And right now, facial recognition is not supported.
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.340]   But they did the search event at the computer
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.820]   history museum this week.
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.300]   And a reporter asked, what about facial recognition?
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:13.020]   So it supports logos, book covers, DVDs, landmarks, and objects.
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.140]   So you take a picture, it scans the object,
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.780]   and it identifies what it is and returns Google search results
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:18.740]   for it.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.980]   And someone asked, what about faces?
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:23.900]   Because Picasa and Picasa Web have facial recognition.
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.300]   So ostensibly, it wouldn't be that big of a stretch
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.660]   that you could point your camera phone at somebody's face
[00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:32.180]   and get Google search results.
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:35.860]   And they said that faces are objects which can be recognized,
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.980]   but that they did not turn that on because of privacy issues.
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:40.460]   They need to work out the privacy issues.
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.500]   Well, I think we're very--
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.180]   I've heard from other executives that it is imminent,
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:45.700]   that they can do that.
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:46.580]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.660]   It's kind of scary, the idea that you
[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.700]   could be in a room with someone, snap a photo of a stranger
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:53.940]   from across the room and get Google search results
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.180]   before you even speak to that person,
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.260]   without knowing their name.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.820]   I mean, it makes sense, but it's also a little creepy.
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:01.580]   I want this.
[00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:02.580]   You know what I really want?
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.380]   And every old person is always one of this.
[00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:05.860]   Exactly.
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:06.980]   It's memory time.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.460]   You know what I'm going, Jeff.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.340]   I want a little earpiece in my ear, a little ear button there.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.940]   I want a little camera on my lapel,
[00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:13.940]   and it just goes--
[00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:15.820]   That's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.420]   His son is named Jake.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.820]   His birthday is on November.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.780]   And that would be so cool.
[00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:22.460]   Like the queen.
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.380]   The queen has that, but it's a human.
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.380]   Well, now let's tie it together with another thing
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.860]   from Google this week, which is putting the QR codes
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.060]   on 1,000 favorite places.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:32.580]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:37.540]   So you have the physical code on a business or a place.
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.820]   You take a picture of that with your iPhone,
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.580]   and that again becomes a search query,
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.780]   and you find out about that place.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:45.940]   Do you get to feel the Google is just--
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:50.620]   Yes, it's so perfectly positioned to do this stuff.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.860]   The opportunity for this company is limitless.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.100]   So now you start to see what goes
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.020]   beyond this notion of the quaint old phone.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.020]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.980]   So this device is not only making you constantly,
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.940]   perpetually connected to the world.
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.420]   It's also connecting the world to it.
[00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.180]   It becomes your world connection device
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.780]   that what you see and experience can come back through
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.180]   and populate not only search queries,
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.820]   but your own personal data.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:20.140]   4 square like where have I been?
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.620]   What have I done?
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.820]   What do I want to know about this?
[00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:25.380]   What can I say about this?
[00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:25.900]   It's so--
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.140]   That becomes really powerful.
[00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.340]   It's so freaking cool.
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.580]   It's kind of crazy.
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:34.060]   But the barcode and the window thing, I don't know,
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.900]   my first reaction was like, am I really
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.900]   going to scan a barcode on a coffee shop window?
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.300]   I mean, of course I will to try it out.
[00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:41.980]   I will.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:42.900]   But most people do not.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:44.380]   Gina, why don't you go to a restaurant?
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.660]   And you can scan through the barcode
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:50.020]   or through just now a picture, and you get all the reviews
[00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:51.340]   right off the bat.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.140]   Oh no.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.700]   I was in-- was it Paris?
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.100]   In Paris, you see on the posters everywhere,
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.980]   the QR codes on the corner.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:58.980]   Ah.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.580]   Oh.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:00.900]   So I mean--
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.660]   You're so worldly, Leo.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.300]   Well, when I was in Paris-- this was a year ago.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.700]   So I think that a lot of phones--
[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.620]   maybe European phones have the QR capability,
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.700]   or at least software for it.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.900]   I know you can get Android can get something.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.820]   I phone could get something that will read those.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.900]   It is a lot easier.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.300]   I mean, aren't we already-- maybe you don't do this.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.220]   But I do this.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:26.220]   I take pictures of stuff on my phone to remember it.
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.020]   A flower.
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.300]   Or-- I mean, I use every--
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:29.860]   Parking Spot.
[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:31.460]   Parking Spot.
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.700]   If you were on it, I could easily see you're on a subway train
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.860]   and you see an ad and you take a picture of the ad.
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.700]   How much better to just do the QR code
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.180]   and you get all the information in there?
[00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.540]   I think that's kind of natural.
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.180]   Gina, I think you're right too though.
[00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:47.020]   Is the some point GPS does it for you?
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:47.540]   Right.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:48.460]   That's the four-slamers.
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:48.980]   Or God.
[00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:49.500]   I'm here.
[00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:49.980]   Or God.
[00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.260]   I'm on the goggles.
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.460]   See, that's why--
[00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:54.340]   Yeah, if I'm standing in front of the place already,
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:57.860]   I'm more likely to just browse the menu in the window
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.420]   versus take out my phone and scan a barcode.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:03.220]   But on posters in the subway, this makes a lot of sense
[00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.020]   to me, for sure.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.340]   So I can download goggles now?
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.980]   Yeah, it's in the market.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.820]   It's an Android market.
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:09.780]   It's Android only.
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:10.340]   I'll be with you later.
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.780]   Which made a lot of iPhone owners not happy.
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.380]   So I wrote this barcode this week that all the best Android
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.140]   apps are made by Google at this point.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.140]   Yes, I think you're right.
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.180]   Except for Amazon MP3.
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.940]   But that got a lot of people a little upset.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.660]   But everything else is either on par with what's
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:30.340]   available for the iPhone or less so.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.540]   Well, this is the Google kind of ways.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.220]   Do it yourself.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.580]   That's why I credit the Google phone.
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:37.220]   Because you get the feeling--
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.460]   I don't know what's going on internally.
[00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.340]   But you get the feeling they get fed up.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:41.340]   And they just say, oh, screw it.
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.300]   I'm just going to do it ourselves.
[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.140]   Right.
[00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:45.500]   And they're using their own applications
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.420]   to differentiate Android from the iPhone OS.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.380]   I mean, the Google Maps on Android
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.780]   is just way better than the iPhone at this point.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.740]   And that's a really good killer app for your mobile phone.
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.140]   You want good maps.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:00.860]   Well, you've also learned from the Google ROMs fiasco
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:04.140]   that those proprietary applications that Google owns
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:07.220]   and doesn't let you distribute yourself.
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.100]   Our closed source.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:08.900]   Those are closed source.
[00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.660]   And it may be that that's another way
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:14.220]   of controlling a little bit the environment.
[00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:16.100]   So I do sense we're on the cusp of something
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:17.340]   that's the next device.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.820]   I argue that when the iPhone came out,
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.100]   they actually should have released it first
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:24.220]   as the iPod touch and as a computer as you had.
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.060]   And then added and said, oh, guess what?
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.140]   We just added a phone to it.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:27.980]   Right.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.900]   It's a computer that-- oh, yeah, we put a phone in.
[00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:31.380]   Well, they were in a bigger hurry than that.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:31.900]   Right.
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.780]   And I get that.
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.980]   But I think in this case, you want
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:36.300]   to try to push people's minds past the idea of just
[00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.580]   what a mirror phone is.
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.980]   Yeah.
[00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.460]   By the way, when they announced the QR thing, I went on
[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:45.300]   and they had pictures of the places with the QR codes
[00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.500]   on the web.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.940]   So I took a picture of the QR code with my iPhone off
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.260]   the screen.
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.700]   And I kept getting the wrong place.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:55.780]   And so I tweeted that.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.060]   And God bless somebody from the QR team at Google.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.540]   The places team at Google tweeted back to me
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.540]   and-- or email me back and said,
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.300]   PR person just sent this to me.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:06.380]   What's the problem?
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.180]   And then I guess the resolution on the QR code,
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.780]   if you take it off a screen, is just that much off.
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.340]   There was going someplace else on the list.
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.740]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:19.420]   I think QR is an intermediate step that really--
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.860]   the thing should be smart enough not to have to look for some
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:23.340]   code just to go, oh, I get it.
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.140]   Slically.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.980]   Somebody said they pointed goggles at the screen,
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:28.740]   the video stream that we sent.
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:32.460]   And Google sent them to Twitch on the search page.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.940]   Really?
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:34.940]   That's how smart can this be?
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:35.980]   It may seem the logo.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.340]   It's really good with logos.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:38.700]   Must have seen the logo.
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.260]   Yeah.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:39.740]   Yeah.
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.340]   It's quite good with logos, actually.
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.340]   That's kind of spooky.
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.980]   I love it, though.
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:47.780]   I mean, basically, this is what you want.
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.340]   I mean, that's what search really is.
[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.460]   Ultimately, tell me what's going on.
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:53.900]   What's that mean?
[00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.980]   Right, so we go to this whole thing about static search,
[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:59.220]   now becoming live search, now you get truly
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:02.260]   place-based and object-based search.
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:04.860]   Object being a place or a person.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.420]   Wow.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.380]   I'm just boggled by goggles.
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.300]   This is--
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.020]   That's really amazing.
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:11.100]   --that title to show this way, perhaps?
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:11.380]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.540]   I think you just did it.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.140]   I saw your reflex there to write it down
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.260]   so you don't forget about it.
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.660]   That's new phone will do for you.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:19.700]   Well, yeah, exactly.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:20.460]   No, I have a chat.
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.820]   Well, see, I have had the chat room
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:23.260]   to do this for me for a long time.
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.140]   I will just--
[00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:25.980]   At the end of the show, I'll say, what was that title?
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.500]   And they'll say, boggled for goggles.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.340]   So I actually have people for that.
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.180]   There's about 600 or 700 people who are watching it all times.
[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.380]   Nice crowdsourcing.
[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.540]   They're my brain.
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.060]   It's great.
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:35.860]   I love it.
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.940]   So I have a little sense of how cool this would be.
[00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.100]   And I don't think it's eventually--
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.220]   I think it's going to be an all-time real time.
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.980]   Just that Gordon Bell's idea of you
[00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.180]   wear the camera around your neck,
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.420]   and it's recording everything that you do all the time.
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.820]   Well, why shouldn't that camera also be giving you information
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.860]   about stuff you're looking at?
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:56.700]   I'm just very excited about this whole idea.
[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:58.940]   More from Google coming up in just a second.
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.540]   This was the week that--
[00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:02.420]   I don't know.
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.980]   We might look back on this week and say,
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:08.380]   this is when Google kind of just took off.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.660]   How many announcements did they have?
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:11.820]   It felt like a dozen.
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.220]   Well, yeah, if you go to their official Google blog
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.980]   and it has this week of search this week and this,
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.780]   this week and that, there's just four or five things
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:19.140]   in all of them.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:19.980]   That's just amazing.
[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:23.060]   And by the way, thank you for stealing this weekend.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.700]   I appreciate it, Google.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.500]   We still have this week in Google, though.
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.940]   See, they can have all those others.
[00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.220]   But we have this week in Google.
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.140]   We own--
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.460]   Here's the other really neat announcement that I love.
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:35.300]   Save it.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:35.740]   Oh, save it.
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:36.140]   OK.
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:37.540]   Because I'm--
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:38.900]   That's called a tease.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.020]   It's called a very brutal abrupt tease.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.860]   It was so subtle, I didn't even get it.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.140]   That's how smooth you are.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.620]   You know, we've got more things to talk about the moment,
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.500]   but right now I'd like to talk to you about my Ford.
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:53.780]   And the Ford Sync the Mighty Mighty Ford Sync--
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.900]   I have a video on here.
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.100]   I'll show you.
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.340]   I'm going to take more videos of it.
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.700]   Because people don't believe me when I say that my car
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.460]   understands what I'm saying.
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:04.060]   It's like Google goggles for your car is what it is.
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.180]   You're talking to your car.
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.540]   It's like having hell in here.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.740]   Sync is the hands-free calling, music search,
[00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.060]   turn-by-turn navigation, information search,
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:15.300]   built into Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury vehicles.
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.900]   It has-- you press a button in your steering wheels.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.740]   You don't have to take your eyes off the window,
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:24.380]   because it's not the screen.
[00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:25.180]   It's talking to you.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:26.700]   There is a little screen, but it's not about what's
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.820]   on the screen.
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:29.500]   So when you ask for directions, it walks you
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:30.220]   through the directions.
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.740]   It tells you what the traffic is going to be.
[00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:32.740]   You can get sports scores.
[00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:34.900]   I can tell it things like-- I press a button.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.100]   I say, "Climate."
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.860]   And I can tell it with temperature to make the car.
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:40.780]   I can go on and on.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.860]   It can give you vehicle health reports.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:45.060]   You get a website, SyncMyRide.com.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.260]   That you can go to and get all this information about your car.
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.980]   You can also get updates, because every Ford Sync
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:52.500]   vehicle has a USB port.
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:56.460]   So you can take a thumb drive, download software on the website,
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.900]   and bring it over to the car and install it on the car.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.180]   In fact, they plan to do applications next year.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.380]   There's this magical convergence happening.
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.340]   They're also opening the platform.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.580]   It's just remarkable.
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.140]   I am very happy to be associated with Ford.
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.500]   The only American auto company that
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:18.900]   didn't take TARP funds or whatever, the bailout funds,
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.020]   they are very forward-thinking.
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.900]   They're really very active in social media.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.100]   They're paying attention to this stuff.
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.580]   And I think that that's why Ford is--
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.460]   I'm just thrilled to be driving an American car,
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.620]   and I'm really thrilled to be telling you about Ford Sync.
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:33.180]   Find out more.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.900]   Go to SyncMyRide podcast.com.
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.780]   Sometimes it's good to be proud to be an American,
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.500]   not going to say.
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.940]   SyncMyRide podcast.com.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.700]   And for those of you listening outside the US,
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.940]   it's great to be you, too.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:49.140]   I don't mean it's not great to be you, too.
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.580]   I keep forgetting that this is really
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.340]   an international audience.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:55.820]   But look at, guys, our car industry's been dying.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.900]   We're just happy to have one that's surviving and doing
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.020]   and thriving and doing well.
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.260]   SyncMyRide podcast.com.
[00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:02.140]   All right, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:04.620]   What was it you just were so excited about?
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.980]   Well, coming back to the secreticity of this,
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.660]   the Google is trying to-- they always
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:11.620]   want to know your intent and anticipate your intent.
[00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.980]   And it's almost freaky that when you start typing in,
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:17.380]   their example was, weather in New York in the search box,
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:20.780]   and it's pre-filling out the possibilities of what you're doing.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.780]   It also says, I know what you want
[00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:26.100]   and gives you the forecast right there in the search box.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:26.660]   So the search box--
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:27.300]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:27.860]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:28.460]   Now, so this is--
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:30.060]   If I go to Google.com--
[00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:34.100]   Go to Google.com and search for weather in Chicago.
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.060]   And by the way, that fade-in thing is weird.
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.860]   OK, but Google, weather--
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:40.380]   Isn't it a little strange that the controls don't fade
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.740]   into later?
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:43.460]   Weather in--
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.940]   That's going to give me some choices.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:46.740]   Oh, Chicago.
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:47.340]   It's fading in.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.340]   I'm trying to test it.
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.020]   I messed up.
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:49.740]   I messed it up.
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.580]   You couldn't even do it.
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:52.580]   It's not--
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:53.860]   Oh, there it is.
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:55.380]   Holy scumoly.
[00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:56.860]   You haven't finished typing Chicago,
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:46:01.500]   and it's already giving you the answer in the search box.
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.980]   Whoa.
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:04.060]   Forget the web page.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:04.900]   I would love to suggest.
[00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:05.820]   Suggest is awesome.
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:07.540]   But now, suggest is even more awesome.
[00:46:07.540 --> 00:46:07.860]   Awesome.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:08.380]   Is it amazing?
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:09.780]   Because it has images in it.
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:11.100]   So it's all about intent.
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:12.420]   And if it can know your intent, it's
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.140]   going to give it to you before you can friggin' ask.
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:19.020]   And I can click this box, and it will give me more.
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:21.300]   And oh, my gosh.
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:25.020]   I had dinner this week at a Michael Wolf, the media columnist,
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.500]   played host to a dinner for Yuri Milner, the guy who
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.300]   invested in Facebook for the Russian oligarch.
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:31.300]   It was fascinating.
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:32.100]   I got to sit next to the guy.
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.740]   I bet that was really interesting.
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.140]   Oh, it was great.
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:37.260]   But he was talking about what happens in a world
[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.500]   where you have a billion people, which
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.820]   is Facebook soon will, connected to a billion computers.
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.340]   And what does that mean for intelligence and intent,
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:50.500]   and how things will anticipate your needs, not just answer them.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.340]   And the power of that--
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.060]   And notice that an AdSense link also
[00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.380]   appears when you type the word weather.
[00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:55.380]   Why didn't you see that, Gina?
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.380]   Good catch.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.820]   You're in it, really?
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:01.900]   If it added ads to the free search box, this is incredible.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.180]   They're so brilliant.
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:06.460]   It's like, oh, look at that, the Weather Channel.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.180]   Oh, that's amazing.
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.660]   Yeah, that's-- yeah.
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.740]   Wow.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:15.540]   Is that an AdSense ad or is that a sponsor kind of ad?
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.460]   The Weather Channel have to buy weather.
[00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.180]   Why does weather come up?
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:20.260]   They must have bought weather.
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.180]   Well, I'll tell you what.
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.100]   Let's just do a search.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:23.580]   That's the order they buy this as--
[00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.060]   Can anybody just buy that?
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:25.740]   Actually, no.
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.420]   If you take the word life hacker,
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:30.300]   life hacker appears first, and we definitely did not buy that.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:34.100]   And I don't see, by the way, the Weather Channel
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:36.300]   on the sponsored links when I type in weather and hit return.
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.860]   Yeah, that is not AdSense.
[00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:38.740]   Did you type "twit"?
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:39.740]   Oh, there it is at the bottom.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:40.900]   You can Twitter it.com first.
[00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.660]   Oh, they don't like that one cotton-picking bit.
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.820]   Because that not goes away from there.
[00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:47.740]   If you put .tv, you get you Leo.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:49.220]   Let me ask this.
[00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:49.780]   Is that evil?
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.900]   Oh, I didn't buy that.
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:53.820]   That's not evil.
[00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:56.540]   But why is it linked and underscored like that?
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:57.860]   I didn't buy that.
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:02.180]   Because it looks like it's just-- it knows that--
[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.860]   How is it-- why does it do that, though,
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.460]   instead of just the link below, which says twit.tv,
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.340]   it says it gives the full title of the TwitNet cast network
[00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:10.100]   with Leo Laporte.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:11.540]   But do you buy the keyword twit?
[00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:12.540]   No.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.300]   No?
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.220]   That's weird.
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:16.740]   I'm not unhappy.
[00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:18.940]   I mean, I wish Twit would give me--
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.180]   but of course, I could see why I go to Twitter.
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:23.620]   But as soon as I put a dot after it,
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:26.780]   it goes Twit-- it thinks I'm going to Twit.tv.
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:29.900]   That's remarkable.
[00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.860]   Yeah, so well, I would have thought it was a slightly evil
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.060]   if it was an ad, but now it's clearly not an ad.
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:34.460]   No, that's not.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:34.940]   It's all right.
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:35.300]   Google your own.
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.260]   This is like Google just becomes sentient.
[00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:42.260]   It's like, do you feel like all of a sudden this week just
[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:43.980]   got a-- oomph.
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:44.980]   It became sentient.
[00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.180]   And all of this stuff is happening.
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:47.700]   Why?
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.580]   What happened at Google?
[00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:52.500]   Did it reach critical mass?
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:53.620]   I don't understand.
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:53.860]   Now--
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:54.980]   It was the Messiah.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.460]   The moment has come.
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:01.060]   You know, I feel like 2009 was just this incredible year
[00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:01.460]   for Google.
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.220]   I mean, they had that focus on speed,
[00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:04.220]   which they delivered on.
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:05.500]   I mean, that just wasn't PR.
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:08.460]   I mean, Google has put out dozens of products and tools
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.380]   at this point that increased speed of the web.
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:11.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.420]   And then--
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.980]   They're right, by the way, speed is everything.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:15.740]   They're right.
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.940]   I'm not going to deny that.
[00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:19.820]   I mean, I don't remember 2008, Google
[00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:23.140]   having a focus on a particular concept like speed,
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.340]   like the way that they did this year.
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:26.000]   Right.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.300]   It's like they had an off-site last year.
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.380]   And they said, OK, we're going to get it together.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:33.540]   What should we focus on?
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:35.860]   We could speed.
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:38.220]   I mean, it's very interesting.
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.020]   I think the Google culture-- you know this better
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.020]   than anyone, Jeff.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.140]   The Google culture is kind of a non-traditional corporate
[00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:43.420]   culture.
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.700]   It's very committee driven, which you would think
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:48.460]   would make it very hard to suddenly all agree
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.740]   speed is the process.
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.260]   I mean, it seems--
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:53.180]   Well, but isn't it also, I think, just that--
[00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:54.140]   Larry likes speed.
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.300]   OK, we all like speed.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:56.820]   Let's give Larry fast stuff.
[00:49:56.820 --> 00:49:57.820]   Right.
[00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:58.780]   And I think it--
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:00.140]   So he has that kind of-- there's still
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.780]   that leadership coming from the top.
[00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:04.100]   Well, let me-- I think it's a really, really good point,
[00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.660]   really smart point.
[00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:06.860]   I've worked in a lot of companies,
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:09.820]   because I have a checkered resume and can't keep a job.
[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.460]   But I've worked for mobile companies,
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:15.660]   like Murdoch or Maxwell or First or Newhouse.
[00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.260]   And I've worked for corporate companies
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:20.540]   like Time Inc, which are more ruled by task forces
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.940]   and committees.
[00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:23.780]   Maybe-- just thinking about this, as you say it,
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.300]   I think in a sense, Google combines the two,
[00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:30.140]   where you have the committee filter structure.
[00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.860]   No, you've got to go through this gauntlet to get there.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:35.420]   But at the top of it is a mogul.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:36.420]   Right.
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.180]   A can.
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:38.380]   A can.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:38.900]   A model.
[00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.420]   Or a plunter, perhaps, in this case.
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:43.820]   But this is not a-- well, it doesn't feel that way.
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:44.420]   All right.
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.020]   By the way--
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:45.780]   That's a point.
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:49.220]   Well, I've asked people about various things in the company.
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:51.260]   And the answer came back, yeah, we tried that.
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:52.100]   But--
[00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:52.900]   Sargated--
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:53.580]   Yeah.
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:54.100]   Good.
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:56.420]   Because, you know, I trust Larry and Sergey--
[00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.820]   I trust even more than Eric.
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:01.860]   I think Larry and Sergey are magical, brilliant guys.
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:02.220]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:05.180]   And I always trust a programmer and an engineer.
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:05.820]   Same as jobs.
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:05.820]   Yeah.
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.060]   So the irony here is--
[00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:07.820]   I haven't thought of this before.
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.060]   I should have put it in the book.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:09.580]   Right.
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:11.700]   That's what does-- I said in my book,
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.300]   which I don't have with me to point right now,
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.220]   but that Apple was the grand exception.
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.380]   It did everything ungoogly.
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.420]   But in the end, maybe not so much like that.
[00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:22.820]   Now that you mentioned it, Leo, that having Larry and Sergey
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:26.900]   on top and having jobs on top as visionaries all,
[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:27.940]   that's what ties them together.
[00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:31.420]   It's kind of the OTER theory meets corporate governance.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:31.780]   I mean--
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:32.580]   Meets technology.
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:36.020]   Well, the technology as a creative act.
[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.820]   By the way, they are listening, just so you know.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.620]   Matt cuts, tweets, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.780]   We think that's a useful navigational link.
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:45.340]   It's not advertising.
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:45.860]   Yeah.
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:46.380]   Right.
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.300]   I've been playing with it.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.220]   I've been playing with it.
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:49.500]   Well, but it's OK.
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.420]   And by the way, this is a fabulous book.
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:54.260]   Speaking of ads, a fabulous book
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:57.700]   that everyone should get, what would Google do?
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:00.660]   Well, you know, you've got to raise second edition, Jeff.
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:02.220]   I know.
[00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:04.700]   And the book is in its 11th printing, congratulations.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:05.180]   It's not a print.
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:05.900]   And I'm proud to say it.
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.100]   Holy cow.
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:08.660]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:09.020]   Pretty cool.
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:09.580]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:10.540]   It's really great.
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:12.700]   That's like all these figures who are buying it.
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:15.340]   How many books is 11 printings?
[00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.740]   Not as many as you think.
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.500]   There were only printing 10 at a time.
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.180]   Technology makes me able to hit the HP button
[00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:24.780]   that it goes.
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:25.660]   That's neat.
[00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:26.540]   That's so cool.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.340]   Yeah.
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:29.980]   Really, really neat.
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.540]   There's more changes to the front pages,
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.540]   as long as we're on the front page of Google,
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.820]   a Google Chrome advertisement.
[00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:38.900]   Installed Google Chrome.
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:38.900]   Yeah.
[00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:40.020]   You can click away.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:44.500]   And then you can click the X and I presume not see it again.
[00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:46.500]   They must have-- that Droid ad must have done so good
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.380]   that they thought, well, we'll do more of that.
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:50.220]   That's kind of a change.
[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:54.180]   If the Google front page has changed quite a bit,
[00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.460]   to have this there is a little odd.
[00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:57.620]   But you know, it's funny.
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:00.260]   They move pixels and we say, wow, changed a lot.
[00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:02.380]   You look at Yahoo and AOL because they're
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:05.580]   not playing front and re-mick themselves with their home page.
[00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.420]   Any other auto complete magic that we--
[00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:10.580]   I'm blown away by what's happening there.
[00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:12.260]   You know, I've just been experimenting with it.
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:14.620]   And it looks like it's really like a URL suggestion.
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:18.020]   So if you type in Tiger Woods or the space between Tiger
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.780]   and Woods, you don't get a suggestion.
[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.900]   But if you type Tiger Woods with no space,
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:24.420]   it suggests Tigerwoods.com.
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.180]   So it's fighting URLs.
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:29.540]   Yeah, this appears to act similar to the way
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:33.100]   that the Firefox awesome bar--
[00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:35.020]   By the way, if you type Tiger Woods
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:36.260]   and look at the suggestions, this
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:39.980]   is exactly what you do not want to have happen in your life.
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:41.740]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:44.340]   Car accident, infidelity, affair accident, quick golf,
[00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:49.380]   accident update, wife, car crash, break from golf house.
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:51.460]   Theo type in newspapers are--
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.220]   Oh, I love these.
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.220]   I love it when we complete sentences.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:59.260]   Newspapers are dying dead, obsolete, underlying,
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:02.100]   not dying, written at what grade level doomed,
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:05.100]   important, not dead, a waste of time.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.900]   I love that.
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:07.580]   So much fun.
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:08.260]   I don't know who spends it.
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:10.060]   Oh, don't type in the opal report is.
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:10.540]   Don't do it.
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:11.100]   Don't do it.
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:12.900]   I'm telling you, don't do it.
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:15.060]   Oh, yeah, I'm not going to do that now.
[00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:15.940]   Oh, no problem.
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:19.180]   Let's get on with the show and talk about some other things.
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:21.780]   Oh, how did that happen?
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:22.580]   There's nothing for me.
[00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.580]   I actually might as worse.
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:24.980]   It doesn't suggest a thing for me.
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:27.380]   It says, Leo LePorte is an idiot.
[00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:28.740]   Leo LePorte is a douche.
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:29.580]   And then I don't know why.
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:31.260]   Leo LePorte ISP.
[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.100]   So where do these come from?
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.860]   Are these the most searched?
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.780]   Nobody's searching for Leo LePorte as an idiot.
[00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:38.300]   Somebody's searching for Leo LePorte as an idiot.
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:40.300]   It's the what it finds, the result.
[00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:42.740]   It's those phrases in the documents that it finds
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.020]   when someone searches for what you are.
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:46.060]   Jeff, yours is pretty good.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:48.900]   If you type Jeff Jarvis, it suggests blog, Twitter.
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:49.740]   What would Google do?
[00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:56.340]   CUNY, Dell, Bio, Jazz, Dell, Hell, Wickey, and BLM.
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.340]   I don't know what BLM is.
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:58.100]   How are you getting that?
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:54:59.300]   I'm not getting anything.
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.100]   If you just type in the LePorte alone,
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:02.260]   you get all the right things.
[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:04.620]   Tech Guy, Twitter, podcast, blog, and my virus blog,
[00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:05.580]   Mike Arianton.
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:06.100]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.900]   You're tied for life.
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:09.620]   Yeah, forever will be tied together.
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:11.180]   Incomp, that's interesting, Leo.
[00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.940]   Incomp, that was a big story.
[00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:17.260]   You know, we have a show called NSFW,
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.620]   where that's a game that they play.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.780]   It's really cool to give you--
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:23.580]   they say, we're going to give you the results,
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.420]   and you try to figure out who this is.
[00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:26.300]   Wow.
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:27.060]   Isn't that great?
[00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:29.220]   And then you have to compete with somebody.
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:30.180]   You should guys should go on the show.
[00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.220]   You have to compete with somebody
[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:34.340]   and say, I could name that person in two results,
[00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:38.060]   or an N that was in four results, or one result.
[00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:39.500]   It's really a fun game.
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.900]   It's like the Google Age of Celebrity.
[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:42.900]   Yeah.
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:43.700]   [WHISTLE]
[00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:45.060]   Matt Cott's just sent us another.
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:45.900]   We got to have Mon.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:46.900]   You should call him.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:50.780]   So if you type in a flight number into the search box,
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:54.420]   it gives you the departure and arrival times.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:55.700]   Do I have to type the--
[00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:56.740]   Give the search box.
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:57.420]   Not in the results.
[00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.620]   Just type in delta 140.
[00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.180]   Yeah, that's cool.
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:04.060]   Oh, it's all you need is the search box.
[00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.700]   You don't need the web.
[00:56:05.700 --> 00:56:07.900]   Yeah, try JetBlue 182.
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.900]   This is the flight I always take to New York.
[00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:12.220]   So you will know this one by heart.
[00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:13.900]   JetBlue182.
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:14.900]   Uh-oh.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:15.740]   Oh, you're not getting it.
[00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:16.580]   That's weird.
[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:17.180]   I got it.
[00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:17.660]   I got it.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:19.060]   You did?
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.980]   JetBlue one word, space one word.
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:23.140]   Oh, there you go.
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:25.100]   Oops.
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.060]   JetBlue.
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:28.580]   We got to type it correctly, 182.
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:30.580]   Oh, yeah, there you go.
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:31.220]   That's great.
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:35.180]   Now, but that's pointing to a non-Google site, flight stats.com.
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:38.660]   And then if I hit it, I'm lucky I go to flightawear.com.
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:39.860]   Mysterious Google.
[00:56:39.860 --> 00:56:41.300]   It is so mysterious.
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:42.180]   It's like a woman.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:44.660]   I'll never figure it out.
[00:56:44.660 --> 00:56:45.660]   OK.
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.860]   OK.
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:50.820]   I'm not making any comments on that one.
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:53.780]   No, sir.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:58.220]   According to Google Maps, the Googleplex is for sale.
[00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:00.260]   That one came from an eight-year-old blogger.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:01.380]   Let's give him a prop.
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:02.940]   Credit to Jake Smith.
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:04.180]   Wow.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:04.620]   It's great.
[00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:05.340]   It's great blogger.
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:05.540]   Sorry.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:05.900]   It's great.
[00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:07.940]   It's great blogger.
[00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:10.820]   He says, do you have the money to buy the Googleplex?
[00:57:10.820 --> 00:57:13.140]   I wish I did because this place is truly amazing.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:14.820]   Obviously, this is a joke.
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:17.380]   He went on Google Maps to the Googleplex
[00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:22.580]   and for sale for a mere $100 billion.
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:24.060]   $100 billion?
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:26.460]   $7 billion.
[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:27.340]   That's so--
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.780]   Do you think kids-- this must be an activity these days.
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:34.100]   Kids go and search for stuff and see what they can find.
[00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:35.340]   Somebody's doing that.
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:36.860]   Somebody's doing that.
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:37.220]   All right.
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.100]   So we've got a Google phone.
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:39.540]   What else?
[00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:41.140]   What else is new?
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:44.060]   What other new Google products came out this week?
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.340]   Anything else we want to talk about?
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:47.820]   You got some Chrome extensions.
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:49.220]   That was last week, wasn't it?
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:50.980]   Well, there's Speed Tracer.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:51.980]   That's new.
[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:52.980]   Yeah, Speed Tracer is new.
[00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:54.060]   That's a Chrome extension.
[00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:57.100]   They opened up the Chrome extensions gallery this week
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:00.140]   with the launch of Chrome for Linux and Mac.
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:03.100]   But sadly, the extensions don't work for Mac version.
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:04.780]   They only work for Windows and Linux.
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:06.340]   Not that's a bummer.
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:10.700]   But Speed Tracer is really something for web developers.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:12.260]   It's really neat.
[00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:14.660]   It lets you monitor the speed of your site as it loads.
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:17.100]   And it creates all these very cool dynamic graphs
[00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:20.740]   and shows you the Facebook JavaScript is taking too long
[00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:21.420]   or whatever.
[00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:23.420]   It shows you where you're--
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:25.020]   it's a sluggishness graph.
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:29.500]   It's similar to why slow for Firefox.
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:30.980]   Which does work for me now, actually.
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:32.260]   More, more new things.
[00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:35.020]   We have the fact that Google search results now include
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:37.980]   live results, though I can't get it to work from Twitter
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:39.260]   or Facebook at all.
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:40.940]   Yeah, we talked about that a little bit last week.
[00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:41.460]   Yes.
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:42.660]   Yeah, I can't get to work.
[00:58:42.660 --> 00:58:43.140]   That's right.
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:43.340]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.020]   Real time.
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:46.020]   Yeah, real time stuff.
[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:49.740]   Google Apps has added some collaborative features, which
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:51.780]   kind of brings it closer to Wave.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.660]   Including Google Groups, which is going to be my tool.
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:55.060]   But we can do it out.
[00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.700]   No, I don't mind.
[00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:58.540]   I like Google Groups.
[00:58:58.540 --> 00:59:01.020]   And I kind of felt the feeling it was falling off
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.500]   the face of the Earth.
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.780]   So I'm glad that they put it in apps.
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:07.700]   I think that'll keep it alive.
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:10.460]   Why did we think it was just seemed like it was more abundant.
[00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.260]   And Yahoo Groups kind of faded away.
[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:14.300]   And I use groups all the time.
[00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:18.060]   My poker group has a group.
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:20.100]   I just use this all the time.
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.020]   And it's so useful.
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:22.620]   Well, they've even redesigned it a little bit.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:25.460]   It looks a little slicker and nicer.
[00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:28.460]   Yeah, Google Groups has a serious spam problem, honestly.
[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:29.860]   I run all my software projects.
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.380]   I have a mailing list on Google Groups.
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:33.060]   And yeah, and I have to keep them--
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.380]   I have to have them moderated.
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:35.740]   I have to moderate new posts to it,
[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:37.740]   because otherwise it'll just get killed at spam.
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:40.060]   And I think I complained about it one week to Matt,
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:41.220]   actually, on air.
[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.940]   I said, hey, when's Google Groups going to work on the spam
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:44.460]   a little bit?
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:46.780]   And so I was really happy to hear that it's
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:48.980]   integrated into Google Apps, because it felt like a renewed
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:50.660]   commitment to the product.
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:54.980]   And also this week, Google Wave kind of came out of the closet
[00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:57.420]   about their Google Groups integration, which a lot of users
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.500]   had kind of figured out that you can make
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.820]   away participants using Google Groups.
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.100]   But Google kind of came out and said, yes, you can do it this way.
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:06.540]   It's really tricky still.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.260]   We're working on a way to make it easier.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.900]   So it looks like Google Groups is here to stay.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.620]   And I hope to see it kind of grow up mature and maybe get
[01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.540]   a little better.
[01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:15.820]   I think you're right, too.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.100]   It survives if it becomes part of something like Wave.
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:18.620]   Yes.
[01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:19.140]   Yes.
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.780]   It's a tool to that end.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:22.580]   Yeah, it becomes important.
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:24.900]   The other important thing this week, in my end of the world,
[01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.220]   is living stories.
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:27.580]   OK.
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:29.260]   What's that?
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:31.540]   Well, Google did in partnership with the New York Times
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:32.220]   and The Washington Post.
[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.900]   And it's basically the topic page
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.740]   graduated to what it should be, which
[01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:39.540]   is that an article is surrounded by context.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:42.620]   And full disclosure, "Daylife," where my partner is working
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:45.100]   on something similar and has parts of this out now
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:49.140]   with what they call smart topics and smart sections.
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:52.100]   Living stories, basically, the problem with a New York Times
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:53.420]   topic page is that--
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.260]   Right.
[01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:56.620]   --it's an attempt to get SEO.
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:59.340]   But it was a cynical attempt to just list their stuff.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.140]   Whereas Google's saying, immersive Myers
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:04.340]   been telling news organizations for a year and a half now.
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.020]   Don't just make the article what you do,
[01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:10.060]   make it a page that's going to gather momentum
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.140]   and gather traffic and gather Google juice
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:13.580]   if you have the good reporting.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.580]   And to do that, you've got to give more than just an article
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.300]   on the page.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:19.420]   You have to give the context and the links and the timeline
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:21.300]   and the quotes and all this other stuff.
[01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:22.100]   I love this.
[01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:23.340]   So you'll go there.
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:25.620]   If you get-- it's at livingstories.googlelabs.com.
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.700]   You'll see some of the big news stories,
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:30.420]   like Washington tackles health care reform.
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:33.100]   They link to The Washington Post for that.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:35.860]   But then underneath it, others--
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.420]   Now, these aren't all from The Washington Post, or are they?
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:40.100]   No.
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.180]   They should be from other sources as well.
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:42.420]   Right.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.740]   So what this is, is this is a format that--
[01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:47.740]   Oh, so then this takes me to a page.
[01:01:47.740 --> 01:01:50.140]   --to give Washington Post and other news organizations.
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.460]   Basically, they're saying, you fools.
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:53.740]   You don't know how the internet works.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:57.340]   You keep writing articles, which are the artifact of print.
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:00.060]   Here's what a news page should look like.
[01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:01.180]   OK, we'll give you two.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:02.180]   This is great.
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:05.460]   So is this in conjunction with, or is this--
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.100]   they're just doing it?
[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.780]   Google's just doing it with Washington Post and New York
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.980]   Times as a demonstration.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:14.460]   So the times in the post are cooperating.
[01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:14.980]   Right.
[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:15.980]   OK.
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:17.420]   Well, that's really neat.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:18.300]   I really like that.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:21.340]   That's a much better way to do news.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:27.340]   And you've got some flash in here, interactive stuff.
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:28.860]   And I mean, just really, this is neat.
[01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:30.700]   There's nothing surprising about this.
[01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.900]   Daylight has been doing this not to plug them for some time.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:37.340]   But the newspapers couldn't get out of their own mindset
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.420]   of what they produced.
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.300]   We're just putting the page printed page on the web,
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:40.740]   of course.
[01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.180]   That's the-- yeah.
[01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.020]   Really neat.
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:44.700]   That's how I like that.
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.540]   And it comes out of time, too, when Google's trying to make
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:50.100]   buddy buddy with news organizations.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.300]   And so one could say that it's just an effort to do that.
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:56.100]   But I think it is, in fact, a helpful effort to give them
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.300]   to see the web in a new way.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:02.220]   So Eric Schmidt joined Twitter with the ridiculous
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:05.420]   "Eshmit Zero" handle.
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.220]   I don't know what he was thinking.
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.100]   But he's changed.
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:13.740]   Well, I think Twitter said, can we give you a better name?
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:16.020]   I think Aneil was one of the people that was like, hey,
[01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:18.580]   someone-- no one told Eric that Eric Schmidt that he didn't
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:20.860]   have to use his AOL name and screen name on Twitter.
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:23.220]   Exactly.
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.500]   So now he has Eric Schmidt.
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.060]   And yes, Twitter has verified the account.
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:29.820]   And let me just see how many Mr. Schmidt now has.
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:30.820]   Four.
[01:03:30.820 --> 01:03:32.300]   16,000 followers.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.620]   It is four tweets.
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.500]   And four total tweets.
[01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:37.620]   And he doesn't follow me.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.660]   What the heck?
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.260]   Unhirt.
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.020]   Eric, Eric, how could you?
[01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.780]   You know, this is the guy who wrote the fabulous book.
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:46.460]   What would Google do?
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:46.980]   And if you--
[01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:48.060]   Was he wearing in the picture?
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.700]   It looks like he's wearing a bulletproof vest.
[01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:50.620]   He does.
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:51.140]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.300]   Or a bib.
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:52.980]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:53.340]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:54.820]   Zoom in on that.
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:56.620]   It won't open the picture up for me.
[01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:59.020]   Eric, what the heck?
[01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.340]   Why would-- OK, this is--
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:03.060]   I mean, who did this?
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.300]   His kids did this.
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.540]   Does he have kids?
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:08.260]   He must have a 15-year-old who said, oh, dad,
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:11.420]   we'll make you a Twitter account, Eric Schmidt Zero.
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.340]   And then-- and dad, you got to have a picture.
[01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.220]   What about this one in the bulletproof vest?
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.660]   That is bizarre.
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:23.900]   So now he's Eric Schmidt officially.
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.900]   I don't know what happened to Eric Schmidt Zero.
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:27.740]   And if you ever had any doubt, he's
[01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.780]   a man in the bulletproof vest.
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:33.380]   Or overalls.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:33.740]   I don't know.
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:35.060]   It looks like Velcro on the front.
[01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.500]   I don't know what that one is.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.780]   Why would anybody choose that?
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:42.100]   What is that saying?
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:42.740]   I don't know.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:45.020]   That's very strange.
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.700]   What is that-- OK, chatroom, what is that thing?
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.140]   Oh, this is when he was in Iraq.
[01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:51.740]   It is a bulletproof vest.
[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:52.460]   It is a bullet.
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:53.420]   This was when he was in Iraq.
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.780]   I think it's a bit of a rise sense of humor.
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:55.780]   Yeah.
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:57.220]   You remember they went to Iraq.
[01:04:57.220 --> 01:04:57.580]   That's right.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:58.080]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.620]   When they announced the library.
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:01.340]   That's what that is.
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:01.820]   Thank you.
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:04.420]   Again, you see my brains are better than Google Gosses?
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:06.580]   It's a billion brains and a billion computers.
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:07.180]   Like what it does.
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:09.700]   Unbelievables, like a million monkeys.
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.020]   Google, will they buy Twitter?
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:13.260]   Don't call your listeners monkeys.
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.500]   In aggregate.
[01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:15.380]   Only in aggregate.
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:16.740]   No individual is a monkey.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:19.700]   Just they're aggregated into monkeys.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:22.300]   Google to buy Twitter rumor resurfaces.
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:23.140]   No, I don't know.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:27.100]   Apparently, Jack Dorsey was at a Leweb at a panel
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:32.700]   called European gang live and asked about the purchase
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.100]   of Twitter by Google.
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:36.980]   He responded, there have been no announcements.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:37.660]   Oh, come on.
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:41.140]   This is criminal analogy again.
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:45.100]   But it's kind of interesting that he didn't say no.
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.180]   I don't know.
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.140]   Well, the other interesting story that came out this week,
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:51.180]   too, in the Craigslist versus eBay fight,
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.340]   is it turns out that Google was also
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:57.860]   bidding to buy that 28% Craigslist that was available.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:59.140]   Oh, interesting.
[01:05:59.140 --> 01:05:59.660]   And then--
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:00.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:01.220]   So who did get it?
[01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:02.580]   How would it be different if they had?
[01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:03.900]   Did eBay get it?
[01:06:03.900 --> 01:06:04.620]   eBay got it.
[01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:08.100]   And now eBay and Craigslist are locked in a Japanese monster
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:09.900]   movie legal fight.
[01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.300]   Oh, it's a nightmare.
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.420]   Because Craigslist, I understand it here.
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:15.100]   And I'm not sure exactly what it is.
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:18.060]   That the chat room will correct me.
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:21.620]   But I think that Craigslist accused eBay
[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:23.780]   of using its position and intelligence
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:27.300]   to be able to create a competitor to Craigslist.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:33.180]   eBay accuses Craigslist of changing its rules to dilute eBay.
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:35.060]   And so it's not a friendly combination.
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:37.980]   All right.
[01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:39.420]   We're going to-- I think we've--
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:41.020]   there's been so much to talk about.
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:42.420]   And I'm sure that with your stuff we've missed.
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:43.660]   But I think we have to move along.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:44.980]   Otherwise, Jeff's going to miss his pizza.
[01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:46.340]   And we hate for that to happen.
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:49.420]   I'm down at mom and dad's in Florida tonight.
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.820]   No pizza?
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:51.900]   You see me behind me.
[01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:52.980]   And no pizza?
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.540]   No, we're having something off the grill.
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.940]   But Jake is down here as well.
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:58.020]   Oh, have fun.
[01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:06:59.300]   That's great.
[01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:01.220]   Maybe-- maybe Conkfrita.
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:02.620]   Sun City Center is an amazing place.
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:06.780]   You have to be 55 years old to live here legally.
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:07.460]   The whole town.
[01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:09.020]   It's not just a complex.
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:10.500]   It's a town.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:13.100]   But people under 55 can visit.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:13.780]   You can visit.
[01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:14.820]   And you can work here.
[01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:17.860]   But you can't live here.
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.140]   That is wild.
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:19.660]   That is really--
[01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:20.780]   You can twilight zone episode.
[01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:21.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:22.420]   No kidding.
[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:23.100]   And is it--
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.260]   I hate my future legal--
[01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:24.820]   Yeah.
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:25.700]   Is it a nice place?
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:27.420]   I mean, you like it?
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:27.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:28.700]   It's a nice place.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:29.700]   All right.
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.140]   Let us get--
[01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:31.980]   yeah, that's the problem.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.460]   I got to take up golf before I go down there somewhere
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:35.700]   like that.
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:38.180]   Let us get our tip tool and number of the week starting
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:41.300]   with Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.580]   You have many choices, Gina.
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:43.300]   I do.
[01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.100]   There are many choices.
[01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:46.300]   And actually, this one is kind of a tool.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.660]   Last week, we talked about how Google released
[01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:52.220]   Google Public DNS, which are public DNS servers that they
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:55.340]   say are faster, maybe than your service providers.
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.060]   But if you want to know whether or not
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:59.900]   Google Public DNS or Open DNS or your other choices are
[01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:03.940]   faster, there's a free tool called Namebench, which you can
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.180]   download for Mac, Windows, or Linux.
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.180]   And basically, it benchmarks your DNS server.
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.540]   So it takes Open DNS.
[01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:10.940]   It takes Google Public DNS.
[01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:13.500]   And it takes your service providers DNS.
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.940]   And it just pits them against one another.
[01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.580]   And a DNS server take down and creates these charts and tells
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:20.340]   you which one is your fastest and best choice based on your
[01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:23.140]   browser history or the Alexa top 100.
[01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:24.140]   It takes a little time to run.
[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:24.900]   It takes a few minutes.
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:27.700]   You want to start Namebench and go make yourself a sandwich.
[01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:31.260]   But in the end, you'll see what your best choice is.
[01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:34.140]   My friend Steve Gibson, who does our Security Now podcast,
[01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:37.820]   has a very similar free product that you can run also.
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:40.060]   That gives you a lot of information.
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:42.100]   In addition, it will put Google on there.
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:45.060]   And I ran it on my system.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:47.260]   And Google's DNS was not that fast.
[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:48.500]   I use Open DNS.
[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:52.420]   And that was by far faster than Google's DNS.
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.660]   So it is worth running just to see what results you're
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:58.500]   getting, because as Google has said, speed is very important.
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:01.660]   But you can also get that one from a grc.com.
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:02.900]   We'll give out both of them.
[01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:07.780]   That way, you get to choose slash DNS slash benchmark.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:11.340]   And it runs also a very thorough benchmark.
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:14.340]   It's small because Steve writes an assembler.
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:14.820]   Nice.
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:15.620]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:19.700]   It's 170K or something like that.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.860]   It gives you really interesting results.
[01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:25.660]   It also tells you, which I think is valuable,
[01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:30.340]   if this DNS provider redirects 404s to its own page.
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.260]   So a number of them do, including Open DNS.
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:36.140]   So you get a search result instead of this page not found.
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:38.260]   That may not be what you want or maybe what you want.
[01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:39.980]   But it's a good thing to know.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:42.220]   And you can add your own servers to that, too.
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.340]   Yeah, that Steve Gibson definitely looks like a good one.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.580]   In fact, I wrote about name bench.
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:49.740]   Everybody said, hey, you should look at Gibson's name benches.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:50.740]   They're both free.
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:51.620]   Yeah, they're both free.
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:53.260]   And they're both definitely, I think,
[01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:55.340]   worth looking at if you're not sure whether or not you should
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:55.860]   switch.
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:56.500]   I agree.
[01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.420]   Gina, is the time difference noticeable
[01:09:58.420 --> 01:09:59.780]   to the human eye and brain?
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:01.060]   It can be.
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:01.420]   Really?
[01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:02.420]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:06.500]   Yeah, I mean, it can be depending on your service provider.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.700]   Most people just use their ISPs.
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.820]   And there's a security issue with that, because some ISPs
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:13.340]   are not fixing the bind problem that
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:16.940]   is really nasty exploit.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:19.740]   But you'll notice, when you enter in an address
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.260]   and there's a lag between the time you enter in that address
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:24.980]   and the time the page starts loading, that's DNS.
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:25.540]   Right.
[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.060]   And I mean, I think we've all seen a lag there.
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:29.140]   I love OpenDS.
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:30.460]   I'm a big fan of OpenDS.
[01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.100]   If you see in your browser status bar,
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:35.740]   it says looking up example.com, that's the DNS call.
[01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:36.660]   That's a truly DNS call.
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:37.180]   Yeah.
[01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:38.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:41.260]   Our number of the week for Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:41.660]   All right.
[01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:48.500]   It is 1,661,463, 2,10.
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.100]   What does that mean?
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.380]   How many people live in Sun City?
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.020]   What is that?
[01:10:52.020 --> 01:10:53.500]   It's how many seconds I have left.
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:55.260]   It's how many seconds there are left in the year.
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:56.820]   If you go to Google and just say,
[01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:58.940]   I'm feeling unlucky with the blank box,
[01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:00.620]   it will come back with how many seconds
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:02.860]   there are left in the year.
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:05.780]   So right now, I'm watching yours and mine on the same screen.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.380]   And I see the lag broadcast.
[01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:08.340]   It's kind of a little--
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:10.100]   The exact lag, isn't that funny?
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.100]   It's great.
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:16.420]   So I presume that we should go there on New Year's Eve
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:20.420]   and watch it, because I imagine something wonderful will happen.
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:21.260]   Ooh, a patch.
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:22.660]   The whole page looks flowed and just become
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:24.780]   part of our browser and that's it.
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.860]   Google goggles everywhere.
[01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:30.460]   Something wonderful is about to happen.
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.540]   Actually, knowing Google, I just go to zero and say, OK,
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:34.180]   we're done.
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:35.620]   I got to set up some sort of screen capture,
[01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:37.660]   because I want to be a kiss and love one at midnight.
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.020]   I don't want to be looking at Google's homepage.
[01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:40.820]   But I'll still be curious about what happens.
[01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.220]   But we're going to New Year's Eve party.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:44.460]   I'm getting finding the biggest screen in that house.
[01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.580]   And I'm putting Google up on there, and I'm leaving it there.
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:47.220]   I mean, why not?
[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.140]   You got the countdown.
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:50.900]   That's the perfect thing to do.
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.820]   Back in the day when webcams were hot,
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:56.140]   I got a webcam at four times square in the county
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.660]   and asked Billy when I worked with them,
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:59.980]   pointed at the Times Square thing.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:02.100]   And I remember Jake and I sitting at home
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.700]   doing screen captures of the web photos
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.580]   as it counted down and putting them up on the web
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:07.220]   on a web page.
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:09.460]   It was so cool, man.
[01:12:09.460 --> 01:12:11.060]   We've come a long way.
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.740]   Isn't that father's son bonding?
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:13.660]   It's so sweet.
[01:12:13.660 --> 01:12:14.180]   So sweet.
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:15.940]   Has Jake found out about CMU yet?
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:16.700]   No, no, no, no.
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:17.820]   I don't know what's going to happen there.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:23.300]   But my daughter finds out Monday.
[01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:24.660]   Oh, it's a nerve-wracking time.
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.740]   Anxious weekend.
[01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:29.180]   We have somebody in the chat room who has been bugging me,
[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:32.020]   sending me emails saying, you never mentioned this tool.
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.940]   This is my favorite tool on Google.
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:35.180]   Everybody should know about this tool.
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:37.540]   It's not a new tool, but it is a great tool.
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:40.180]   If you've used SketchUp, which is absolutely free,
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:43.380]   Google has created a building maker
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:46.020]   that is kind of based on SketchUp that allows you
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:50.860]   to create 3D buildings that you can then embed in Google Earth.
[01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:54.580]   And it's really cool when people have done this
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:56.860]   to go to these locations in Google Earth.
[01:12:56.860 --> 01:12:58.620]   And instead of getting, you know,
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:00.500]   how Google Earth kind of gives you pictures,
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.460]   they're 2D, you can zoom and stuff.
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:03.420]   But it's still kind of 2D.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:06.820]   These buildings are actually like physical buildings.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:09.460]   It's really, really neat and it's free
[01:13:09.460 --> 01:13:10.940]   and it's fun to play with.
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:13.820]   It's called Google Building Maker.
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:17.740]   And probably easiest just to Google Building Maker
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:21.540]   because it's a long URL to find it.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.380]   It's part of SketchUp.
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:23.820]   And you of course have to have SketchUp to do that,
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:24.740]   but that's absolutely free.
[01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:27.660]   But many, many cities, it's really fun to browse around
[01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.300]   and Google Earth and see these buildings.
[01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:32.420]   This is how it's being done with Google Building Maker.
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:34.900]   And I would like to give credit to that person,
[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:38.620]   but I don't know what his name,
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:41.100]   but he was the guy who really wanted me to mention this.
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:42.580]   Google.com/buildingmaker.
[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:45.340]   Okay, maybe it's not such a bad URL.
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:46.900]   Was it MXX?
[01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:51.180]   Okay, thank you MXX for the tool of the week.
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:53.740]   Also want to remind folks, I know many of you know
[01:13:53.740 --> 01:13:55.900]   that I wear Scott Evest clothing everywhere.
[01:13:55.900 --> 01:14:00.300]   That's the wonderful, many, many pocket jackets and pants
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.620]   and shirts.
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:04.880]   I love Scott Evest and we want to give you a little gift
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.900]   they have Scott Evest merchandise with the Twit logo,
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:10.200]   but you can also get it without the Twit logo for 20% off.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:14.340]   If you go to scottevest.com/twit2009.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:17.100]   It's not really an ad, we just like to do this every year.
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:17.940]   - How do you spell that way out?
[01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:19.060]   - Our gift to use.
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:23.860]   S-C-O-T-T-E-V-E-S-T, Scott Evest.
[01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:25.580]   This is great geek clothing and I think,
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:28.400]   I know Jake would love some Scott Evest stuff.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.480]   Great, great because you can put all your,
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:33.920]   if you travel a lot, you put all your stuff in your pockets
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.300]   and you walk onto the plane, it's just great.
[01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:38.060]   I love Scott Evest stuff.
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:42.700]   So scottevest.com/twit2009.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:44.580]   We've got the beautiful Twit Army jacket
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:47.340]   which is fleece available.
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:50.140]   And as I said, 20% off all products,
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:52.080]   whether they're Twit or not, if you use the coupon code
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:55.040]   Twit2009, upper case, lower case, doesn't matter.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:59.460]   Twit2009 on all of the products from Scott Evest.
[01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:02.580]   We're big fans of theirs and Scott's a great guy.
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:06.240]   And frankly, I do this because I don't have to ever buy clothing.
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:11.240]   He just sends me clothing with pockets, lots of pockets.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:14.200]   - I don't mean to compete with Scott Evest,
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:16.080]   but I just gotta mention this, it's funny.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:18.080]   Fred Wilson, the blogging venture capitalist
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:20.880]   at ABC.com got off a flight one day, not too long ago,
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:23.600]   two weeks ago and had to blog the fact
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:28.000]   that somebody had a hoodie that has a built-in neck pillow.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.360]   - Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.200]   - Isn't that great?
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:31.040]   You're blow up your neck pillow
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.120]   and you just put the hoodie over
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.380]   and they think you're a comfortable terrorist.
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:37.580]   - That's a good idea 'til you're on a bus or something.
[01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:40.380]   You're driving around with a neck pillow.
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:44.460]   It's amazing, what you can find in clothing these days.
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:46.460]   Gina Tripani is the best.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:48.580]   We just adore her and she is, of course,
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:50.940]   at smarterware.org in her book.
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:53.380]   The Complete Guide to Google is available at Complete Wave Guide.
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:55.020]   I'm sorry, The Complete Guide to Google Wave
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.380]   is available at completewaveguide.com.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:58.820]   (laughing)
[01:15:58.820 --> 01:15:59.660]   - We got it. - We got it.
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:01.580]   - We got it before.
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.100]   - It's one of these days.
[01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.500]   But I know Jeff's book, see, it's easy.
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.340]   - Ah!
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:08.580]   - What would Google do?
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.900]   Jeff Jarvis is, of course, the great journalist
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.620]   at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:14.300]   The author of What Would Google Do.
[01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:15.480]   Always fun, you guys.
[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.780]   We really love doing this show.
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:18.340]   It's one of our most successful shows.
[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:22.420]   We are now happy to say it is all on video available to you.
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:24.640]   If you go to twit.tv, you can download it.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.340]   We are working on the iTunes feeds
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:29.220]   as we speak, those will be out soon.
[01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:33.980]   All of our top five shows now are available on video
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:35.900]   and of course on the Roku box and everywhere else.
[01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:38.860]   But if you wanna see Twig video, in fact,
[01:16:38.860 --> 01:16:41.420]   I think, let me just see if we have last week's show already.
[01:16:41.420 --> 01:16:44.420]   You go to twit.tv.
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:49.140]   And you'll see now you can listen to the audio,
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:51.980]   but you can also play the video for many of our shows.
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.500]   - Hey, Leo. - Yeah.
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.300]   - Will I be able to embed those things
[01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:56.700]   on my vlog someday?
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:58.420]   - That's the next thing that we really want you
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:00.420]   to be able to do and I think the key there
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:03.180]   is getting some help from Google.
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:04.740]   Anybody know anybody at Google?
[01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:09.220]   Because what I'm trying to get is
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:12.740]   a Google account that we could upload full length shows to.
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:14.060]   You know, they don't normally that you do.
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:15.420]   - A YouTube. - A YouTube.
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:16.740]   - Oh.
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:18.820]   - And then, could we like to do that?
[01:17:18.820 --> 01:17:20.060]   We have no reason not to do that.
[01:17:20.060 --> 01:17:21.220]   We put all our shows on YouTube
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.940]   and then you can embed away.
[01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:24.460]   - I'll email somebody now,
[01:17:24.460 --> 01:17:26.100]   but I'm sure Matt Cutz has already done some.
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.300]   - Matt, if you're listening, I just--
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:29.700]   - Matt. - I have a producers account,
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.260]   we have a directors account, we have all the different,
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:34.500]   but you have to get some sort of dispensation
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:36.180]   from Larry and Sergey or something
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.300]   before you can upload full length.
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:38.860]   I think they're worried I'm gonna upload,
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:40.540]   you know, full length versions of Happy Days,
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:41.700]   but I'm not, I really am.
[01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:42.540]   I'm not.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:43.740]   I mean, I'm really not.
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.380]   I really am not gonna do that.
[01:17:45.380 --> 01:17:47.340]   It'll just be Twitch shows.
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:48.580]   Everybody, thank you for being here.
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:51.700]   We will see you next week on This Week in Google.
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:52.540]   - Bye-bye.
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:55.120]   (upbeat music)
[01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:57.700]   (upbeat music)
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:00.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:18:02.860 --> 01:18:05.320]   (ghast brie)
