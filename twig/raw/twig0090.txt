[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.640]   is moving into the internet.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.920]   If that makes any sense.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.520]   Joining us, as always, we're glad to have Gina Trapani

[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.840]   How you doing, Gina?
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.280]   Great.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.040]   How you doing, Tom?
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.040]   I am doing well.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.880]   Oh, I forgot to mention.
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.560]   I am Tom Merritt, looking for Leola Bort.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.440]   Who's out at NAB doing our great live coverage out there.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.680]   If you want to check out Twitch specials or watch
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.840]   a live, good stuff coming out of the National Association
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.680]   of Broadcasters, really interesting coverage
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.120]   of the gadgets and things that'll
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.000]   be bringing you media in the future.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.720]   And speaking of media, the media may have in himself, Jeff
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.280]   JarvisBuzzmachine.com.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.400]   How you doing, Jeff?
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.000]   All right.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.800]   All right.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.240]   Just all right.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.520]   Yeah, I'm doing great.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.640]   See, I tweaked you into lying.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.080]   You're giving me a more honest answer to begin with.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.200]   Good to have you along as well.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.040]   And joining us as a guest this week, Mr. Joel Johnson,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.680]   editorial director at kataku.com.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.600]   You've had that job for about a month now,
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.680]   coming over from Gizmodo.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.280]   How's it going?
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.120]   Yeah, whole month.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.120]   It's going.
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.600]   I'm still completely overwhelmed.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.240]   But I'm doing OK.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.280]   Between taking a new job and moving back
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.320]   to New York, it's been a busy month.
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.240]   Yeah, I bet.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.440]   Well, that makes me extra appreciative.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.960]   You had the time to join us today.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.960]   Thanks for doing that.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.080]   Yeah, no problem.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.200]   All right.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.560]   One more day left of Twitch at NAB, like I mentioned.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.360]   If you want to see our live coverage, live.twit.tv.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.320]   We finished that up today and tomorrow.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.480]   We'll have a little coverage tomorrow.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.520]   Leo's coming back today.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.520]   So he'll be back for security now and shows like that.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.000]   We're covering a party tonight.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.800]   The Heil party, Bob Heil, if you may have seen his interview
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.640]   on our triangulation show, has been in the industry
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.880]   for quite a long time.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.760]   And he brings us the mics that we use right here at Twitch.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.560]   So that should be fun to see who shows up there.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.440]   Because he's got connections to like Jimmy Hendrix
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.720]   and the Grateful Dead, all the best radio broadcasters
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.440]   in the world.
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.200]   And it should be an amazing collection of people.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.600]   So watch that at live.twit.tv.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.960]   Let's start off with some news from the world of Apple
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.040]   and Google colliding, Business Insider reporting
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.040]   that apparently, at least according to this book,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.800]   Eric Schmidt had the iPad hidden from him
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.680]   because Steve Jobs was upset about the use of multi-touch
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.400]   pinch-to-zoom specifically in Android.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.040]   That according to Steven Levy's book, "In the Plex."
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.200]   Jeff, do you think this is a real thing
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.720]   or is this just trying to sell books?
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.440]   Maybe when I'm confused, I started to read the posts on this.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.120]   And so the first Android came out without pinch-to-touch, right?
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.280]   Well, yeah, former and gadget editor, Neelai Patel,
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.440]   we're going to have him on tech news today later today,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.440]   had a posting up and said, "The first Android phone
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.560]   that G1 shipped in September 2008 without pinch-to-zoom."
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.760]   And in fact, Google didn't add it to their official Android
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.200]   release until the Nexus 1 got it as a software update
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.440]   in February, 2010.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.440]   Right.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.840]   And I don't know if that's because they felt
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.880]   that they were in some difficult position or what.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.880]   So that's why I don't know how to really judge this as a result.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.240]   Well, obviously, I mean, it does bring up
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.880]   something weird was going on because Google had pinch-to-zoom,
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.440]   obviously.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.160]   They didn't include it for a while.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.320]   They allowed the carriers to add it.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.480]   Motorola was adding it on their interface.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.680]   HTC added it on their interface.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.240]   And then eventually, February 2010, if it was a patent issue,
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.760]   they decided it wasn't a big enough patent issue
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.080]   and added it to the Nexus 1.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.880]   So Joel, do you have any insight on what's really going on here?
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.440]   Well, I mean, I think at that time,
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.360]   Google was still trying really hard not to piss Apple off too much.
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.120]   I think it hasn't really been until the last six months
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.200]   to a year that they've decided that they are full-blown competitors
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.240]   and that Apple has recognized that they're full-blown competitors
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.040]   as well.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.120]   So that was always the impression I got in the early Android days.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.040]   It was that Google kind of was pussy-footing around the whole thing.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.800]   They figured they were probably OK from a patent perspective,
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.840]   but it was worth being nice to jobs long enough
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.280]   to not have them completely go on the attack
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.160]   while they were just getting Android up and running.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.920]   So you think it was actually more of a nice situation than a dispute?
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.040]   Yeah, I mean, I don't think jobs and Schmidt were still talking--
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.000]   I mean, I presume they're still talking today,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.880]   or at least that Google and Apple are still talking.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.320]   But in the very beginning, you have to remember,
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.040]   this was still-- like, when all of the Android stuff was coming together,
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.680]   this is still-- Schmidt was on the board of Apple.
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.160]   And there was still a lot of involvement between the two companies.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.320]   And yeah, I just think there was a lot of those decisions
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.400]   that they made that were sort of token gestures
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.680]   to try to not upset Apple too much while they got Android actually
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.200]   on the market.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.520]   And now that Android's completely-- well, dominating is maybe a little strong,
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.080]   but they're doing really, really well on the phone market.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.360]   I don't think there's any reason for them to really worry about each other anymore.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.920]   And this idea of Eric Schmidt having the iPad hidden from him by Steve Jobs
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.560]   could just be good business sense of like, well, we're now competitors.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.760]   So we're not going to show you every product and development,
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.360]   even though you're still on the board and you're stepping down from the board.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.440]   And so we're not going to bring you into the circle.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.880]   That makes sense, Gina, right?
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.960]   You just rephrase that and make it sound more controversial if you want to sell books.
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:55.640]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.760]   And I'm actually-- I'm really excited.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.800]   We're going to have Stephen Lee beyond the show, I think, in a couple of weeks.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.360]   I'm not sure if it's next week or the week after.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.280]   So we'll get to talk to him a little bit about it.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.880]   Not showing Schmidt the iPad seems to make sense.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.280]   The pitch to Zoom thing is interesting.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.800]   I mean, maybe it was just like Joel said.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.200]   They didn't want to piss off Apple right away.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.240]   There was a lot more involvement.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.960]   And maybe it was like, we want to see how our whole story about using the phone with one
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.000]   hand is enough is going to go.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.840]   That's right.
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.600]   Andy Rubin made that point of why they didn't have pinched to Zoom originally.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.080]   Right, exactly, exactly.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.760]   But I think Patel's piece was like touchscreen devices.
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:33.040]   Pinched to Zoom is just as important as the screen and the batteries.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.400]   It's just part of it.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.520]   And maybe that just wasn't clear what the patent situation was back then.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.800]   But later on, they were just willing to put it out there and see what happens.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.920]   Well, yeah, I'll be interested to speak to Stephen about it a little more.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.520]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.560]   I think it'll be good to talk to Stephen and say, OK, what do you really know about this
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.280]   and how has it come about?
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:00.360]   Because obviously, it's a good story to put out there and get people interested in looking
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.280]   at the book.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:09.960]   But we may be a victim of business insider tweaking this and pulling it out a little more
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.440]   than even it is in The Plex, which is the name of the book.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.120]   Based on two years of research at the company, so he--
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.840]   Levy obviously knows what he's talking about.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.560]   Yeah, he's been a long time embedded in the company.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.280]   Yeah, you're not going to get a lot of-- a lot more insight, I think, at this point on
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.520]   that era of Google than this book.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.520]   Although I still haven't read it.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.600]   I got a copy last night, but haven't even cracked it open yet.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:40.280]   So yeah, once you actually read the book, I mean, obviously, that's going to make a difference
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.520]   in how you think this stuff plays out.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.640]   But it does-- if nothing else-- forget the actual controversy of who knew what and why
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.640]   there wasn't Pinch to Zoom in there.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:58.360]   Why hasn't Apple gone after Google for Pinch to Zoom if there is-- if they were the first
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.160]   to market with it, do they not have a strong enough patent?
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:09.040]   You know, it's-- it just always comes back to this patent story.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.640]   And it's a fairly obvious thing.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.480]   Somebody should patent that story.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.640]   And that's where we are.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.720]   I talked to a researcher working on something for us here at CUNY yesterday who told me something
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.160]   that was fascinating.
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:29.520]   He did research with a professor at Reed University on Reed College, whichever it is, on the most
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.080]   influential patents.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.880]   And by that, they just-- they analyzed the citations in the patents.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.320]   And this guy, Noah, told me that the most influential that they found was the inkjet
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.760]   printer because the placing of something physically on exactly that spot is critical
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.200]   and a lot of the development going on today like 3D printers.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:57.520]   And when you see the kind of development that goes on with patents and you take, you know,
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.920]   OK, figure it out, boys, figure it out.
[00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.120]   It's now become a standard.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.080]   Is it-- is it-- is the swipe?
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.720]   Something we wouldn't have thought through is--
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.400]   Well, we've talked about that before.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.560]   Is the patent unswiped unlock?
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.560]   Right.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.560]   Yes.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.960]   There's a blog-- what is it?
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:22.240]   It's just a list of all of the patents that Apple has put out as they kind of come through
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.560]   the patent system.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.800]   And it's always mind blowing to me to look at those because so many of those things
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:33.000]   are literally like we've done a patent on where the delete button should be in a certain
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.760]   UI.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.960]   And the patent system at this point, you know, is structured that you just throw as many
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.800]   patents up on the wall as you can possibly get to stick.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.920]   But I don't think if you look at how many are actually litigated and fought for, it's
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.480]   very-- it's very rare.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:52.400]   I mean, that's because not only do you have the chance to-- or you have to spend a lot
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.120]   of money to litigate it, you also have the opportunity to lose the patent or have the
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.400]   patent be revoked, which is risky too.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.760]   So it's a-- it's a-- it's definitely a Cold War.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.880]   There's a-- there's a bit of brinksmanship to defending your patents where, you know,
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.840]   you're sitting on a pile of patents and they're sitting on a pile of patents and you agree,
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.880]   well, we'll-- we'll pay the difference in our piles' height to settle this out of court,
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.880]   essentially.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.720]   In fact, somebody was telling me, and I wish I could remember who, that they've been in
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:30.160]   patent meetings like that where they brought in piles of documentation and measured them.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.000]   And so, okay, we've got about two inches more.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Let's-- let's negotiate a rate for that.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.360]   That is insane.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   Ugh.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.440]   Is that not the way it's supposed to work?
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.440]   I don't know.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.000]   That doesn't seem like the best way for it to work, but--
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I do everything.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.080]   Like, every legal transaction I do, I do buy weight.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:56.000]   So, like, when I pay for things, I always pay in coins because it weighs a lot more and
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.880]   it's really hard to convince people to let me do it, but I have a patent for it, so it
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.880]   works out.
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.880]   Right, right.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:03.880]   So you'll be protected.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.120]   When you talk to your lawyer, what-- what's your pound rate?
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.120]   Right.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.760]   How much-- how much do you charge per ounce?
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.760]   All right.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.560]   Well, I think this is an interesting story that people are fascinated with because Eric
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.440]   Schmidt was on the board of Apple, and then he had to leave.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.760]   And people wonder, "Well, Steve Jobs, he's a prickly guide.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:28.120]   Is he upset that Google got into the phone business and are now the direct competitors,
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.080]   not only to iPhone but also iPad, to iOS?
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.200]   Is it a friendly rivalry or not?"
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.680]   What do you guys think?
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.760]   It's really hard to read those guys.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.360]   I mean, like, Jobs in particular is-- and, you know, I don't know him at all.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.160]   I know him just as well as anybody else does, which is just through the news.
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.000]   But he strikes me-- all the anecdotes about him and if you go to the folklore and read
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.320]   even early Apple days, you know, he's definitely has a reputation for being vindictive and being
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.600]   kind of a seething sort of guy.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.800]   So I'm sure that he was incredibly pissed about Schmidt.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.040]   I mean, that's why he asked him to leave, ultimately.
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.960]   And even when Schmidt was around, he was supposedly recusing himself during discussions
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.640]   of iPhone development and things like that once Android was out and known.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:28.000]   But by the same token, you know, there was shots of Jobs and Schmidt out having coffee
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:28.960]   like a year ago.
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.680]   So, you know, I don't think it's-- I think for as much anger as there may be, it's that
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.960]   sort of business anger.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.400]   Like, they want to get back at each other and they want to be as successful as possible.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.280]   But I don't think that they're not communicating.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.080]   At least up until the point that Apple can completely replace Google and all of their
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:51.320]   product lines through search and maps and the whole Schmir, which, you know, they're
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.320]   messing around with.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.840]   But that's a big bite to chew.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.200]   You know, what I find interesting here is that I've been arguing that the next frontier
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:06.120]   of the fight in our world is between Google and Facebook over who's the best signal generator,
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:10.240]   who's going to find the most signals of what we want and who we are, what we're looking
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:15.480]   for and so on to be able to target services and content and then, of course, advertising
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.640]   to us.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:22.080]   So in that sense, Google being in mobile to me pits the most against Facebook.
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:28.120]   But Google being in phones pits them against Apple in the hardware world.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.440]   And the argument these days is that what Apple really is, is a retail company.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.640]   And they're the best damn retail company there is.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.360]   They make more per square foot in stores than most anybody out there.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.080]   And they do it in amazing ways and they involve us.
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:48.840]   And so, you know, apart from the obvious line of who has the bigger platform, Apple
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:55.200]   or Google and Android, what I have a heart to get in my head around is where is the real
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.080]   battlefield there?
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.160]   Where is the real battlefield between AOL?
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.320]   I mean, this is a part of me.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.320]   Apple and...
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.320]   There's no battle there.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.560]   It's already in slip.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.480]   Yeah, no, you're exactly right.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:13.640]   And I mean, if you look at the amount of real money that's being made, Google is still
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.880]   an advertising company and Apple is still a products company.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:25.240]   But which is why if you ever have any sort of discussion about will Android kill iPhone
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:32.960]   or will or vice versa, it's a useless discussion because they generate their money in different
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.960]   ways.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.760]   So as long as they're both relatively successful, neither one is going to win out.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.520]   And I'm actually very glad that that is the case because it means more competition and
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.520]   they push each other.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:53.080]   And hopefully both will stay afloat and in these markets because I want to see more
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.600]   platforms, I want to see Blackberry OS come back, I want to see WebOS succeed.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   I want to see people nipping at each other's heels, pushing them to be more innovative and
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.960]   coming up with new and better ways for us to benefit when we use our phones.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:06.960]   Absolutely.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:07.960]   Right.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.760]   I mean, it seems like the battle between Apple and Google is really this platform for selling
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.760]   things, right?
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.800]   Like a store, a way to sell stuff, not just products, ads.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.960]   I mean, Google does ads a lot better than Apple does, but Apple has the App Store and
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.360]   the iTunes store and Google is certainly lagging behind in the Android market.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:27.080]   But I completely agree, competition is a good thing.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.880]   I want to see more of it, more seething competition, whether it's a faux business thing or it's
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.280]   like they really hate one another.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.280]   I'll take either one.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.040]   I totally agree.
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:43.360]   When you get to the end, what you want to see are situations that are created for different
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.120]   types of people because not everybody uses their phone the same way.
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.200]   So if you've got enough competition and enough different platforms, you've got a platform
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:53.280]   that's really good for somebody who uses their phone in a casual way and just wants to do
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.720]   some social networking.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.960]   You've got a phone that's good for somebody who's very productive and uses it in a business
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.960]   way.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.480]   You've got a phone for the tweaker, the geek who wants to just mess around and see what
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.800]   he can make the phone do.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.120]   That's the ideal is when it's not about being a fanboy and saying, "My operating system
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.120]   wins.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:13.480]   It's about having different operating systems that suit different kinds of users."
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:14.480]   Yep.
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.920]   Google's got a major reorganization.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.720]   They're going to be doing what they do in a different way.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.200]   This has to do with Larry Page taking over as CEO.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.080]   His first big act is to change who's in charge of what?
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.400]   Sundar Pichai is now senior vice president of Chrome.
[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.720]   Vic Gundotra is SVP of Social.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:40.520]   Andy Rubin gets a promotion to SVP of Mobile, Salar Kamengar, SVP of YouTube and Video and
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.280]   Alan Eustace, SVP of Search.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:49.240]   I also heard that Susan Wachiki, SVP of ads, I apologize to all of them for mangling their
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.240]   names.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.520]   I'm not sure if I pronounced everything correctly.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:18:00.560]   The idea is now they have core product areas and they've got people in charge of things
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:06.320]   like Chrome, like Android or mobile, YouTube and video.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.600]   Everything comes up through those people and then those people talk to Larry Page.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.040]   It's a more centralized organization.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.400]   What's the theory behind this, Gina?
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.760]   Do you have an idea of why they would reorg this way?
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.240]   Well, I think the company line is they're trying to break down the committees that you
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.120]   have to go through and get approval from in order to launch a product and make innovation
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.880]   happen faster and easier.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:33.080]   This is a challenge in all big companies, right?
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.960]   Page just took the helm.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.480]   This is the thing that normally happens when you've got someone new in charge.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.160]   You do this shake up reorg, re-energize the company.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.440]   These are all names we all know, put them in charge of product.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:51.880]   I honestly, I don't pay too much attention to Google's executives, but Vic and Dautre
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.880]   was at IO last year.
[00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.320]   He's super charming and I thought he was a really interesting choice to be in charge
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.320]   of social.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.120]   I think he was he in charge of mobile before?
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.120]   I'm not sure.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.120]   I thought he was more focused on mobile before.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.120]   As I understand, yes.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.120]   That's a really interesting choice.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.440]   Something that I'm happy about because I really like Vic.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.520]   He won my heartic, an IO last year.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.360]   It would be interesting to see.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.880]   This just sounds like this is Larry saying, this is the way it's going to work now that
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.280]   I'm in charge and we're going to make stuff, we're going to be a little more innovative
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.040]   and get stuff out the door a little more faster and more efficiently.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:27.960]   Yeah, I think that it's interesting to me that there is someone that senior in what
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.320]   we're expected in the company in charge of social when Google basically still doesn't
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:35.000]   have a social strategy, let's be honest.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.680]   And local, I think, is very important in this whole mobile signal generation thing.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.280]   Some people are saying that Marissa Mayer got passed over for that, but I don't think
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:50.480]   so because he's not a senior VP and hasn't been and she has her areas of specialization.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.080]   I think because she's so popular, people expected to see her name amongst these other names
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.400]   they recognize like Andy Rubin and Vic Bindotra.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   Right, exactly.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:02.440]   But I think that that's, you know, she would have been jumped up a quantum leap in the organization.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:09.440]   You know, I just did a Skype talk with Siva Badefian's class at University of Virginia
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.000]   and he asked me what I would have changed in my fanboy book in the two years since it's
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   out.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.280]   And so the main thing is I don't think that I fully grappled with the notion of Google's
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:27.240]   size, its bigness and how that's affected so much about the company, including, you know,
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:33.480]   it's the people who go after it in Europe and so on, including the difficulty of continuing
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:38.600]   to grow at a rapid pace when you are so big.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.680]   The culture around it of what people think of when you're that big, but also more important
[00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:43.680]   than anything else.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.320]   And Eric Schmidt always said this, it's the biggest challenge within Google.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.720]   And Gina's right, things had to go through committees and then the committee on top and
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.720]   the triumvirate.
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:57.640]   Yet ironically, you'd think that would have caused great integration and right-hand would
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.960]   have known what left-hand is doing, but that's not the case.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.400]   We have Android and Chrome OS and things like that.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.360]   And given that Larry's new to the job, I think it's very smart to surround himself
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.360]   with a very strong structure because the triumvirate was a strong structure and now
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.160]   he needs that structure.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.800]   So this is, you know, by all appearances, good management.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.920]   I, you know, be curious whether he has consultants now too or, you know, as a McKinsey hanging
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.360]   around, God help us.
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:29.280]   But I think we'll know a lot more when we start seeing new products come out of the
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.280]   company.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.280]   Yes.
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.680]   I mean, that's been, that's Microsoft has gone through this.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.120]   Well, I mean, they're still kind of going through it.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.120]   Sony went through this for several years and is still going through it.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.040]   And it seems like Google just in the last maybe three or four years started to hit that,
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:50.600]   that morass of being like too big and, and, and doing a lot of these half-baked projects.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.400]   That was always my biggest fear with Android.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.600]   And I think they've, you know, they fixed it largely.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.120]   But my biggest fear with Android coming out of the gate was it was half-baked.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.120]   It wasn't ready.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.000]   It wasn't as polished as I felt like it should have been.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.040]   And if Google would have managed Android like they've managed most of their other projects
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:11.680]   over the last three or four years, it would probably be killed already.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:18.760]   So I think as you see a faster rate of innovation within Google, but also wedded to a larger,
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.840]   longer product plan.
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:25.240]   I'm thinking of things like Google TV, which is just completely stillborn, which is, but
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   is a good idea.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.920]   And, and, and if they commit to it, could really do something with it.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.440]   I think over the next, you know, 12 months or so, if we start seeing a bunch of products
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.480]   come out and they have a weight to them and they feel like there's something that Google's
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.000]   really behind and will continue to be behind and iterate on, then I think it'll be a sign
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.560]   that this reorg, you know, makes sense.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.040]   Otherwise it's just it's, uh, what do you call shifting the deck chairs when the ship
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.200]   isn't going down, just shifting the deck chairs?
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.960]   It's called rearranging the deck chairs when the Titanic is going down.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:55.960]   Right.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.320]   No, no, if there's a shorter way to say it, but it's an.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.160]   But I think I think Joel said the Titanic ain't going down here.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.120]   It's just there, they're, they're redecorating the deck.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.120]   Right.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:10.680]   They're re shifting the deck chairs on the X crews that's going through the Bahamas,
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.160]   which well, let me, let me ask you this.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:17.840]   What do you think that, um, that they should kill?
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.200]   What areas should they be in?
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.480]   Part of what happened was with 20% and all that, they got into all kinds of new areas
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:28.720]   and you know, they moved stuff around a bit, but are there things that Google was in that
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.040]   don't make sense for them to be in?
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.640]   I mean, I always, and I don't think I'm not, I'm not good at business.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.880]   That's why I, you know, work for other people.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:46.760]   But I always like Google the most when they are dabbling in areas where you wouldn't expect
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.000]   them to be.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.080]   You know, I like Google being the company that's full of super geeky, super scientist
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:24:00.080]   and engineers who have the ability to experiment as long as they can eventually tie it back
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.880]   into the greater Google advertising system.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:10.640]   So all the automated car stuff, which is something that, I mean, that was, of all the projects
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.160]   last year that I think that just came out of nowhere and then I looked at it and was
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.080]   just like, oh, they, they did it.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.640]   This thing that I was supposed to take another two or three decades, Google's looks like
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.280]   they pretty much got it cracked.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.640]   And so those kind of things I love to see Google do because they have the engineering
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:34.000]   acumen to go out there and take really big, really big leaps and try to come up with
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.080]   ideas that are completely out of left field for, for a, you know, essentially a services
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.160]   company.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:45.760]   But they have to, again, when they choose to do those things, they have to continue to
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.000]   move forward with them.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.880]   And I think so that the outline stuff, the investment and energy and all of that stuff
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.880]   is really good.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.040]   And I hope they continue to do that.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:59.920]   But internally they have a pretty, like, you know, I can't say there's been a lot of effort
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.880]   in their core products outside of search.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.240]   Search has, has continued to evolve in a pretty logical way.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.200]   But you know, I use Gmail and G-Dox and all that stuff every day.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:15.520]   And there's nothing that's really blown my mind about or impacted my life in the way
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.600]   that Gmail did when it first came out.
[00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:23.000]   You know, there hasn't been anything iteratively within the product that's been amazing in
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   years.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.680]   So I hope that they kind of go back to some of those old hits and revitalize those too.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.680]   Hmm.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.440]   You know, I have to disagree with you on that.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.220]   You know, I follow Gmail and Dox development because this is kind of, this is kind of my
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.240]   thing is just follow along with all the little features.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.160]   And I feel like they're constantly adding new little features or labs features.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:48.160]   And I mean, Google Docs just recently, you can upload files, you can share videos within
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.160]   Dox.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.880]   Gmail just actually, this is my tip this week.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.120]   They launch a bunch of little fixes.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.120]   I mean, they're all super minor.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.000]   I mean, none of them are like mind blowing like you've got 10 terabytes of storage forever,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.560]   which is kind of what it felt like when it first, you know, when Gmail first launched.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.440]   But I feel like the product's pretty active.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:09.480]   I completely cop to the fact that I'm asking for something that is nebulous.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.680]   Like I'm saying, I want to be loud and I don't know what that would be.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.200]   You know, and that's completely unfair.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.760]   And I mean, I acknowledge that.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:21.920]   But I'm just saying that there to me and Gmail is the one that I mean, I use it all the time
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.320]   and I switch off to hosted mail and I do all these other things that I always end up coming
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.400]   back to Gmail.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.560]   But I still remember vividly the difference between Gmail and all the competitors and
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:36.240]   how it actually made the amount of time I spent in my life and email so much better
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.480]   when it launched.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:41.480]   I'm just saying, I feel like nothing, maybe the sum total of all the improvements over
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:47.080]   the last however long it's been six years, seven years have gotten, you know, have cumulatively
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.320]   been that transformative.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:54.400]   But I still feel like I was hoping there's a lot more like human intelligence stuff that
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:59.920]   I feel like Google could be doing maybe better than any other company or artificial intelligence
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:06.000]   I guess is like the things that they do with priority inbox for instance.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.280]   I feel like there's all of this social stuff that Facebook is getting ready to smash in
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:17.840]   Google's like just completely steal the ball away from Google where I don't want to use
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.840]   Facebook mail.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.320]   That's as my mail that seems really weird to me.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:24.280]   I guess I'm just old enough that the idea that I would communicate with everybody on
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.960]   Facebook is strange.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.160]   But there are a lot of really smart things that Facebook does about presenting and lifting
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.680]   information that I find pretty accurate that I'm still amazed that Google for as much information
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:42.680]   as they have about me aren't exposing in my daily life or if they are exposing it, it's
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:48.280]   they're hiding it so much in the background of algorithm that it's hard for me to recognize
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.120]   what a good job they're doing.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.760]   I think all of these companies are struggling with an old, old problem which is when you
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:01.760]   begin, you know, when you're Sergei and Larry in 1999, putting your algorithm out there
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:07.720]   that's like this wows people look how fast Google is or when you're when you're Ev and
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:12.360]   Biz and you're putting up Twitter and you're like, you know, take a look at it once you
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.640]   use it for a while, you really get it.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.280]   It's fun and it's easy to bust out of all of these things that hold back larger companies.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:25.720]   But once you get big and once you have a lot of a lot of people, it's harder to move and
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.520]   they're all trying to figure out they're all taking different approaches to recapturing
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.920]   that startup feel in a large organization.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.600]   Facebook does it by limiting their hires and they try to keep the developer teams very
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.600]   small.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.480]   This is Google's attempt here is saying, well, let's let's try to recapture that startup
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:48.240]   feel by creating business divisions that have a clear head and we can all point to one particular
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.240]   direction because in the past that 20% time has just been, you know, and I'm using that
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:57.400]   very loosely, but that sort of innovative spirit has just been kind of widespread and
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.840]   they subscribed loosely to the idea of fail faster and they failed very fast in a lot
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.160]   of things except for search.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.720]   Search has been their cash cow that allows them to experiment.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:11.440]   And I think this is Larry saying, hey, look, look, we've got some good stuff going on here.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.920]   We've got Google Docs is coming along well.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.120]   Gmail is got widespread adoption and is very good.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.000]   Let's try to come up with those things that are going to move it faster and make it feel
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.400]   like a startup and wow the Joel Johnson's of the world in ways that they didn't expect.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.080]   You know, I was really the best business model you could come up with is just wowing me.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.080]   That's my crystal and pitch.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.800]   That's actually is my pitch to VCs.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.960]   Anyone listening right now, that's that's my business plan.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:45.720]   I mean, this is very unfair, but I always thought Eric Schmidt was super creepy and I
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:50.520]   don't know if he just had a knack for putting his foot in his mouth a lot, but it was definitely
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:56.760]   Eric Schmidt who would say the things that made me scared of Google as opposed to, you
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:02.600]   know, the founders. So I'm kind of glad to see him on his way out because I like and
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:07.960]   again, this is this is a very cartoonish at best, but I like the idea of Google being
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.840]   a home for engineers and a home for people that want to really innovate. And I felt like
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:19.200]   Schmidt often was represent representative of the Google that was going to take all of
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.240]   that trust that we put in them in their founding years and monetize it in really ski
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.400]   be ways. So maybe he's the nicest guy in the world. Maybe that was just all accident
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:32.640]   on, you know, on that he's not he says stupid things sometimes, but I'm glad to see a founder
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.840]   back in the chair and like move forward with it. It kind of feels it could be like a steep
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.840]   job.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.560]   But Joel, I'm not going to screw you about having a founder back in the chair, but I
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:47.200]   will just agree about about Schmidt. I've gained a lot of respect for him over time.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:53.360]   And I think that as a geek, you of all people should understand the geek's sense of humor
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.760]   is get misinterpreted. So I don't think he says so much creepy things as he has a sense
[00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:03.480]   of irony. And that doesn't often hold up and doesn't go. I think he did a hell of a job
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:09.000]   training Larry and getting the company in the position where it is. And I even wonder
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.880]   whether this organization is not about getting back the startup spirit, whether it's about
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:18.200]   a company finally acting like a big company. And you know, you consider how fast you have
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:24.560]   to be able to change now. I think the death of the flip camera is the Cisco killed this
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:32.600]   week is breathtaking in the speed of a company from zero to hot company to dead company and
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:40.520]   product in four years, which is, you know, a third of Google's lifespan and Google's
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:48.600]   basically had three lives, search company at company now, mobile company. You know, I
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:53.120]   think they've been remarkable and they've stayed up there, but I wonder whether or not,
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.760]   you know, they're vulnerable for the next change. So far, they haven't been. But I still
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.840]   I'll still will defend Eric. I think that Eric did a great job.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:08.680]   Yeah, I don't think anybody is impugning Eric's integrity here. And he's still there, right?
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.960]   He's still an executive chairman for whatever that means. A lot of people think that Larry
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.720]   Page, not so good with dealing with the government, not so good necessarily with dealing with
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.120]   the public and maybe Eric will still continue to fill those roles, especially that role
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:26.920]   of dealing with the government, which is a more important role than ever for Google,
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:32.280]   because they have huge lobbying interests that they're not filling. You know, everybody
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:35.960]   likes to complain about lobbyists, but when you're a company that doesn't have them, you
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.680]   get stomped because everybody else does have them. So you know, Eric Schmidt, I guess,
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:47.520]   is becoming the lobbyist in chief in this situation where Larry is focusing on, okay,
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.560]   I've learned from you, Eric, and I think I know what to do. This is the way I'm going
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.000]   to make that organization. It does put a lot of pressure on him, though. He is at the center
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.160]   of this hub and folks are comparing him to Steve Jobs and saying, you know, he's going
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:05.560]   to be involved in all of these departments at a very hands-on level. Do you think that's
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:12.800]   true? Yeah, I think we have a reason to think that I think it'll be confusing now is that
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:19.800]   I somehow still doubt that Larry is going to be a very public face of Google. And Joel,
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:26.200]   you're right that Eric stuck his foot in his mouth or had his foot shoved into his mouth
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:32.200]   again and again and again. But Larry, we haven't seen publicly at all. It's going to
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.320]   be hard to imagine at some point he's going to have to be. He's the CEO now and that's
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:41.960]   going to be a really interesting transition to see how much he seems to be and wants to
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:47.360]   seem to be demand in charge. One of the first things he'll be overseeing
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.160]   is the acquisition of ITA software, which Caroline McCarthy over at CNET's the Social
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:58.240]   Blog reports is now closed. The deal was approved by the Justice Department. You may
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:01.680]   have read that the Justice Department filed suit against Google. That's their way of
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:07.440]   improving it. That's the way these things work is when the DOJ wants to object and put
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.400]   in conditions for approval, they file suit and say, "We're going to block this unless
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:16.840]   these conditions are met." So now it sounds like Google has agreed to the conditions and
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:22.640]   announced that it has reached a settlement with the Department of Justice. And ITA software
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:29.520]   will go ahead. 700 million done deal. Google has added an update yesterday that said our
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:35.760]   acquisition of ITA has now closed, which means that they will operate ITA and be able to
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.280]   benefit from all the data ITA does in the travel industry. If you're not familiar with
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:45.360]   them, what they do is gather fair information and then provide a feed of that information
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:51.640]   to various different companies. Google is going to have several restrictions on them of what
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:56.640]   they can do with that company over the next five years. They'll be required to continue
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:02.120]   to license the QPX software. That's the software that Airfare websites use. They'll have to
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:07.320]   license it on commercially reasonable terms. Google will also be required to continue
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:12.280]   to fund research and development of QPX, at least at similar levels to what ITA has invested
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.800]   up till now. And Google will also be required to further develop and offer ITA's next generation
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:23.960]   Insta-search product that had been in development. And Google will be required to implement
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:28.200]   firewall restrictions within the company that prevent authorized use of competitively sensitive
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:33.880]   information. So if Kayak is giving a bunch of information to ITA in order to facilitate
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.200]   a feed to them, a fair information, Google can't take that information and go, "Hey,
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:43.480]   that's a good idea. Let's implement that in search." What is Google going to get out
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:49.400]   of this? Gina, do you have an idea of what products we might see and what ways they'll
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:55.080]   be able to make use of this? So they just want to return the kind of results that Kayak does
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:36:00.280]   for travel search results. Show me all the flights under $500 leaving for Puerto Rico
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:05.720]   tomorrow. And actually, I was curious to know, what do you all use? What search search engine
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:10.800]   do you all use to find flights when you need to travel? I use Kayak. I generally go to
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:17.040]   Kayak first. Yeah, I have default to Kayak. And then for some reason, I've been like a
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:21.520]   I had like one really amazing customer service experience with the orbits like three or four
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:26.320]   years ago. And so often I just go back to them. But if I'm trying to actually turn something
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:31.240]   around really fast, I tend to use Kayak. Yeah. I use Expedia still only because it's habit.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:37.600]   But the truth is I fly out of Newark. So I'm basically stuck with continental come United
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:41.240]   now no matter what. So I end up going to the site to do it because I have my flight.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:46.160]   Yeah, that was my first thought too. It's good as this might be for business and as
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:52.760]   good as it might be for Google from a revenue standpoint, I can't see this affecting real
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:37:00.240]   people all that much until something about fair search and all this indexing actually
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:05.720]   changes the airlines themselves. Because you know, unfortunately, the problem with all
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:10.320]   of this really great search indexing and fair indexing and all of that stuff is it just
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:16.400]   continues to drive prices down, which is that's great for the individual consumer
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:21.320]   purchasing things right at that moment. But it's also why we have the tops of airplanes
[00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:27.400]   ripping off because the industry continues to shave as much money as they can out of
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:34.400]   it. So I feel like this is, we won't see, it would be much more interesting if Google
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:40.480]   was pulling a branch and it deciding to open their own airline or do some sort of travel
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:45.200]   thing that actually involves physical travel. But you know, I don't think that's super likely
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   for them.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.480]   Well, you know, I think that more transparency of pricing is a good thing. And I think that
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.440]   Google being involved in this will tend to lead to more transparency because they don't
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:38:00.920]   own an airline. And so I think that's good for consumers whether or not airlines inspect
[00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:07.840]   their planes is an entirely different issue for the FAA. I once asked Sergey about an
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.320]   airline because when I was writing what we will do, I said that I speculated about the
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.440]   idea of a Google airline, the social airline, and he laughed and said that a friend of his
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:21.640]   had started an airline based on that in something new in Brazil. But without a business when
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:25.200]   the entire crew was arrested for smuggling drugs.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:31.520]   That's one way of making use of social. Yeah, we're such good friends. We're going to
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.000]   be partners in crime. Well, you know, right now airlines keep us prisoner, at least they
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:42.160]   gave us drugs. We might be happier online. The other thing that I think comes that becomes
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:47.360]   really disruptive in the airline industry, I ran a session on the social airline in at
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:53.400]   the DLD conference in Munich in January with Lufthansa and people like Skowble were there
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:59.000]   because Skowble is everywhere. And as we went through it, what would fascinating be there
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:06.840]   was a story about six months ago, some passengers on KLM wanted to go to a from Amsterdam to
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:12.120]   a music festival in Miami. And there wasn't a direct flight. And so they petitioned KLM
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:17.160]   on Twitter saying we want you to get a flight force. And KLM said, okay, if you get 315
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:23.600]   people, we'll put a flight on for you in five hours. They did. Now, what's fascinating
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:30.920]   about that is airlines are supply driven. What if airlines became demand driven? So like
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:36.840]   eventful for airlines? Well, exactly. And Lufthansa people who were there said, well,
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:42.960]   we do already have a private air thing, but it doesn't scale very big. But imagine if
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:47.120]   lots and lots of people from San Diego said, we're all going to South by Southwest, and
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:53.680]   there's no really good direct flight to Austin. Hello. Well, if suddenly Google sees a lot
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:40:00.840]   of searching by people in Austin to go to San Diego to go to Austin, what does that
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.960]   tell them? What's the value of that? Now, you get all kinds of issues and airlines
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:10.760]   of having slots and all that kind of stuff. But if you imagine just a little bit here,
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:16.960]   what travel could be like if it were demand driven, if it were a little bit less risk,
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:24.720]   less fixed cost, more flexibility, that becomes really, really interesting as a disruptor in
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.000]   the industry. And if you think about it, Google could be in that position where they might
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.200]   know more about demand, just like they know more about flu than the doctors, right? They
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:39.960]   may well know more about interest in destinations from locales than anybody.
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:44.200]   See, that's really that's super fascinating. I hadn't heard about that KLM flight. That's
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.360]   that's, I don't know, that made me happy for some reason. I really like that. And I think
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.440]   that's the same reason that that Google's messing around with this automated car thing,
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:41:01.560]   because if you if you think of surface travel as like essentially a packetized system, if
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:06.560]   they can start, you know, not just automating the cars, but knowing where the cars are,
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:11.280]   knowing what the demand levels are for the cars, knowing who's in what cars at what time
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.920]   all of this stuff. And of course, this is pretty, you know, being able to drive down
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:20.600]   the highway in a test car is a long way from having the entire American auto fleet, you
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:25.880]   know, wired up to be autonomous. But you can, it's the same sort of thing. All of a sudden
[00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:31.240]   Google, they could give away all of this routing stuff to all of the auto manufacturers.
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:36.200]   And then knowing where people are going, all it gets, it all it's all intertwined. It brings
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.920]   you back to the local stuff. It brings you back to how people are spending time, how
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.680]   you know, you can save energy, which is sort of like a outdoor thing, but it's still positive.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:48.560]   Yeah, there's all of a sudden I'm realizing that Google, you know, messing around and
[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:52.560]   travel is a lot, not as far from as I had had first thought.
[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.240]   Well, and now that I've gone too far, all of course, this is what I want to go even
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:00.560]   farther. Part of what we said at this Loufton's thing was that was, you know, the seat is
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:05.000]   a commodity. It's long been a commodity. And we're a prisoner there. And if you had this
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.440]   demand driven thing, a company could come along and say, listen, I'm going to buy bulk
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:16.400]   seats from Loufton's or continental, United. And, but I'm going to take care of your entire
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:20.040]   experience. I'm going to get you to the airport and from the airport. And I'm going to help
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:24.000]   you decide where to stay. I mean, the old time travel agent in a way, right, comes back,
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.640]   but in a bulk by way, so that you just the airline seat is the commodity that gets here
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.520]   as long as the service is good enough. That's not where the brand is. The brand may be in
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:39.960]   Joel's travel wonderland. It'd be Airbnb, but with the focus on the air. Right. Yeah,
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:45.560]   good. And then, you know, you go to Google and you think that there are things like getting
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:50.760]   me either what's my automated car in that car. Have you programmed it with my music? Did
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:54.480]   you pick the kind of car that I would like to drive be there? You just log in with your
[00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:00.080]   Google ID and it's got all of your specifications, your preferences. Right. And we know you're
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.640]   landing at noon, Mr Jarvis, and you do like Chipotle and we know where the nearest one
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:07.720]   is. We'll just take you there automatically and we'll have your order ready for you.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:12.480]   It's actually in the car when you get. Yes. Yes. The margarita with the betrone. That
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:19.040]   was a real cool transition to Chipotle. It was that was smooth, really smooth. So I love
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:23.400]   all these ideas. I love this. I really love this. And in the long term, it's really cool.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.160]   The possibilities are really cool. But in the short term, if you're kayak or you're hit
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:32.440]   monk or you do travel search, doesn't this kind of stink? I mean, Google's the best search
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.920]   engine out there. If you do travel search and now that they own the software, I know
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:39.680]   that they made this deal where they have to set up, you know, that they can't there that
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.320]   people are going to be able to extend their contract and they're still going to provide
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:46.560]   this data to other people and all that and all this kind of thing. It's still like, oh,
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.960]   you know, if I'm an entrepreneur, I'm not going to go into travel search now. That's why the
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:55.480]   fair search organization was created to oppose this. And they actually have some ideas that
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:44:01.680]   they've won in this. I want to get to those in a second, though speaking of product placement,
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:06.760]   Jeff, we should take a break and thank one of our sponsors here, Squarespace, the Fast

[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:37.800]   beginners and CSS experts, HTML experts, folks who know what they're doing can get under the
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.560]   hood and tweak things. But the nice thing for those of us who do know what we're doing
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:45.880]   is you don't have to do that all the time. You can use the template to create a website
[00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.200]   and then go in and just tweak the couple of things you need to. You don't have to go
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:54.880]   through the tedium of it. They've got all kinds of templates that you can tweak around
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.920]   and play with. They've got a form builder. You can collect email addresses and other
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.600]   information from visitors, website tracking, a built in search engine optimizer. Talk
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:08.440]   about tedious going through and doing SEO. Forget about it. Squarespace does it for you.

[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:28.040]   and we thank Squarespace for their support of this week in Google.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:31.920]   So I mentioned fair search. That was an organization put together by some of these companies like
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:37.640]   Kayak but also Microsoft was in there as well. And one of the things that they opposed to
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:42.320]   was the idea of Google having this information and incorporating it into search. But one of
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.400]   the reasons they think they've succeeded in this, even though Google gets to acquire
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:52.480]   ITAs, the DOJ had the sniff around Google some more and they think that the DOJ is going
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:59.360]   to be doing more sniffing around now and possibly going after Google in other areas of, particularly
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:03.120]   search. Do you think that's going to happen? Do you know they're going to go after them?
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:07.360]   Interesting. If this organization is happy about it, that's very interesting.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.280]   I mean, everybody likes to claim victory. But yeah, they were saying this is a victory
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:15.440]   for us. It put restrictions on Google and most of all, the Department of Justice is now familiar
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:20.560]   with what Google's up to. Right. And this is similar to the privacy. The FTC, you know,
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.280]   the privacy mandate that they're going to be checking in on Google every year, every
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:31.280]   two years for the next 20 years to make sure that they're enforcing privacy policies well.
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:36.960]   So interesting, interesting to see if anything else comes up.
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.480]   I mean, I would be very curious to know where they got that information or if it's just
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:48.320]   wishful thinking because the DOJ and the FTC tend to be extremely opaque about those
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:54.160]   investigations while they're happening or before they've announced anything officially.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.760]   At least, you know, in my world, like I know I've spent a lot of time hearing those rumors
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.480]   and then trying to get them confirmed and it's really hard to get that information. So,
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:08.640]   it almost sounds a little funny to me like they're saying, you know, like it kind of
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:14.600]   justifies why they had to call in the big guns and create this organization is to say,
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.560]   you know, it's not just this one thing. It's all sorts of other things. So, yeah, they're
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:24.760]   not trying to say there is an investigation going on. They're sort of implying it because
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:29.360]   of the other investigations. We got one in Texas. Got other attorneys general still going
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:36.600]   after Google for the Street View Wi-Fi collection. But you've got that antitrust thing going
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:41.080]   on in Texas. You've got some European Commission looking in and they're hoping, I think, more
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:47.120]   than knowing. Yeah, we don't know if Google has stopped beating its wife or not, but it
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:51.520]   would be good to find out. Yeah, exactly. Jeff, do you think there's anything to this?
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.720]   Do you think the DOJ would go after Google or is that just wishful thinking? Yeah, I
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:03.720]   think it's wishful thinking or it's an attempt to scrape victory from defeat. You know, the
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:08.200]   problem I have these days is that why is Google treated constantly as if it's a bad
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:14.240]   guy? I have a discussion with Siva before about the buzz FTC decision, which I went
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:20.000]   a little bit overboard on the last twig. But I still find that a one-time mistake fixed
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.880]   over a weekend, is that worth putting you on probation for 20 years? Was the violation
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:32.720]   of trust that huge? I think we just come back to this all the time and it's probably a
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:36.280]   problem with Google's size is that size brings mistrust.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:42.840]   Yeah, in fact, Google's search share has been declining very slowly, but the new hit wise
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:48.920]   numbers are out. And Bing, if you count Yahoo and Bing together makes up 30% of the search
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:57.080]   market and Google makes up just shy, you know, just around 65% or so. And then of course
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:01.880]   you've got poor ask.com and the others like them trailing behind. But Bing is making some
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:08.320]   inroads. Yeah, and I think that, you know, the US particularly that's highly competitive
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:13.640]   in Europe, Germany, Google search remains over 90%, which is ironic since the Germans
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:19.680]   go crazy on Google. That almost may be why, right? Because it's 90%
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:26.000]   Yeah. Well, but the people are making it that big and go remedial after it. So yeah, I think
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.600]   we could be fairly well assured that the FTC and the DOJ and the FCC are all going to try
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:36.400]   to make points and score points by keeping an eye on Google because Google's just so
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.400]   big.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:41.640]   The other thing we forget about sometimes, Google owns YouTube. YouTube getting into
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:47.200]   the live streaming business this past Friday, they launched YouTube live. You can go check
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:53.520]   it out at youtube.com/live. They've got trusted partners that they're partnering with these
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:59.320]   days. So featured live events have featured a lot of Indian cricket.
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:03.640]   Coachella was going to be live ad tech. The conference here in San Francisco had a lot
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:08.760]   of live streams from there. And then they've got other partners like revision three and
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:15.400]   other video production companies that are putting on live events. This sort of positions
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:22.560]   them between you stream and Hulu and Netflix somewhere. It's not anybody can get on a broadcast
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:28.080]   anytime, but it's also, you know, it's not Hollywood. These are these are more independent
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.080]   video providers.
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:32.440]   Tom, do you have any inside information? Is Twitter going to go on this?
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:33.600]   Yeah, where's Twitter?
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:39.800]   I have no idea. I have no inside information. You're talking to the best protected source
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:43.280]   Twit could ever have.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:47.680]   My reaction to the story was immediate indignance. That's what wasn't listed. So YouTube people
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.680]   get on that.
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:52.840]   Yeah, see that maybe that's why Leo couldn't do Twig this week. He didn't want to answer
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:53.840]   these questions.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.040]   Yeah, because you know Leo, he's always keeping all those secrets.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:00.840]   Yeah, exactly. He's very good at that.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:05.480]   Oh, yeah. Yeah, I, you know, I really can't speak that. I have no idea what what the Leo's
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:09.280]   position is about putting us on YouTube live. I can't imagine we wouldn't want to be on
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:15.840]   there at least eventually. But this is something where I I've definitely been interested in
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:19.680]   taking some of the things I do outside of Twit and putting them on here. But I'm not
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:25.040]   in there yet because I'm alone, not a big enough partner. So it is interesting, right?
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:30.360]   I mean, not every single indie is on YouTube live. Some of them are and a lot of them are
[00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:35.400]   aren't usual suspects, right? They're not live production companies. They're doing specific
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:42.720]   live events for YouTube live. But this is this is this is an interesting procedure for
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:48.960]   YouTube to follow in order to compete with a Netflix or Hulu because don't forget Hulu
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:54.680]   was put into place to crush YouTube because at the time the industry had convinced itself
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:59.520]   that YouTube was the threat because of all of the pirated video. And it turns out that's
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:03.280]   not why YouTube was successful. That was part of it. People did like that aspect of it,
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:08.480]   but people did like to see other folks stuff, whether it was, you know, the typical cat
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:14.720]   riding a skateboard or whether it was Fred or lonely girl or or these other independent
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:19.720]   uh, productions. So I think it's been a long time in the making that we would have YouTube
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:24.240]   do a live service. It's interesting that they're picking their partners though. It's it's more
[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:29.160]   of a Google go slow approach. Let's let's iterate. Let's put it out there slowly and
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:34.320]   see how it does. Yeah, that's definitely how it strikes me. I think it's going to be really,
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:39.360]   um, I mean, I think live video streaming has been around long enough that we've seen most
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:44.600]   of the real interesting things that you can do with it. But I think the best thing for
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:50.720]   me is the idea that for a lot of people, I'm guessing, but I would think for the mainstream
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:56.320]   audience, a lot of people are still just viewing. They think video online is YouTube. So the
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:53:02.680]   idea of having live streaming, especially once it can come to mobile devices, um, like I,
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:09.680]   I'm not, I, I'm not particularly wedded to, uh, watching something live for the most part.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.560]   I mean, depending on what it is, um, because part of the nice thing about the internet
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:17.000]   for me is that I don't have to or DBRs or all of that stuff that I can watch it when
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:23.240]   I want to. But, um, from a news standpoint, I just instantly think of things like Libya
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:28.120]   and Syria and Bahrain and all of these things that are happening where, uh, if it becomes
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:32.320]   more of a platform thing and it's very common and it's on, you know, all these throwaway
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:37.360]   phones in another, you know, three or four years, the idea that, um, I think, I think
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:43.760]   it'll change the way that we engage with the public for in political ways. I think, like
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:48.440]   Jacob Applebaum keeps getting like harassed at the borders, uh, because of the work that
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:52.800]   he did for WikiLeaks. And I just really like the idea of like him being able to flip open
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:57.520]   a camera and, you know, and, and have it there, which is all again, all stuff you can do with
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:54:02.120]   your stream. It's all stuff that you can do with other services. But I think that if this,
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:07.920]   uh, a platform as big as YouTube, uh, and as, and we'll get it out into places that it
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.760]   hasn't been before and maybe kind of give it the boost that it has needed, uh, because
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:16.840]   I feel like it's been a little bit haphazard and adoption in the mainstream market.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:21.240]   Yeah, I think that I'm surprised to YouTube this long to get this far with live because
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:25.120]   live as well established and has been there, you know, since Justin TV and other live
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:29.120]   streaming such, but I, you know, I look at it this way. I don't think that, and I just
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:33.160]   could be heresy. I could get bumped off. I don't think Twitch and twig or shows so much
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:37.720]   as they are conversations. And I don't think that's heresy. Yeah. I think that's exactly
[00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:42.080]   what people like it. Right. And so, and so the chat room, which by the way, says that
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:46.560]   Leo won it on and I don't know if they're joking, but there's some question of the copyright
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:51.440]   takedowns when we put on Glee or something, I guess. I don't know. Um, I don't understand
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.520]   what the chat room is bragging about being ahead of us and then as well, they should,
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:59.200]   but I'm not sure what that means. But, but I, you know, I think that Joel, you're right
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:03.080]   in terms of things like entertainment programming, live doesn't matter. Being on the schedule,
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:08.400]   put it that way, doesn't matter. But in terms of having a conversation, being able to look
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:16.160]   at the, um, uh, the chat room here and, uh, seeing that they're saying, who, who they're
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:22.320]   ahead of us. Yeah, you are. Um, uh, uh, is, is part of the joy of it. And, and the number
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:25.400]   of people, I don't know, do you have any idea, Tom, what the, what the proportion is of people
[00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:31.920]   who watch, uh, Twitter and Twig and such and your show live versus, uh, delayed? Yeah,
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:38.160]   it's the smallest portion watch live. Uh, the next, I'd, you know, I don't really know,
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:43.320]   but I'd say it's like a 50th maybe roughly. That's all. And then, and then the next
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:47.400]   smallest portion watch video and then the largest portion still watch audio still
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:52.040]   listen to audio. Uh, they just watch those little lines jumping up and down.
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:58.800]   People, they just stare at the spot because audio is more convenient, uh, as a, especially
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:03.960]   as a podcast, even as live. Uh, you can, you can put it on in your car now with 3G coverage
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:09.880]   getting better. You can, I listened to a Windows weekly live streaming audio on my way up to
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:14.160]   the cottage today, 20 minute drive, never lost the signal once. Uh, so that, you know, I
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:18.640]   think, I think in some ways audio is here now. And that's what people are using. Video
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:23.680]   is coming next. That is, that is where it's going. And, and we're still trying to figure
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:28.120]   out how best people access it. I can shed some light on the whole YouTube takedown notice
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:34.760]   thing. Uh, every time we show a clip on Twit or often on frame rate, uh, that is a copyrighted
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:39.040]   video, but it's fair use. We're either shown in a news context or it's a trailer for a
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:45.640]   movie. Uh, we run this risk of, of running into an automatic takedown. So we can't promise
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.200]   that we're never going to run a fall of YouTube's algorithm. We can say, look, we'll never
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.720]   actually infringe because we think it's fair use because of, because of news gathering
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:57.000]   and we know what we're doing. Uh, but, but we've had plenty of shows taken down by this
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.920]   algorithm that you then have to go file a counter notice and have it reinstalled. It's
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.920]   easier, frankly, to just re upload the episode and then somebody doesn't. That's really
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:09.920]   interesting because that, that affects YouTube in terms of having relationships with any
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:14.640]   news organization and I call Twit and Twig a news organization. Yeah, exactly. Because
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:20.600]   fair use laws are different regarding news and ephemeral like live than they are for
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:24.600]   something that's going to be archived or something that's done for entertainment purposes.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:31.200]   I wouldn't be surprised if part of the delay in implementing it, um, is, is also related
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:35.600]   to, to kind of the takedown issue because what do you do if somebody starts doing something
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:41.280]   vulgar live streaming? What do you do if, if, yeah, somebody starts live streaming content?
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:45.920]   You know, they just go into a movie theater and are, and are, uh, live streaming the,
[00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:50.960]   the movie, you know, directly through YouTube. Um, I think there is probably a lot of like,
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:56.240]   uh, legal wrangling and, and ad partner wrangling that had to happen behind the scenes to, to
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:00.000]   make this happen. And I think that's part of the reason it's being, uh, tiptoed out is
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.440]   that they know, I mean, they, nobody that's a guaranteed partner of YouTube is going to
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:09.680]   do anything heinous in their live stream. And that kind of, you know, gets everybody used
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:13.200]   to it. It gets the advertisers to calm down and get comfortable with it. And then they
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:18.400]   can, you know, they can move forward from there. All right, let's, uh, let's take a quick break.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:22.160]   We've got a lot of other stories, uh, to cover before we wrap up here, but I want to thank,

[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:07.120]   of this week in Google. A lot more Google news to come through. Uh, yesterday HTC announced a
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:13.120]   new Android headset. We've known it under the code name peer mid. It's the sensation 4G dual core
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:19.440]   1.2 gigahertz snapdragon processor. Say same body actually as the HTC Evo 3D. This is not 3D,
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:26.240]   however, it's going to come with the HTC Sense UI 3.0 8 megapixel rear camera really emphasizing
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:30.960]   video. They've got this Netflix like video service they're going to put on it called HTC Watch
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.560]   does 30 frames per second video 1080p resolution. Uh, we're going to get it in the United States in
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:44.560]   summer on T mobile, uh, which by the way, folks, T mobile still independent till at least 2012,
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:50.720]   if not later, AT&T can't acquire them until the earliest 2012. So T mobile is at least independent
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:56.240]   for another six months or so. Uh, and, uh, launching in the UK, Germany and the rest of HTC's key
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:01.120]   European markets in mid May, they get a little earlier. In fact, Vodafone gets an exclusive on
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:06.560]   it for a couple of weeks right after that mid May launch date. You guys, uh, excited at all about
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:12.080]   the, uh, the sensation? Is it a sensation for you? Yeah, the thing, the thing that I got the most
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.640]   excited about was the lock screen update, which I, which I'm not sure if this is part of this part
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:21.360]   of sense 3.0 or not, but it's got this really cool shortcut where, and this is just, this is
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:24.800]   the type of thing that makes me really happy because I'm just a software gal and I love shortcuts.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:29.360]   Um, unlock your screen. If you, you know, when you, when you go to unlock your phone, you need to
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.840]   do something, right? You're going to check your email or, or, or search search Google or make a phone
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:38.480]   call. So there's a list of apps on your lock screen. So your phone is, is locked, but there are apps
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:43.440]   there. So to unlock it, you grab the app that you want to use and drop it on to the unlock thing.
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:47.680]   And it just launches it automatically, right? So it takes out the T. So normally it's two steps
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:53.760]   unlock launch and, and reduces it to one. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. Hey, it's a tiny little thing,
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:58.160]   but I was like, Oh, that's great. And I want it now. And that should be in the core, core Android.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:03.920]   But you know, Netflix not being an Android is such a huge thing. It's such a huge problem.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:08.000]   So, you know, this HCC watch is cool. I still just want Netflix.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.520]   But yeah, there's a big hole there. And so the HCC watch makes sense that someone else would kind
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.440]   of jump in and say, Hey, we've got, we've got streaming and watch TV shows on Android.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.400]   But I just, I don't know what Netflix is waiting for. It's a DRM issue, right? But I don't understand
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:27.200]   what the issue really is. Does anybody? They have a particular DRM implementation that they need
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.640]   the Android operating system to support. Jill, do you know more about it than that?
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:34.720]   I mean, all I know is that on the website of things, it's all based out of Silverlight.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:41.680]   So there's not good Silverlight support for for Android, obviously. But by the same token,
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:46.640]   there's not good Silverlight support for iOS either. So it seems to me like it's either a
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.000]   licensing deal because you have to realize that any of these media companies, which is the same
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.720]   reason that HTC watch platform is just going to, you know, probably crash and burn, is that when
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:03:01.040]   Netflix makes any move or Hulu or any of these guys make a move, they have to get sign off from
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:07.520]   a million different content partners on almost everything. And so I would imagine it's just some
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:14.640]   weird hold up in the licensing fees for Android. But technically, there's no reason they couldn't
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:18.800]   do it on Android if they really put their mind to it. They could, they could transcode everything
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:24.160]   on the back end and use a different DRM server just for, or a different DRM service, just for
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:28.800]   Android if they needed to. I mean, Netflix is on Google TV right now. Google TV is a build of
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:32.880]   Android, right? So this is, this is like, I mean, technically it's absolutely possible. I use it on
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:38.320]   my Google TV all the time. Joshua Caleb in the chatroom says he thinks it's a DRM on the chip
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:44.080]   that Netflix requires and that that's what's holding it up and that the chip for the iPhone and the
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:50.320]   iPad both process that DRM. I know Netflix has some pretty restrictive and weird DRM that they do,
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.200]   which is one of the reasons they've been able to strike as many deals as they have.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:57.040]   How many licensing deals is because it makes the industry feel comfortable.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:03.760]   I was not aware of there being any sort of hardware DRM aspect to the Netflix stuff,
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:09.520]   but now I'm super curious. So yeah, I would, I would, that would, that would make a lot of sense.
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:17.760]   But I do think it's, actually, I don't even know, like, I just, I find myself not using Netflix and
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:23.200]   things like that as much on mobile on phones as I normally would, but for the Android tablet market,
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:27.920]   I think it's a real bummer because watching, watching TV on an iPad or watching Netflix or Hulu
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:33.120]   on an iPad is like one of the best things ever. So yeah, they need to get it fixed.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:38.880]   Good news for sprint fans. Google says Android carrier billing will be available for sprint.
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:44.320]   It'll roll out slowly to different folks. You may not see it right away, but this puts them now
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:50.960]   on what? AT&T sprint and T-Mobile for, for carrier billing. So that makes it easier when you're in
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.400]   the Android marketplace to just spend lots of money without realizing it.
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:05:03.520]   This is this, this is what carrier billing is one thing that people have required to say that
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.920]   the Android marketplace needs to have it easier to billing to bill you to take off because it
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:10.800]   needs to be easier to buy stuff. But is that the only thing, Gina?
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:18.160]   I'm not sure. I'm not sure actually. So carrier billing billing is just an easier way for someone
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.960]   to purchase something like through the their carrier versus like having a Google checkout account.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.640]   So this would enable the Android market to use carrier billing?
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:32.240]   Yeah, the carrier bill, as I understand it, that when you're on a sprint phone now,
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:37.200]   you'll be able to go to the Android marketplace and when you check out, it'll give you the normal
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:44.080]   options as well as a sprint logo and then you click that sprint logo and it gets put on your bill.
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:49.040]   Yes, I think that this is super important, right? Because I know people who are like,
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:53.360]   I don't buy apps because I just haven't given Google my credit card yet, right? But you've
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.800]   already given your carrier credit card. So it makes sense. So it's an easy way to buy stuff. And
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:01.200]   then this is, this is like has to be top priority and kind of is top priority for the Android folks.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:06.240]   It's like making it easier for people to hand their money over. So it makes a lot of sense.
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:12.000]   Just circling back real quick, Joshua Caleb sent a link to the Engadget story about Qualcomm
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:17.840]   saying future Android devices with Snapdragon should be able to support the DRM that Netflix
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:24.480]   requires. They said that at Mobile World Congress earlier this year. So they have, they have some
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:32.880]   crazy DRM requirements for watch instantly. Russia backing down on banning Gmail. They had
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:36.960]   said at the end of last week, Skype, wasn't it? Yeah, that will Gmail and Skype and Hotmail.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:43.120]   Oh, oh, oh. All of them. Russia's Federal Security Service had threatened on Friday to call for a
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:50.160]   ban on Skype Gmail and Hotmail. The uncontrollable use of such services can lead to a major threat
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:56.720]   to Russia's security. And Ray's can reportedly set at a government meeting. He proposed a ban on
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:03.440]   them. But on Saturday, the Federal Security Bureau backed down and said it had no plans
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:12.640]   to try and control Skype, Gmail or Hotmail. Is this just a weirdness of Russia, isn't it?
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:17.600]   It's not something that Gmail is going to be facing or Skype or anybody worldwide. It's not
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.800]   like a blackberry situation. We're going to see a bunch of people starting to consider this, are we?
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:24.400]   Well, is it? That's what I'm asking. I don't know.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:29.840]   I think the more authoritarian government, the better chance that they're going to try to get into
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:38.880]   interfering with communication. Russia does an excellent job of giving the appearance of being
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:45.120]   a democracy, maybe to people who don't give it just the most cursory look. But yeah, I think this is
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.440]   just weird power struggle stuff that Russia's been doing for the last 10, 15 years.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.520]   So it doesn't, I don't think it's portends a trend among other European countries or anything like
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:05.520]   that. But for oligarchies and for poorly run, not very free countries, we're going to see more
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:09.040]   of that happening basically until they become free.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:14.560]   Another battle also going on. Microsoft claims that Google's apps for government do not have
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:19.520]   valid certification under the Federal Information Security Management Act. This is a tiny little
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.520]   battle that a lot of people aren't really paying a lot of attention to. But essentially,
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.840]   Google is going after Microsoft for government contracts. It's a huge revenue source. And
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:34.000]   Microsoft is fighting them tooth and nail. Microsoft, from what I understand from the things I've
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.040]   read, had a pretty easy way. They would come in, they'd say, here's our latest progress project,
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:42.720]   the government would rubber stamp it. They'd get the contract. And with Google coming in,
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:48.960]   they've been fighting and fighting to keep them out. Google does have what's called
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:54.640]   FISMA certification, Federal Information Security Management Certification. But they have it for
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:09:00.640]   Google Apps, not a separate product called Google Apps for government. Apparently, this has to do
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:04.720]   with the fact that Google is just not as experienced in the ways of Washington.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:10.320]   The other question I have relevant to the theme of the show, obviously, this is Microsoft going
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:14.080]   after Google. That's the whole point. But is it also anti-cloud?
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.080]   Well, that's a really good question because Microsoft is pushing their cloud services too.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:23.440]   I don't know specifically whether they're pushing them to the government as well, but I'm sure they
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:29.680]   will. I don't get the sense that this is the government saying, no, our Microsoft saying,
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:36.640]   you don't want to trust the cloud yet. I'm sure that's in their rolodex of things to object to.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:41.920]   Right now, they're just saying, Google isn't licensed. They lied. They said they had certification.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:48.080]   They don't. Google's like, we thought we did. All I know is that I really, really want Google Apps
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:53.440]   for government myself. Now that I know there's a government-class Google app, I feel really
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.000]   jealous. My tax dollars are paying for that. I should have government-class Gmail.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.880]   Isn't Google Apps for government just a subset of regular Google Apps? This just sounds like such a
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:07.360]   stupid nitpicking. I mean, really. I'm sure it's just locked down to certain, because the government
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.440]   has all those internal standards that every application has to reach. So I'm sure that
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:16.640]   that's basically just the Google Apps that are probably almost exactly identical, but that
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:22.080]   have gone down the checklist of things that the government requires. So yeah, I mean, maybe it
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.400]   sounds like a technicality. Microsoft has them on a technicality, but it's also something that
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:31.040]   they should be able to fix relatively quickly. That Google should be able to fix relatively quickly.
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:36.240]   Finally, Google just acquired Push Life, a company that developed music apps for
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:40.400]   Android and Blackberry. A lot of sites are speculating Google will use the technology to push music
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:45.760]   to your phone. Push Life has now said, "We've been bought. We're not doing anything anymore."
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.920]   And it's getting integrated into Google Canada, apparently, as well.
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:54.560]   Is this significant for the Google Music rumors? Anybody?
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:11:06.720]   It doesn't feel-- I mean, the tech behind music for Google Music is-- This is more along the lines
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:11.520]   of a patent acquisition. I'm not saying specifically because I've used some of the good life stuff,
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:18.080]   but I'm not familiar with what if any patents they hold. But there's nothing stopping Google of
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:26.240]   all the companies to go to a completely cloud-based sort of situation. But Google, I don't think,
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:32.560]   has quite had the stones to fight the content side of things, which is why I was so proud of
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:38.640]   Amazon last week saying, "We're going to do our cloud music implementation, but we're going to do
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.880]   it by just the same thing that mp3.com did a few years ago with the Locker idea."
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:50.720]   And you saw all the quotes from the music industry all, "Oh my goodness, I can't believe we're so
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:55.200]   offended that they didn't have this conversation with us, whereas Amazon's position is essentially
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:01.600]   saying, "Well, we just don't think you legally even have a leg to stand on." And I feel like
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:08.240]   Google and Apple both are acquiring companies and setting up all of these pieces together
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:14.160]   for them to be able to make that big push, but for whatever reason have still been really timid.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:20.720]   So this one, yeah, I'm sure it's part of the whole Google music idea, but there's half a
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:24.400]   dozen companies that have been brought together before this, and they still haven't pulled the trigger,
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:30.160]   so it's impossible to know. All right, we're going to take a quick break and then come back
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:36.240]   with Gina's tip, Jarvis's number, and my tool. But first, I want to thank our sponsor Netflix.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:40.720]   We were just talking about them. Watch thousands of TV episodes and movie streams, your PC or Mac,
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:46.080]   instantly, plus get DVDs by mail in about a business day. You can also stream them if you've
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:50.240]   got an Xbox, a Nintendo Wii or a PS3, you can stream them right to your TV. There's plenty of
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.160]   otherwise we talked about Google TV as a way to stream Netflix to your television, Apple TV.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:01.200]   There's all kinds of ways you can watch Netflix streaming live on your television. Gina,
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.240]   what's the last movie you watched on Netflix? I'm actually in the midst of watching damages
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:10.880]   right now, which started airing in like 2007, and it's a fantastic show going close, and I'm just
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:16.160]   completely, it's like, when when can I finish works? I can watch the next episode of damages.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:19.520]   Love Netflix. I didn't realize their sponsor. I mean, the reason why I was
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:23.200]   bitching about it not being on Android is because I have a zoom and I want to watch
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:25.360]   Netflix. I want to watch damages on my zoom through Netflix.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:31.280]   Right. And Joel, you're right. Watching it on a tablet is really nice. It's a really convenient
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:37.680]   way. I do it a lot just in the bedroom, even though we have a television, it's just more convenient.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:42.000]   I've got the tablet and I just pop it up. Netflix on my iPad, watch some episodes of
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.840]   Firefly or something. Yeah, Firefly. I admitted in the last show that I don't use Netflix,
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:51.360]   which is Paul People. And I said on the last show before they were a sponsor that I'm going to
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.720]   use Netflix now because I think it's great what they're doing with bringing series on,
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.200]   and they're going to compete and break up with the hegemony of the old networks.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:04.080]   And that's a good thing. Well, you have one question here. Just tweak that a code for Netflix,
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.240]   or is that just a twit code? It's just a twit code, but it still gives you a free trial, Jeff.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:14.400]   I just want credit for it. Netflix.com/twit. The credit is shared across the entire network.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.080]   And we'll be generous. Yes. I know you're into social and sharing, right?
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:24.160]   No, I'm not. No, okay. Never mind. Netflix.com/twit, though. That's the place to go.
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.880]   Sign up for a free trial. Instantly watch this movie, the "damages" series, if you want, or
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.800]   "Firefly," or choose from thousands of TV episodes and other movies when you register.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:37.840]   And we thank them for their support of This Week in Google. Let's move on to the tip. Gina,
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:43.840]   you alluded to it earlier in the show. It's a Gmail tip. Yeah, Gmail has fixed a couple of
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:49.200]   annoying things in it. And the one thing that I was super happy about is this. So by default,
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:55.040]   Gmail auto saves anybody that you email. Gmail auto saves that person as one of your contacts.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.240]   And that's pretty handy unless you have a job like ours where you email with a lot of folks,
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:04.240]   maybe once or twice, and then they're saved in your contacts forever. So your contacts just sort of
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.400]   like balloon out of control. And then you're sinking your contacts to your phone. You're like,
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:14.240]   "Who's this person that I emailed five years ago once about something?" So you can now turn that
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:18.880]   off and sort of have more control over your contacts and have a cleaner decluttered context list.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:26.080]   You go into Gmail's settings. There's an area that is labeled, create contacts for auto save. You can
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:31.200]   say, "When I send a message to a new person, add them to my contacts." And that's how it works
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:35.280]   automatically. And then Gmail will auto complete for you when you send a message from the future.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:41.760]   Or you can just say, "I'll add contacts myself and turn it off." That's really useful. I'm going
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:45.360]   to take advantage of that because I have that problem that you're talking about where I just,
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:51.200]   you know, I email with so many different people out of Gmail, not always from a Gmail account,
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:56.880]   but it all starts to build up in there. So I wanted to do that because I wanted to be able
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.680]   to remember those email addresses, but I want a better way to manage it. That's great.
[01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:04.720]   Yeah. I'm now part of an extended family with another Joel Johnson who isn't me because I think
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:11.120]   his Gmail is like Joel something Johnson. Oh no. I have to. It's so funny. It got handed off. So
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:14.320]   like, you know, and he's like a preacher or something. So I get all these, you know,
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.080]   invitations like, "Oh, I loved your sermon last Sunday." And I'm like, you know, you're welcome.
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:23.920]   Like I did my best, but it would be nice if I could somehow go in and remove all those auto
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:27.600]   completes from the people that have them that don't know me. But that's asking a little much
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.200]   right now. Yeah. The same thing happened to me. I got into somebody's auto complete. I get these
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:37.120]   random messages from someone in Louisiana, you know, who is sure that I'm in his family. I should
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:42.240]   probably let him know that I'm not. I just mute the conversations. I can't wait for one of the
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:48.320]   other. There's one Jeff Jarvis who is a famous jazz musician, but there's another Jeff Jarvis
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:54.640]   recently discovered who is honest to God and Elvis a personator. Nice. Wow. I'm dying to get
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:59.280]   confused with him. Yes. Elvis Jarvis. I ate nothing but a hound dog.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:05.760]   That's your alter ego. That's your Duke silver alter ego that night you go out and you're an
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.400]   Elvis impersonating jazz player. That's a great. It's a great new way to hide an alter ego now.
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:15.200]   You say, Oh, no, that's not that's not me. That's a different Jeff Jarvis. Don't you think I'm a
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:21.520]   good and white satin? I always have. You're a knight in white satin, Jeff.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:27.120]   And let's move on to your number. What do you got for us to get a number of the number of this
[01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:32.720]   week is five to 15. That is the percentage of visits falling in the New York Times since it
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:38.960]   implemented its meter according to hit wives. And more troubling for them should be that
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:45.440]   according to hit wise, the page views fell between 11 and 30%. They analyzed 12 days after the
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:51.760]   meter to a 12 day period before the meter and found this. The big question is that the
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:57.200]   Times has said again and again that most people, the vast majority of people would never hit the
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:02.640]   paywall, which is a good news bad news thing for them because the truth is that if the vast
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.960]   majority of the people never look at more than 20 pages of the Times in a month, that shows a
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:15.440]   pretty low engagement rate versus let's say Facebook, most newspaper sites that know get 12 pages
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:19.440]   of periods per year per month. On average, Facebook gets that every day. And that says something
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:25.280]   about the engagement in newspapers. But in any case, the question is who is the Times losing and why?
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:29.680]   Is it people who hit the wall and say, never mind and go elsewhere? Is it people who are now
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.120]   afraid they're going to hit the wall and so they've started looking elsewhere and the Times has
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:39.440]   trained them in new habits? We don't know enough yet. But I don't think that's a great number losing
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:46.080]   15% of visits just because of the threat of the paywall. And if those visits are from the people
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:51.040]   who come most often, then that's very harmful to the Times because they cause that small number
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:55.680]   cause the vast majority of traffic on the Times site. And they're the ones who justify the premium
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.200]   ad rates. So we'll see where this goes. Yeah, the next number I want to see, which is when you
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:02.800]   probably won't hear from the New York Times is what the revenue has done. At least you won't hear it
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:09.120]   until the next earnings call. And then they even then they may try to fudge what's actually going
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:13.280]   on. But if they if they have a five to 15% drop and the revenue goes through the roof, then,
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:19.360]   you know, that's great. It worked. That's what they wanted. It's all about them raising that
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:23.680]   revenue line. But what they have to do is they have to both keep expanding advertising at the
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:31.840]   same time they get the paywall avatar, the meter average rate from consumers. And so we'll see where
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:35.600]   it goes. I mean, I like the Times. I love the Times. I pay for the Times. I'm rooting for them to win.
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:41.680]   But I think that if any other newspaper thinks they can do this, they can't. Only the Times could
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:47.360]   do it and it's still very much up in the years. One of the Times can. All right. I've got a tool.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:52.400]   I've got two actually, somebody in the chat room and I apologize for not remembering your name,
[01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:59.520]   pointed out that the new Twit app for Android is out. So you can you can watch Twit on Android
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:05.120]   up to date. But my tool is Instapaper. I don't know if we've talked about it on Twig before or not,
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:13.120]   but Instapaper.com is a place where you can easily save things to read later. You put a read later
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:18.320]   button in your browser tag. I've got one in Chrome. I've also got one in Firefox. And when I run
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:22.960]   across an article, because I'm reading so many things every day to prepare for tech news today,
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:26.880]   I run across these articles from like, wow, this is really interesting. It's really in depth.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:33.040]   Maybe it's a scientific article or a philosophy philosophical article. And I'm wanting to read
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:38.160]   it, but I don't have time. I click it, read later. And then I can not only read it at Instapaper.com,
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:43.600]   but there's apps for your phone, for your tablet that you can at your leisure pull it up. It gives
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:48.080]   you a list of all the things you've marked read later. It's very simple. You might think, well,
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:53.120]   it's kind of like delicious, but it works particularly well for this sort of thing where you're like,
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:57.920]   I just don't have time to get to this right now, but I want to sink my teeth on it when I have more
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:05.760]   time. So I've used them to great effect in that particular way, Instapaper.com. You guys use it at
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:15.360]   all? I recommend Instapetch on Android. I seem to kind of serendipitous because
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:20.240]   the last time I was on, everybody was making fun of me for defending the iPad as a tablet,
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:25.440]   but actually having just sold mine. And I just got the email today right before I came on that
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:32.080]   Apple has shipped my iPad to from Hong Kong. So and actually, and that Instapaper is one of the
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:37.680]   main things that I do on my iPad because there's something about and I mean, it's not intrinsic
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:41.760]   to the iPad. It could be any tablet, but there's an idea of like getting home. I don't want to
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:47.360]   get online yet. I don't want to like be at my computer. And I use my iPad a lot for reading,
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:52.320]   and I'll just pick it up and yeah, like I'll fire up Instapaper and grab, you know, I kind of treat
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:56.320]   it like I do podcasts. Like these things that I want to sit down and spend an hour with or so
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:02.240]   and kind of give a little more time. Yeah, I think Instapaper is great. All right,
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:08.000]   that's going to wrap it up for us. Joel Johnson, editorial director at Kotaku.com. Let folks know
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:14.240]   what's going on and what they can look forward to from you there. Video games mostly. I actually,
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:18.720]   we're getting ready to do some really fun stuff at Kotaku that we have E3 coming up,
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:23.760]   which we're doing a lot of planning for that. A lot of it is sort of nebulous right now,
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:29.520]   but I can definitely say I've been really pleased. Sometimes I've worked with a lot of different
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:34.640]   sites and I stepped into a site that had a really strong team and a lot of really good editors.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:40.000]   So we're trying to figure out how to blow it out and do even more in-depth coverage and try to
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.480]   cover video games in a way that maybe wouldn't be the traditional way that they've always been
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:48.640]   covered, which just straight ahead reviews and previews, try to take a little more cultural,
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:54.400]   thinky angle on things. So yeah, come check us out. We love that. Sounds good. Just as Google
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:23:00.960]   surprises you, you will surprise us. There we go. And there goes Jeff Jarvis, BuzzMachine.com,
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:06.720]   any notes to leave people with? No. Okay. Good to see you again, man. I've said everything I have
[01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:12.160]   to say. There's nothing more left. Gina Trapani, smarterware.org. I'm looking through my think
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:17.120]   up stats right now. Awesome. Awesome. Yeah, we are looking for, we're always looking for
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:24.240]   contributors, developers, documentation writers at ThinkUp.com. We're doing a mentor program this
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:29.440]   summer for young programmers. I want to get some experience working in open source. So come
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:34.640]   check us out and just install it and run it if you're on the Twitter's or the Facebook.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.080]   One of my favorite parts is the most retweeted. I like to... Awesome.
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:42.720]   Because that tells me what stuff I said that was actually penetrating people's minds and they
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:47.040]   wanted to pass around. Cool. Cool. My number two most retweeted right now is something from
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:53.680]   the Oscars night though. That's crazy. Wow. Yeah. There's a while ago. Come on, Tom. You gotta keep
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:59.920]   it fresh. I know. All right. See? That's what it does. It gets me up to date. Thanks everybody
