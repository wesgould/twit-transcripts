[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff's here, Stacey's here, and it's here.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   We're going to talk about whether Google's policy of getting rid of old code is just bad for everyone.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   The bad news that maybe they're eliminating duo that made Stacey pretty unhappy.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   And what that 6 GHz bandwidth could be doing for Google? It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. The show we cover everything but Google.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   But we'll have a little Google in today's show.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   So I'll have to rename the show this week in everything including Google.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   That is Aunt Pruitt all the way over to my left. Hello Mr. Pruitt, you look good man. That is boy, that's a best shot man.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   You look like it's like lit. It's got the background. It's just beautiful.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Well thank you sir. I did turn off one of the lights still.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's a little hot today.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   No, it's good. Yeah, no. I think that's good. We don't want it too bright. We want it relaxed.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We want it looking good. And then there's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Hey, he's still pink.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   We finally figured out it's because there's two different color temperatures in your room.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   There's the warm light of the back of the room and the blue light from the daylight in the front.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I'll try the lip but I think you're wrong. I think it's just because I'm in front of a really big window.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Yeah, so that's daylight. We need a lot of daylight.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   You need some Philips Hue lights and to have daylight in the background.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Precisely. Precisely.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Well, okay. Here's the question. Well, those light but I have high hats.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Right? Those lights come in high? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Yeah, VR 30s. Yeah. Yeah, you need the VR 30s.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Yeah, you need the VR 30s.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Yeah, you need the VR 30s.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Are those? Yeah, they have candle lights. They have, I have my cans so I know that they make them.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Yeah, VR 30s. Yeah.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   And you'll want the, if you don't want fancy colors, which you probably don't,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   you just need to get the white ambience. And what'll happen is for this show,
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   you can make them cool. But if you like warm, you can warm them up for every other time.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And that, my friends. And you can get a button for 20 bucks.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   And you can program the button when the show starts and you can just be like,
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Boop, cool. I'll say you don't get too fancy of me. Come on. Come on.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Oh, that sounds brilliant.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   So these are the wise light bulbs? No. No, no, no. These are the hue.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   So if you want the wise ones because, let's see.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   They do. Actually, you could use wise, but you can't use a button then.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Sorry. Okay. Use what? A button. A button.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   But you could tell Google or Amazon,
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Hey, make the wise cool show time.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Yes. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is exactly
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   why we have Stacy on the show. Stacy, you can buy them. The queen of IOT.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Stacy on IOT.com. Subscribe to her newsletter. Check out her events.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   And then, of course, listen to the IOT podcast. She does with the TOEFLant.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And my her perfect, perfect plant.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I'm going with my background as a solid 10.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I would say 10 out of 10. Rumor it.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   We're going to put it to the test. We've got to see what they say.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   There is only one 10 here, and that is Mr. Ant-Proit.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Actually, Ants, I don't know what rumrater would say about Ant. He would say, well,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   no, that's a portrait. I'm sorry.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   That's too good. Yeah, mine's too bland. That's all all Ant.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Mine is all about me. Not about the room.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Yeah, you no longer would now. Looks like you got cement or something.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Is that new paper? Dark slab stuff.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Yes, that paper is dark slab. Dark slab.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   For the classroom that's not too cheery.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Let's see. Oh, there's so many things we could talk about today.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   How about this great article by Steve Yege. Did you read this? I love this article.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   Steve is a now-retired former Google engineer.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   He's obviously made enough money now that he doesn't have to actually work.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   In fact, if you look at his bio, Steve Yege is X Geo, works X Amazon, X Google,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   and X Grab with nearly 30 years of tech experience.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Nowadays, he's pretty much retired. In other words, he's stock-vested.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   But when he was at Google, by the way, I love his lead.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   God dang it, I don't want to blog again. I have so much stuff to do.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Blogging takes time and energy and creativity. I could be putting the good use.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Never clear. My novels, my music, my game, and so on.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   But you get me wild enough and I have to blog. So let's get this over with then.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   The headline, "Dear Google Cloud, Your Deprecation Policy is Killing You."
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   I don't even know why he added the cloud part, but I guess it's because this post is really about what's going on in the cloud.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   SEO, baby.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Yeah. But, yeah, SEO, maybe. But really, you could say this is true about Google in general.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And it's an interesting lesson for people like us who follow the tech industry.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   One of the knocks that Microsoft always got was they never let a technology die.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   That they're always adding code to Windows so that everything that ever worked on Windows will continue to work on Windows.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Steve says it's exactly the opposite at Google.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   In fact, it's almost like they honor people, engineering teams that kill legacy old code.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   That's part of the lore product. It's as good to kill things as it is to make things.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Yes.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   He says, "But the problem with that is your customers pretty soon learn that don't depend on Google."
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   And again, he's talking about the cloud, but I think this applies to all of Google.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Google engineers, he says, "Pride themselves on their software engineering discipline."
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   And that's actually what gets them into trouble.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Pride is a trap for the unwary.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And it has ensnared many of Google team into thinking their decisions are always right.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   And that correctness is more important than customer focus.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Customer focus gives you legacy.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Correctness gives you only the stuff that's new, modern, and good.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Yeah, and that makes sense. I can see an engine.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   That is interesting.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   That's a good hot take.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   But he says, "Backwards compatibility keeps systems alive and relevant for decades."
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   One of the best lines in this.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   The first system I'll pick as an example of this is the oldest.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   EMAX, which he says, and this is the greatest line ever.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Sort of a hybrid between Windows Notepad, a monolithic kernel operating system,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   and the International Space Station.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   (laughter)
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   In a nutshell, EMAX is a platform written in 1976 for writing software to make you more productive
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   masquerading as a text editor.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   But he says he writes a lot of extensions, as many people do, for EMAX.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   But more importantly, no extension he's ever written since 1976 doesn't work.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   I'm still using software I wrote for EMAX back in 1995.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I'm sure there's still people using software they wrote for EMAX from the mid-80s.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Every once in a while it might require a minor tweak.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   It's really rare.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And actually I'll add to that.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   That's one of the reasons I love the Lisp programming language.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   A program you wrote for Lisp in the 70s would still run today.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   It just would.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Whereas in the Google world, deprecation means we're breaking our commitments to you.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   It really does.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   That's what it ultimately means.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   It means they're going to force you, you, to do some work, possibly a large amount of rework
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   on a regular basis as a punishment for doing what they told you to do originally.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   As a punishment for listening to their glossy marketing on their website, better software,
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   faster, you do everything they tell you to do, and you launch your application or service
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   and then bang a year or two later, it breaks.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   This is Google across the board.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Like Jeff and I will both tell you that being a paying Google G Suite's customer is like
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   punishment.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   No one should do it.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Yeah, they just don't care about the user.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   That's really the end of, I mean, anyway.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Yaggy says this is hurting them far more than they realize and will continue to hurt them
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   for years to come because it's not part of their DNA to care about customers.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   No.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Solid data.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   But could this be considered Google trying to force the users to, air quotes, evolve?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Yeah, but, well, and the reason it hurts them on cloud more than anywhere else is because
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   customers are developers who develop for Google Compute Cloud and other.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Yeah, I think I cut a difference.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   There's a difference between the consistency of developers and the consistency of searchers.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   I think Google does care deeply about customers when they're non-tech people trying to use
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   services.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Okay.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   But people will have to integrate with Google on a technical level.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Google says do it our way because we're smarter than you are.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   And there are parts of Google that do care.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   For instance, he uses as an example Android.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   He says, "Android folks take backwards compatibility to almost unimaginable extremes."
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   True.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Which piles on massive amounts of legacy technical debt in their systems and tool chains.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Oh boy, you should see some of the crazy stuff they have to do in their build system all
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   in the name of compatibility.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   For this, I award Android the coveted You're Not Google award.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   You really don't want to be Google.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I wish I could be retired like that.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   That'd be nice.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I know.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Be cranky over the screw wall.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I'm going to say what I want to say.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I'm red should I tell you.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   He brought up one thing that I've --
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I'm sorry, Jeff.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Go ahead.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Jeff's already that way.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I know.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   That's what I --
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Oh, you --
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Stacey, Stacey, you just wait.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   It's going to get worse when he doesn't care.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   When I'm that crumpy old man, oh, you just wait.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I can't wait.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   As an example, he brings up an example that's a pet peeve of mine.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Instant apps.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Remember that?
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Yes.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Instant apps was a pretty dumb idea, though.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   You know why?
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Because it required you to rewrite and re-architect your application.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   As if people are just going to up and rewrite 2 million apps.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   I'm guessing Instant Apps wasn't an Android idea.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   It was a Googlers idea.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   And, of course, Android apps -- Instant Apps is gone.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   So if you did all that work --
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Sorry.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Sorry.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Sorry.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   No payoff for it.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Sorry.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Google's pride in their software engineering hygiene is what gets them into trouble.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   They don't like it when there are lots of different ways to do the same thing with older, less desirable ways sitting alongside newer, fancier ways.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   So they just kill it.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   I think this is really a well-written piece.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   It's on Medium.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Steve, what I'm probably saying is the name wrong.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   Y-E-G-G-E.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   When he mentions the hygiene aspect of it, is he saying that they're too efficient with their hygienic code or not?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Yes.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   So what you do -- so if programmers -- so you've got a code base.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   And you go, "You know, we didn't do that the right way.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   So you take it out, you fix it, you write it, this beautiful, it's clean, it's elegant code.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Hygien."
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   But then, as a result, you broke everything that was written prior that depended on those things that you took out and fixed.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And there are lots of examples in the technology world of this Python 3.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   It broke everything in Python 2.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Pearl 6 ended up having to be renamed because it didn't work with any -- it wasn't really Pearl.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Because it wasn't Pearl anymore.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   So there are examples of this.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   Engineers -- you know, being engineers, if there's nobody saying, "This is the problem."
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   You know, what it takes is a marketing team and people -- and normally I don't like the input of marketing team.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I'm more on the engineer side saying, "No, you can't deprecate.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   You can't take that out.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   But the customers depend on that." And engineers, like Guido Von Rossum of Python and Larry Wall of Pearl, say, "I can do anything I want.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   There's no marketing team.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   I'm going to make it better."
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   And meanwhile, everybody else is --
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   You know, but I still think there's some sort of a fine line between deprecating old code versus improving old code.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   That's why you have updates, right?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   No, no. Improving old codes is a good thing.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   What you don't want to do is take out the old code or break it.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   So what you can do is -- and this is, again, an anaphometit to engineers who don't like five ways to do something, four of which are old-fashioned and outmoded.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   He uses an example Java.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   He says, "You know, Java, they don't -- they'll deprecate something.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   They'll say, "Don't use this method.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   But they won't take it out."
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   So all the programs that used it still work.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   They just don't work maybe as elegantly and as beautifully as newer programs that use the new methods.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   But what you don't want to do is just break everything.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Yeah, it just does.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   It'll cut you more of a memory hog or something.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Right.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   So, again, Jeff?
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   How much do you give up that?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I mean, other features you just can't do as a result.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   So he talks about Apple.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   He says, "Apple, at best, gets a C minus because they break stuff all the time for no good reason."
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   [laughter]
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   But Apple, as a result, though, is famously -- in fact, they're about to do it again by leaving Intel and dust and moving to their own designed chips.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   That will inevitably break a lot of stuff.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   And the newest Apple version of Mac OS Catalina, they refuse to run 32-bit apps.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Microsoft will never stop running 32-bit apps.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And it's a security problem for Microsoft because Windows -- when 32 is kind of -- oh, gosh, there's all sorts of messy stuff in there.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Oh, it's actually really more than just the Google problem.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   This is a problem in the tech industry in general.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   That's very -- I thought it was a good piece, but maybe --
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Well, it's fun because I agree.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Google, for their customer-facing products and services, they've always been ruthless in shutting down any offering that doesn't meet their money bar even if it has millions of users.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   We know that.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   And that's not the engineers talking.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Correctly.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Well, it's not just the engineers.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   That's why when he's talking about cloud, he's talking about the engineers because they're the Google Cloud platform.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   He says, "They're not committed to supporting anything. It's well known that they refuse to host any third-party software until after Amazon's already done that and built a successful business around it, at which point their customers hold them at gunpoint."
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   [laughter]
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   The lack of support culture combined with the "Let's Break It" and the name of making a prettier, deprecation treadmill is alienating their developers.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   And it's why the Google Cloud platform is now third after AWS and Azure, and he says, "Failing fast."
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Really? Is that true?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Well, at some point, the poop's going to hit the fan, right?
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   And somebody higher up is going to say, "You know what this really is hurting us from a bottom-line standpoint?"
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   No.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Google's not structured?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   No, no, that's exactly what it's.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Well, I wonder if Thomas Curiein will come in and do that.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Who's that?
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   He's their cloud GCP guy, the guy they pulled over from Oracle, who's been making some really severe changes.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   I think Oracle's a good example of the opposite, isn't it?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Well, that's what I'm saying. I'm saying that Google brought him in because they were terror. GCP is a joke in the enterprise.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Right. For this very reason.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   Yeah. So I actually think that that may be one of the things he's doing.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   He's also really focusing less on engineering and more on monetization in a way that is challenging to the traditional Google ethos
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   when we think about how they're introducing and charging for products.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   So I actually think there may be some changes happening here.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Right.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Interesting.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   At least on the enterprise side.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   For the good or the bad?
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   It depends. I think probably for the good of Google's bottom line and possibly for some users.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   I mean, I do think there will be part of the fun of Google is they invent really cool random stuff.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   And that's harder to do in an environment when you're incentivized less towards cool technology and more towards maintaining and supporting technology.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Those are two very different mindsets.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   And we don't see a lot of companies get it right in terms of maintainers versus inventors. Right.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Let's take a little break. When we come back, the massive battle that's going on right now.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   No, I'm not talking about Epic versus Apple. No, I'm not talking about Trump versus TikTok.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   We've covered those. We're sick of that.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   I'm talking about Google versus Australia.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Oh boy.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   You're going to do your accent when we come back?
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   I can't. I wish I could do a good.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   I can do Australian for a little bit and then it fades into something else.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Then it turns into scotch.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Everything turns into Yish.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Yeah, it all goes bad. It all goes to go south.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I'm like Google Cloud. I can't follow the same path for very long.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I have to do something else.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Our show today brought to you by Roman. This is for guys.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   This is for guys and for the people who love them.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   It's a digital health clinic for men because guys face it. We need it.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   Here's an example.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Roman does a lot of different stuff. Hair, skin, daily health.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   They've got supplements, a lot of things.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   But there's one area where guys just, you know, it's just you just suffer in silence.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   And it's erectile dysfunction. And anyone who suffers from erectile dysfunction knows you does.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   It's not something you bring up.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   It's not something you can hide.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   Your spouse knows.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   But you're not going to go to the doctor and say, "Hey Doc, I got a problem."
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   But you should because first of all, it's easily fixed.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Second of all, it can always be a sign of an underlying condition.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   You need to check with a doctor about it.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Fortunately, there is a simple convenient solution to get the treatment you need without leaving the couch.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   It's Roman.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Roman makes it convenient to get the treatment you need.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Grab your phone or computer. Go to getromen.com/twig.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Complete a free online visit.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   You'll hear back from a US licensed physician within 24 hours.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And this is not some pro forma script writing doctor.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   This doctor is really going to talk to you.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   This is telemedicine.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And if the doctor decides the treatment is right for you, your medication can be shipped to you.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   The medication can be shipped to you with free two day shipping.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   And a nice unmarked packaging too.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   So the neighbors are going, "Oh, what's going on over there?"
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   You get free unlimited follow-ups with your doctor.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Any time you have questions or you want to adjust your treatment plan with Roman,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   there are no commitments you can cancel anytime.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   I gave short shrift to that.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   I love this.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Free unlimited follow-ups with your doctor anytime, just for questions if you want.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Or to adjust your treatment planter to give the doctor an update.

[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   Thank you Roman.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Open ladder to all Australians.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   So you better explain this because this is right up your alley, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   This is like light, sung, zik, shrek, shrek, shrek, shrek.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   It's in Australia.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   It's like shrek, shrek, shrek, man.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   That's pretty good.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   It's the news media bargaining code, which is not yet law, but proposed.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   This is what Google says in their open letter.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   It will hurt how Australians use Google search in YouTube.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   The way Aussie search every day on Google is at risk from new regulation.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   The law would force us to give unfair advantage to one group of businesses, news media, over everyone else who has a website, YouTube channel or small business.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   News media businesses alone would be given information that would help them artificially inflate their ranking over everyone else, even if someone else should provide a better result.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   Yep.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   The proposed changes are not fair, says Google, and they mean Google search results in YouTube will be worse for you.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Under this law, Google has to tell news media how they can gain access to data about your use, your use of our products.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   There's no way of knowing if any data handed over would be protected or how it might be used by news media.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   We deeply believe in the importance of news to society.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   We partner closely with Australian news media.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   We already pay them millions of dollars and send them billions of free clicks every year.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   We've offered to pay more to license content, but rather than encouraging these types of partnerships, the law is set up to give big media companies special and treatment and to encourage them to make enormous and unreasonable demands that would put our free services at risk.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   The law wouldn't just--
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   That's a threat.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Oh, that would put our free services--
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   Free services with that risk.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Google start charging or would Google pull out?
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   No, that's-- well, one report is that they would start charging Australians for services.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   That's one report.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Or in Spain, they pulled out Google News.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   They pulled out.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   They can do either.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Yep.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   So here's the response from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   I can't do it.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   I shouldn't do it.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   It's bad and I apologize.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   It's not quite the ACC I'm used to, but close.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   A-s-a-s-a.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   An open letter published-- what is ACC Stanford in your world?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Atlantic Coast Conference.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Of course.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   All of the defending Atlantic Coast Conference champion Clemson Tigers.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I had to give him an opportunity to do that, folks.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   You understand.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   It's in his contract, I know.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   Why?
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   What does ACC stand for, Matt?
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   An open letter published by Google--
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   He's the only real man here about this.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Yes.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   Oh, it's football.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   I understand that.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Hand egg, we call it.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   The open letter published by Google today contains misinformation about the draft news media bargaining code, which the ACCC would like to address Google.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Will not be required.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Oh, he says, what-- what-- what--
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Oh.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   You will be required to charge Australians for use of its free services, like Search and YouTube,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   unless you choose to do so.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   Google will not be required to share any additional data with Australian news businesses unless it chooses to do so.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   The draft code will allow Australian news to negotiate for fair payments for their journalists' work that's included in Google services.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   It snippets all over again.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   Yes.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   Oh, it is.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   It's-- it is.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   It's already ready.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   It is.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   The light structure.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   So you should correct.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   So the--
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   You can do that to reggae if you like folks.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   The point that bothers publishers is that little paragraph that's under the news search results that is from the article.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And their concern is that you read that, you got the answer, you got the answer you need.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   In fact, a lot of people say this.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   I get the answer I need from Google.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   I don't need to click that link.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I don't-- Google's basically stealing traffic.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   They're not really saying that.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   They're what they're really saying is we're trying to find an excuse to try to force Google to pay us.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Is it not fair, though, to say that Google might be stealing some traffic with the snippets?
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   OK.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   That's a case of proving a negative.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   That presumes that everyone was going to go to every article that crossed their paths.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Had they not seen the Google snippet?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   In fact, it's the opposite.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   With the snippet-- what I found on the research that I did long ago, but the longer the snippet,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   the more traffic that went.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Well, you've got a better sample of the article, and you had more cause to want to go actually read the article.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   So the short snippets are-- it's proving a negative saying that had they not seen the snippet,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   they would have gone to that article?
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   No.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   There's no way it didn't say that.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   And are there some pieces of information I get on Google?
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Sure.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   What's the Dow Jones?
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   I don't need to go to the Wall Street Journal if I don't know what the Dow Jones average is right now.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   No.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   And that's fine.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   And it's public information.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   And it's Google's right to do that.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   And yes, the Wall Street Journal might lose some clicks there, but they're dumb clicks.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   They're commodity clicks.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   So I'm looking at--
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   I didn't work.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Sorry.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   No, you go ahead.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   I never worked for the Wall Street Journal or anything like that, but when you look at content management systems,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   there's usually some type of configuration as far as how your slugs and things like that will display in search, right?
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Bingo, regardless of the content management control, the snippet you put in.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Right.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   When I put a medium post up, it says change your--
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   That's become common.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   So Google's only-- does Google always honor that?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   Well, I think in the case of news, they do.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   So I'm looking at-- I actually don't see any snippets here on Google's news.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   So is it only on Google's search, not Google News, that these snippets appear?
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Well, if I go to Google and search for Google, which Google will think I'm very stupid to do that.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   I don't think we look at that.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   I just see it.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Let me-- OK, here's an example.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   Here's an example.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   I searched for California fires and then clicked the News tab.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   And here I'm seeing a paragraph, California fires live update.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   Fast moving fires, this is the snippet, are spreading across California.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   So now click on that.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   In the north, wind whipped flames force people to fleet-- nice alliteration.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   In the north, wind whipped-- wind whipped flames forced people to flee their homes near
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   Fakavil.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Fakavil.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Fakavil.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   So now you're saying I should click-- by the way--
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Click on that.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   That didn't mean I didn't want to read that story.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   That was just more information about what that story covers.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   It's Fakavondo.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   All right, so I don't think that would hurt the click.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   It was, in fact, this--
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   It was, in fact, the subhead.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Yep.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   But go to another one.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Let's try this.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   And again, that just sounds like perfectly crafting the content management part of it.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Now here's one with ellipsis, which means it's right not have been intentional.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   This is CNN's story.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Wildfires raced toward populated areas of Northern California's wine country.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   That's where we're going tonight.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   Early today, forcing some residents to evacuate.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Follow here for dot dot dot.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Do you think they did that on purpose?
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   That might be intentional because they want you to finish reading the sentence.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Yes.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   They said follow here for.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   And then there's some people that would say that was enough for me to read in this case.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Oh, look.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.240]   Here's that snippet.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   That's interesting.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.000]   But follow here for is new.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   That's new.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   So I think--
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Well, that ended.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   That was the content management system.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And then they added better--
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Yes.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   That's quite--
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   Better would be something like, and you won't believe what happened next.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Of course.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   I'm just saying.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   It's only on Facebook.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   So yeah, none of these snippets give me enough information to say, oh, good.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   Exactly.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   I don't have to say it.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   So they don't care about the snippet.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   They want an excuse to say, Google, you took our money as if God gave them that money.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   This entire thing, this entire, entire thing is Rupert Murdoch.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   And that's all you need to know, folks, because that's the man who's ruined democracy in the
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   English-speaking world.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   But I'll leave that aside.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   The equivalent in Germany is a company called Axel Springer, headed by a man named Matthias
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Difne.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And in Germany, they started the fight that led to the Lijstungschutzricht.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Don't you love this?
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And Murdoch has been his ally from the beginning going after Google.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   And the funny thing is that Murdoch and Springer both tweak Google by making friends with Facebook
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   and Zuckerberg.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   And Zuckerberg, they have wrapped around their little fingers.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   So Zuckerberg is indeed paying for content.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   So what's happened now is Google gets stuck in a bad position.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   So Google, by all reports, is going to pay publishers for content starting in Germany,
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   because that's the squeakiest wheels.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   So Murdoch is coming along in Australia and saying, pay us.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   Now pay us for what?
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   For the privilege of linking to you?
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   For sending you traffic?
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   For sending you customers?
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   For sending you people?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   No.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   You owe us, Rupert.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   You owe us, Rupert.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   But no, Google was foolish in the beginning by not setting that precedent.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   And by saying, you can't pay-- and the reason why they were not foolish is wrong.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Google said you can't pay for search presence.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   So if Google had charged people, they would have been selling search presence.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   And Google made an ethical decision not to do that.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Unlike early Yahoo, which did do that in the original model, Google said no.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   That would be a bad service to the public.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   That would be unethical of us.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   We are not going to charge for that.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   So the economics became all skewed.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   And even though Google was sending value to the publishers, the publishers were saying,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   you stole the soul when you took my picture.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Oh.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Oh.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Here's-- by the way, the ACCCCC's responses actually a little disingenuous, because it isn't completely
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   up to Google what happens here.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Here's the draft code, the negotiation process.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   One, news business notifies a digital platform.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   By the way, that is only Google and Facebook initially, that they want to negotiate under
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   the code.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   And let me cut off and news businesses of only a certain large size.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   Not a-- if I'm--
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   If I'm-- if I'm-- no, no, no, no, no.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   If I'm a small startup, I'm not in this game.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Only large news services.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Step two, negotiation and mediation takes place for up to three months.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Google says, "New news."
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Google says, "No."
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   No.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   If no agreement can be reached on payment for content, the news business may choose to proceed
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   to binding final offer arbitration, in which each party lodges just one offer with the arbitrator.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   And then the arbitrator chooses one of the offers.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   So it is an up to-- it is-- it's a lie.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   It's a-- it's a blatant lie when it says--
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   It's an absolute lie.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Google doesn't have to pay.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Well, and the other issue here is-- this is not going to sound like Benedict Evans here
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   in this argument, but why does Google owe the news business money, right?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Why doesn't Google owe-- why doesn't Wikipedia owe encyclopedia's money?
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Why doesn't Amazon owe Walmart and why doesn't Walmart owe A&P and why doesn't A&P own Jones's corner grocery?
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   Right.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Right.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   It's almost asking for capitalistic reparations or disruption.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   And even if that were-- you can't even say that reparations are owed because as we just demonstrated,
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   the links don't take traffic from you and it's everybody knows that the search links drive a lot of traffic to you,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   even if a little bit of the snippets cut traffic, you're still getting a net--
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   I think you must be getting a net gain of traffic.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   We know that because in Spain when Google said, "Fine, we won't drive any search traffic to you,"
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   the Spanish publishers waved the white flag pretty quickly.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   Well, again, you still have control.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Go ahead.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   Sorry, Stacy.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   What is the value of Google's search if they can't pull quality and reputable answers for those snippets?
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   Well, I guess the publisher might say, "Well, I don't publish a snippet, just the headline."
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   Well, I'm just asking.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   I mean, like, if Google doesn't have the ability to search through, like, if they did--
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   I don't know why they would do this, but they didn't allow the robot crawlers onto their sites.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Google then becomes less valuable because you don't have easily--
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Incredible or easily verifiably, like, good information to answer your search entries.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And the newspaper gets a lot less traffic presumably, right?
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   I'm just saying that this conversation seems to be glossing over the fact that
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   newspapers do provide an add credibility to a Google search result.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Google gets value.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   That gives Google value and keeps people turning to their search.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   If I, as a publisher, say, "Hey, you know, you're kind of burnishing your credibility with my content,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   what's that worth to you?"
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   I don't think that's a wrong conversation to start.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   I don't know if legislation's going to do it.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Yeah, we're trying to get them before, but then I want to respond to that, Stacy.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   No, go ahead.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   There you go.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   No, I was just saying that you still, as a content creator, at least from my perspective,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   if you have some control over how those search results can be--
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   You could block a blade.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   Just like--
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Just like they said, you could use robots.txt and say, "Don't index me."
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   Bye-bye.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   So few things.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Not that hard.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   It doesn't take that much time, no.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   No, no.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   No, no.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Clearly, they go to the effort to do the SEO.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   They do all this.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Stacy, a few responses to what you just said.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   One, the Stacy, then two to you, Leo.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Stacy, on that point, perhaps, but what Google will point out is that 97% of searches have no news on.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   The news content that ends up on search result pages is a tiny proportion.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   We're going to see it more because we're weird people, but it's tiny.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   So Wikipedia gives a lot more value to Google for credibility than the news industry, I would argue, because it appears in a lot more places.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   The Spain did not waive the white flag.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   Spain set up the law such that there was no choice.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And Google said, "Okay, if you're going to make us pay, we're leaving."
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And they closed Google News in Spain.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   In Germany, there was some--
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   Is this so close?
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   It's still closed.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   Oh, oh, oh, I think that's fine.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   And the publishers lost.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   Publishers lost a lot of traffic.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   In Germany, under the-- I know you want me to say it.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Le Stungschutzrecht.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   There was flexibility in the law.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   So, Sprager, for the first-- I think it was 15 days or there about two weeks, said, "No, you can't run our snippets.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   You must pay us."
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   And Google said, "No."
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   And Sprager put up the white flag.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   Sprager said, "Okay, yeah, we're losing too much.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   It's fine."
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   So, there was a new law in Europe, the copyright directive in Europe, Articles 15 and 17, is the Le Stungschutzrecht for all of the EU.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   And then each country is going to write their own version of it.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   France wrote its version saying, "Google, you must pay us."
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   And Google told France, "How do you say F off in French?"
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Oh, I know.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   You do?
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   You do?
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   I know how to say it.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   Go F yourself.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Is that close enough?
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Yes, say it.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   Really?
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Are we allowed?
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   [BEEP]
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   Okay.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   We're going to have to case that.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Okay, see, I--
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   It sounded lovely.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   I think that's a wonderful thing.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   I'll take it.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Whatever it is.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Carsten, show title.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   So, that's actually the experiment in Germany, the actual experiment.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   Do publishers gain more than they lose from Google?
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   And the proponent of the law, both like--
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Hey, what?
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.680]   Right, so that's why they try to then go to the next level of the EU to try to force Google
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.400]   for the whole of Europe, and Google's going to just say no everywhere.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:42.480]   So, the bad thing that could happen here is that Google could kill Google News and say
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.480]   screw it.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.480]   Not worth it.
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.480]   Tiny portion of our search.
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:52.360]   Most people are looking for mixtures to buy and Stacey light bulbs to put in their homes.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.360]   And that will occur up.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.360]   They should go to my news site.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.360]   That's the thing.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:01.360]   Yes, then you should be the person.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.560]   So, I don't know who Alan Gibson is when he's at home.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:09.880]   Landshark.io, I think he's a venture capitalist.
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:15.360]   And I just bring this up because he actually said something a little light bulb went on
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.360]   for me.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:22.360]   He's talking about how not only is the browser war over the internet war is over and Google
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.360]   won.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:29.720]   It is the Google web or web by Google trademark.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:34.320]   And you can read the various details, some of which I agree with and some of which I
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:35.400]   don't.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.760]   But he does make an interesting point.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:42.280]   He says two deficiencies have determined the course the web has taken.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.800]   One is lack of native payments.
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.000]   I disagree with him on that.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.920]   So, I won't bring that one up.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:50.520]   He says we wouldn't have to have all this advertising if we just figured out a way to
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.360]   micro payments.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:54.560]   That's not the case.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.200]   Don't get me started.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.880]   No, you don't have to get upset about that.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.880]   It's just blatantly not.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.720]   It's obviously not the case because we've had ad supported media for as long as we've
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.120]   had media.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.720]   That's what newspapers were created to do initially.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.320]   So it's clearly not the case.
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:16.080]   It's kind of retroactive history to say, oh, if we only had a way to pay blogs, you wouldn't
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:17.080]   have had an ad.
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:18.080]   No, no.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:22.800]   Since 1776, it's just the way it is.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.960]   And I personally, and I thought it was thinking about this, would I, could I convert Twit into
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.600]   some sort of micro payment system?
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   Nobody would do it.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:34.800]   No, without ads, we just wouldn't exist.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   You're bringing your pay restriction up.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.240]   Yeah, it's too much friction.
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.720]   But his interesting first point is lack of native search.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:44.080]   And I never really thought about this.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:52.000]   He says, had we designed the web in the early days for search, lacking native distributed
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.080]   search allowed Google to grab a monopoly position as the entry point of the web.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:01.200]   The web's original architects were off base on hyperlinks.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:06.120]   It turns out people just want to go right to the answer they're looking for.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:11.880]   And I think that's a really interesting, I mean, it's too late now, but it is an interesting
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:12.880]   point.
[00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.560]   It's not a problem that didn't have to exist.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:22.360]   Had search been built in to early web protocols, we wouldn't need a gatekeeper.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:26.360]   The web would just do it itself, a distributed search.
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.360]   I wish we had.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.360]   Well, well, okay.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.360]   It's interesting.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.560]   But Google adds a lot of value to that search.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:40.580]   Google's the amount, you know, the army of Matt Cutzes who are taking out spam and dealing
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:45.760]   with the bad guys and trying to come up with ever better search and ever better page rank
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.760]   and ever better this and ever better that.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.280]   It's not a commodity.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:50.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:55.120]   Perhaps, although Doran in our chat room says they invented the phone network without a
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.000]   phone book.
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.300]   You could, that's an analogy.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:02.660]   We had a phone network and they realized, oh, you need a phone book to find people on
[00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.080]   the phone network.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:09.000]   And so they created the phone book and yes, it's conceivable you could have a commercial entity
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.980]   that makes a better phone book.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:16.100]   There's certainly room for personalized phone books and so forth.
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:21.260]   But honestly, if you designed the web with at least kind of minimal phone book capability,
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:23.420]   maybe Google, I mean, there would probably be a business.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.140]   Yeah, you know, the web was done with Alta Vista, right.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.140]   It was just it was done.
[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.140]   It was done.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.720]   I think it's a really good argument.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.700]   I think it's a very good argument.
[00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.100]   Oh, I think it's a very good argument.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.580]   That's a ridiculous argument.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:35.580]   Not at all.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:40.020]   But that, you know, of course, Google filled that void.
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.960]   But the problem is now a private company controls the web.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.640]   I mean, really it does.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.760]   For now, folks, for now, but it's still a concern.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:52.320]   If you're not on Google, Google delists you, you don't exist.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.080]   It doesn't matter if you have a website, if no one can find it.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.080]   It's irrelevant.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.720]   Well, that leads to something interesting I found.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.920]   I put it under Facebook.
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:06.220]   An academic paper, a policy review paper was done on what if Facebook goes down, what if
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:07.220]   it dies?
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:08.700]   Or somewhere wishing for?
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.700]   Oh, I wish.
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:10.700]   I don't think you were going to say that.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.700]   Okay.
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.860]   So so the paper is very interesting.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.780]   It says there are a lot of communities that are I mean, you basically this is a bad thing,
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.540]   but where we are, I'll give you one community dependent on Facebook.
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.540]   QAnon.
[00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:22.060]   Wouldn't exist without more.
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.060]   Not anymore.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.060]   Did they delist them?
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.060]   Yep, they did.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.060]   Antifa.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:27.060]   I added it to the one down.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.060]   And you went on and militant.
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.060]   Militants.
[00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:31.060]   Militants.
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:32.060]   Yeah.
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:38.480]   So Facebook is in large parts of the world become the de facto platform for communication
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.980]   and social interaction.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.600]   If you don't find problems with their opening sense.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.160]   Oh, this is a negative world you want to be against.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.880]   This is a negative Facebook paper.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.880]   Oh, okay.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.320]   De facto is doing a lot of work there.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:55.160]   Well, de facto always does a lot of work though, doesn't it?
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.960]   Well, since Daisy.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:02.860]   The closure of an online social network would not be unprecedented.
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:05.920]   Friendster, Yik Yak, Google+, and Yahoo!
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:09.920]   Group's leap to mind.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.720]   So what do they conclude?
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:17.200]   Who would suffer if for some reason Facebook said, yeah, we're done.
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.200]   That's too much work.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.200]   Groups.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:25.940]   Wouldn't, I mean, we used to have Google groups and Yahoo!
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:32.260]   Group's communities that connect only now, that chose this as their platform.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:35.700]   When my young daughter was an American girl fan and they had the American Girl Chat, that's
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:39.100]   how she had friends, American Girl killed it, and then suddenly her friends were gone.
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.100]   Right.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:43.660]   So I wrote at the time there's a responsibility when you create something for a community.
[00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:48.220]   You're creating, this is the point of the paper, an ethical obligation.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:52.160]   And it's not so easy to just say whether it's Facebook turning it off or government
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:56.080]   turning it off, what hell have you turned off?
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:00.640]   It's the same as Tim Wu had a column in the time of the day that drove me nutty.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:01.640]   Oh, man.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.640]   Citing with Trump's...
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.640]   I liked Tim Wu.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.440]   I was shocked by that.
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.440]   Because you're shutting it off, Sarah.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:11.600]   What he said was, I know I'm dancing around five stories in the rundown driving Carson
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.760]   crazy, but that's what I do for a living.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:18.920]   He's citing with Trump, he's agreeing with Trump on TikTok.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.120]   And the problem is you're not cutting off TikTok, you're cutting off Sarah Cooper.
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.120]   Right.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:33.160]   He says, it's foolish of us to allow TikTok to exist when China is shutting down Facebook
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:37.800]   and Twitter, we should be doing the same back.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:48.480]   He mentions people like me who think that the open web is something to be promoted and
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:55.840]   honored and that in fact we can unilaterally do that just as we almost unilaterally do
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:59.480]   it with democracy.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:08.120]   He says the asymmetry between China, the country's extensive blocking censorship and surveillance
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:13.200]   and the way US treats it should no longer be tolerated.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:18.440]   The privilege of full internet access, the open internet should be extended only to companies
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.840]   from countries that respect that openness themselves.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.640]   Like America, killing TikTok?
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:31.960]   Well, yeah, I think that I would stand on the side that says, no, that's the whole point
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:37.240]   is that we have to stand up for an open internet and that it's not justified to do what they
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.240]   do.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.240]   Not do what they do.
[00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:46.560]   I would just leak into other aspects of our society for us like the industrial side of
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.560]   things.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:50.000]   Well, yes, there's consequences so much.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:56.640]   And Tim does point out that the President Trump is not perhaps the best bearer of this
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.640]   message.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:58.680]   In some shock.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:03.840]   Some think that it's a tragic mistake, who writes, by the way, the headline of the article
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.240]   is, it's an opinion piece in the New York Times today.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:08.640]   But TikTok ban is overdue.
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:11.880]   Some think that it's a tragic mistake for the United States to violate the principles
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:14.680]   of internet openness that were pioneered in this country.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:19.520]   But there is also such a thing as being a sucker if China refuses to follow the rules
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.200]   of the open internet.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.120]   Why continue to give it access to internet markets around the world?
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.280]   Well because we believe in open internet.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.440]   By the way, I got no problem.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.440]   Yeah, I got no problem.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.560]   You're a percent of the same thing about us.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:36.520]   I have no problem with the Department of Defense banning it from phones and military personnel.
[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:40.040]   I have no problem with the Commerce Department and the government saying you can't have it.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:45.720]   I have no problems with private enterprise like Wells Fargo Bank saying no TikTok on your
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.880]   company phone.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:53.240]   And I also have no problem with individual users like me deleting TikTok because I did
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:58.040]   do it after Amy Webb convinced me of the...
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.320]   Well, last week you were saying it was fine.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   I know.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.680]   I'm still saying it's fine.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:04.360]   You are just so fickle.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:05.880]   I'm still saying it's fine.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:07.440]   I would not want to ban it.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:13.280]   I'm saying as an individual, her point was by dance, we think of it as a social media
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.520]   company, the owner of TikTok.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.240]   They're actually an AI company.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:23.600]   They were instrumental in China's social credit score system.
[00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.760]   And that in fact, I'm actually not worried about the privacy invasion of TikTok.
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:33.920]   I think it's legitimate to worry about how TikTok could be weaponized as a propaganda
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:34.920]   tool.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:39.840]   We already know that they banned Uighurs and Hong Kong and so forth from TikTok.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:43.240]   So I choose as an individual, I don't think there's anything wrong with an individual
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.960]   to choose not to have TikTok on their device.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.400]   But I would never support a nationwide ban against TikTok.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.720]   The same thing with Facebook.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.600]   I don't have Facebook on my phone.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:56.760]   I would never have any Facebook app on my phone, but it should not be banned.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.080]   We would all agree on that.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:04.560]   I haven't either and I really don't care if those get banned.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:08.680]   I get why people would be upset, but it doesn't really move the needle from me one way or the
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.680]   other.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.480]   Well, I think we need to stand up.
[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:21.080]   I don't think government, our government, at least as constructed in favor of open and
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:24.120]   free speech should be doing that kind of thing.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:28.520]   I don't have any problem with private individuals or institutions that want to do it, but not
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.520]   our government.
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.920]   I first shall make no law respecting an established religion or prohibiting the free expression
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:38.280]   thereof or bridging the freedom of a speech or the press or of the right to people peaceably
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:42.920]   to assemble, which is what they do on TikTok and to petition the government for a redress
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.280]   of grievances, which is what they do on Twitter and Facebook.
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:50.760]   So I think it's so what has happened now is this is now a First Amendment issue.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:57.160]   And but does the First Amendment protect the Chinese government or Chinese government?
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.160]   Well, Chinese government.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:02.160]   The Cooper, if she's using it to speak, the Cooper is printing press is TikTok.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.160]   That's a good point.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:05.440]   This is a whole new area of law that I don't see people go for.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:10.480]   Now, I was on with two people I respect on a podcast, but we was going, they said they
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.480]   thought it was a First Amendment issue.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.880]   That's an interesting way to look at.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:25.440]   So let me pull a disrada in 1474 petition the doge of Venice to get rid of to stop the
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:30.680]   printers because the printers were foreign Germans coming in and stealing his work as
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:37.760]   a scribe and polluting the minds of children and getting drunk on their money and stop it.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.320]   He said, stop it.
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:44.960]   These foreigners are doing terrible things here in Italy.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:45.960]   That was a downer.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.960]   Sorry.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:52.200]   I was like, and one more time.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:54.400]   So what's going on with foreigners in Italy?
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:58.360]   This is I need to know.
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.160]   It's a parallel.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:05.120]   This is why we have a First Amendment to protect against that kind of government action.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.720]   Now Larry Allison didn't do it.
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.280]   Now Larry Allison in Oracle.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.280]   Oh, I ticked.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.280]   Well, it's okay.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:11.440]   He's going to rule it in anyway.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.440]   Jesus.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:14.440]   What is it?
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:17.280]   Help me understand the rash.
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.280]   I saw that.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.400]   I've covered Oracle.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:25.240]   I'm I think the president asked him to because he's I was going to say is this just like weird
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.240]   crony as well.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.240]   Yeah, I think that's what it is.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.240]   Yeah, it is.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.800]   Trump Trump already endorsed that, which is none of his damn business, but he endorsed
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.600]   Ellison's purchase.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:39.800]   It be like the government's shutting down comic books, which it wanted to, by the way.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:42.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:47.320]   And there's a great comic book, confidential, great documentary about about that era.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:49.800]   They even show Al Gaines, the founder of Mad Magazine.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:55.280]   But before that he did, you know, horror magazines, horror comics and testifying in
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:01.080]   front of Congress because Congress was very close, I think, to shutting down comic books
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.800]   in the 50s and the comic book.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:03.800]   I did not know that.
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.720]   Comic book in history because it was think of the kids.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:10.480]   The comic book in history prevented it by self regulating.
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:15.280]   They created the comic book code, which ruined comic books for about 10 years.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.520]   But it did create Mad Magazine.
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:18.720]   So that's the good that's the good thing.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:23.360]   So what do I wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what did the comic book code decree?
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.300]   Oh, you couldn't do anything.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:31.000]   So Gaines tells the story in comic book, confidential again, great documentary about one of the
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:37.920]   comic books where the hero had beads of sweat and the comic book code sensor said, can we,
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.160]   can we get take the sweat off his?
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:41.520]   Off his brow.
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:47.160]   It was to eliminate, I could read you the comic book code, but it had the effect of basically
[00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:53.400]   bowed, lorizing comic books so that it'd be safe for kids.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.400]   Wow.
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:57.840]   But a complete lack of interest.
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:03.440]   So the code was voluntary, but everybody was expected to adhere to it.
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:09.120]   You would submit the comic to the CCA for screening.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.520]   So it was essentially a censorship operation.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.160]   It lasted a good long time.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.400]   Let me see if I can find it prohibited the presentation of policemen, judges, government
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:23.920]   officials and respected institutions in such a way as to create disrespect for established
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.200]   authority.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:29.440]   In every instance, good should well, this is no state of masochism.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.440]   That's for sure.
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:36.040]   And then every instance, good should triumph over evil, discouraged, incouraged instances
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:40.720]   of law enforcement officers dying as a result of criminal activities, depictions of excessive
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:46.800]   violence were forbidden as well as lurid, unsavory, gruesome illustrations, vampires,
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:50.280]   werewolves, ghouls and zombies were banned outright.
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:53.880]   Comics could not use the word horror or terror in their titles.
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:58.800]   The word crime was subject to numerous restrictions.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:00.800]   No sexy, wanton comics, of course.
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.960]   I didn't know all of this.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:09.800]   But the love stories from the brow, I think that's lurid.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:15.320]   Love stories were enjoined to emphasize the sanctity of marriage and those portraying scenes
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:20.120]   of passion were advised to avoid stimulating lower and baser emotions.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:28.360]   And all of this was voluntary, but it was really to save comics because, you know, how
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.680]   long did it stay in force?
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:40.800]   It was created in 1954 and it looks like it took until the year 2000, that can't be right
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.960]   before nobody paid any attention to it.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.200]   I remember that logo.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.880]   No, I actually know it's true.
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:49.800]   There was like dark horse and stuff.
[00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.840]   I think that's where they, no, they were publishing.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:58.240]   Underground comics came around and in fact, this documentary interviews Robert Crumb and
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.760]   so there were these, they didn't bother, but they didn't care about distribution.
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:06.040]   Remember part of the problems with the comic book code was no news stand, no drug store
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:09.040]   would carry a comic that didn't have the seal of approval.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:13.200]   So underground comics didn't care if they were in the drug stores.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:16.320]   They were in head shops and stuff like that.
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:20.720]   So that's when it started to break is in the 60s and the 70s.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:25.600]   But boy, the coders are advised in 1971.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:32.040]   We have a, yeah, by any of our child's documentary.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:40.360]   Violence was allowed by the 1980s by the 2000s advertisers no longer made decisions to advertise
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:43.280]   based on the appearance of the stamp.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   Most new publishers to emerge during this time did not join the CCA.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.800]   So literally until 20 years ago.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.800]   Wow.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:52.800]   Wow.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:57:00.320]   In 2001, the CCA rejected an issue of the Marvel Comics series X force requiring changes to
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:01.320]   be made.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:05.840]   Instead Marvel stopped submitting its comics and implemented its own rating system.
[00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:10.720]   You mentioned there was still a room filled with old buddies looking at comic book 2001.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:11.720]   You got it.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.240]   I'm telling you comic book confidential.
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:19.160]   They have a scene where a comic book artist submits his comic and they have, it's literally
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:22.520]   an old bitty going, no, I don't know.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:26.160]   And then he goes and takes it back and takes off the beads of sweat or whatever.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.480]   And recently she goes stamps it.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.480]   It's okay.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.480]   Wow.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:31.480]   Wow.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:32.480]   It's amazing.
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:33.920]   This is called comic book confidential.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:35.920]   It's a great documentary.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.920]   I was.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:43.120]   Well, this is what the world now wants for Twitter, Facebook and TikTok.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.560]   Maybe.
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.120]   But I can understand it.
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:48.280]   Facebook, this, did you see this in the Guardian?
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:52.600]   Because funneling readers towards COVID misinformation.
[00:57:52.600 --> 00:58:01.720]   This is a study by a group called A Voz that there's that campaign group.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:02.720]   What does that mean?
[00:58:02.720 --> 00:58:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:04.720]   I don't know what it means.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:06.720]   Well, that's an issue.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:09.720]   Thank you, Jeff.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.720]   This is the report.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.360]   Let's see if they say something about a Voz.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:16.920]   The Guardian has gotten, I love the Guardian has gotten so get ready.
[00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:17.920]   Moral panic.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.120]   Oh, and I just started subscribing.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:21.560]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:22.560]   Oh, no.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:26.440]   Voz, it uncovers health misinformation spreading networks.
[00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:28.960]   That's their, that's their job, basically.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.160]   That's what they do.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:34.560]   It's a, let me see if I can find more information about them.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.560]   That's okay.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:40.680]   Is the campaigning community bringing people power politics to decision wide world to decision
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:44.000]   making worldwide?
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.480]   I don't know who they are.
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:46.480]   You're right.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.480]   I'm going to investigate them.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:51.280]   You know, the other thing we have to do is we've got to figure out this is, and there's
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:56.080]   WHO doing something I'm involved in something that is making a proposal to the WHO so full
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:59.960]   disclosure about what do we do about vaccine misinformation?
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:05.080]   And my addition to the project was saying we need to listen to neuroscience and cognitive
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:08.800]   science because why are people scared?
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:09.800]   What actually works?
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.440]   Well, this always happens.
[00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:12.800]   This always happens.
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.280]   I mean, this is universal.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:20.520]   I'm reading the great, I mentioned this before, but I'll mention again for those who I didn't
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.040]   watch Twitter on Sunday.
[00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:27.280]   Eric Larson's book, this splendid in the vial about the battle of Britain, you know, the
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.360]   German bombing of London.
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:34.000]   And one of the big challenges was suppressing rumors that spread like wildfire.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.840]   The Germans have a super bomb.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.200]   They're breaking up.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.800]   Don't go in a shelter because when it gets hit by a bomb, they just brick it up and it's
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:43.680]   now in a burial site.
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:44.680]   All sorts of stuff.
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.480]   All sorts of stuff that was wrong and it was a big problem.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.640]   And that's without Facebook.
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:54.040]   That's without, you know, they, that's without any modern means of spreading these things
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.320]   spread like wildfire.
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:59.040]   So it's a, it's a human trait, especially under stress.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.360]   And what are we under stress with COVID?
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.760]   Global health, according to a Vase, I guess we'll have to consider the source.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:08.920]   I don't know anything about them.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.320]   Global health misinformation spreading network spanning at least five countries generated
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:18.160]   an estimated 3.8 billion views on Facebook in the last year, peaking at 460 million
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:22.720]   views in April views in April.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:27.040]   Content from the top 10 websites spreading health misinformation had four times as many
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:32.120]   estimated views on Facebook as equivalent content from the World Health Organization,
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:38.040]   Centers for Disease Control and other leading health respected health institutions.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:44.600]   Maybe 16% of all misinformation analyzed had a warning label from Facebook.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:48.080]   That's part of the problem because Facebook says, no, and we don't want any COVID misinformation
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.560]   and we will identify it.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.920]   But of course, it's a very big challenge to do that.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.320]   Face failed and wasn't on the time.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.320]   And that's not surprising.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.480]   I mean, it's hard to do.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:00:59.480]   And you're right.
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.400]   The problem isn't maybe necessarily Facebook.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:06.360]   Maybe we need to find a way to convince people not to be so accepting of all.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.760]   I don't know.
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.760]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.040]   Maybe just got the shingles vaccine, right?
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.400]   And she's in misery for companies.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.160]   But it's better than shingles.
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:21.360]   Well, yeah, what I was saying is people then spread that and say, oh, no, these vaccines
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.120]   are awful, right?
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.960]   And you're proving a negative again, but you don't get shingles.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:32.760]   Well, by the way, there was a well-known study of flu vaccine.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.960]   I think it was last year.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:39.360]   It was a double blind, which means placebo, half the people got nothing.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.560]   Half the people got the flu vaccine.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.360]   More people who got the placebo complained of side effects than the people who got the
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.360]   vaccine.
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.160]   There's a huge society.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:54.600]   There's a huge, you know, mind component in all of this.
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.560]   I got the shingles vaccine and did not have any symptoms.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:02.480]   And that's probably probably why tabloids have always worked so much.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.480]   Exactly.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:04.480]   We love this case.
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:08.080]   So I just wanted to follow up with Avaz.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.080]   Yes.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:13.120]   If you want to understand where it came from, good, please do.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.280]   It was co-founded by res publica.
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.680]   Oh, and also by move on.org.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.680]   Good.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.720]   We are familiar with move on.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:24.600]   And it is supported by the SEIU, which is a founded part.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:30.760]   The service employees international union, which represents most nurses and people like
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.520]   that health workers, yeah.
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.520]   Yeah, they do.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.520]   They do polls.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:40.320]   And so it's kind of like imagine if you funded your change.org petitions and then you actually
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:47.040]   created groups around them to in had an outside organization help organize your change.org
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.080]   positions into actual physical real world action.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:52.080]   So that's.
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.440]   So it's left leaning, obviously.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.960]   Yes.
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:59.520]   But it's it's heart is in the right place.
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.960]   They did campaign against Donald Trump in the 2016 election.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.320]   How dare they?
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:11.200]   How dare they against our dear leader?
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.200]   Can I ask you a question?
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.960]   I just saw something new that I had not seen before on Twitter.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.240]   Would you go to Twitter, please?
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.400]   Are you or do you still have it or did you kill it?
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.000]   No, I have it, but I'm private on Twitter.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   What?
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.520]   What do you want to talk about, Jeff?
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:28.320]   Well, because because what so if you do a retweet now, you used to say retweet or retweet
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.320]   with comment.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:30.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:33.440]   Now it says basically retweet.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.280]   Hold on.
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:37.280]   Mind still says retweet.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:38.280]   As quote tweet.
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.280]   Mind still says retweet.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:40.280]   So mind.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:43.200]   So my mind says retweet with retweet as quote tweet.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.200]   Does say that's Daisy?
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.200]   Yes.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.320]   Mine just started saying that today.
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.040]   So this is typical of Twitter.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.760]   You know, it's not it's not universal.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.160]   The eight year rollout.
[01:03:52.160 --> 01:03:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.400]   My says is quote tweet too, but it's still the same function.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.120]   And they used to say quote tweet.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.120]   No, always said with comment.
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.120]   Okay.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.120]   All right.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.120]   Never mind.
[01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.240]   I thought they were trying to I don't understand what their what their aim is.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.760]   They're pulling a Google and changing the code.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:11.360]   They're deprecating.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.360]   Debricate.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.360]   Mm.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:16.240]   I speak of Twitter.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:22.120]   Actually, this is something worth talking about because this broke fairly recently.
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:27.080]   I think today it is a story from TechCrunch by Zach Whitaker.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:31.720]   It's talking about a university in Michigan requiring students to install an app tracking
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:34.040]   their location for contact tracing.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:36.720]   What's interesting is they can't opt out.
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.720]   Mm.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.920]   So the university makes you do this.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.640]   The cherry on top.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.440]   So the app is called Aura.
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:49.280]   It is made by a company that does not historically make contact tracing apps.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.920]   And they've already found two security flaws.
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:52.920]   One.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:58.400]   One allows you access to the apps back in servers.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:02.360]   Big, big, not issue or sorry, big issue rather.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:07.160]   And then the other allows you to infer someone's COVID-19 test results.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.320]   Those vulnerabilities happen fixed.
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.520]   But this is a really interesting story.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:20.200]   So I thought this is where the intersection of privacy and public health kind of come into
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:26.120]   conflict in where in the US we're probably going to air more towards privacy.
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.760]   And I just was curious.
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:33.960]   If you can't not download this app, right, if you're a student there, otherwise you get
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960]   suspended.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:38.360]   But that seems fair because they want to bring people back to the campus so they're trying
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.040]   to find a way to do that safely.
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.920]   And a hundred percent compliance, you can ask that.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:48.160]   It's, you know, I mean, it's a public university, but you could ask that if that's part, that's
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:52.360]   a con commitment with going with going back to school.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:56.720]   So I know schools is not allowing students to leave campus at all.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.720]   Right.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.320]   They're imprisoned on campus.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.960]   Does or I don't think any, I think there's always going to be somebody losing regarding
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.560]   school education nowadays.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.960]   It's just it is what it is.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:13.120]   Somebody's going to lose spoken as someone who's hit over the knuckles with a ruler.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.680]   Many, many times.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.800]   I said this was the University of Michigan.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.680]   It is a university in Michigan.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.320]   Oh, is it a private?
[01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:21.320]   It's a private.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:22.320]   You know, that makes sense.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:25.600]   I read it the same way because I read the, I just read the headline.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:26.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.680]   What's university is it?
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.680]   Does it say?
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:29.680]   Albion.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:30.680]   Oh, Albion.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.680]   Which sounds, yeah.
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.320]   It's a small school.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.320]   Okay.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.640]   Can I, can I stay see bait?
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.600]   Can I stay see a question?
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:42.320]   Stacey, you're asking me permission to stay see bait?
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.320]   Yes, I am.
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.200]   I give you permission to stay see bait.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.200]   I think she'll like this one.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.800]   So I'm trying to ask her permission granted.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:56.600]   Stacey, Dr. Stacey, the Google seeks to test six gigahertz broadband in secret test story.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:58.800]   Oh, yeah, I saw this.
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.200]   Yeah, I want to explain it to me.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.200]   Explain it to me.
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:07.480]   We're talking about this super high frequency broadband a couple of weeks ago, right?
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.880]   I think it was last week.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:10.880]   It was.
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:11.880]   Yes.
[01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:16.720]   I haven't, I haven't really done it.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:22.440]   I wrote about using six gigahertz for broadband for actually what was web pass.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:29.480]   So I have this thesis that companies with satellite connect a satellite physical satellite
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:34.840]   dishes on top of people's roofs have an inherent advantage as we moved to millimeter wave.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.840]   Yes.
[01:07:35.840 --> 01:07:36.840]   So it makes sense.
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:37.840]   Can be line of sight.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:42.520]   Yeah, because you do actually need something on the roof to do this.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.240]   So yeah, this makes a ton of sense.
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:49.400]   I don't know what else you want me to say about this.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:54.840]   People constantly think that we're going to have the thing that frees us from wires,
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:55.840]   but never.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:02.960]   So this is interesting and there've been other six.
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:06.480]   I don't know if it's been in six gigahertz or if it's been some of the tests have been
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.720]   actually in 24, which is much more difficult.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:16.360]   But yeah, for something like this, you do need line of sight and you need the dishes
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:21.640]   to be fairly close together, but it could free us from wires.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:26.840]   And what would happen is it go into the dish itself or into the CPE is the dish plus whatever.
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:32.000]   And then you'd have that that would be converted into Wi-Fi probably into your home.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.400]   So and you also, by the way, if you do something like this.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:41.840]   You still need somewhere a massive physical pipe to go to this is my massive physical.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.600]   It's like a culvert for the internet.
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.960]   It's a big.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:52.040]   You need that for back all because obviously this six get this wireless has to like it's
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.200]   transmitted from somewhere to your house, right?
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:01.000]   So you still need that transmission tower needs to have a big fat pipe.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.120]   Microwave internet's been around forever.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120]   Yeah.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.880]   This sounds like it's similar to that.
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.880]   It's same thing.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:08.880]   You have to dish.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.880]   You have to be high up.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.040]   You have to have line of sight to the tower.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.040]   It could be.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.240]   Microwave can be very fast.
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.480]   Here's one company that does it.
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:21.000]   Geolinks and they can get they say they can get up to a gigabit with very low latency.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.840]   But you know, you have to have line of sight.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.000]   So thank you.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.280]   Sounds very niche to me.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.240]   It's yeah, it's for cities.
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.240]   It's for specialized use.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:38.600]   So here's actually so this is one of those things where I had argued for a long time that
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:41.760]   it would be bad for rural or not as useful for rural.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:45.040]   But then I had some guys like in Wisconsin or Wyoming.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:50.560]   I'm so sorry people in Wisconsin and Wyoming argue they were they were Wisp owners, which
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.560]   is a wireless IIS.
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.080]   Oh, I bet you heard from Brett.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.680]   Brett Glass contact you.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.400]   Brett is not called me.
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.320]   Please don't mention this.
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.280]   I don't want to.
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.760]   He comes in here a lot.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:06.680]   He's at Wisp in Wyoming in Laramie.
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:07.680]   Let's not invoke that.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:08.680]   Okay.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:13.040]   I won't say his name three times because that would only send it twice.
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.040]   Okay.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:20.560]   But the Wisp pointed out that it might still be economically viable to have essentially
[01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:21.800]   repeaters.
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:27.720]   So maybe it would be okay for rural in some or they bring they because you still need
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:33.520]   fiber out to someplace right to and if you're still super far apart.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:37.680]   But there are areas where it may be worth it to bring fiber, especially if there's already
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:39.640]   fiber for like a cell tower nearby.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:40.640]   Right.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.640]   You need that back all.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:42.640]   That's the key.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:43.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.840]   So I'm going to start calling them Internet culverts because that's just super culverts.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.080]   I like it.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:54.880]   So Google did in fact apply in 17 states.
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.880]   That's what amazed me.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.680]   It was this is this Mondo multi state thing.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:10:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:01.680]   This is great.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:02.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:06.880]   Google Google fiber when they were building their fiber in Austin, for example, they actually
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.960]   built their own fiber back all around the city.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:15.320]   So imagine you're pissed off because your awesome trench digging technology did not
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.880]   work out as anticipated and people started hating you.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:24.000]   So now you're like, well, what if I convince people to put dishes on their house and I
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:25.400]   offered them this brought them.
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:26.720]   Because they have the back all.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.720]   They have the back all.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:28.720]   They have the fiber.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.240]   This is a last mile.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.640]   Oh, at best.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:32.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.480]   Last half last.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.120]   Last block, maybe.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.120]   I don't know.
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:44.080]   Did your friends, your friends in Wyoming and Montana say anything about the distance
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.240]   that you could go with this stuff?
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:52.160]   It depends on what I mean, as as is always the case in wireless broadband, it depends
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:55.400]   on the weather depends on rain.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.400]   Rain's red luck.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.400]   Well, that not true.
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.400]   Not necessarily.
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:02.440]   Actually, six gigahertz is pretty terrible.
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:05.200]   It'll bounce off anything.
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:07.200]   That's going to be the big problem.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:14.000]   It'll it'll bounce off human sacks of salt water.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   Absolutely.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.440]   Or just tiny droplets of drops of water.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:25.080]   There's pesky trees.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.080]   Terram down.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.080]   That's what Ronald Reagan said.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.080]   Just get rid of them.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:32.360]   MIT researchers have found a new use for spot.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:39.080]   They're putting a little doctor on this robot dog.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:46.520]   And they're using it to test, to do patient triage and test for COVID-19.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.520]   This isn't new.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.560]   Well, no, they've been doing the triage for a long time.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.560]   Oh, OK.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.840]   I've seen spot in hospital since.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:57.920]   What's weird to me is this dog, imagine spot coming in different colors, right?
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:01.560]   Because Singapore was using it to patrol its parks for social distancing.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.520]   MIT's testing hospital remote patient care.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:08.520]   I'm like, you've got your red cross spot.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.080]   You've got your sentry enforcer spot that will kill you.
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.080]   Spot could do.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:14.680]   Is there anything spot can't do?
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:18.000]   You have a fever and spot comes into your hospital room.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   That's right.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.960]   But that's what they're doing because spot has--
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.200]   Next year, you have high blood pressure.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:28.400]   As can simultaneously measure skin temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood auctions
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.960]   and saturation while maintaining social distancing.
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:34.880]   It's teleoperated.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.480]   They call it doctor spot.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.800]   So the clinical staff drives spot, the little dog in.
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:42.240]   Well, thank you.
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:46.960]   And it's equipped with all this measuring stuff.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.440]   And they can get vital signs.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.440]   They wouldn't--
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.560]   Couldn't that money be used for something else instead of that robot?
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:57.520]   Yes, $75,000 robot just to take vitals.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:09.320]   Well, the argument might be that you're not-- in the case of COVID, people couldn't-- the
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.680]   doctors, PPE and such.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.560]   They were going through it at such a rate.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:18.520]   If it can go in and check on the patient every 30 minutes without the doctor having
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:22.440]   to put more risk, without humans being at greater risk.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.440]   OK.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:24.440]   More often.
[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:25.440]   That's fair.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.440]   Medical by the way.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.440]   But still $75,000.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:29.680]   Yeah, that's not for a hospital.
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.680]   If you look--
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:32.680]   Yeah, for hospital equipment.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:33.680]   It's--
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:39.160]   They spend a lot of money on stuff that is unnecessarily expensive.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.320]   So what do you think about this?
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:46.600]   The right to be forgotten.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.600]   And the question--
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.600]   [CHUCKLES]
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:52.280]   The question with-- I mean, we don't like the right to be forgotten in general.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:58.080]   But the question whether it is equally applied really starts to bring up some issues.
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:00.320]   In 2014, a German princess--
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.320]   It was just--
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.320]   It was just--
[01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.320]   It stopped right there.
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.320]   Right?
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.320]   Whatever.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:06.320]   It's just stopped right there.
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.320]   That's it.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.320]   But there are still German princes?
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.320]   There is a German--
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.320]   I was going to say I didn't even know they existed.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.320]   She's a victim of Stein.
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.320]   She had a friend.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.560]   She's a victim of Stein.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:20.400]   She was 27, attended the October Fest at Scotland at the University of St. Andrews,
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:26.160]   got a little tipsy, assaulted police officers and first responders and said, "I was doing
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:31.480]   my nails this morning and wondering how many Muslims I could kill."
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.480]   This got into the news.
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:33.480]   What a shock.
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.480]   Good.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.480]   Who?
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:38.840]   Her family with the help of Google and the European Right to Be Forgotten Law.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:39.840]   And many lawyers.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:45.520]   And many lawyers have been getting those stories removed.
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:55.120]   197 links to be exact from the search and thereby being removed from the world of the
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.120]   internet.
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.720]   She apparently took off her clothes too.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.120]   I find this interesting because I do think there's value in the Right to Be Forgotten.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.120]   She was young.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.120]   I kind of wish--
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:14.720]   Yeah, I wish that when you turn 21, your internet search history was expunged, right?
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:18.440]   Just because kids do and say stupid things.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.160]   She's not a kid though.
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.160]   She was 27.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:26.000]   Well, at 27, I think you don't get that right.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:29.360]   I'm not going to-- I mean, 27, I was married.
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:36.640]   If you search-- Yeah, right.
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:40.880]   If you search for her name in Germany, you'll get almost exclusive results about her marriage.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:47.680]   If you search outside of Germany, you're going to get those fun stories about the drunken
[01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:50.280]   outburst.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:53.200]   Although if you-- you know, Google does have a little thing.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:58.000]   It puts the bottom of the page where it says, "The information on this page represents a
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.720]   request to remove material from an online site or a DMCA counter note is blah, blah, blah.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.920]   It lets you know that this was taken down out of the right to be forgotten."
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:11.520]   It doesn't give you what, but it gives you why.
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.360]   I want to go back if I may for one moment, something that's just breaking.
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:15.360]   Yes.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:17.360]   So, back to QAnon.
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.360]   Yes.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:24.000]   So in his update, I think occurring now, Trump is asked to shed light on his thoughts
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.920]   about the lunatic QAnon conspiracy theory, says Aaron Rupar.
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:32.880]   Instead of denouncing it, he says, "I understand they like me very much, which I appreciate.
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:34.400]   I've heard these people.
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.240]   These are people who love our country."
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.840]   Oh, Lord.
[01:17:38.840 --> 01:17:43.760]   So the war is not only on social media, friends.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:47.560]   Yeah, so it doesn't really matter what Facebook does back to me.
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:48.560]   Right, exactly.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:52.040]   Although, if President of the United States just endorsed QAnon.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.040]   But here's the difference.
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:57.360]   Okay, so that makes QAnon okay to a certain group of people.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:03.120]   But what Facebook does is facilitate the actual, you know, do the research, which is the tag
[01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.360]   line on QAnon.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:05.720]   It facilitates all of that.
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.520]   It provides you with all the document.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:09.560]   It allows somebody to go down that rabbit hole.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.560]   Right.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.560]   It goes on.
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:15.680]   Reporter, QAnon believes you are secretly saving the world from this cult of pedophiles
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.680]   and cannibals.
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.680]   Are you behind that?
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:18.680]   I can guess what he's saying.
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:19.680]   Trump.
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:21.040]   Is that supposed to be a bad thing?
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:21.880]   Yes.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:22.880]   We are saving the world.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:23.880]   We're saving the world.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.520]   You're right.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:30.840]   This is the second time he's been asked about the QAnon.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:35.720]   The first time he just kind of moved on, I guess he's decided not to embrace.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.720]   This is his base.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:38.320]   He's got nowhere else to go.
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.320]   Yeah, it's his base.
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:41.320]   Yep.
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:45.960]   Facebook has said that it will restrict the spread of QAnon content on his pages, groups,
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.560]   and Instagram accounts.
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:54.200]   It will allow people to post content supporting movements like QAnon if other policies are
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:59.800]   not broken, such as those about harassment, fake accounts, hate speech, or inciting violence,
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.600]   none of which QAnon does outwardly.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:08.360]   QAnon pages and groups will be ranked lower in its newsfeed in the near future, right
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:11.080]   after the election, depending on what happens.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:15.040]   And the hashtags, titles, or accounts associated with the conspiracy theory will be demoted
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.680]   in search results.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:23.760]   They did remove 790 groups, 100 pages, and 1,500 ads tied to QAnon.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:26.560]   They restricted over 10,000 Instagram accounts.
[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:27.560]   Wow.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:34.120]   Alongside 1,950 groups and 440 Facebook pages and blocked more than 300 hashtags.
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:39.320]   So of course, the problem with the conspiracy theory is all of this, anything that happens,
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.920]   but all of this confirms the conspiracy theory.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.920]   You go, you see?
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:43.920]   You see?
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.000]   It must be true.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:53.040]   But I think, you know, and if you want to know what is QAnon, there's a very good piece
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:20:03.080]   in the Atlantic from last month that I'd highly recommend that goes deep down the rabbit hole.
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:11.200]   It actually was, I think, the cover story in the July or August by Adrianne La France.
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:16.880]   The prophecies of Q was really, really well done.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:18.640]   And it's deep.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:23.840]   It's a deep, long, and it's a really good example of conspiracy theory.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:27.720]   In fact, what's really interesting about QAnon, it's kind of a meta-conspiracy theory.
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:32.880]   It takes all of the best parts of all the other conspiracy theories and merges it into
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:38.840]   one weird volcano of conspiracy theories.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:44.280]   It's got it all.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:48.760]   The protocols of the Zion, the protocols of the Zai elders of Zai elders.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:49.760]   George Soros.
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:54.520]   George Soros, all of that stuff has all kind of merged in to one weird thing.
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:21:00.800]   And the funny thing is, no matter what happens to counter it, there's always well.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.800]   You see?
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:03.960]   And that's the problem with conspiracy theory.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:09.960]   It's all really confirmation bias.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:11.840]   What are you going to do?
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:14.600]   And by the way, Trump is not alone.
[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:21.200]   There are 11 congressional candidates this election cycle that others just won in Florida.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:23.400]   There's 11 that publicly support you.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.600]   One in Georgia that actually won their primary.
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.480]   She won her primary.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.480]   But she's not alone.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:30.480]   Eleven?
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:31.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:35.520]   According to Axios, 11 GOP congressional nominees support QAnon.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.520]   Oh, my Lord.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.520]   Oh, my Lord.
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:42.040]   Here's one of them posing with her handgun in Rifle, Colorado.
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:46.280]   To be fair, primaries award the craziest.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.520]   They have gotten worse and worse about that.
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.040]   So these are the craziest of--
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:56.440]   Yeah, but this woman, Lauren Boebert, defeated five term congressional member of Congress
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:00.360]   Scott Tipton in the Republican primary for the third congressional.
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:02.760]   It's Republican district.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.040]   And Trump had endorsed Tipton.
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:08.280]   But Lauren beat him.
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:13.240]   This is bad news for the election because that's kind of why Trump won in 2016.
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.920]   He was the FU candidate, right?
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:17.960]   He was for people's politics as usual in QAnon.
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:19.560]   Can you say that in French, please?
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:23.440]   It sounds much better.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.440]   I can't say it.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:29.760]   I don't know how to say it, like, to conjugate it correctly for that.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.200]   They didn't cover that.
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.600]   And I can't remember.
[01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.360]   Our everb conjugation.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:40.480]   Anyway, the point is-- I don't know what the point is.
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.480]   The point is this is--
[01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:42.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.480]   I'm sorry.
[01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.480]   I ruined your--
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.320]   No, I don't-- I don't even want to--
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:53.640]   Let's take a little time out and we will continue with this humiliation in just a moment.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:23:02.280]   Our show today brought to you by monday.com, the team management platform that helps you
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:05.760]   plan, manage, and track work in one centralized place.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.840]   Teams these days distribute it all over.
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.640]   Everybody's working from home.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.840]   It is hard to do.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:15.200]   But this is one of the things that's really been interesting about quarantine is we've
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:17.560]   learned new ways of working.
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:22.480]   And I have a feeling distributed teams are increasingly going to be the way it is, regardless
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:25.720]   of what the health concerns are.
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.520]   People aren't going to go back to work.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:33.560]   So it's a good thing Monday.com is here to help you collaborate with your team members,
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:37.520]   track everything your team's working on, wherever you are in any industry.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:41.840]   I wish we'd had monday.com for my science projects back in high school.
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:44.640]   There was always somebody in the team that said, yeah, yeah, I'm working on it.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.200]   It was doing nothing.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:49.640]   Had we had monday.com, we'd know exactly what was going on.
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:54.560]   So your team is five or 5,000 monday.com is the easiest way to keep everybody connected
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:55.560]   and on track.
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:24:01.160]   And don't you love if you're watching the video, all the different ways you can use monday.com.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.160]   It's very visual.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.800]   It's basically a dashboard.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:06.400]   It's a project management platform.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:11.480]   But what's nice about it is it can look the way you like it to look like Stacy likes
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.480]   Gantt charts.
[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.960]   That's how she plans for Thanksgiving dinners.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:21.960]   So you can do a Gantt chart or a timeline or a can band or a spreadsheet.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:22.960]   You can do tables.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:24.520]   You can make it work the way you do.
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:29.800]   You can integrate all of your teams, go to tools and connect them to monday.com.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:34.000]   Zoom, Slack, email, calendar, spreadsheets, Google Docs, whatever.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.680]   And what's great is there are no code automations.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:38.400]   Put the whole workflow on autopilot.
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.720]   Once you connect it up, it's all flowing into monday.com.
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:42.880]   You've got the dashboard.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:43.880]   You've got alerts.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:45.800]   Status updates.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:46.800]   Project flows.
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:52.160]   Everybody in team is on track and confident because there's a single source of truth.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.640]   Everybody can look at it and go exactly what's going on.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:57.400]   It's great for centralized communication.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:59.960]   You won't even need check-in meetings anymore.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:05.000]   They've got all sorts of templates for every possible industry, including remote ready templates
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.800]   for your work at home team.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:10.440]   Productivity and efficiency will go up.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.480]   Transparency will go up.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:14.000]   Operation goes up.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:21.360]   If you're making decisions by guessing, now you can make data-driven decisions directly
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:24.400]   from the actual data, tracking progress, timelines and budgets.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.760]   You don't have to guess anymore.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:29.560]   We set up one of the things monday.com does, which is great.
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:32.400]   They have onboarding specialists you can request.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.360]   We had a great one, Eddie.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:36.320]   He said podcasts.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:37.400]   We got a great template.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:38.400]   We set it up.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:40.400]   A great way to have producers.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.760]   All everybody works on our shows now is remote.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:51.880]   Producers, hosts, contributors, all working together on the same page, it's amazing.
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:52.880]   It's amazing.
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:56.040]   I want you to check it out and change the way you work online.
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.800]   The time is right for monday.com.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:02.320]   Let monday.com take care of what slows you down and free up time to focus on the work
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.640]   that gets you excited.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:05.920]   Start your free 14-day trial.
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:12.240]   Go to monday.com/twit.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.240]   It's really exciting.
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:17.600]   There's something here that can really help you get the job done.
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:23.720]   Change the way you work monday.com/twit.
[01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:32.360]   I got something to suggest.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:34.360]   I'm looking for something to land on.
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:36.360]   A zoom box.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:44.360]   Did we know that zoom was going to come to portal and all those things?
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:47.120]   Yeah, this is the news.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.360]   I think it's -- we lost Ant.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.360]   His zoom box shut down.
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.360]   Is that his monitor?
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.360]   Oh, no.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:55.360]   Sorry.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:59.360]   Are you getting -- are you -- oh, he's getting hot.
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:00.360]   It was hot.
[01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:02.360]   Oh, it's in hot.
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.360]   Hot.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.360]   It turned off the lights.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.360]   I was like, oh, no.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:12.360]   You need a thermometer tied into something so we can see how hot it is there for you.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.360]   It's a hot day.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:18.360]   I have ordered some air conditioners, but still waiting on delivery.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:19.360]   It's 87.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.360]   Oh, about they're hard to get.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.360]   It was really hot.
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.880]   You can make a swab cooler.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.360]   Can you make one?
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:30.360]   Yeah, you just get like -- get some wet rags in a fan.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:31.360]   Wet rags?
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.360]   Oh, and there you go.
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:33.360]   Yeah, he's got one.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.360]   It's swampy in there.
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.360]   It's swampy in there.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:40.360]   So you just blow air across a wet rag and that's a swamp cooler.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:41.360]   Yep.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.360]   Wow.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360]   Sorry.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:45.360]   I didn't know that.
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.360]   Poor people at the deep south.
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.360]   That's where I think it comes from.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.360]   Resourceful.
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:55.360]   I remember I used to sit in my boxer shorts spritzing myself in front of a fan.
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:58.360]   That's kind of like -- that's like you're not one of a vision.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.360]   It's pretty similar, but --
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:03.380]   The requires the action on your part.
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:06.200]   All right.
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.040]   - All right.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.120]   - What were you talking about?
[01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:08.940]   - Zoom.
[01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:09.860]   - All the older of mine.
[01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:12.240]   So this is part of the change.
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:13.940]   Like, but I mentioned.
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:16.500]   This morning I woke up 'cause I saw the Google
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:19.960]   is going to add Duo and Meet to the Nest.
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:22.880]   Home Max Microsoft has announced that they're gonna take
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:25.980]   that Lenovo screen that they
[01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:28.480]   that's Google home screen, but they're gonna take that
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:30.340]   and they're gonna make it a Microsoft team
[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:33.340]   and they're gonna make it a systems device.
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.960]   And now we hear that Zoom and other
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.760]   conferencing technologies are gonna make it
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.000]   to Facebook's portal, same idea.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.600]   So I ordered another, I have one in the kitchen,
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:47.440]   but I ordered another 'cause I thought this is actually,
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:49.440]   at first I thought that's stupid.
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:50.280]   Why do you need this?
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.100]   You got a computer.
[01:28:51.100 --> 01:28:53.080]   - No people have been asking us for this.
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.480]   This is like one of the top on our little show
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.280]   we have a call in question line.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.480]   I've had at least four or five questions
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:01.580]   like this and the answer unfortunately was always,
[01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:03.860]   you can't, so we never.
[01:29:03.860 --> 01:29:06.900]   - So I ordered the Nest Hub Max
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:08.500]   'cause that's the one with the camera.
[01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.860]   And I'm hoping it's small enough that I could just put it
[01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:13.740]   in front of my computer, just right below the screen.
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:16.740]   If it can't, I'll mount it on a shelf right above the screen.
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:19.340]   And the reason I thought, well this is done
[01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:21.580]   because I can do this with my computer,
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:24.460]   but this is kind of a standalone dedicated Meet
[01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:27.940]   or Zoom or Duo device.
[01:29:27.940 --> 01:29:30.620]   And because it's the Google Hub,
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:33.660]   it recognizes me, it shows my calendar.
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:36.000]   I can send audio messages.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.100]   I can say, send a message to Ant.
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:40.340]   We're gonna start 10 minutes late.
[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:42.820]   It will record that voice and send it to him.
[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:45.780]   I can make phone calls.
[01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:46.860]   I can play music.
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.820]   I can actually say, you know,
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:51.180]   play some music on my stereo.
[01:29:51.180 --> 01:29:52.180]   I can control the lights.
[01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:54.660]   This is, now I'm starting to get into this idea
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:57.460]   that maybe this little box could be the assistant
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:00.140]   in my office, my home office, sitting right on the,
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:02.880]   it could be like a little mini Karsten,
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:04.620]   only more obedient.
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:07.020]   - You gotta put a bow tie blow.
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:07.860]   - More obedient.
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:10.580]   - More obedient and sitting right in front.
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:13.860]   I thought, maybe this is a good idea.
[01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:15.300]   - I didn't think about any of that,
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:18.540]   but I did think that this is just further proven
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:21.980]   that working from home is definitely normal.
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:25.500]   And it's probably gonna be that way for quite a long time,
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.260]   not just for the rest of this year,
[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:29.220]   but next year and beyond.
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:31.140]   If we continue to get tools like this
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:33.740]   to help make it more of a simplified approach
[01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:34.860]   to get work done.
[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:38.180]   - In theory, you can even use your voice.
[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:40.380]   You could say, hey, you know who started meeting
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:43.140]   and on the screen.
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:47.820]   And you'll be glad to hear Stacey and Jeff Beta support
[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:49.840]   for G Suite accounts.
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:53.700]   But you have to go to g.co/gsuite.
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:58.340]   - How does the Google Assistant help you?
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:01.260]   - The Max follow you around, if you move.
[01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:06.100]   - No, I'd have to attach it to a Boston robotics spot dog.
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:07.540]   (laughing)
[01:31:07.540 --> 01:31:10.060]   - Well, the poor one will follow you around, right?
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:11.540]   (laughing)
[01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:12.620]   - There, are we going, Leo?
[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:15.420]   - So the camera, oh, does the phone run around?
[01:31:15.420 --> 01:31:16.500]   Yes, it does, doesn't it?
[01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:17.340]   Yeah.
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:18.700]   - Yeah, the camera on the, yes.
[01:31:18.700 --> 01:31:20.860]   I thought you meant like for room to room, Jeff.
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:21.700]   - 'Cause I would love to be able to--
[01:31:21.700 --> 01:31:23.020]   - As to you.
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:24.900]   - No, well, you can switch to--
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:28.020]   - I wanna be able to lecture by pacing.
[01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:29.020]   - Yes.
[01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:29.860]   - I wanna stay with the whiteboard.
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:30.700]   - With certain pace.
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:34.620]   - You know, that's what graduate students are for.
[01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:36.580]   Just bring it, just have them aim the camera.
[01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:37.420]   That's all.
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:38.260]   - Yeah.
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:39.980]   So Zoom's gonna be on all of them, right?
[01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:44.980]   It's gonna be on Google and Facebook and--
[01:31:44.980 --> 01:31:49.060]   - Eventually.
[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:51.860]   - This is one of those Zoom announcements where they say,
[01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:53.620]   "Coming soon."
[01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:58.620]   But is it on the, it's on the portal now or September?
[01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:02.100]   - Yeah.
[01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:02.940]   - No, it's like--
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:04.580]   - Right, portal next month.
[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:09.340]   Echo, it's slated to be available on the Echo Show
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:11.820]   and Google Depowered Displays by the end of the year.
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:12.660]   - Right.
[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:15.620]   - But then the portal is also getting blue jeans,
[01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:18.140]   which is what Facebook uses 'cause they refuse to use
[01:32:18.140 --> 01:32:20.660]   any Google products they wouldn't use meat
[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:22.420]   and WebEx and go to meeting.
[01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:25.540]   - Yay, portal.
[01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:29.100]   The thing's still creepy and I would not use it.
[01:32:29.100 --> 01:32:33.100]   - I think I'm gonna regret this.
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:34.780]   I got two new--
[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:35.620]   - You regret everything.
[01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:36.740]   - I know, I will.
[01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:38.380]   I got two new phones on the way.
[01:32:38.380 --> 01:32:42.340]   One, we mentioned last week, which is the duo phone
[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:44.420]   from Microsoft, the thinnest phone ever made.
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:49.420]   The other is the pine phone, which is gonna be so clunky.
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:50.780]   It is a--
[01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:51.780]   - Oh no, you didn't.
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:52.940]   - You didn't get in here on all your--
[01:32:52.940 --> 01:32:56.220]   - Yeah, I get the wrong link here, we have it, pine phone.
[01:32:56.220 --> 01:32:57.580]   This is a Linux phone.
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:33:00.780]   Well, I thought it'd be interesting to try a Linux phone.
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:01.780]   - Of course you would.
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:06.260]   - Of course, it's open source, community driven.
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:07.540]   - It's the moral panic phone.
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:08.740]   - It's the moral panic phone.
[01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:11.340]   I'm gonna have my own very own moral panic phone.
[01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:16.180]   And it's also the privacy phone 'cause it has switches,
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:19.180]   hardware switches to turn on or off LTE,
[01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:22.260]   Wi-Fi microphone speakers and cameras.
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:24.820]   So you want privacy, you don't have to break your phone
[01:33:24.820 --> 01:33:26.340]   and throw it out the window.
[01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:27.180]   - Just flip a switch.
[01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:28.900]   - The glass that does nothing.
[01:33:28.900 --> 01:33:30.940]   - I know you get a lot of grief or bond,
[01:33:30.940 --> 01:33:34.340]   all of the stuff that's pretty popular and newly released
[01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:36.580]   or whatever, and you also get a lot of grief or bond.
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:39.300]   Some of the crap where that you see an Instagram ad.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:41.620]   - I stopped by quitting Instagram.
[01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:45.300]   - But this looks more like your alley.
[01:33:45.300 --> 01:33:46.140]   - Yeah.
[01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:48.140]   - And it makes photosets.
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:49.980]   - It's not, the other thing is it's not expensive.
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:33:51.220]   It was like 150 pounds.
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:52.060]   So.
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:54.420]   - That's expensive to some people.
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:58.100]   - No, yeah, but relative to a modern smartphone.
[01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:59.180]   - Sure.
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:00.820]   - Relative to a thousand dollar phone.
[01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:02.340]   - That was a dollar phone.
[01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:03.540]   - Sing it?
[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:04.700]   - Your a bomb a phone.
[01:34:04.700 --> 01:34:07.460]   - That's for, yeah, that's low income phone.
[01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:10.020]   - Yeah, so we had on community leaders
[01:34:10.020 --> 01:34:13.220]   from the South Bronx in the class I had before we were on today.
[01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:16.900]   And I didn't realize how widely it is used there.
[01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:18.020]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:20.380]   - I get callers all the time who,
[01:34:20.380 --> 01:34:22.780]   it's only colloquially, colloquially,
[01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:24.860]   all the calls that Obama phone,
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:27.860]   I think it's a subsidized phone.
[01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:28.860]   - Yes.
[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:31.260]   - For low income people.
[01:34:31.260 --> 01:34:32.820]   Which is cool because.
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:34.620]   - Great, great.
[01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:39.060]   - Nowadays, it really is the way people connect.
[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:42.060]   - Without it, without it, you're not connected to the world.
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:42.900]   - Yeah.
[01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:49.420]   - I'm not sure how it stands under the current FCC.
[01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:54.420]   It has to be funded by the FCC, so I don't know.
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:56.660]   It comes from the Lifeline, you know,
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:34:58.420]   we all pay that Lifeline fee.
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:34:59.420]   - Yep, okay.
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:00.260]   - On ourself.
[01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:01.100]   - Rural.
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:02.900]   - Rural and others.
[01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:03.740]   - Yeah.
[01:35:03.740 --> 01:35:04.580]   - Yep.
[01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:09.140]   - It's a, it's called a Lifeline phone, really, I think.
[01:35:09.140 --> 01:35:09.980]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:13.540]   - That's the actual Lifeline phone service.
[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:14.380]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:19.380]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.220]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:21.060]   - What else?
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:21.900]   What else is going on?
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:23.220]   - A slot.
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:24.660]   - I could do the change log, I just wanna make sure
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:27.300]   I get everything before you do that.
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:29.300]   - That we head to the home base.
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:32.100]   - Right, yes, it's the head for home sound.
[01:35:32.100 --> 01:35:34.140]   - A change log?
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:36.940]   - Did you read the fake blog that this kid wrote?
[01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.820]   And it got on Hacker News.
[01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:43.380]   It got a number one spot on Hacker News.
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:48.300]   Using this AI tool GPT-3, we've talked about it before,
[01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:53.300]   that generates pretty realistic, here, this is the post,
[01:35:53.300 --> 01:36:00.780]   I'll give you, this is the post, it's a sub-stack blog,
[01:36:00.780 --> 01:36:02.900]   so he was able to set it up quickly.
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:04.940]   This was the post that made it to Hacker News,
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:09.580]   feeling unproductive, maybe you should stop overthinking.
[01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:10.660]   (laughing)
[01:36:10.660 --> 01:36:12.700]   That's a picture of a guy thinking.
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:15.820]   In order to get something done, maybe we need to think less.
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:17.820]   Seems counterintuitive, but I believe sometimes
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:20.340]   I thought it can get in the way of the creative process.
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:22.620]   We can work better at times when we tune out
[01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:25.140]   the external world and focus on what's in front of us.
[01:36:25.140 --> 01:36:26.380]   I've been thinking about this lately,
[01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:28.420]   so I thought it'd be good to write an article about it.
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:29.380]   So what does this mean?
[01:36:29.380 --> 01:36:32.180]   Well, for starters, let's start with some definitions.
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:34.740]   Definition one, creative thinking, definition two,
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:38.540]   overthinking, how do these two concepts relate to each other?
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:40.340]   And they got it, there was a whole conversation
[01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:42.420]   on Hacker News about it.
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:44.180]   It's taking it seriously.
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:47.460]   I was gonna say, was it up-voted?
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:49.060]   Because it was--
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:51.860]   Nobody, it was only one post on Hacker News
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:56.860]   who said, "Is this generated by an AI?"
[01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:59.660]   (laughing)
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:02.660]   So the most recent post on the blog,
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:07.420]   which is adolos.substack.com, A-D-O-L-O-S,
[01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:11.500]   is what would I would do with GPT-3
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.100]   if I had no ethics?
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:17.540]   - Was GPT-3 trained on Reddit or Hacker News articles?
[01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:19.380]   - It was trained on articles.
[01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:23.140]   Where we talked about, it's from OpenAI, remember?
[01:37:23.140 --> 01:37:24.140]   And we read some stuff. - Right.
[01:37:24.140 --> 01:37:24.980]   No, I'm just wondering,
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:27.740]   I mean, 'cause there is a style of writing
[01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:31.860]   that very much wins on Hacker News.
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:34.620]   And so if it were trained on those articles,
[01:37:34.620 --> 01:37:36.140]   I would imagine-- - Wouldn't that be interesting?
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:36.980]   Yeah.
[01:37:38.660 --> 01:37:42.220]   - So this whole story is actually revealed
[01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:44.860]   in the final post on this blog, Adolos.
[01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:48.300]   The kid got, I'm sure he got an A.
[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:50.540]   (laughing)
[01:37:50.540 --> 01:37:53.300]   He talked about how easy it was to do.
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:56.220]   He got some help from a graduate student
[01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.300]   and had been working on it and so forth.
[01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:01.340]   The way it worked, it turns out GPT-3 does a very good job
[01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:02.700]   if you give it a prompt.
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:06.220]   So he would create some blog prompts.
[01:38:07.940 --> 01:38:10.340]   And then generate a number of articles
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:13.740]   which he would go through to pick the best one.
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:21.660]   The post went viral, more than 26,000 visitors.
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:25.300]   Only one person reached out to ask if the post was AI generated,
[01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:30.180]   although several commenters did guess that GPT-3
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:31.620]   was the author.
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:35.300]   But the community downvoted those comments.
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:36.220]   - We wanna hear that.
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:37.740]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:39.060]   - What a thick glass.
[01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:42.540]   - That's really a wild story.
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:45.860]   He's a computer science student at the UC Berkeley.
[01:38:45.860 --> 01:38:46.860]   - That's what I was really asking.
[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:50.260]   - He had to get access to the API, which is not public.
[01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:54.860]   Only researchers can get it in a private beta from OpenAI,
[01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:57.900]   but he knew a PhD student who had access to the API
[01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:59.220]   who agreed to work with him.
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:04.220]   Poor, the student wrote a script that gave GPT-3
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:06.580]   a blog post headline and intro.
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:09.540]   It would generate a few versions of the post.
[01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:12.900]   Then he'd choose one for the blog, copy pasted
[01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:15.460]   from GPT-3's version with very little editing.
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:18.340]   So it sounds like it might have been a little bit of a tune up
[01:39:18.340 --> 01:39:19.180]   on this.
[01:39:19.180 --> 01:39:22.260]   Liam Pore was the student.
[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:26.700]   So maybe we are getting a little closer to that.
[01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:31.020]   Liam suggests GPT-3 writing, and he puts that in quotes,
[01:39:31.020 --> 01:39:33.180]   could replace content producers.
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:38.940]   The whole point of releasing this in private beta
[01:39:38.940 --> 01:39:42.100]   is so the community can show OpenAI new use cases
[01:39:42.100 --> 01:39:44.940]   that they should either encourage or look out for.
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:47.300]   Notably, he does not yet have access to the API,
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:49.700]   even though he's applied for it.
[01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:52.140]   He said to MIT Technology Review,
[01:39:52.140 --> 01:39:54.620]   "It's possible they're upset I did this."
[01:39:54.620 --> 01:39:57.020]   - Really?
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:40:03.420]   - I don't know why it's a proof of concept.
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:04.700]   Pretty darn good one too.
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:05.540]   It worked.
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:06.380]   - Yeah.
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:09.180]   - Apparently, according to Deadline,
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:15.540]   CBS Interactive via COMBS is now in discussions
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:17.340]   to sell CNET.
[01:40:17.340 --> 01:40:18.900]   Oh, buy it, oh, buy it.
[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:20.060]   Should I buy it?
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:23.460]   That would be turn about as fair play.
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:25.180]   That would be justice.
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:26.780]   - 500, it's still 500 billion.
[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:31.780]   That's down to being 1.8 billion that CBS paid in 2008,
[01:40:31.780 --> 01:40:34.500]   but it's still--
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:38.060]   - 500 million, I don't know if I could scrape that much together.
[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:39.660]   Unless you guys want to invest.
[01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:42.140]   - Kind of fun.
[01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:42.980]   - Yeah, I'll invest.
[01:40:42.980 --> 01:40:44.860]   - I'll be Lindsey Turrentine's boss.
[01:40:44.860 --> 01:40:45.700]   - Right.
[01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:46.860]   (laughing)
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:48.100]   - And Jason Heiner.
[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:49.380]   - And Heiner.
[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:50.420]   A lot of people I know.
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:53.980]   We have a lot of people on CNET on this show.
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.660]   - Lexi Savitas?
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:40:57.100]   - Yeah, Lexi's on.
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:40:59.380]   They are considering selling it to Red Venture,
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:02.340]   a digital focused holding company,
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:05.700]   which is by the way where we're all gonna go someday anyway.
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:08.620]   - Yeah, the big digital holding company in the sky.
[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:12.740]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:15.540]   Apparently, ViacomCBS is unloading a lot of properties.
[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:17.180]   Simon & Schuster's on the block.
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:18.860]   - My publisher, Simon & Schuster.
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:20.340]   - They're trying to sell BlackRock,
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:23.380]   the famous CBS building in Manhattan.
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:25.340]   - Did I get it?
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:26.740]   Good timing.
[01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:28.060]   - Yeah, everybody's moving to Manhattan.
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:31.140]   I hear that's a real hotspot now for work.
[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:33.780]   I saw rents were down 10%.
[01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:34.620]   - Oh yeah.
[01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:36.460]   - That's pretty astonishing.
[01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:37.980]   - And houses around me are actually selling,
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:39.100]   which they weren't.
[01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:42.100]   - Do you think New York is over?
[01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:43.180]   - No, that was a horrible--
[01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:44.260]   - Why are we being this way?
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:45.540]   - It was a terrible piece.
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:46.660]   - It was a terrible piece.
[01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:47.500]   - Thank you.
[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:48.340]   - It's terrible piece.
[01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:50.420]   - It was a bro hot take.
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:51.740]   - Bro hot take.
[01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:52.580]   Who is that?
[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:53.420]   - What do you got?
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:54.260]   - Could have never heard of that guy.
[01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:56.300]   - Yes, New York is invaded by zombie pigs.
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:58.540]   - Then, are there zombie pigs?
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:41:59.380]   I should be worried about it.
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:00.420]   - There's zombie pigs in the rundown.
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:01.620]   I put zombie pigs there.
[01:42:01.620 --> 01:42:05.620]   - Oh, here it is from my alma mater.
[01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:08.580]   Scientists restore some functions
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:11.100]   in a pig's brain hours after death.
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:13.820]   No, this research was not done at Harvard.
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:17.580]   (laughing)
[01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:21.020]   - Which also means this isn't useful at all.
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:21.860]   - Hey, shut up.
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:24.220]   (laughing)
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:26.220]   - Four hours after it's death.
[01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:28.380]   Yeah, that you did that first Carson, I know.
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:29.220]   - Yeah, I did that.
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:32.580]   - So we have we have gin news for Stacy.
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:34.620]   - Gin news, tell me more.
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:35.460]   - Big gin news.
[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:42.500]   - Ryan Reynolds sells aviation gin for 610 million dollars.
[01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:43.940]   - Oh my God.
[01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:45.500]   - And that guy has been killing it.
[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:47.380]   - Worth more than seeing it.
[01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:51.060]   (laughing)
[01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:52.140]   - Yep, yep.
[01:42:52.140 --> 01:42:53.700]   - What?
[01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:54.540]   - That's awesome.
[01:42:54.540 --> 01:42:55.380]   - That's easy.
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:56.220]   He's killing it.
[01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:58.460]   - Or, yeah. - Diagio announced Monday.
[01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:00.220]   It's gonna acquire, what is Diagio?
[01:43:00.220 --> 01:43:01.460]   Is that something famous?
[01:43:01.460 --> 01:43:02.300]   - That's a huge.
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:04.700]   - I didn't know that was how you pronounce it.
[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:07.700]   But yeah, it's the number one's like her brand.
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:09.860]   - It's spelled Diagio.
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:11.300]   - I think that's what it is.
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:14.140]   - But it's pronounced Chardae.
[01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:17.260]   Diagio announced, I like saying Diagio.
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:19.060]   Diagio, is it Italian?
[01:43:19.060 --> 01:43:19.900]   - I have no idea.
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:21.180]   - Diagio announced the Monday,
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:25.260]   the plans to acquire aviation in the American gin.
[01:43:25.260 --> 01:43:28.060]   Co-owned by actor Ryan Reynolds.
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:33.940]   610 million, including an initial payment of 335 million
[01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:35.620]   and a further potential consideration
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:38.460]   of up to 275 million based on the performance
[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:40.860]   of aviation gin over a 10 year period.
[01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:43.580]   Man, forget movies, Ryan.
[01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:45.660]   Just keep doing what you're doing.
[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:47.020]   - Yeah.
[01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:48.600]   - It's an American gin.
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:53.500]   Boasting a botanical mix touted to be smoother
[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:57.460]   and easier to drink compared to London Dry Ginz.
[01:43:57.460 --> 01:43:59.820]   - Now Stacey, you were somewhat dismissive of it
[01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:02.700]   when I mentioned it after he did the cool ad.
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:04.500]   Where do you rank aviation gin?
[01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:07.900]   - It's not in my top 10.
[01:44:07.900 --> 01:44:09.660]   It's kind of a coring gin.
[01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:10.500]   - Boring.
[01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:11.340]   - It's an American.
[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:13.580]   - But I like gins that have a little something,
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:16.580]   like a little uniqueness or punch.
[01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:20.980]   So I like 209 because it has a hint of coriander, right?
[01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:22.620]   You can taste that in there and you're like,
[01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:23.620]   "Oh, what's that?"
[01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:25.460]   - There's coriander in my gin.
[01:44:25.460 --> 01:44:28.580]   - And aviation, it is very smooth,
[01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:31.020]   but at that point you might as well be drinking vodka.
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:32.140]   - Yeah, I don't want smooth gin.
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:34.420]   I want gin with some gimt gin.
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:35.260]   - I want smooth gin.
[01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:37.660]   - I don't, I want to have something
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:39.100]   and I don't feel like,
[01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:41.980]   and you know, I've had some terrible aviation's made with this
[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:43.780]   and I feel like people got the idea
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:45.740]   that if I just use aviation gin,
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:48.740]   I can mix an aviation poorly and it will still be good,
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:49.580]   but it's not.
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:51.900]   It's a horrible drink if someone makes it wrong.
[01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:56.380]   - Reynolds also, I should say, owns Mint Mobile,
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:44:59.900]   one of our sponsors, or at least partially owns.
[01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:00.820]   - Really?
[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:02.460]   - Oh yeah?
[01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:03.460]   - That was a couple months ago.
[01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:04.860]   - It's taking that Deadpool money
[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:06.580]   and really making it work for him.
[01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:11.220]   And he has now created a streaming service
[01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:12.860]   with only one movie on it.
[01:45:12.860 --> 01:45:16.500]   Mint Mobile Plus, of course you gotta have a plus.
[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:19.580]   You got Disney Plus, Apple Plus, now it's Mint Mobile Plus.
[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:21.500]   Ryan Reynolds, foolproof.
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:23.460]   Is that a real movie?
[01:45:23.460 --> 01:45:24.300]   - Good, I want you.
[01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:25.140]   - Is that a real movie?
[01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:25.980]   Yes it is.
[01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:28.860]   It's a full length,
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:33.020]   hour and 28 minute movie,
[01:45:33.020 --> 01:45:38.220]   stream, it's only the only movie on Mint Mobile Plus.
[01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:39.820]   - Good, oh you're Ryan Reynolds.
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:40.980]   - Isn't that hysterical?
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:42.980]   (laughing)
[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:44.260]   - He, I love Ryan.
[01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:47.500]   I want him to be my best friend.
[01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:48.740]   No, I don't know.
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:49.580]   - Oh it's like.
[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:53.540]   - Look at this, this is, look at the carousel.
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:55.500]   Okay, so it looks a little like Apple TV Plus,
[01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:58.100]   except that it's the same movie.
[01:45:58.100 --> 01:45:59.500]   (laughing)
[01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:00.420]   Same movie.
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:01.620]   - Outstanding.
[01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:06.020]   - Every time, every freaking time.
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:07.980]   How do I get out of this?
[01:46:07.980 --> 01:46:10.780]   I wanna go back, here we go.
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:11.820]   What else you got?
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:14.940]   Original originals, kind of originals.
[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:16.700]   (laughing)
[01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:18.400]   Unoriginal originals.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:24.100]   Top 10 in US, full proof, full proof, full proof.
[01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:25.220]   - This is brilliant.
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:26.660]   - Full proof.
[01:46:26.660 --> 01:46:27.740]   - It's good, it's good.
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:28.740]   - Full proof.
[01:46:28.740 --> 01:46:34.900]   Oh, I just violated the,
[01:46:34.900 --> 01:46:36.740]   violated copyright.
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:37.860]   We're using a site you're creating

[01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:50.860]   - Oh, rats.
[01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:51.940]   - Well, we didn't watch the movie,
[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:53.860]   I'm just showing the site.
[01:46:53.860 --> 01:46:55.340]   I can't take it down for that.
[01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:57.820]   - Well, it's just like, you're Google
[01:46:57.820 --> 01:46:59.580]   and you've promoted it and then they're gonna come after you.
[01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:00.580]   It's just like Australia.
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:01.380]   - Right.
[01:47:01.380 --> 01:47:06.180]   Everybody go to mintmobileplus.com, that's just great.
[01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:09.060]   It doesn't even have an ad for Mint Mobile or anything.
[01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:10.060]   - Or gin.
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:11.060]   - Or gin.
[01:47:11.060 --> 01:47:12.020]   (laughing)
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:12.860]   Or anything.
[01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:14.500]   - For real lost opportunity.
[01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:16.540]   (laughing)
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:20.660]   - So, you wrote a piece on Buzz Machine,
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:23.300]   Jeff, about the YouTube convention.
[01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:24.820]   - I also wrote it on Medium, but you could
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:26.140]   pissed at me if you went there,
[01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:27.220]   so I put it up the Buzz Machine.
[01:47:27.220 --> 01:47:29.060]   - I pay five bucks to have--
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:30.900]   - You do now, oh good boy.
[01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:33.420]   - I like, there's enough good stuff there.
[01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:35.180]   I wanna support it.
[01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:38.500]   But it's interesting because here we are,
[01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:42.060]   and this is not, I don't, this is not part of the content,
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:44.580]   'cause there'll be a Republican convention next week.
[01:47:44.580 --> 01:47:46.180]   But here we are in an era where you can't really
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:49.340]   do a convention, how do you simulate,
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:52.420]   'cause conventions historically are a big bump
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:55.100]   for the party, it's like a big long,
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:58.300]   week long ad on television.
[01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:00.020]   So how do you get all that gin up,
[01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:02.420]   all that excitement, get all that attention,
[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:04.660]   and you call it the YouTube convention?
[01:48:04.660 --> 01:48:06.500]   - Did it work?
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:07.420]   - I think it's appropriate to the age.
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:10.620]   I think so, if you watch Michelle Obama,
[01:48:10.620 --> 01:48:12.180]   I mean, what I mean by YouTube too,
[01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:13.900]   is the intimacy of it.
[01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:16.500]   You watch you, Michelle Obama, and she's just talking to you.
[01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:17.340]   - Yeah.
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:18.860]   - She's not talking for television camera,
[01:48:18.860 --> 01:48:21.580]   she's not talking for a huge cheering crowd,
[01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:24.380]   she's not doing all that, she's talking to you.
[01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:25.220]   - Yeah.
[01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:28.380]   - And then I saw a clip of Hillary Clinton closing
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:29.220]   the nominations and the nominee.
[01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:30.060]   - It's very different.
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:32.900]   - Obama, and the noise and all this and all that.
[01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:36.540]   That was just, it was a BS thing that was made
[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:38.980]   for television, but the next generation
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:40.940]   is a YouTube generation, and they didn't try it this way,
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:41.780]   they had to do it, right?
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:44.300]   They were forced into it by the pandemic.
[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:49.300]   But I found it fascinating that it really is appropriate
[01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:54.380]   to the time and is more conversational in a way,
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:57.740]   'cause you can, rather than just applauding,
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:00.260]   you can talk about it on Twitter, you can send it around,
[01:49:00.260 --> 01:49:01.860]   you can't believe it's your own convention.
[01:49:01.860 --> 01:49:06.340]   - In fact, it's one thing, and Joe Biden's having
[01:49:06.340 --> 01:49:07.500]   a little difficulty with this,
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:09.300]   the older Pauls are having a little different
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:11.220]   difficulty, not declining.
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:13.500]   Bernie Sanders shattered the whole time,
[01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:15.780]   'cause they're used to giving speeches.
[01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:19.380]   And so it's the younger people who had a little bit more,
[01:49:19.380 --> 01:49:23.140]   a little more comfort with, Michelle Obama was a good example,
[01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:24.260]   and actually you'd expect her,
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:25.740]   but she's not a politician, is she?
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:28.860]   So maybe that's why she was able to do it, but she--
[01:49:28.860 --> 01:49:32.500]   - Although it was late, and then last night
[01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:34.220]   they had the roll call of the stage,
[01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:36.420]   which was the most boring thing.
[01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:39.100]   It was great, and then Calamari in Rhode Island.
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:39.940]   - Yeah, it was brilliant.
[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:42.500]   So when I was telling Lisa, Lisa and I were watching it,
[01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:47.580]   and when I was a kid, I was such a politics nerd.
[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:49.740]   I would actually get graph paper,
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:51.980]   and I would put all the states, and I would write poems,
[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:54.020]   'cause this is back, and when a convention,
[01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:56.540]   you might have multiple, it wasn't decided
[01:49:56.540 --> 01:49:58.380]   by the time you got to the convention.
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:49:59.580]   So you'd have multiple votes,
[01:49:59.580 --> 01:50:01.820]   and there'd be a lot of politicking in between.
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:03.940]   It was really the smoke-filled room,
[01:50:03.940 --> 01:50:05.180]   and so it was really fun,
[01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:07.020]   and as a kid, I remember staying up late,
[01:50:07.020 --> 01:50:08.780]   and he said, "Oh, he's almost got enough."
[01:50:08.780 --> 01:50:10.700]   It was really exciting, but that's--
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:11.540]   - Well-- - Of late,
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:12.580]   that's all been gone.
[01:50:12.580 --> 01:50:16.100]   It's all very, very much stage-managed,
[01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:17.940]   and this was stage-managed,
[01:50:17.940 --> 01:50:20.100]   but at least we got to see the states.
[01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:22.700]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:24.980]   - It was-- - And also they had a time limit,
[01:50:24.980 --> 01:50:27.080]   so it wasn't gonna go on forever.
[01:50:27.080 --> 01:50:30.380]   - Carson's making an excellent point.
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:33.180]   He's channeling it right now, let me hear it.
[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:34.500]   He says, and I agree with him,
[01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:38.180]   the use of celebration when he crossed the threshold
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:40.180]   was a little bit cringy, I agree.
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:43.580]   And they couldn't do a bloon drop,
[01:50:43.580 --> 01:50:47.540]   and honestly, Uncle Joe didn't really know what to do.
[01:50:47.540 --> 01:50:50.980]   - It's different if you're standing on a stage,
[01:50:50.980 --> 01:50:53.580]   actually though, the candidate's never at the convention
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:55.260]   when he gets nominated.
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:56.980]   - And it's only been in recent years,
[01:50:56.980 --> 01:51:01.700]   you've had a TV feed, and years passed as a well.
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:05.660]   Senator Kennedy will be here in two days to give his speech.
[01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:07.620]   He has to take the train out,
[01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:09.900]   and that would be it, you wouldn't see.
[01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:11.860]   So it's always been a little cringy
[01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:14.780]   since they've started having these TV feeds of the candidate,
[01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:17.140]   but Joe just didn't really know,
[01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:18.860]   he started picking at his pants at one point,
[01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:20.300]   I was like, you didn't know what to do.
[01:51:20.300 --> 01:51:22.780]   (laughing)
[01:51:22.780 --> 01:51:25.060]   But the family came in, they threw confetti,
[01:51:25.060 --> 01:51:28.060]   bless his heart, it was a bless his heart moment.
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:29.460]   - Hot-putter Joe says they should have done
[01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:31.940]   a tricaster virtual bloon drop.
[01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:34.220]   - We have had bloon drops, we can do it,
[01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:36.140]   we should have, they should have asked us for some help.
[01:51:36.140 --> 01:51:38.140]   - First Kevin, where's Mr. Kevin?
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:39.140]   - I think they did a very,
[01:51:39.140 --> 01:51:41.820]   I think they did, given the limitations of what they could do,
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:44.020]   it was a little bit, but it always is,
[01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:45.020]   isn't it a little bit permaculae?
[01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:46.100]   - Yeah, it's always good.
[01:51:46.100 --> 01:51:49.140]   - But it was, I thought it was surprisingly engaging.
[01:51:49.140 --> 01:51:52.700]   - Yeah, yeah, and that's why I think it was really appropriate
[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:54.540]   to the time, so that's what I wanted to say about it.
[01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:55.380]   I was fascinated.
[01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:59.100]   And the other good news is you don't have 15,000,
[01:51:59.100 --> 01:52:03.260]   in recent years, they have sent 15,000 journalists
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:04.100]   to the convention.
[01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:06.020]   - Geez. - Where no news occurs.
[01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:06.860]   - Right.
[01:52:06.860 --> 01:52:11.100]   - Where they just all pontificate and predict and postulate.
[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:15.060]   And it's a huge waste of resource in journalism.
[01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:17.340]   And so I think it's a good thing all around.
[01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:21.060]   - I don't you remember Dan Rather, 68,
[01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:24.100]   he had the backpack with an antenna.
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:26.140]   And he was down on the floor and he's looking up
[01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:29.020]   at the sky booth, 'cause all the networks had a sky booth.
[01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:31.300]   And Frank McGee, or whoever was sitting there,
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:33.420]   and Dan, what's going on on the floor?
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:36.740]   And he's standing in the, I'm standing with the Chicago,
[01:52:36.740 --> 01:52:40.140]   the Illinois delegation, and Mayor Daley
[01:52:40.140 --> 01:52:41.740]   is beating up somebody here.
[01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:44.380]   And there was, there was, there was,
[01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:46.340]   there was, he was getting roughed up down there and stuff.
[01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:48.220]   That was wild.
[01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:50.260]   Then there was some news being made at that time.
[01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:51.100]   - That was the last time.
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:52.900]   That was, there was too much news in '68,
[01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:54.420]   so there's gonna never be news again.
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:52:55.420]   - Yeah.
[01:52:55.420 --> 01:52:59.860]   - So I think we're over, we're over that spectacle.
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:00.700]   - Wow.
[01:53:02.340 --> 01:53:04.460]   - I don't know what Trump's gonna, 'cause Trump dies
[01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:05.300]   for the spectacle, right?
[01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:06.860]   He is of the spectacle.
[01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:08.420]   - Well, what do you think, so next week,
[01:53:08.420 --> 01:53:10.980]   are they, will, this will be actually, if anything,
[01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:13.620]   the only thing that'll be interesting to me and you,
[01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:18.060]   will be the comparison between how they use the technology
[01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:20.460]   and so forth, I think it'd be very interesting.
[01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:25.100]   All right, let's get the drums, let's get the music,
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:28.820]   let's roll the tape, let's have a spectacle please.
[01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:29.980]   - I know.
[01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:31.340]   - It's time for a balloon drop.
[01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:33.900]   - It's time for the virtual balloon drop
[01:53:33.900 --> 01:53:36.060]   of the Google change log.
[01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:37.300]   (siren wailing)
[01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:39.540]   - The Google change log.
[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:42.300]   (dramatic music)
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:47.580]   - Well, this is bad news, but it's only a rumor,
[01:53:47.580 --> 01:53:50.020]   so don't get too disappointed
[01:53:50.020 --> 01:53:51.860]   but according to XDA developers,
[01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:56.660]   Google's planning to phase out Google Duo
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:59.140]   in favor of Google meets.
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:03.060]   - This should not surprise anybody.
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:07.900]   - I just got everyone I know to use Duo.
[01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:09.900]   - You're joking, right?
[01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:12.980]   - No, no, you're serious?
[01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:13.820]   You really did?
[01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:18.380]   - Yes, my parents, my friends who call to help me with things.
[01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:21.140]   - That's what my family uses this Duo.
[01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:24.780]   Don't get depressed, it's gonna take a couple of years.
[01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:29.660]   Google issued the following statement in response,
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:31.780]   "We are fully invested in Duo,"
[01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:33.460]   which is seen as astonishing growth
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:35.380]   during the pandemic, people all around the world
[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:38.180]   are relying on video calling more than ever.
[01:54:38.180 --> 01:54:40.380]   We have no plans to interrupt that.
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:42.740]   We're adding new features.
[01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:44.100]   - We kill everything we make.
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:46.340]   We kill all our babies, so yes, it'll go someday
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:47.740]   when you least expect them.
[01:54:47.740 --> 01:54:51.860]   - Now this is why the rumor,
[01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:54.540]   and it comes from nine to five Google,
[01:54:54.540 --> 01:54:58.180]   Javier Sultero, who leads the G Suite,
[01:54:58.180 --> 01:55:01.300]   has been brought in to run Duo and Meet,
[01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:05.700]   and apparently feels like we don't really need both Duo
[01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:09.780]   and Meet, so he's spearheading an initiative known as Duet,
[01:55:09.780 --> 01:55:13.660]   which is, of course, an omnibus of Duo and Meet,
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:16.780]   that will see some of Duo's features integrated into Meet.
[01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:22.900]   But Google says we brought the Duo organization
[01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:25.940]   under Javier Sultero's leadership in May,
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:27.860]   and it follows, we're looking at ways
[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:30.380]   that our video calling products can improve
[01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:32.780]   alongside one another, so it's a little bit
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:34.260]   of a non-denial denial.
[01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:36.700]   - They never-- - They hate him.
[01:55:36.700 --> 01:55:38.860]   - Yeah, you knew it.
[01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:40.180]   (laughing)
[01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:41.900]   - You knew it was just that. - I hate that.
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:43.980]   - You knew. - Nah.
[01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.860]   - So the other thing-- - At least they're consistent.
[01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:47.940]   - The other thing, yeah, that actually,
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:49.740]   the other story that you came out today that got,
[01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:52.700]   was part of the reason I got myself a Google
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:57.700]   Nest Hub Max is they have now multi-room audio control
[01:55:57.700 --> 01:56:01.180]   from the Nest directly.
[01:56:01.180 --> 01:56:03.700]   You can already manually group Nest devices
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:05.180]   and the Nest speaker isn't that good,
[01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:07.860]   but if you have, for instance,
[01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:10.740]   Google Home attached to a speaker in some way,
[01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:14.820]   whether via Chromecast, Android TV or that kind of thing,
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:17.700]   smart displays, Chromecast and speakers,
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:21.340]   can all be multi-cast enabled in real time
[01:56:21.340 --> 01:56:22.900]   to fill multiple rooms of music.
[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:25.300]   This was the secret sauce of Sonos,
[01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:27.860]   and I have to say, I'm never buying
[01:56:27.860 --> 01:56:29.300]   another Sonos product again.
[01:56:29.300 --> 01:56:30.980]   It's now just a mess.
[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:33.380]   (laughing)
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:35.140]   Oh, why are you laughing so hard?
[01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:38.260]   I spent, how many tens of thousands of dollars?
[01:56:38.260 --> 01:56:39.740]   - I could've told you when you bought 'em.
[01:56:39.740 --> 01:56:41.820]   - Oh, I should've known.
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:43.420]   - Yeah, I should've listened to me.
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:45.940]   - You'll be able to stereo pair two Nest Mini
[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:49.220]   or Google Home Max devices for room filling,
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:50.780]   and I'm putting that in quotes,
[01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:53.260]   if you're in a closet maybe,
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:56.740]   sound and more immersive left and right channel separation.
[01:56:56.740 --> 01:56:59.660]   You can also do a stream transfer.
[01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:01.980]   You can, this is kind of cool.
[01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:04.180]   Amazon's Echo does this,
[01:57:04.180 --> 01:57:05.500]   where you can say, I'm moving to the living
[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:07.940]   or move the music over there with me.
[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:11.380]   You can get music from YouTube, music and Spotify premium
[01:57:11.380 --> 01:57:14.620]   and ask them to recommend music as well.
[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:17.300]   So this is good, this is good.
[01:57:17.300 --> 01:57:19.500]   This is another, I love seeing,
[01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:21.820]   and I hope that they continue to do this more features
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:23.460]   built into this Nest up Max,
[01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:26.240]   'cause I want it to be Mini Carsten.
[01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:28.420]   And it's gonna.
[01:57:28.420 --> 01:57:31.060]   - Carsten, watch out, your days are numbered.
[01:57:31.060 --> 01:57:32.060]   - It's Mini Carsten.
[01:57:32.060 --> 01:57:36.300]   - You're gonna be replaced by a machine with a bow tie.
[01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:40.340]   - Mini Carsten, how about a robot that turns your picture
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:45.340]   into manga or a vest that helps navigate,
[01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:51.180]   oh, this is Nest Navigate,
[01:57:51.180 --> 01:57:53.060]   helps people navigate or gloves that transmit
[01:57:53.060 --> 01:57:55.100]   the feeling of bird songs.
[01:57:55.100 --> 01:57:57.420]   Some of the finalist projects presented
[01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:00.700]   in New Orleans during the ACM symposium
[01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:04.260]   on user interface software and technology
[01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:06.980]   and their student innovation contest.
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:09.940]   And there's a nice video on the Google keyword blog
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:12.660]   of some of this innovation.
[01:58:12.660 --> 01:58:17.660]   So, see, feel and hear the invisible.
[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:21.420]   It's kinda cool.
[01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:23.540]   - That is pretty cool.
[01:58:23.540 --> 01:58:25.220]   Makes me think about,
[01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:27.420]   there's a documentary I've been watching
[01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:29.660]   that's talking about synesthesia
[01:58:29.660 --> 01:58:33.180]   and how people with this particular brain disorder
[01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:37.900]   can see colors based on what they feel and hear.
[01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:38.740]   - Things like that.
[01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:41.460]   - Nine finalist teams had three months to use these kits
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:45.180]   to create interactive experiences with cardboard prototypes.
[01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:46.420]   There were two types of awards,
[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:50.620]   the People's Choice Awards and the Juries Choice Award.
[01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:53.460]   The Juries Choice went to team visionaries,
[01:58:53.460 --> 01:58:57.380]   Dennis Dietz, Stefan Longer, Carol Schmidt, Daniel Neumann,
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:59:01.300]   and Felix Dietz from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich
[01:59:01.300 --> 01:59:04.700]   in Germany, they developed a haptic vest
[01:59:04.700 --> 01:59:08.420]   that had a camera for visually impaired people,
[01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:09.940]   vibration sensors in the back,
[01:59:09.940 --> 01:59:12.140]   it detects objects in front
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:14.380]   so they can navigate around these obstacles,
[01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:16.740]   feeling it instead of seeing it.
[01:59:16.740 --> 01:59:19.060]   So, that was the Juries finalist.
[01:59:19.060 --> 01:59:20.980]   I don't know who the People's Award winner was,
[01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:23.220]   I don't know if they said that.
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:24.820]   But that's pretty cool.
[01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:29.620]   - Up time for Martuni.
[01:59:29.620 --> 01:59:33.260]   - What are you doing?
[01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:34.260]   - Sorry.
[01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:35.620]   - Is that a shaker?
[01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:37.620]   - It was a shaker of ice, sorry.
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:39.180]   - And what else is in there?
[01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:40.940]   - I thought I hit mute.
[01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:41.780]   - What else is in there?
[01:59:41.780 --> 01:59:43.100]   - Is this my water?
[01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:44.940]   - Aww, I thought I hit mute, I'm sorry.
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:45.780]   - I thought I hit mute, I'm sorry.
[01:59:45.780 --> 01:59:46.820]   - I'm curious typing of a tweet.
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:48.940]   - I thought I was a Martuni on the way
[01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:50.420]   and I could have used one.
[01:59:50.420 --> 01:59:52.660]   - I'm sorry.
[01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:55.540]   - Google Travel has now pandemic related travel
[01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:57.060]   planning information.
[01:59:57.060 --> 01:59:59.060]   When you do that search,
[01:59:59.060 --> 02:00:02.380]   you'll get information about COVID-19 trends,
[02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:04.740]   you'll get information about whether cancellations
[02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:07.580]   are offered, lots of information.
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:09.580]   That's took them a while, I get that.
[02:00:09.580 --> 02:00:10.800]   But now it's there.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:12.540]   I guess.
[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:13.980]   - You're doing a lot of good things in other ways.
[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:15.900]   I mean, they have the business updates
[02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:17.260]   that let you know like,
[02:00:17.260 --> 02:00:18.900]   hey, has someone actually come in
[02:00:18.900 --> 02:00:20.860]   and updated this information because of COVID?
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:22.580]   - Oh, that's good, that's helpful.
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:24.060]   - Yeah, we should update our information
[02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:25.480]   like you can't come in.
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:29.700]   Google Maps is getting a lot more detail.
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:32.740]   You'll be able to better see natural features.
[02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:34.420]   Streets will be easier to navigate.
[02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:37.140]   Here's an example on Iceland,
[02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:40.140]   a new map design does a better job distinguishing
[02:00:40.140 --> 02:00:43.100]   between the ice caps and the greenery.
[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:46.220]   So you can actually now see those ice caps.
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:48.580]   Google says it uses satellite imagery
[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:50.780]   as the basis for the redesign maps.
[02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:54.020]   And it has a new color mapping algorithmic technique.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:56.500]   So here's the before,
[02:00:56.500 --> 02:00:58.300]   actually here's a before,
[02:00:58.300 --> 02:00:59.500]   and here's the after.
[02:00:59.500 --> 02:01:01.940]   - What kind of like before about our cleaner?
[02:01:01.940 --> 02:01:03.820]   - Before makes Iceland look like it's all ice,
[02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:04.980]   which is not.
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:05.820]   - That's right.
[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:07.500]   - It's a little ice. - Space.
[02:01:07.500 --> 02:01:09.580]   - Makes it look more like Greenland.
[02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:10.420]   (laughs)
[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:12.380]   So that's, I guess. - Really short.
[02:01:12.380 --> 02:01:13.220]   - How about this?
[02:01:13.220 --> 02:01:16.380]   Here's, you can see vegetation
[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:17.940]   on the northern coast of Morocco.
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:20.020]   So this is not satellite imagery.
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:24.820]   It's just the non-satellite map imagery enhanced.
[02:01:24.820 --> 02:01:25.860]   So you can see that,
[02:01:25.860 --> 02:01:27.580]   I think that's interesting because
[02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:30.700]   you wouldn't necessarily assume that northern Morocco
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:33.900]   would be that green, you know, but it is.
[02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:35.020]   It is.
[02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:36.340]   - Yeah, I'm all for this.
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:37.180]   I love maps.
[02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:39.580]   - This is Mount Rainier National Park.
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:42.100]   And now you can see elevations a little bit better mountain.
[02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:43.860]   You can see where the mountain is for one thing.
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:44.700]   See that?
[02:01:44.700 --> 02:01:46.620]   There's the mountain.
[02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:51.380]   So here's the Croatian coast.
[02:01:51.380 --> 02:01:52.940]   Next time you're going to split,
[02:01:52.940 --> 02:01:55.300]   you can tell that they're seeing the beaches
[02:01:55.300 --> 02:01:57.340]   and the greenery because the beaches are brown
[02:01:57.340 --> 02:01:58.540]   and the greenery is green.
[02:01:58.540 --> 02:01:59.980]   Oh, that's nice.
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:01.980]   Now I know where there's a beach.
[02:02:01.980 --> 02:02:03.260]   - Like that.
[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:04.420]   - Thank you, Google maps.
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:05.740]   - All right, I stand right.
[02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:07.500]   - Thank you, Google maps.
[02:02:07.500 --> 02:02:09.620]   - I wanna hear Ant on the next one.
[02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:12.100]   - Street View in London, New York and San Francisco
[02:02:12.100 --> 02:02:15.340]   will also show off more detail.
[02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:16.540]   So just so you know.
[02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:19.100]   Yeah, Ant might not like this so much.
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:20.660]   In the past on Android,
[02:02:20.660 --> 02:02:24.740]   if you had a third party app that needed to take a picture,
[02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:27.380]   you would often have a choice between a variety of cameras.
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:30.820]   Android 11, Google says for security reasons,
[02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:32.500]   is taking away the camera picker.
[02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:36.820]   You will only be able to use the built-in camera
[02:02:36.820 --> 02:02:39.500]   from now on.
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:40.980]   - I see nothing wrong with that.
[02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:44.620]   - Yeah, I wanted to hear what you thought.
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:45.700]   - I see nothing wrong with that.
[02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:49.020]   The stock software that Google has put together
[02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:52.300]   for photography, it works really well
[02:02:52.300 --> 02:02:54.580]   for just about whatever you need to do,
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:58.140]   where this just snapping the copy of a receipt
[02:02:58.140 --> 02:02:59.420]   for an expense or something,
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:02.460]   or wanting to go out here and capture the sunset
[02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:06.460]   on this fine hot Northern California evening
[02:03:06.460 --> 02:03:09.300]   and be able to get out of the beautiful high dynamic range,
[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:11.740]   even though you didn't necessarily try to do the camera
[02:03:11.740 --> 02:03:13.700]   and do you want it to add and boom, it just did it
[02:03:13.700 --> 02:03:16.620]   and it clicked, so yeah, just leave it as it is.
[02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:19.300]   - Google says, "Go over to do this, no one would complain."
[02:03:19.300 --> 02:03:20.460]   - I think Apple does do that.
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:24.140]   I don't think you ever gonna choose a third party app.
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:27.020]   Google says for privacy and security,
[02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:28.860]   maybe there were malicious camera apps
[02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:30.020]   or something like that.
[02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:33.740]   Carson does point out that this is a problem
[02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:37.500]   for Photoshop camera, which Adobe put out just recently,
[02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:38.340]   which is a really--
[02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:40.540]   - Yep, you put it out last November.
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:42.220]   - You didn't like it that much, I know.
[02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:43.060]   - No, sir.
[02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:44.540]   - It's not my style.
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:46.620]   - You don't like popsicles in my pictures,
[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:47.860]   I remember that much.
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:49.580]   (laughing)
[02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:50.340]   - Right.
[02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:53.220]   - But you still can use, not that you can't use it,
[02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:56.060]   it's that it won't show up in the camera picker
[02:03:57.540 --> 02:04:00.500]   when you wanna, if it's, you know,
[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:02.220]   you're asking, it's asking for a picture
[02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:05.420]   and you wanted to try a different camera
[02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:07.540]   or maybe you're using this, you wanna use this app.
[02:04:07.540 --> 02:04:09.540]   - If you're inside a Photoshop camera,
[02:04:09.540 --> 02:04:11.380]   you're giving that application--
[02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:14.180]   - Yeah, you're already-- - to your physical camera.
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:15.300]   - Exactly, exactly.
[02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:19.260]   I deleted that popsicle picture 'cause of you.
[02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:20.580]   - Thank you.
[02:04:20.580 --> 02:04:22.980]   (laughing)
[02:04:23.980 --> 02:04:27.020]   - Finally, search is gonna get better.
[02:04:27.020 --> 02:04:31.620]   This is gonna really piss off somebody
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:35.660]   finding jobs, recipes, and products on search,
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:38.620]   they call them activity cards.
[02:04:38.620 --> 02:04:40.700]   They help you pick up where you left off in search
[02:04:40.700 --> 02:04:42.780]   and they're being updated now to focus on three
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:45.020]   or areas that are especially important.
[02:04:45.020 --> 02:04:49.100]   Jobs, recipes, and online shopping.
[02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:52.140]   So you can get products--
[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:53.500]   - Thank you, COVID-19.
[02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:55.580]   - Products from your activity.
[02:04:55.580 --> 02:04:57.940]   See that carousel right there?
[02:04:57.940 --> 02:04:59.620]   So if you've been searching for headphones,
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:01.260]   you might get a little carousel.
[02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:06.740]   Products you can really search.
[02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:09.380]   - Thank you, COVID-19, 'cause that's helpful right now.
[02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:11.460]   - Yeah, same thing for jobs.
[02:05:11.460 --> 02:05:13.380]   So--
[02:05:13.380 --> 02:05:14.700]   - Yeah, the recipes will be helpful.
[02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:15.540]   - You can actually--
[02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:17.540]   - I sometimes find good recipes and I'm like,
[02:05:17.540 --> 02:05:19.180]   oh, where'd I put that?
[02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:20.100]   - Exactly.
[02:05:20.100 --> 02:05:22.900]   - So once you search for jobs in a category,
[02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:23.740]   you can actually--
[02:05:23.740 --> 02:05:24.900]   you'll actually get a list of jobs
[02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:26.700]   and you can even turn on new job alerts.
[02:05:26.700 --> 02:05:29.140]   So it's gonna help you do that.
[02:05:29.140 --> 02:05:29.980]   Let's see.
[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:32.700]   You probably search for recipes.
[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:35.140]   When you have a favorite ingredient or dish you make often,
[02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:38.860]   you probably search for recipes for it again and again.
[02:05:38.860 --> 02:05:40.100]   To make meal planning easier,
[02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:42.180]   we're updating the recipes activity card
[02:05:42.180 --> 02:05:45.220]   to show you even more relevant recipes
[02:05:45.220 --> 02:05:46.740]   related to your query.
[02:05:46.740 --> 02:05:50.060]   So when you search for, as I often do, chicken breast,
[02:05:51.220 --> 02:05:53.580]   you'll get recipes you've recently visited,
[02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:56.380]   plus maybe some other recipes
[02:05:56.380 --> 02:05:58.740]   that you might wanna take a look at.
[02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:00.700]   - Oh, I thought I was gonna show me the recipes
[02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:02.260]   that I had recently been looking at.
[02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:03.300]   I don't want new recipes.
[02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:05.020]   I want the recipes that I've known.
[02:06:05.020 --> 02:06:06.020]   - That's exactly right.
[02:06:06.020 --> 02:06:08.940]   So it says, "You're related to activity.
[02:06:08.940 --> 02:06:10.340]   "Only you can see this.
[02:06:10.340 --> 02:06:13.740]   "These are recipes you've used in the past
[02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:15.900]   "when the same search, chicken breast.
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:17.900]   "But there will also be, as always,
[02:06:17.900 --> 02:06:19.940]   "more recipes you haven't seen."
[02:06:19.940 --> 02:06:21.380]   - More suggestions.
[02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:23.220]   Same way I haven't been curious.
[02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:25.380]   - Yeah, related to your previous searches.
[02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:26.900]   I think that's a nice feature.
[02:06:26.900 --> 02:06:31.820]   And I believe that concludes the Google change log.
[02:06:31.820 --> 02:06:34.580]   (dramatic music)
[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:37.820]   Says the chip log.
[02:06:37.820 --> 02:06:39.020]   - Taking a break, coming back,
[02:06:39.020 --> 02:06:41.220]   your picks of the week next,
[02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:43.700]   our show today brought to you quite literally by cash fly
[02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:47.580]   our content delivery network.
[02:06:47.580 --> 02:06:50.580]   It's been innovating on content delivery since 1999.
[02:06:50.580 --> 02:06:53.860]   We've been using them for at least 10 years.
[02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:56.420]   That's why when you click a link on our website
[02:06:56.420 --> 02:06:58.900]   or you go to a podcast application
[02:06:58.900 --> 02:07:01.140]   and you're downloading podcasts,
[02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:03.380]   it just comes right in.
[02:07:03.380 --> 02:07:07.300]   But there is a problem with a CDN.
[02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:10.580]   The cash fly has solved because how does that data
[02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:12.940]   get initially moved to the CDN?
[02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:15.260]   Well, you're copying it from your original source
[02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:17.460]   very commonly, S3.
[02:07:17.460 --> 02:07:20.340]   Now S3 Amazon's S3 charges for egress.
[02:07:20.340 --> 02:07:23.420]   So suddenly not only you have a CDN to pay for,
[02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:26.140]   but you also have an origin cost.
[02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:28.100]   And that can actually really add up.
[02:07:28.100 --> 02:07:31.500]   So cash fly has created SOS.
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:33.860]   Storage Optimization System.
[02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:37.780]   It's a dedicated storage space on cash fly just for you.
[02:07:37.780 --> 02:07:40.860]   Keeps your data and content closer to your customers
[02:07:40.860 --> 02:07:44.660]   without having to get it from a neighbor
[02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:48.500]   or competitor reducing your customer's experience.
[02:07:48.500 --> 02:07:49.820]   You're gonna save thousands a month
[02:07:49.820 --> 02:07:51.860]   by shielding your origin.
[02:07:51.860 --> 02:07:54.340]   They guarantee no cash misses.
[02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:55.260]   That's a big deal.
[02:07:55.260 --> 02:07:56.540]   That means your download speeds
[02:07:56.540 --> 02:07:58.100]   will be drastically improved.
[02:07:58.100 --> 02:08:02.500]   Your data transfer out fees will be significantly reduced.
[02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:07.500]   100% cash hits every single time with cash fly SOS.
[02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:09.580]   Once you're a cash fly customer,
[02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:11.980]   you can specify how much storage you need
[02:08:11.980 --> 02:08:14.220]   and you'll take care of the rest.
[02:08:14.220 --> 02:08:15.740]   Cash fly is rapidly expanding
[02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:18.020]   and adding new pops by the way all over the world.
[02:08:18.020 --> 02:08:22.180]   There's six new points of presence in South America.
[02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:25.380]   So that means they're serving 10 times
[02:08:25.380 --> 02:08:28.660]   the amount of traffic in Latin America over the last year.
[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:32.140]   You'll be very glad if you've got customers in Latin America.
[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:33.380]   That's fantastic news.
[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:34.300]   They've not only maintained,
[02:08:34.300 --> 02:08:37.180]   but drastically improved performance in the region.
[02:08:37.180 --> 02:08:39.980]   And they're of course taken on a much higher traffic load.
[02:08:39.980 --> 02:08:43.820]   So whether your users are in North America,
[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:46.580]   the Latem, the Caribbean, Amia or APAC,
[02:08:46.580 --> 02:08:50.500]   their goal is to constantly deliver quick
[02:08:50.500 --> 02:08:53.860]   and reliable content even in those hard to reach regions.
[02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:57.260]   You can expect consistency and performance everywhere
[02:08:57.260 --> 02:08:59.700]   in the Americas and everywhere else
[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:01.780]   because they're reliable throughput and scalability.
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:04.820]   They're five times faster than other CDNs.
[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:07.540]   And by the way, you never get that call
[02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:09.860]   and I always dreaded it in the middle of the night.
[02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:12.700]   The CDN's down never, not once.
[02:09:12.700 --> 02:09:17.220]   SOS is backed by cash flies 100% uptime SLA guarantee
[02:09:17.220 --> 02:09:20.300]   and it's industry leading global performance.
[02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:24.300]   Whether it's video streaming podcasts, digital downloads,
[02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:25.500]   software as a service,
[02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:28.620]   cash fly will scale to a global audience of any size,
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:31.380]   files will be delivered, lightning fast content
[02:09:31.380 --> 02:09:33.300]   will be delivered quickly and reliably
[02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:35.820]   without delays or timeouts.
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:39.100]   And cash fly can handle all kinds of traffic surges.
[02:09:39.100 --> 02:09:40.540]   Arc traffic is very peaky.
[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:42.820]   You know, when a show comes out, the lots of downloads
[02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:47.060]   then it trickles off, but we never, ever run out of room
[02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:48.500]   on cash fly.
[02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:50.540]   By the way, they've partnered, I wanna just mention this
[02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:53.460]   'cause I think it's really great with World Central Kitchen
[02:09:53.460 --> 02:09:54.460]   to help others in need.
[02:09:54.460 --> 02:09:57.900]   They've now, cash fly's now donated over $50,000
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:00.420]   and they have a goal of serving 300,000 warm meals
[02:10:00.420 --> 02:10:03.460]   to those who are struggling in these tough times
[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:04.660]   through World Central Kitchen.
[02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:07.020]   Thank you, cash fly, it's really great.
[02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:10.140]   With standard powerful throughput low latency,
[02:10:10.140 --> 02:10:13.700]   a high cash hit ratio and 100% uptime SLA,
[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:16.900]   cash fly is your go to CDN.
[02:10:16.900 --> 02:10:19.940]   Like cash fly's SOS, be your SOS.
[02:10:19.940 --> 02:10:21.660]   Right now, just for Twitch listeners,
[02:10:21.660 --> 02:10:24.180]   cash fly's giving away a complimentary detailed analysis
[02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:26.540]   of your current CDN bill and usage trends.
[02:10:26.540 --> 02:10:28.940]   If you're paying over more than you need to,
[02:10:28.940 --> 02:10:32.620]   in fact, many cases more than 20% more than you need to,
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:36.340]   you should check it out, twit.cash fly.com.
[02:10:36.340 --> 02:10:37.580]   They can really save you.
[02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:42.580]   They saved us a lot, twit.cash fly.com.
[02:10:42.580 --> 02:10:44.860]   And now the highlight of the show for me,
[02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:48.000]   Stacey's Pick of the Week.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:54.300]   Oh, mute, mute, mute, mute, mute.
[02:10:54.300 --> 02:10:56.100]   - If I'm muted, sorry.
[02:10:56.100 --> 02:10:58.820]   - Zoom moment. - Zoom moment.
[02:10:58.820 --> 02:11:02.180]   - Yeah, really, unmute your Zoom is on the bingo card.
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:04.140]   - Oh, I'm sorry, y'all.
[02:11:04.140 --> 02:11:05.660]   My dog is nuts. - Oh, that's fine.
[02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:08.020]   - Oh, that's fine. (laughs)
[02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:10.620]   - So I was, I'm a little confused
[02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:12.660]   because I think this is actually out,
[02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:14.980]   but it's still setting me the Indiegogo page.
[02:11:14.980 --> 02:11:19.140]   So I'm a little like, oh, I guess this may not be out,
[02:11:19.140 --> 02:11:20.380]   but it's about to be out,
[02:11:20.380 --> 02:11:22.820]   or you can buy one of 22 that's available now.
[02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:25.180]   So this is the firewall of gold.
[02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:28.300]   And firewall it makes an internet security device
[02:11:28.300 --> 02:11:30.220]   that you plug into your router.
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:34.140]   The gold is the new consumer version.
[02:11:34.140 --> 02:11:37.580]   And this is a device that we have tested out.
[02:11:37.580 --> 02:11:38.900]   We did not test out the gold.
[02:11:38.900 --> 02:11:43.020]   We tested out the blue, which was the enterprise version.
[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:46.260]   But the gold has, it does deep packet inspection.
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:49.620]   It is local on your network. - Oh, wow, really, wow.
[02:11:49.620 --> 02:11:52.500]   - What it's doing is it's basically monitoring
[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:55.100]   your network activity for weird discrepancies
[02:11:55.100 --> 02:11:56.700]   and insecure sites.
[02:11:56.700 --> 02:11:58.900]   When it finds them, it's into a notification.
[02:11:58.900 --> 02:12:00.980]   You can quarantine devices.
[02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:04.540]   It also has like a VPN and sub,
[02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:06.260]   let's see what else does it have.
[02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:08.580]   Oh, network segmentation,
[02:12:08.580 --> 02:12:11.540]   that's not 100% sold on it.
[02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:13.300]   It's got an ad blocker. - That's the kind of thing
[02:12:13.300 --> 02:12:16.420]   you'd want if you wanted to segment your IoT devices
[02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:19.220]   from the rest of your network, that kind of thing.
[02:12:19.220 --> 02:12:23.100]   - So this is a very powerful device.
[02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:27.140]   And the gold, like the red was the cheaper version
[02:12:27.140 --> 02:12:28.460]   that they had for consumers,
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:31.940]   but it was only for 100 megabit per second connections.
[02:12:31.940 --> 02:12:34.420]   And so it would slow down your network
[02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:36.220]   if you were using it on faster things,
[02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:39.500]   'cause it just didn't have a computing power to do the DPI.
[02:12:39.500 --> 02:12:45.420]   Now with gold, it's super fast and it's awesome.
[02:12:45.420 --> 02:12:46.700]   And I...
[02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:50.020]   - It can handle, they say up to three gigabits,
[02:12:50.020 --> 02:12:51.660]   which is fantastic.
[02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:54.220]   - Yeah, and I would say though, if you buy this,
[02:12:54.220 --> 02:12:56.180]   you should let people on your network know
[02:12:56.180 --> 02:12:58.380]   that you will be able to see the sites they go to
[02:12:58.380 --> 02:13:00.580]   as the person who's managing the network.
[02:13:00.580 --> 02:13:03.100]   - That's the dashboard shows that, huh?
[02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:06.140]   - So, I just, you know, like so your kids,
[02:13:06.140 --> 02:13:07.980]   you should be like, hey, yo, when you're going
[02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:10.900]   to those questionable sites, I know.
[02:13:10.900 --> 02:13:13.540]   - This looks roughly like the edge router X
[02:13:13.540 --> 02:13:15.980]   I've been using from Ubiquiti.
[02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:16.820]   - Yes, it is.
[02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:19.420]   It's a little friendlier than the Ubiquiti router.
[02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:20.420]   - That's not a friendlier.
[02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:21.260]   - Yeah.
[02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:24.260]   - Was that diplomatic of me?
[02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:26.340]   I thought that was diplomatic.
[02:13:26.340 --> 02:13:29.140]   - The advantage of the other router X is it's 50, 59 bucks.
[02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:30.780]   How much is this?
[02:13:30.780 --> 02:13:31.860]   - Okay, this is--
[02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:32.700]   - A little more.
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:36.380]   - You could buy it now for 396, so 400 bucks.
[02:13:36.380 --> 02:13:37.620]   - Yeah.
[02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:38.780]   - Yeah.
[02:13:38.780 --> 02:13:42.180]   - But for normal people, this is actually quite good.
[02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:43.220]   - I'm gonna have to address this
[02:13:43.220 --> 02:13:47.860]   'cause we're getting our whole home wired.
[02:13:47.860 --> 02:13:49.540]   We've got somebody coming out, we're gonna get it.
[02:13:49.540 --> 02:13:51.620]   We're gonna build a rack.
[02:13:51.620 --> 02:13:53.300]   We're gonna do the whole thing.
[02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:54.820]   And I think I'm really gonna have to need it
[02:13:54.820 --> 02:13:56.180]   as security appliance like this.
[02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:59.020]   I don't have to really start to look at these.
[02:13:59.020 --> 02:14:00.020]   - Yeah, this is a good one.
[02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:04.220]   We're actually, so we're testing the firewall gold right now,
[02:14:04.220 --> 02:14:07.340]   but we have tested the other one and really liked it.
[02:14:07.340 --> 02:14:10.020]   It did not impact network performance,
[02:14:10.020 --> 02:14:11.500]   which can sometimes happen.
[02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:13.700]   - It's kind of like a pie hole on steroids.
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:16.180]   - Yeah.
[02:14:16.180 --> 02:14:21.180]   And again, this is for people who don't wanna do,
[02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:24.780]   take a pie and download specialized software to it
[02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:26.740]   and manage all that themselves.
[02:14:26.740 --> 02:14:28.020]   - Well, it's more sophisticated.
[02:14:28.020 --> 02:14:32.500]   I mean, deep pack and inspection is a high end firewall feature.
[02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:34.260]   It means you can look into the packets
[02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:36.820]   and see what's going on there, which is.
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:39.260]   - But you need that for IoT stuff.
[02:14:39.260 --> 02:14:40.100]   - Yeah.
[02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:44.260]   - Well, I don't, that's the thesis anyway.
[02:14:44.260 --> 02:14:46.340]   - Yeah, this is really interesting.
[02:14:46.340 --> 02:14:47.980]   Yeah.
[02:14:47.980 --> 02:14:49.780]   Yeah, I'm torn.
[02:14:49.780 --> 02:14:52.060]   I mean, the other option is to go with the appliance
[02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:56.220]   running PF sense, which would be also less expensive.
[02:14:56.220 --> 02:14:59.500]   But I'm gonna have to do some research on this.
[02:14:59.500 --> 02:15:01.900]   - You know, if you want, I'm happy to hook you up with them
[02:15:01.900 --> 02:15:04.020]   and I'm sure they will send you.
[02:15:04.020 --> 02:15:05.500]   - I'm just gonna read your review.
[02:15:05.500 --> 02:15:07.220]   I don't do that, but I'll read your review
[02:15:07.220 --> 02:15:08.740]   and then I'll decide.
[02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:10.420]   - We send ours back and then buy them.
[02:15:10.420 --> 02:15:12.020]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:15:12.020 --> 02:15:14.820]   - That's, I'm like, I'm having this issue right now
[02:15:14.820 --> 02:15:17.500]   'cause I'm trying to install the leak monitoring systems
[02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:19.580]   and they're like, okay, we're gonna send a plumber
[02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:21.740]   out to install it, but we don't want it back.
[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:23.100]   And I'm like, you have to take it back.
[02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:24.740]   - Yeah, I know, I know.
[02:15:24.740 --> 02:15:25.580]   Yeah, I know.
[02:15:25.580 --> 02:15:29.100]   Either way would be a really good tool
[02:15:29.100 --> 02:15:32.020]   in building the Great Firewall of Stacey
[02:15:32.020 --> 02:15:34.100]   because it has geo IP filtering.
[02:15:34.100 --> 02:15:36.260]   So you could say, I don't want anything from China
[02:15:36.260 --> 02:15:38.020]   coming in my house.
[02:15:38.020 --> 02:15:41.980]   - I would then avoid like a good chunk of my smart home devices
[02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:43.380]   'cause a lot of them do talk,
[02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:45.460]   if they do take out data to show.
[02:15:45.460 --> 02:15:46.480]   - Oh, interesting.
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:49.100]   Forget TikTok.
[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:50.780]   What about your smart home device?
[02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:52.660]   - This is interesting.
[02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:54.340]   Yeah, I'm gonna look a lot at this.
[02:15:54.340 --> 02:15:56.620]   Firewall, it's on Indiegogo right now.
[02:15:56.620 --> 02:15:58.140]   We'll be $500.
[02:15:58.140 --> 02:16:02.140]   It's a deal right now, 396.
[02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:04.140]   And there's only 22 left.
[02:16:04.140 --> 02:16:06.540]   So hurry, hurry.
[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:09.780]   - Jeff, you got a number?
[02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:11.580]   - Yeah, I do.
[02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:14.580]   So while everybody in Elson Silicon Valley is saying,
[02:16:14.580 --> 02:16:16.660]   "Well, a year or so, we might come back."
[02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:18.780]   "Oh no, might not, don't pre-launch."
[02:16:18.780 --> 02:16:23.780]   Amazon is buying major property in six cities for offices,
[02:16:23.780 --> 02:16:25.300]   not just warehouses and stuff.
[02:16:25.300 --> 02:16:26.140]   - Wow.
[02:16:26.140 --> 02:16:29.140]   - And plans to put 3,500 new jobs into those places.
[02:16:29.140 --> 02:16:30.140]   - Yeah.
[02:16:30.140 --> 02:16:34.100]   Did you see, I mean, the S&P 500 is at a record high
[02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:37.500]   as of yesterday, higher than its February peak.
[02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:40.180]   So in other words, all of the loss of COVID
[02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:41.900]   completely wiped out.
[02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:46.900]   But if you subtract Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet
[02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:51.900]   and Microsoft, it's down 6%.
[02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:54.300]   - Wow.
[02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:57.060]   - All the growth in the S&P 500.
[02:16:57.060 --> 02:16:58.380]   - What's that tell you?
[02:16:58.380 --> 02:17:02.540]   - Yeah, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft.
[02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:07.180]   Those companies, Apple's now a $2 trillion company.
[02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:08.020]   It hit one million.
[02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:09.020]   - So Joe Scarborough's true.
[02:17:09.020 --> 02:17:11.140]   - Because he's gone all moral panic
[02:17:11.140 --> 02:17:12.860]   anti-tech company this morning.
[02:17:12.860 --> 02:17:14.460]   And he's starting to grow about it.
[02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:17.340]   - And I'm gonna remind people, imagine this pandemic
[02:17:17.340 --> 02:17:18.660]   without the internet.
[02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:19.500]   - Yeah.
[02:17:19.500 --> 02:17:20.340]   - And yes, they grew.
[02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:21.180]   - Of course they grew.
[02:17:21.180 --> 02:17:22.580]   - But yeah, of course they grew.
[02:17:22.580 --> 02:17:24.980]   And they provided the means to keep us in businesses
[02:17:24.980 --> 02:17:27.420]   as best we are and sane as best we are.
[02:17:27.420 --> 02:17:31.060]   And in the school and many of us in jobs.
[02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:33.100]   And yeah, so they grew.
[02:17:33.100 --> 02:17:34.000]   Yep, they grew.
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:38.980]   And I say that having some stock in some tech companies.
[02:17:40.380 --> 02:17:45.380]   Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft.
[02:17:45.380 --> 02:17:50.060]   Just remember those.
[02:17:50.060 --> 02:17:50.900]   - Power.
[02:17:50.900 --> 02:17:52.060]   - That's power.
[02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:52.900]   - And prove it.
[02:17:52.900 --> 02:17:53.740]   - Yep.
[02:17:53.740 --> 02:17:55.060]   - This thing of the week.
[02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:58.140]   - My thing of the week is two.
[02:17:58.140 --> 02:18:02.020]   First, quickly Adobe Max registration has opened up.
[02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:04.780]   I wanted to mention that because people have shared with me
[02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:07.060]   that they wish they could have gone to Adobe Max,
[02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:09.260]   but it cost too much for them to fly there and so on
[02:18:09.260 --> 02:18:10.100]   and so forth.
[02:18:10.100 --> 02:18:13.540]   So like everything else is free now.
[02:18:13.540 --> 02:18:15.380]   So go ahead and register and you can check out
[02:18:15.380 --> 02:18:19.220]   all the different online sessions that they will be offering
[02:18:19.220 --> 02:18:20.340]   to help walk you through.
[02:18:20.340 --> 02:18:22.460]   - You love that show, I know.
[02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:23.420]   - Creating content.
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:25.260]   Yes, I do love it.
[02:18:25.260 --> 02:18:28.620]   Still have Jason Levine and Lisa Carney and many others
[02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:32.300]   and Dave Clayton doing different shows.
[02:18:32.300 --> 02:18:35.900]   - Keanu Reeves, you left Keanu Reeves out.
[02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:38.420]   - Oh yeah, that's sort of the keynote stuff.
[02:18:38.420 --> 02:18:40.340]   But yeah, that's great.
[02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:56.480]   But I like the meat and t
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:05.160]   and the other one is a content creator and the other one is a maker.
[02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:10.200]   And the content creator's name is Justin, maybe.
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:15.760]   And the maker's name is, I can never say it, get her name right.
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:17.120]   - Brandy Obey.
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:19.080]   - Obey, obey.
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:24.640]   And I wanted to feature this because first off, Brandy is just freaking awesome.
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:30.040]   She's a fabricator and welder down in Brobridge, Louisiana.
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:34.200]   And Justin decided to start a YouTube channel
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:39.120]   and just document these makers like herself and his brand new channel.
[02:19:39.120 --> 02:19:41.120]   But he does some amazing work.
[02:19:41.120 --> 02:19:45.960]   If you look at this video, the work he did with it is just absolutely beautiful.
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:47.520]   And Brandy's story is great.
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:50.080]   Plus, he has that awesome cage and accent.
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:52.720]   - It's really nice to highlight people like this.
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:56.720]   You probably wouldn't see anywhere else.
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:58.080]   I think that's so great.
[02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:00.160]   This is where YouTube shines.
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:01.160]   - Yep.
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:02.640]   - Just really fantastic.
[02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:06.680]   - So check them out, Brandy Obey and Justin, maybe.
[02:20:06.680 --> 02:20:11.720]   I think his channel is called Call Me, maybe, M-A-B-I-E on YouTube.
[02:20:11.720 --> 02:20:16.320]   - Call Me, maybe, a documentary series of makers and craftsmen.
[02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:18.840]   He's only got 569 subscribers.
[02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:20.520]   Let's get that number up, folks.
[02:20:20.520 --> 02:20:21.520]   - Yeah, let's get it up.
[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:23.360]   - He does good work.
[02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:26.400]   - Bring the bell, hit the button, do the thing.
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:30.440]   Do the thing because, yeah, you want to know about these people.
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:31.840]   He just started out to be fair.
[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:32.840]   Chair makers.
[02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:33.840]   - Yeah, he just started.
[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:34.840]   - furniture.
[02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:35.840]   That's cool.
[02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:36.840]   That's cool.
[02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:37.840]   A channel for makers.
[02:20:37.840 --> 02:20:39.840]   Call Me, maybe, M-A-B-I-E.
[02:20:39.840 --> 02:20:42.560]   Nice, Aunt.
[02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:46.560]   We've got our mask of the week from Karsten.
[02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:50.880]   I'm confused because Karsten has posted a number of things.
[02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:59.320]   He got this handmade leather mask from a company called MIR Leather in Ukraine.
[02:20:59.320 --> 02:21:01.920]   As China, he writes, "Is to Alibaba.
[02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:04.920]   Ukraine is to Etsy for Karsten.
[02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:06.240]   Very comfortable.
[02:21:06.240 --> 02:21:08.680]   Comes with paper filters.
[02:21:08.680 --> 02:21:10.680]   Makes you look like you're insane."
[02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:12.040]   - Yeah, it does.
[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:13.040]   - Pretty much.
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:14.920]   - But fitting for Karsten.
[02:21:14.920 --> 02:21:17.840]   - Yeah, it's a nice leather mask.
[02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:20.400]   - It's like, yeah, you've been arrested by very evil police.
[02:21:20.400 --> 02:21:22.280]   - It really looks like you've got a muzzle on.
[02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:23.640]   It includes 10 filters.
[02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:25.600]   - Well, perfect for Karsten.
[02:21:25.600 --> 02:21:27.920]   - Yeah, you've just been arrested.
[02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:30.320]   - I have a quick mask story.
[02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:31.320]   - Yes.
[02:21:31.320 --> 02:21:36.840]   - I was out at the local hardware store this weekend walking around and the attendee saw
[02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:37.840]   me sort of looking around.
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:40.520]   I was like, can I help you find something?
[02:21:40.520 --> 02:21:45.320]   And I told them what I was looking for and pointed me where I need to go.
[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:49.480]   But before I left, they said, "Is your name Ant?"
[02:21:49.480 --> 02:21:53.640]   And considering I have nobody here, that maybe just freeze because I'm like, who the hell
[02:21:53.640 --> 02:21:55.040]   knows me here?
[02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:58.800]   But I still forgot that I had my twit mask on.
[02:21:58.800 --> 02:21:59.800]   - Ah.
[02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:03.720]   - And he's looked and he's like, "Are you Ant?"
[02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:05.080]   And he said, "I recognize you."
[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:06.520]   And it just sort of caught me off guard.
[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:10.960]   - So whatever we travel, Ant, whatever we travel again, I have been recognized because
[02:22:10.960 --> 02:22:21.600]   of this silly show in Sydney, in Munich, in London, in New York, in San Francisco.
[02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:22.600]   - It's kind of amazing.
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:23.600]   - It is.
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:26.000]   - I have a little bit recognized when I speak.
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.440]   - Oh, I know your voice.
[02:22:28.440 --> 02:22:29.960]   - I know my voice.
[02:22:29.960 --> 02:22:31.640]   And it's always at Google events.
[02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:32.640]   So it makes sense.
[02:22:32.640 --> 02:22:40.120]   - And if you ever see anybody like this walking around, run, run.
[02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:41.120]   - But after you say...
[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:42.120]   - It's a horror movie.
[02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:43.360]   - You look like Carsten.
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:45.800]   There he is in his leather.
[02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:48.760]   - He looks like Arsten's serial killer brother.
[02:22:48.760 --> 02:22:54.200]   - Yeah, and the room raider is going to give him a minus 10.
[02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:55.200]   This is too much going on.
[02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:57.680]   - He's got like four lava lamps.
[02:22:57.680 --> 02:23:00.080]   He's got a Webby award.
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:01.920]   He's also got an Emmy award.
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:05.120]   He's got pictures of Tilda in the background.
[02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:06.800]   Those are actually quite good.
[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:09.080]   It looks like a 3D printer.
[02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:11.160]   This is a mad...
[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:12.160]   - This is a mad...
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:14.040]   - Not just workshop.
[02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:15.720]   Is that a Hieronymus Bosch?
[02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:17.160]   I think it is right behind him.
[02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:18.160]   A trip to...
[02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:19.160]   - Yeah.
[02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:20.260]   - Holy cow.
[02:23:20.260 --> 02:23:24.720]   That's basically an illustration of Carsten's mind right there.
[02:23:24.720 --> 02:23:25.720]   - Yeah.
[02:23:25.720 --> 02:23:28.640]   - From mind of Carsten.
[02:23:28.640 --> 02:23:31.000]   As depicted by Hieronymus Bosch.
[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.920]   - Yeah, I love it.
[02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:33.920]   I love it.
[02:23:33.920 --> 02:23:40.800]   And then finally, because one Carsten segment would be too few, here's a YouTuber.
[02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:41.800]   You might like this.
[02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:43.640]   The Builds device is...
[02:23:43.640 --> 02:23:45.160]   It actually is a mask gun.
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:46.320]   - Oh, this was my favorite.
[02:23:46.320 --> 02:23:47.320]   I'm glad we're doing that.
[02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:52.320]   - It shoots a mask onto Karen's face.
[02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:55.800]   And that way, you don't have to deal with them.
[02:23:55.800 --> 02:24:00.080]   You just have to shoot a mask at them.
[02:24:00.080 --> 02:24:02.080]   I don't think it's a serious but...
[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:04.080]   - Could it be self-defense?
[02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:06.080]   - Look at that.
[02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:08.440]   Look at that.
[02:24:08.440 --> 02:24:11.600]   It's got little weights that wrap around the...
[02:24:11.600 --> 02:24:12.600]   Oh, you missed.
[02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:13.600]   - Oops.
[02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:16.720]   - By the way, I'm a little worried about how to beat up that...
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:20.760]   Oh, he's doing it himself.
[02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:21.760]   Holy cow.
[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:23.000]   - He's so excited to work.
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:24.000]   - He's so excited.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.000]   He's so excited.
[02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.080]   I shot myself with a mask.
[02:24:27.080 --> 02:24:29.080]   - I love it.
[02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:30.080]   - That's his...
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:32.040]   - Look at that surprise on his face.
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:33.040]   - That is great.
[02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:35.320]   - He thought he was going to be wounded.
[02:24:35.320 --> 02:24:37.080]   - That's one way of eating your own dog food.
[02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:38.080]   - So now is he not...
[02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:39.080]   - No, he's wearing safety goggles.
[02:24:39.080 --> 02:24:41.680]   - He's going at the beach to do it.
[02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:42.920]   - Oh, this is funny.
[02:24:42.920 --> 02:24:44.320]   - Oh, my geez.
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:45.320]   That's scary.
[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:46.320]   - This could be...
[02:24:46.320 --> 02:24:47.800]   Yeah, this could not end well.
[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:48.800]   - Wow.
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:52.800]   - This is youtube.com/chadgoesdeep.
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:55.800]   - Oh, my.
[02:24:55.800 --> 02:24:58.600]   - That is so awesome.
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:00.680]   Oh, my God.
[02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:02.400]   - That's crazy.
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:04.000]   Folks, we were out of time.
[02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:05.600]   We were out of stories.
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:06.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:07.760]   We were out a while ago.
[02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:09.760]   (both laughing)
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:13.320]   - Yeah, I don't know if I can do this later start time
[02:25:13.320 --> 02:25:14.320]   and go and play.
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:15.320]   - I'm sorry.
[02:25:15.320 --> 02:25:16.960]   It's my fault because we went way too long.
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:20.320]   So I'm going to cut the show size in half
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:22.720]   so that we will get you to your dinner
[02:25:22.720 --> 02:25:25.320]   or the church or wherever you're going on time.
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:27.680]   - Yeah, no, I'm like at 4.30.
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:29.160]   My brain just went...
[02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:30.160]   - That's fine.
[02:25:30.160 --> 02:25:32.280]   Mine goes for thump at about 9 a.m.
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:35.240]   So that's Stacy Higginbotham.
[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:36.960]   Stacy on IOT.com.

[02:25:45.960 --> 02:25:48.200]   - Jeff Jarvis is the...
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:49.160]   - That needs to be my new...
[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:52.280]   So in front of my name, Aaron Pelow over at Temple University,
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:53.520]   just did a little TikTok saying,
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:55.280]   "This is what he's doing on the YouTubes."
[02:25:55.280 --> 02:25:56.640]   And of course, that's what I do on this show.
[02:25:56.640 --> 02:25:57.960]   And that's what I do on YouTube too.
[02:25:57.960 --> 02:25:58.800]   - Is salute?
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:00.520]   - I think that's, yeah, salute is dumb.
[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:01.920]   I like Stacy's death.
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:03.800]   Good, the Stacy dance.
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:04.640]   - I'm not in school.
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:05.720]   - I'm not in school, I'll follow you too.
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:06.800]   - We'll do the Stacy dance.
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:08.320]   - Okay, bye, everybody stay safe.
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:09.640]   - Okay.
[02:26:09.640 --> 02:26:11.040]   - Jeff Jarvis is the...
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:13.760]   - I don't open my mouth like that.
[02:26:13.760 --> 02:26:15.520]   - Oh, okay, oh, sorry, okay.
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:16.920]   We need Stacy lessons.
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:18.400]   (laughing)
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:19.760]   - Jeff is the Leonard Taill Professor

[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:52.760]   He's got a son of the military.
[02:26:52.760 --> 02:26:55.200]   Do you salute your son when he shows up?
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:26:56.800]   - Negative, he salutes me.
[02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:58.320]   - That's right.
[02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:01.000]   He knows the chain of command.

[02:27:09.040 --> 02:27:10.880]   That's the bad news.
[02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:12.080]   No, the good news is--
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:13.440]   - Oh, I might spend the time with you.
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:14.280]   - Oh, thank you.

[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:17.480]   No, that should be our cutoff.
[02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:18.960]   - Until my brain just cuts right off.
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:20.240]   - Absolutely.
