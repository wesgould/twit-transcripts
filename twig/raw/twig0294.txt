[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.080]   Hate April first. Oh, I do too
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.640]   I hate it. I don't want to do it. Yeah, I could go away
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.320]   Jeff is the professor of journalism at the CUNY

[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.100]   Great to have you at once again. So it is April full. Should we just run through?
[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.920]   quickly
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.480]   There's calm.google which explains why Google was so hot to get the GTLDs
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.400]   In particular Google it's backwards Google it even works and
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:24.160]   Somebody tells me transform you can do in a browser. I mean, yeah, it's easy to make things backwards. Hey, we fixed it
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160]   Yeah
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.320]   I can
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   Yeah, now I fit my back now
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.920]   That's really weird something wrong
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.000]   There's something very wrong yeah, and when you click a link it doesn't like they have the Google plus link
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.600]   But it doesn't make it backwards. They could do that. I don't know why they don't
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.800]   But somebody told me if you look at the code, there's Yahoo backwards in there somewhere
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   So a little in joke
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.920]   That's one then of course the big one I thought was really great the Pac-Man
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.920]   Yeah, you guys talked about that last night
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.320]   I'm sure yep and shut it off on the phone as well. You can play Pac-Man if you just go to your maps.google.com
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:17.360]   You can play Pac-Man in your hometown. I'm playing it in Petaluma. Oh, quickly before blinky gets to me run for the river Pac-Man
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.720]   Oh, I just went I don't know where I am. Oh, yeah, you go off the edge. That's right. Oh
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.840]   It is kind of brilliant isn't it and listen to the sound drop the sound I've got the sound up. I don't know why
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.360]   Oh
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.880]   Now I heard that that's not the sound you want
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.640]   Why aren't I not sound is returned to good huh? Oh, here it is that little thing
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.080]   Now how do you feel do you have to license that sound?
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.280]   Yeah, sure they did. I mean it's it's Google. It's exactly yeah
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:56.400]   The sound Namco licensed it must I oh it's like an a way three nine one oh chip
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.920]   It's just one of the four things it can do so oh, yeah, you know what? That's a probably a good point
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:07.240]   It probably is built into the chip isn't it all right blinky come here, baby. I'm gonna eat you alive I
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:14.760]   Was really bad at this game so can we play this sort of map of London? Yeah, just much harder
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.440]   Sure sure let's let's go back to Google Maps. I think you can go anywhere
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.440]   I believe so
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.680]   Yes, you know what we really hard is one of these like suburban mazes where
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.200]   With there's no actual yeah, there's no out. Yeah, yeah, it works anywhere
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:39.280]   So play play a play Pac-man. I think this is nicely done. Yeah, I mean it's probably not that effect
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.280]   They probably reused the code because didn't they have a Google doodle that was a Pac-man. I believe they did look there's dead ends oh
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.920]   Man, this is hard
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:06:01.080]   They even brought Google even brought Pac-man into the ingress experience they did yeah, so if you're playing ingress you have Pac-man
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.240]   Yeah, this is nice this so this the point about this is it's not a stupid make fun of people thing. I know
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.840]   This one people's expression was something playable that that that's yeah
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.040]   April Falls joke tradition that's actually good
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.820]   It's one of the things that Google's April Falls jokes are a mixture of 50%
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.000]   Cool bit like this and 50% painful. We just wrote something not very fun at all
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.840]   I like what Amazon's doing on their front page. This is their old
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.400]   1999 page, but then Amazon did something yesterday that I was sure
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.160]   Was an April Falls joke
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.640]   And it turned out not to be
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.320]   What is it called that's called the call the dash - -
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.760]   Button so if you go to Amazon.com slash - button if you're an Amazon Prime member
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.440]   You get a free button
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.880]   That you press it on orders
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:58.980]   Stuff for you. This is this is the most ridiculous thing and it comes with I guess overlays for the products
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.920]   You can buy so you stick it to your dish your clothes washer and you push it for tide or bounty
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.880]   Paper towels or huggies. What do you put that in your baby's butt?
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:16.860]   Gillette fusion, but now you can you only get one the total is that the problem here is toddlers
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.120]   Oh, crap. It's true. Totally is gonna walk around and press this button like a nice little noise and then
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.120]   We played it you're gonna go to your phone first
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.460]   You know, it's not it doesn't just like the Amazon you have the Amazon Echo same thing
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.460]   Are you talk? Actually, you don't have it. I don't anymore, but yeah, you talk to the Amazon Echo and when you say buy diapers
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.360]   It doesn't automatically buy them you have to in this case
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:43.280]   I think it you coach the app to do well. I think that it can I what happens is yeah
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.520]   I think I think that can be a direct what happens is that if you order it and then order it again
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.520]   It will send something to your phone. Oh
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.620]   And the other thing is that this is for prime members only and it's kind of an invitation only thing if they notice you make
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.520]   You're buying huggies all the time, right?
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:03.960]   And you're a prime member there contact you and say hey, you know, do you want to you want this?
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.960]   I said you so great, but I totally thought it was an April Fool's joke and it isn't it's I mean
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.480]   Imagine right now they have 18, but they're probably gonna have hundreds and of course the companies the brands behind this are gonna
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.800]   Really, oh so so when you order it you order it for particular brands. Yes, you get
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   It's they send you there's a glad button and they send it
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.800]   And I'm not putting the Laura bar button in our snack cupboard because that would get us
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:35.160]   The only place where I think this would be great is in the bathroom next to the toilet paper. Yeah, but you're sitting
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.360]   Come in time. Well with drone delivery
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:46.760]   I have one hour delivery now with drone delivery. You just have to sit there for an hour a few things to read. That's okay. Yeah
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.280]   And you have to like go and answer the door, right? Oh
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.640]   I see so it sends an order alert to your phone, but it does make the order yeah
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.440]   Unless you elect otherwise it responds only to your first press until the order is delivered
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:05.160]   You know, I would see the books because I have this problem where I see it a new book is coming out
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.320]   And I pre-order it and then
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.720]   Three months later. I see the same thing and I pre-order it and then when the book actually comes out I get to
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.720]   stack of them. Yeah, and you know
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:21.440]   But if I actually order physical books, you know better. Yeah, I do have several copies of a few books. You're exactly right
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:28.560]   So if they've actually done you know debouncing of orders over time, they should do that for deep bounce everything
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:34.280]   But you already bought that you want to try to tell you where in your house, so these are the brands
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.040]   I
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.320]   You know craft macaroni and cheese it's crap. Yeah, it's it's not I mean of course
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.680]   This is like mass market brand stuff. Yeah, it's big mass market brand stuff
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.600]   But of course there there are things that you order frequently all of them, right?
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.800]   So it's mostly consumables like you know paper towels and razor blades toilet paper
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.720]   I think I'm not sure if there's any food beyond the craft mac and cheese
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:03.960]   Actually, you know what I want this for. I want this for the water softener. I want to press the button. Yeah, I do too
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.440]   That's that's that would be useful. No, that would actually be handy. Yeah, there's not enough profit in that's a pain to go and go
[00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.080]   So this is kafunny because they have a patent on the one click
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.920]   I wonder if this counts if this is protected under the one click patent
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.960]   And must is it has that still extent when that was it seems like it was 20 years ago. It feels like it
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.200]   Anyway, this is not an April Fool's joke and I immediately
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.960]   uh
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:31.960]   Requested it, but I haven't I haven't gotten the email yet. So maybe I don't I buy a lot and subscribe and save
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.680]   When word water started writing it
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:40.360]   April Fool's joke about this for an indie web version of this and then then realized halfway through it was a good idea. I think
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.120]   Not a joke
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.120]   There is a long mashable post with all the April Fool's jokes, but I think people have finally gotten the message
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:57.560]   That there's some cruelty involved in really pranking people and and we haven't had to fight a lot of
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.640]   There's the project McFly hovering mouse
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:04.440]   Yeah
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.480]   Think he usually does some good April Fool's stuff. Do they have anything? Yeah
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:13.640]   Um wasn't unicorn meat was a good one. Oh, I like this. This is giving me hope for the world
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.640]   We actually are having a word learning the steam-powered gaming cabinet
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:23.960]   Ah, I'd buy that it's integrated steam engine power generator by burning coal or any other solid fuel
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.240]   You see a little and it works with steam OS of course flame in the window
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.200]   Only $3.99.99 by watt and newl
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.760]   Now you're playing with steam
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:46.040]   Think he always had some fun with these yeah, they got a bunch of them. Yeah. Yeah, that's where the tantan sleeping bag came from originally it was a joke
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.120]   And then uh people people said no, we really want it
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.920]   So they actually made it
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.680]   Uh, it looks like a unicorn horn, but actually it's I think this is real
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:03.880]   My favorite one is they have a they have this gigantic selfie stick that puts uh go pro cameras and 360 degrees around your head
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.960]   That may or may not be a joke. Do you see? Do you see the selfie shoe?
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:17.560]   This yeah, this was actually good. This was from a I think a shoe or company my my wife. I shoes miz moos
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:21.160]   Here's the selfie shoe
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:26.920]   More important than ever. Selfie sticks have helped in a better shot, but at the inconvenience of caring it
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.480]   At miss me. We understand the importance of looking great without giving up comfort
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:38.360]   The selfie stick is a great solution to a problem, but in turn it has created a new problem
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:43.800]   This was the opportunity for miss moos to create an even greater solution
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.600]   Introducing the selfie shoes
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.920]   No matter where you go, you'll always be camera ready just
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.000]   Raise it to the perfect angle
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.800]   You have to be able to kick like a rocket to do it. Yeah, to get the best range of angles
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.840]   We have also added a docking port on each shoe
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.040]   So you can get a photo from either your right or your
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:14.280]   The great thing about the selfie shoes. The funny thing is it looks like a big clown shoe
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.960]   Now both hands are free to be in the photo
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:25.320]   Finally super pumped about the selfie shoes with wearable devices on the horizon the possibilities are endless
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.960]   I like his cardboard moose head
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.320]   Yeah, that I buy
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.040]   I love the selfie shoe
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.520]   Love that
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:43.000]   To get a pair at miss moos.com/selfie shoes. All right. There's your plug miss moos. Why is my bell ringing?
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:50.200]   I hate I hate IOS 10 they we asked whether you can use my current location. I know it's time for the show
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.520]   I've got to not disturb turned on
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.400]   But but it's disturbing me
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.360]   All right, are we done with april fools? Can we move on please? Yes
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.640]   All right, we'll probably find some more before the shows
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.680]   Is that me?
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.640]   That's that's you. How is making that noise? Maybe it's oh, you know, it's the chat room every time they say my name
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.280]   Every time they say my name and they figured that out too
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:21.320]   Go go ahead. No, I just closed it
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:29.080]   You know what I rebuilt this machine and so some of the things that I had turned off. Yes, you lay up a job
[00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:40.200]   Google says this shocks me 5% of its site have ad injectors
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.720]   So the reason that this is of interest is of course we talked about
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:52.760]   Lenovo putting the komodo or komodia certificates in with true fish
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:15:00.040]   And that's an ad injector the idea being that as you surf around with true fish installed Lenovo since stopped doing this
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.960]   It would inject new ads onto pages. You're visiting ads that aren't there
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:08.920]   According to a study google conducted with the UC Berkeley 5 1 in 20
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.440]   Have at least one ad injector
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:18.600]   Is that so that that's that's malware that somebody got on the machine. No, that's the funny thing
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.640]   I call it malware. You call it malware
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:25.960]   It's uh, not really malware exactly
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.720]   Um, it's a
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.680]   Lenovo said this is as a convenience to our customers
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:36.840]   So there are 192 of these and they're killing them. They're they're basically pulling the plug on thank you google
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.000]   Yeah, so this is gonna you'll now have a warning
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.880]   Back way way way back in the day when i worked with konnie nast
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:48.360]   Worked for them. Uh, I think we were part of a big suit over this because there were there were browsers that would pull up ads
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.000]   on others sites
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.320]   And it was seen as a
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:58.440]   Copyright violation. Yeah, what is it? I mean, this is the framing issue. We should remember site framing
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.800]   That was that's one of these things that it's the people do over and over again
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:05.160]   So there was originally it would frames other sites but ads at the top
[00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.520]   Um, and and then there were other things the the dig bar with the dig bar
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:16.920]   Yeah, when dig went and did that and this week's one is nuzzle which does that on their android client, which is really annoying
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.880]   So they they'll you they stay look all your friends read this page and click on the page
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.920]   And it's not in your browser
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.880]   It's in their app and you can't actually get it the page underneath it
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:31.400]   And if you try and share it it shares their link a lot of people get bit by this, uh, if you if you download
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.640]   software from
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.560]   Uh, many of the downloads says I don't know if download.com doesn't add injector, but they do a lot of other stuff
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.880]   I'm not wouldn't be surprised if they did an ad injector
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:46.520]   Um, a lot of sites and they'll the reason we can't call it or I can call them out where but the reason it's not called malware is because
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.840]   usually
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.160]   There is a checkbox hidden somewhere that you checked and said yeah
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:58.600]   Yeah, I want that uh, this is on the way to doing what you actually want and they have an uninstall
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.480]   uh entry in the uh programs and features control panel on windows so
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:09.400]   Um, if if you do that then it's hard than any virus vendors and others are hard press to call it malware
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.920]   I don't give this Google Google even call it malware. No, they just say
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:17.080]   harmful programs harm where fine harm
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:20.840]   It's malware. Of course, it's malware
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.280]   And this study is going to come out in detail on may 1st
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.720]   So we might want to revisit this. Yeah, because there might be some interesting
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.720]   Sure, there's a lot more to it. Yeah
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:36.680]   It's uh, you know, and it it bites basically uh, normal users who aren't really kind of vigilant
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:42.920]   Um about what's even even on the chrome book. I got stuck with some kind of what extension that yeah
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:48.040]   Some extension that I had installed that did this kind of crap and finally that shouldn't happen because the chrome book
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.440]   It has to be signed
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.000]   Right. Isn't that right? Kevin, uh in order to use install something on chrome. Oh, it has to be signed
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.280]   Right, but but you know, there are legitimate, you know, modify the thing i'm reading and plug in
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.920]   Right. So you can't tell i've been a show whether
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.760]   Um rewriting the page that you're on is you know, good thing or a bad thing
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:11.400]   You know, the Pinterest plug in right will rewrite the page to give you a pin this button for example
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:17.560]   So the the challenge is working out which ones are ones you actually want which ones you forgot about
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.040]   I mean the other I
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:25.320]   There's a useful tip actually is to go and check which chrome extensions you have installed because the problem is they do low in every tab
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.280]   Which means you put your potentially loading a lot of extra stuff
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.520]   Oh, that's interesting. They load in every tab
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:36.120]   So one of the reasons that chrome may slow down is that you've got some extension plugged in that wasn't written very well and is
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.280]   Is like as well as every page or loading is loading next to it
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.800]   So go to the hamburger on the right of your a toolbar and chrome
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.440]   And uh go to more tools and select extensions. You'll see a list
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.880]   You can disable them or trash them and then there's often
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:56.280]   By the way more information and sometimes even options there that you might not have seen
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.640]   I have a quite a few of them and this is what happens when you use a chrome book, right?
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.200]   Jeff is that you start putting extensions in because equating these things. Yeah, these are your apps
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.400]   Yeah, and I and I go through occasionally and just just turn off a whole bunch of them. Yeah, also I
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:14.360]   I'm not sure but I think it will it it will sink in solid extensions across
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.720]   It does running crumbs right? So it does it does it does it does it?
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:20.600]   Yeah, so if you install one on your market, it'll put it on the chrome book and vice versa
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.320]   Which may not be what you thought was going to happen. Yeah, I had a case
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.240]   I had a case this week where I'm going to New Delhi for 24 hours. How's that for instead?
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.240]   and
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:34.360]   Um, I had to apply for a visa which thank goodness you can now do online used to be you you had to go through the whole
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.400]   McGilla
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.160]   So they wanted my passport page at only 300
[00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.920]   um
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:46.760]   uh in size and it come you know come on as a as a mega every time and
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.520]   So I didn't know how to do it. So how did I make a pd? I had to make a pdf and make it smaller
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:53.000]   So I'm going through trying to find extensions extensions extensions
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.040]   I end up installing five things for pdfs that I don't get about of course
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.480]   And they're there and I'll go through eventually. I don't know that many. I'll kill them off
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.640]   But uh, but that's how you that's how you do get a little bit. Did you find a solution to that?
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.280]   Uh, I made it a gif and then reduced the
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.000]   You canceled this trip. This was the easiest way
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.560]   I was about to
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:19.400]   It's little things like that with the bite you with the crumb book that you just get used to doing on a normal computer
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.600]   And all of a sudden it's like well. Oh, I don't have that
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.880]   Although and I'll show you later in my tool there. It's getting there the few things that I
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.840]   Said, oh, I can't I have to have a real computer for
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:35.560]   Are the numbers dwindling rapidly including I got skype now
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:40.840]   Yeah, I'm really I'm really liking the pixel the new pixel is fast. Yep
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:43.400]   I'm probably you can't you know
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.120]   And we'll talk about the other chrome chrome analysis this week too
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.680]   And so I obviously love it. It's not like you could have a show on this week in chrome because what he is saying
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.640]   Right. Oh, yep. There it is. No, this is the show. This is it
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.840]   That and all about andro between the two of them I think we're covering it
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:21:01.960]   But good tip kevin to go through your extensions and remove stuff that you're not using because yeah
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.000]   That takes each of them takes up memory and uh and resources
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.040]   What's kind of says it? I'm not sure that chrome if you know chrome has that there's like who's using my around view
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.680]   But I'm not sure it breaks out extensions. That would be nice if it did, wouldn't it?
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:17.480]   Well, that's a good question. There is a task manager in the chrome book, which surprised me in chrome OS
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:23.800]   You can see who's using cp use there's you can even do top a top command in the shell. Just kind of nice
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.360]   Yeah, there's a well, it's in any chrome. There's a task manager. What's it right?
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.320]   Um
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.360]   Ingresses, you know, you know, you know, you know, they don't let you give you points
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.320]   You you do exhibit intellectual honesty
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.800]   You're gonna make me eat crow again. No, I'm saying I'm saying the opposite
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.960]   I'm saying the opposite kind of back-handedly
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:51.080]   I'm saying this with respect and love yes, because I was I was very dismissive of crumb OS
[00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:56.760]   I'm I take my head off to you. No, I'm so serious many others would still just hang on and say yeah, but yeah, but well
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.440]   A lot of a lot of people do and like yourself made a lot of hay with their pond stars adger
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.480]   Yeah, but you can't use it offline and of course you can use it offline
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.640]   You can do more and more they've really they've not only they have extensions, but they also have apps
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.040]   Now which are kind of really just browsers in the separate window, but
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:17.640]   It really feels like an operating system more and more and then there's very little I can't do and
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:23.400]   The task manager does does include plugins. That's useful. So we see which ones are chewing up ram. Oh good
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.320]   Good, which we should we talk about the new the new chrome stuff this week sure?
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:30.520]   A part of the GPO process is eating five
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:35.560]   500 make how do you see the task manager in chrome? Um click on the
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.640]   Oh more tools task manager. There it is. Yeah
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:44.120]   See chrome. What's funny is you really have chrome OS on your system
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.520]   And when you even if you're on a Mac because chrome is chrome OS pretty much
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:53.320]   Yeah, yeah background page google drives a cure shell at these are all running
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:58.920]   Right. So you can see who's got ram. So yeah, my google drive page in the background is chewing up stuff
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.720]   Ooh stats for nerds. Did you click on that?
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.600]   You have stats for nerds
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.320]   Oh
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:14.040]   About memory measuring. Oh, this is uh, this is memory use page in page out. What is that? Okay, okay?
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.080]   Finally we get somebody here can explain what the hell that means
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.360]   Because all task managers will show this
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:24.760]   Sorry
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:26.760]   Go ahead. Sorry. Um
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:33.400]   So the the point is that with with Unix like OS is like Mac OS and chrome OS
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.880]   Um, you are allocating memory, but not all of the memory is actually in memory
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.480]   Some of it is elsewhere
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:45.400]   So you're saying I want this much memory and the operating system is deciding how much is actually on ram and how much is is paged out to disc
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.360]   So paged in means actually using it in the in the memory of your machine
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.000]   And paged out means it's on the disc
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.120]   Bring back as needed and you often the tricky bit is that because of the way page mapping works is
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:03.000]   there's um
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Each process will have a bunch of shared pages which are operating system pages and things so that they will all be mapped into the same process
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.280]   um
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:15.560]   Memory space um, but they will actually all map to the same piece of the operating system
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.640]   So the paging page outs
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:22.360]   You know, it can look like you're using more memory than in your physical machine in the in the paged in one
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:27.400]   They even say that in a footnote on the on the memory redirect page due to memory sharing between processes
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:32.040]   Summing memory usage does not give total memory use. Yes, this is interesting
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.640]   Well, that's yeah, and there's also they also link to their own bug in it, which is wonderful
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:41.000]   I know they say this page will show memory for all running browsers. Not just chrome. That's interesting bug
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.240]   We seriously over count our own memory usage
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:48.520]   They have to say that though because you know if you look at it and it says you're using 49
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.240]   What are you using? 49 megabytes?
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.360]   of actually it's only a sense of it but
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.320]   Where's that gigabytes? So the virtual list
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.960]   So the virtual list is they've all you know, every piece has got three gigs in it because right?
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.760]   They've all got the the same stuff paged in right, right?
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:10.520]   But what I was you know, you don't the point about this is you only really want this if you're debugging your own pages and plugins
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.600]   Yeah, but the other one is you sort of say what what are these things that are lurking around here on my machine?
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.080]   Um, let's go and clean them up. Yeah
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.640]   And it's I remember that I haven't done this for a while so I should go and it's always interesting
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:28.600]   Google is putting chrome in more places a chrome OS the chrome bit dongle will be coming soon from googla
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.720]   I also thought this was the name for a fourth joke at first. I did I did triple but this is cool. I like this
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:41.560]   So intel at ces announced a pc on a stick that would do much the same thing androids been available on a stick for some time in fact
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:47.480]   um, you know google tv and roku and uh, there's a lot of fire tv they're all
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.200]   Looked like usb keys, but they really don't have a usb connector
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.520]   They have an hdmi connector and you can plug them into your tv and then a computer run
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:01.640]   So this is chrome os a sus I guess is going to make it for about a hundred dollars
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:07.880]   Well that now this the the um the next web story says that but the price has not been announced
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.600]   It's not but they did say is that it's going to be under a hundred dollars
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:16.520]   And that seems to me to be anywhere near a hundred dollars sounds really high to me. I think it should be 70 50
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.560]   30 well the chrome the chrome cast is 35
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:26.200]   Yes, but but the a chrome book now you can get chrome book for $149 now two two chrome books for $150
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.960]   Some drive should be more than $50 cheaper than an entire lap right
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.520]   So what's the use case for this because it is on your go to a hotel
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:40.680]   A hotel you you have to bring a wireless key a bluetooth keyboard. Here's my i've got an idea for the google
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.600]   I'm telling you this is a good idea
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.920]   You should your android phone should be should be able to operate as a key bluetooth keyboard. Uh-huh
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:50.760]   Oh, because you're not gonna be using heavy duty stuff on this right?
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.800]   Well, let me pull up that page. Let me show you the presentation. Let me do this. Let me do that
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:59.080]   Right then then uh, you don't need to plug it. You get to plug in power right
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:06.920]   USB power and then you just use your your phone as as as as mouse and
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.680]   Uh, keep at that point. You might as well. You just use the crumb cost
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.240]   Yeah
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.320]   Nobody your trip. Yeah. Well, no the chrome cast has the problem of the Wi-Fi stuff. Yep
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.280]   So the chrome bit is due this summer
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.600]   Uh
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.600]   The idea for this is really room
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:30.840]   It's for at mass at at volume and this thing it does get cheaper does get like, you know, 30 by
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.680]   Raspberry pie-ish
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:39.000]   Then in and the idea is this is for poorer schools and such who have have TVs don't have computers and they can now have
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.320]   Yeah, anybody has got an old hcm i monitor lying around suddenly has a chrome box. Yeah, exactly
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.400]   Except that you got a bi-bluetooth keyboard mouse, which yeah
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.560]   That's why i'm saying this is exactly why i'm saying then then you just follow
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.800]   Yeah, what are we the challenges?
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:59.480]   What this is for me is this is the the chrome box shrunken so the chrome box is exactly this device
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.160]   Um, and you know, we we got one io a couple of years ago
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.160]   My son used it as his desktop computer for over a year
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.680]   Um with precisely this setup is like, oh, we have a cheap
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.720]   Yeah
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.600]   No, because he had his main computer was the was the chrome book and he was taking the pixels of school
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:23.160]   But his desktop computer then became a crime book. I think it's great. Yeah, I think the use case here
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:31.000]   For a lot of people is the fact that if you're using a chrome book if that's your computing system or whatever
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.240]   Then you can pretty much use any
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.240]   You can you can do it anywhere. Yeah, and so this is something you can carry in your pocket
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.800]   You know, it's assuming you can figure out the keyboard part of it
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   And you know, you basically have a chrome box at home and then you go when you're wandering around you just plug it in any tv or or monitors
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:54.840]   I love carrying this in my pocket. Yeah, so this is a april fools joke. Obviously the self-crown self-browsing chrome book
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:00.680]   Uh rethink how you browse the web with a self-browsing chrome book with one click you're off surfing the web
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.880]   No input needed so you don't need the keyboard in the mouse
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.360]   You just lean back and we'll take you there quickly simply and secure what you want
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.440]   Right
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.120]   Unfortunately, it's not compatible with my system, but uh
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:24.440]   But it says it runs on chrome OS so maybe you ought to download it right now and see how it works, uh, jeff
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:27.160]   I'm unfortunately using a mac
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.640]   Why are it why?
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.160]   Uh, because well, it's really a simple thing first of all. I don't want to waste my chrome book here
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.880]   but also
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.520]   Also, uh, the issue is uh, there's a weird we tried this with the first chrome book
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:45.160]   I should try it with a new one, but I it uh, you can't I can't do this what we're doing right now
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:51.880]   Which is get it to the screen video out. Yeah, but I'm gonna regret this. Okay. It's installed introducing chrome selfie
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.840]   If you here we go here, I mean, I'm
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.080]   Hold the camera up. Oh my god. What's going on?
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:03.000]   Oh, it is it's actually doing it
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.720]   It's like stumble upon
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:12.200]   Oh solve for x. Okay, so brought to you to solve for x. That's the great google site kind of their TED talks
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:17.640]   And now it's bringing you to a plus page now research at google. It is literally self
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.960]   Driving, you know, what's gonna google stuff?
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.480]   The germans are going to use this to prove that google is just promoting its own product
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.560]   Right because it is all google sites so far
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.520]   It's stumble upon for google
[00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.560]   And it's fast by the way you barely have time to read anything
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.360]   Wait a minute. That's not that's not google
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.760]   Is is it all blog or sites too? Oh, maybe it's blogger sites
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.280]   Holy cow
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.960]   Now it's a google maps of some place
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:51.080]   Like in the middle of nowhere. It looked like it was burning man. Oh
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.560]   Wow, it even showed google in spanish right google spain and
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.400]   A fist bell? Wait wait, that's wikipedia so it is more than google sites
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:04.600]   Yeah, so it's just all over wikipedia fantastic for oh, it got you're getting sta i see what happened
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.960]   So it's just following a random link on a page
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.240]   That's probably what it's doing
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:16.040]   Right, it's finding a link on the page and then clicking and so you're lucky you didn't get stuck in wikipedia
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.840]   Oh, you're back so now you're gonna be in wikipedia for a while because
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.880]   A lot of wikipedia links go back to wikipedia
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.080]   Huh?
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.600]   All right, i'll put that on my my pixel it has to do something overnight. Well, that's not about screensaver
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.600]   Just leave it leave it on the tv
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.400]   Maybe that's what this is for
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.200]   All right, all right
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:40.440]   It's funny because I clicked the link
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:45.720]   On a fast company i'm sorry in the next web and it brought me that instead
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.720]   This is this is where we wanted to go more chrome books. This is the cheap chrome books
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:55.160]   Here's this is a sus chrome book the the flip this one this one i'm i mean it's gonna be ridiculous
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.040]   I'm gonna end up with five chrome books. I know this is only 250 bucks
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:03.880]   This one i'm very flipped all the way around so it turns kind of into a tablet tablet 15 millimeters thick
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:08.360]   It's gonna be running amazon things. I mean and what i'm saying android things android
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:16.120]   Oh, it is it's android and within within within six weeks or so everything all the chrome will run android s
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.960]   Yes, that's gonna be a very nice first. Yeah, that's gonna be a very nice thing
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.680]   To me this higher chrome book 11
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:29.160]   Um and the high-sense chrome book costs 149 dollars. That's a that's an astonishingly low price
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.520]   Yeah at walmart and amazon 11.6 inch screen
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:37.320]   High sense is the chinese company that wants to get into the tv business. They took over microsoft's
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:45.160]   Booth at ces higher's been around for a long time selling very inexpensive refrigerators and drugstore appliances basically
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.440]   um
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.440]   Wow 150 bucks
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.600]   I don't want to get the cheapest and it's and it's like eight hours battery. Yeah
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:57.000]   Well, yeah, because it's got the slowest process there in the world probably
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.200]   Yeah
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   eight and a half hour i tell you
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.680]   Increasingly i've been recommending these to people who say you know i ask them. What do you want to do?
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.440]   Almost everybody says the same thing i want to surf the web and do email
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:15.640]   And it's just crazy to buy something so complex and expensive as as a windows pc or or a mac
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:18.440]   When you when a chrome book will do it all and do it securely
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:25.080]   One thing i still want is i want del i've said this initial before i want a message to you michael del
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:29.560]   I want you to do a fully customizable chrome book. There's not that many choices
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:35.400]   Right, but how much memory lte blood blood you want what we've all been saying the mid-range crumb
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.080]   I'm going let me custom make it and add my own stuff to it
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.160]   It's my own fault that it costs $600 bucks. I'll be happy
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.880]   So mike tell us about this story. This is from business insider that android is going to be on
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.880]   chrome
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.160]   OS
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:54.120]   Yeah, they talked about this at google.io last year and basically what's going to happen is that they're
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:58.920]   You know, they're increasingly you know, it's all under sundar pachina. Uh, he's got you know
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.120]   He used to be just chrome chrome chrome was now android is under him
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.240]   And there's increasing integration not only
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:11.720]   Uh, the ability to run actual android apps on chrome and it's there's going to be a handful of apps on these devices and then
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.840]   Within within a few you know month month and a half two months
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.320]   Um, it's going to be able to run on all chrome
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:22.040]   OS is everything that is is capable of doing so and it's going to be you know
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.480]   It's going to be an app by app thing, but eventually i think that all all android apps are going to run easily on chrome books
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:36.920]   Uh and on chrome and and and in addition to that chrome is actually chrome OS is actually starting to evolve from an interface perspective
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.600]   To be more like android typefaces little things like that
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:46.520]   So there there seems to be a desire to unify these and it it'll get to the point very quickly
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.240]   Where you'll wonder why
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:54.200]   You have both. I mean if you look at this flip thing that turns into a tablet so now you have this chrome tablet
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:59.320]   Right, so why would you have a chrome tablet instead of an android tablet? I'm already taking calls
[00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.760]   uh
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.040]   on my uh
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.480]   chrome book
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:09.880]   Because I use hangouts and I give out a google voice never so when my phone rings it rings my actually rings everything
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:16.040]   And you're like and I can answer that call on an ipad as a matter of fact or anything whatever I happen to have nearby
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.800]   Sure the house wakes up like crazy because everything's ringing
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.960]   And everything has its own ringtone. Yeah, it's a little crazy
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:31.960]   But uh, but the other thing that's um, but just just to make make a point about that though apple's doing the same thing with continuity and handoff
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:36.680]   But you have to have an iphone and a mac. Yeah, and so it's really kind of
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.320]   It's a very it's a closed ecosystem
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:47.800]   Whereas google has made voice work on everything. Yeah, so I literally can take a google voice call on an apple device on an android device
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.160]   Don't think I can do it on a windows phone device yet or ever
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.320]   Um, but that's pretty cool. Yeah, damn it. The openness is really nice. It is
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.400]   Yeah
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.680]   Not the goo's open everywhere android where it doesn't obviously work with an iphone
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:05.080]   How much effort does it take to port an app to android for chrome?
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.800]   That I don't know
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:11.480]   Right now the way you you do it is you you don't recompile the app
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:14.520]   You run it through a little do hickey
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:20.680]   And then the apk will just work on a chrome book, isn't it? Oh, wait a minute. You have to have a stub of something
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:26.520]   And I can't remember I haven't what did you do to get skype working you you
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:33.000]   I installed um you have so you have an extension that's running that is an android emulator. I guess
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:39.560]   Yes, name. I'm something forgetting. No reason why my google couldn't put a make an emulator
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.440]   Be part. Yeah, sure. Oh, surely they're gonna make it easier than that
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.320]   Um because I don't really run
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.040]   Well, and they already did this with ever note, right?
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:51.240]   The reason the ever note has an app as well as an extension as well as a website
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:58.120]   Is because google's already done this privately with ever note. Yeah, so that they're so the ever note app is actually the android app. Yeah
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.920]   I'm just I I
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.600]   I just like how it's coming along here. Yeah, you too
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:11.400]   Uh, it really it's you know talk about the olpc the hundred dollar one laptop per child. We're really 150 bucks
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.600]   Yeah, we're getting the quality machine and they're decent
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.000]   Quality's really not hard. Well, well, there's these are these are a little better
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.840]   I mean compared to an all-pc machine. Yeah, but the the beauty of it is that the kids can go
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.760]   uh home
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.400]   Leave this leave the machine at at school. They can go home and log into their their accounts
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:37.480]   And you know, whatever it is. They were working on that's really awesome. Yeah, and this is the big problem with uh, you know
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.680]   With apple trying to sell ipads to schools
[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:44.760]   Um, you know, this is you can't do that so you have to send them home with an ipad
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:51.160]   Now the kids are target for theft because of course somebody's gonna mug these kids for this expensive piece of consumer electronics
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.720]   And so that doesn't work
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:38:00.360]   And it's just it's just a fantastic thing now to me one of the most exciting developments in the chrome os world is the fact that
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:05.800]   The new chrome launcher 2.0 is going to be google now centric. So in the future you see cards
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.720]   Yeah in the near future you're gonna turn on your chrome, you know, get open your pixel
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.120]   And it's gonna be google now. That's what you want to see
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.480]   But we already see that right jeff because there is a notification
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:20.600]   In the on the system bar and the right that is a number that's the number of now cards that are available
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:26.200]   Yeah, which can I go back to my my usual apps problem because my main account is as is apps
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:31.160]   I got hardly anything anything. So is this the tool you used ark welder jeff?
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.120]   No, i'm trying to find it right now. I so this this
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:38.920]   I've got this will you run so you need the ark, which is the android runtime for chrome
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:46.440]   And then you run the s the apk you have to get the apk of skype or whatever and you run it through ark welder
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:51.000]   And that somehow processes it and makes it possible
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.680]   So here's another extension to install
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.640]   What I have to do is I have to go to the my extensions
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:02.520]   And get it there if you go to last week's i'll run down it has what I used okay
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:09.320]   Um, I might I thank you at the bottom. I can't really see where it was. Oh, yeah, because you talk about uh, yeah, that's right
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:13.800]   Hold on here. Yeah, it's a pretty big extension. That's uh 103 megabytes so far
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.080]   um
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.080]   Hold on
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.440]   How soon how long before uh, I mean if it
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:28.200]   Is getting wild and open right now. It's more like ever an operating system
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:33.400]   How soon before it becomes a problem or did they design chromo s so well that it never will be a problem?
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:35.400]   What do you think kevin?
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:42.600]   Is he there? Um, sorry, I miss some context because I I yeah, we're just talking about running and right apps on chrome. That's imminent
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.880]   Right and i'm just wondering as as
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:50.120]   One of the reasons chromo s worked so well is because it was so restricted
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.640]   But we've got now a big store growing fast and
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:59.400]   Well to some extent. I mean, you know the point is it's the the the design is clear
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.280]   It's designed to run a web browser web apps really well
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:07.400]   So if you're gonna start running and or that's which different kind of thing you may need to optimize it for that. Right so that's uh, um
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:13.400]   Yeah, there there is a difference in in thinking about which which when you're gonna run but um as
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:20.920]   Mores door keeps doing its thing so be you probably be able to run and you're running an emulator on your on your mac is
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:24.440]   Worked for running and or that's for a while, but it doesn't work that great
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.800]   Because it's it's it's got a lot of wrapper on top of it
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:31.160]   The question is how much of that wrapper can you get away and how much can you make it go direct to gpu
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:35.480]   And given that they control the the os they've they've probably got ways to do the shortcuts for that
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.600]   And maybe that is that what that art world the thing is to happen to that before?
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:43.240]   Well, the thing that worries me about ark welder is you get it you side you have to kind of sideload an APK somewhere
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.720]   so um
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:51.720]   The thing I use is twerk, but I think it's basically the same twerk. Yeah ark welders. Yeah. Yeah, so I have to go
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.760]   I went to launch skype. This is not ready for mortals. I have to go to the extensions find it
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.160]   Open the package that was created
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:03.320]   And skype launches and I still I still want to do a test with with uj's just to see how it works
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:08.040]   So I don't know it's kevin's plan. I don't know if it's if the fact that it's going through that wrapper
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:10.600]   Is that affecting the performance?
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:17.960]   Right, it's funny because uh you can you can simplify that the chat room was saying twerk leo twerk
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.640]   But I thought they actually wanted me to twerk, but no they were telling me no no
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.200]   No one wants you to twerk. I was okay. No offense. I was hopeful
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.320]   No one was I uh, it's aspirational
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.480]   Someday
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:36.440]   The other thing here is that what you you kind of would want is is a bit like the emulator experience where you you want the
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.080]   Running in a small window not taking over the whole screen. Yeah
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:43.000]   Yes, but but in some cases
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:51.480]   And I I think just the opportunity that I've already written an app for android and now I can just run on chrome
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.560]   However, it ought to run on on a browser
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.720]   That's free
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.760]   Right. That's that's like that's if you have a responsive
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:04.200]   Right, but the the the the challenges, you know android will have a gert laying it out
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:08.040]   But there aren't any android tablets that have that many pixels or maybe there's you know
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:10.360]   There's a few but not not being in the market
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.320]   So most of the apps wouldn't have been tuned for that and also if they have
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:20.040]   You know the biggest sort of design challenge these days is the difference between portrait and landscape things and this is a battle that's the
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:25.400]   Songgoing and we've had this um, you know, we've had this for a while in that
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.920]   Um the max keep getting narrower and narrower that way
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.720]   So you end up with this this very wide screen thing and the phones and the other way around
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:40.200]   And so the design challenges am I putting a tall thing or a wide thing and that the the irony recently has been happening with video
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.640]   Where periscope wants you to use portrait mode video
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.520]   And everyone in videos like no
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.280]   We're you're losing
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:52.920]   A third of the screen except that if you're watching on a portrait mode screen you're losing a third of the screen when you watch landscape
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:57.880]   So it is it's an ongoing, you know, ongoing problem. We have which is which way around is this thing?
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.880]   Does it make sense to be wide or tall?
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:05.720]   So I apologize ark welder is for testing you still would use twerk to convert it
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.480]   So ark welder is more for developers to see if their app will work as
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:15.640]   Compiled and we should mention that you can if you want to try the google now
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.320]   Cards on chrome os all you have to be is in the beta channel
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   So if you if you go to about chrome
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:26.520]   In your chrome on your chrome book and select the beta channel
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.920]   You should get this new launcher which I have and I hadn't played with the now features
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.200]   So if you see this launcher you got it
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:39.960]   Restart to update someone update my chromebook. Yeah, we've done. We've done in a few seconds
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:44.200]   Yeah, I know that's nice to boy that pixel boots in about three seconds
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:49.240]   Yeah, I've never seen anything boot faster. Did you get the new pixel? No, the old one was fast and this one's fast
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.200]   One is instant. Yeah, uh, it's amazing
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:57.400]   I don't know you're right now now jeff i've gone too far on the other side
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:04.200]   That was my entire idea you succeeded no time you hit my tasbee
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.040]   Microsoft
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.280]   Is finally adding?
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.400]   Reverse scrolling to windows tan we were talking about this on windows weekly
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:18.360]   Yeah, you know on the chrome book it's funny because it's in a setting they call it australian scrolling
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.880]   Yeah, but I want everything to scroll like my mac does
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:26.600]   Because I use the mac and I just if so finally windows 10 will do it chrome o s does it
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:31.080]   But google is going to improve scro scrolling on chrome
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:38.200]   Uh using a microsoft invention according to this story tom warren writing for the vudge
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:44.520]   Uh, it's going to support pointer events the standard that was introduced in internet explorer
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.920]   um
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:48.120]   touch events
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.960]   Is available right now in uh, safari
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.520]   Microsoft mozilla and opera have adopted pointer events
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:02.280]   And while they were using touch events they are now going to pointer events
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:09.160]   Don't know what any of this means at all touch handlers will be replaced with pointer event handlers
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:15.800]   This is one of those like long running web standardization problems, which is that um to touch events were
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.480]   Pushed by apple for safari and then adopted by others
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:23.000]   Um, but it's very much focused on i'm operating this thing with my finger
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.880]   Whereas um microsoft because they were building the tablets that had both touch screens and mice
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:34.840]   And wanted this more nuanced thing that would pointer events and clearly that's a better fit with chrome because chrome has you know
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.840]   Has that has both modes as well?
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:41.480]   Whereas apple doesn't have touch screens on their laptops yet. So there it's see this is important
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.080]   So it's one of those like
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.480]   Why would I care about that type of things from apple?
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.480]   So it just makes like
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.040]   Building websites a little bit more annoying at the moment
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.320]   What you know, what is the functionality difference?
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.520]   I mean from the point of view of the end user
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.440]   You I mean even on a touch device you would you
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:03.240]   the big difference is that um
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:08.280]   On top one of the things that people get frustrated with is that if you got a touch device you don't have
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:11.880]   Um, you have like a long press gesture
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.880]   Which means that when you click the screen it has to decide when you're making a press or a long press
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.040]   So there was a lot of
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.800]   It was waiting when you when you click things because it was waiting to see what kind of press you were making
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.280]   What is that?
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.880]   And so that was slowing down
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.320]   That was slowing other websites
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:30.200]   Whereas the pointer event because you've got alternative gestures because you can right click or because you can
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:34.200]   um control click or whatever um you can short circuit that thing so
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:40.360]   And the bit that's that slightly weird is that the gesture staff doesn't integrate with that one
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.760]   We've we've had this problem forever, which is that if you do it if I use pointer events then
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.400]   What how do I do a long press? Can I do it?
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.720]   Yeah, well you can it maps
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.640]   I think it maps a right click to a long press or it maps a long press or right click or something
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.600]   so
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:59.240]   The problem is it's there's there's a set of um gestures that you use that are different between these devices
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.800]   Right, and it's trying to unify them what makes
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.440]   Then it's to the app on the other side of it
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:08.840]   Um so that you get the right ones by default, but you can into reinterpret them if you want to
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:12.280]   um, you know the classic one of these is the is the mouse wheel event
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:16.520]   which you you scroll them up you scroll the mouse wheel with your finger and that that
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.640]   um
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:22.120]   Gets mapped to different things and the problem is google maps maps it to zoom
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:27.240]   Which makes sense if it is an actual mouse wheel, but it means if you try and two fingers scroll the map it zooms in instead
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.240]   Which is has been a bug for
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:35.160]   Something like five years and still drives me mad. I try and pan google map the way I would pan anything else on the map
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.560]   so there's there's this sort of
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:43.160]   Is a mismatch of affordances between like which of these jesters are you trying to do and how does that map to what the what the um
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:47.400]   The app is there's no perfect solution. You can you sacrifice in either direction, right?
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:53.080]   Well, the the point is is you've got to try and come up with a set that that makes sense. So that's what the standardization
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:57.160]   Discussions going on are so pointer events was an attempt to
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.640]   um come up with a with a more
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:05.880]   Inclusive thing that included both but apple wasn't interested in it because they they were they think they were thinking those two separate things
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.880]   And the question is whether they'll adopt that too or we get or is everyone
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:18.840]   Is writing code for this gonna have to um adapt to having once every events from the from the i Mac and iOS things and another set from the the others
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.000]   this is the kind of thing
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.160]   that the engineers and
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.400]   Standards setters fight for decades over. Yeah, and then the lawyers
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:34.120]   The challenge you know the challenge for this web standardization stuff is
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:36.760]   um we've
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:41.720]   Well, you want the long version of the short one the the the the long version of this is
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:47.240]   Standardization is basically a process of documentation people implement things and then we try and document how they behave
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.680]   So all the people can make them do the same things
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:52.840]   So if you think about soundization like that then it makes sense for it to have a lag
[00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:55.720]   The problem is is that once you've done that for a little bit
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:59.640]   Then people go to the spec place and look at the spec to implement and implement it
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.040]   Um, and so in their head the standards body is not a documentation body
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.360]   It's a legislation body is telling you what you should do
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:14.920]   Um and once people have that mindset then they go to the um standards bodies with the mindset of legislators lobbying for their organization or for their
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:19.400]   Obsession or whatever and the standards bodies get full of these people whose
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:23.080]   Entire focus in life is one particular little thing or
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.920]   um, the focus is no, I'm not going to accept that
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.680]   I'm gonna do everything to fill it up to that out of the standard cause we don't think it's interesting
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.200]   And that's when the standards bodies turn into, you know, depressing
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:40.680]   Political places and that's normally what happens then is a new standard body is fought off and we start again with the documentation process
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.160]   Um, we don't invite those other guys
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.040]   Which you know, this is what happens people
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:48.440]   because
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:52.920]   You the people who are trying to get agreement a frustrated by the people who are trying to
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:56.200]   Make their point in their direction. Yeah, um and this goes back and forth a lot
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.520]   So, you know, the classic web version of this was the what wg
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.840]   Which was um
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:10.360]   The w3c had become this very legislative mindset place and it has a bit of that anyway because it's got a is a membership body and so on
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:12.680]   um, so there there's
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:19.000]   Sort of the classic standards bodies like I so are these legislative processes where you're trying to pass a law that that
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.640]   Will say how everything works in that way
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:24.440]   Do you see had had got captured bit by that mentality?
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.040]   And so they were focusing on standards that they thought everyone should implement
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:32.440]   Whereas the browser people were like no, we're trying to do these things what's going on
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:38.840]   So what wg was effectively a coalition of the people both the people building websites and the people building browsers to say
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.160]   How can we make this less annoying for
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:46.120]   For our use cases because w3c is not doesn't care about our issues at the moment
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.280]   if um and and in a
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:53.160]   You know, that was the iteration that became h2m l5 and w3c realized this that
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:58.280]   They'd gone off beam and said okay, right? We'll take that back into our process and absorb that
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:03.560]   But there's still this sort of two-headed process going on where what wg is doing h2m l the open standard
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.040]   um the the living standard and
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.960]   um
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:12.840]   w3c is now working on h2m l5 plus rich ml6 whatever they're calling it this week and
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:15.320]   Trying to hit sort of unitry version so there's
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:17.640]   It comes partly comes in a different process
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.560]   But it also comes to this different some mental model and a lot of five things
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:25.000]   I've seen with the standards work that I've done over the years has been
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.960]   Um the progress is often made by these ad hoc groups that say okay
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:36.360]   We're all trying to do the same thing can we get this done and then you know document it iterate have that and then try and take it to the
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.320]   The standards body for ratification if you like so you would say okay
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:42.200]   We're at the point now where we think this makes sense
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:46.680]   Let's take this to the itf or the w3c and the problem is it can then get bogged down in process again
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:50.360]   Another example of that will be oAuth oAuth was an ad hoc group of people
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:54.280]   You know saying we need a way for one website to authenticate to another website
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.320]   um
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:52:00.360]   We came up with something and there were some problems and coalitions, but it was mostly done by you know
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.920]   Small groups in silicon valley, which is can be a problem too
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:09.160]   Um and then it went to the itf for oAuth 2 and is now this standard that is that is um
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:14.920]   So complicated that it's very hard to make it interoperate because everyone wanted to add their own little use case to the to the spec
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:20.920]   So you you hit this this problem quite a lot. So so pointer events and touch events is an example of one of these things
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:22.920]   It's like touch events was apple
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:30.040]   needed a new way for you to um be able to respond to the the things that you could do on ios that you couldn't do with a
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:35.720]   Desktop browser so that was touch events and pointer events was an iteration that was trying to work with a concept that
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:41.880]   I have both a touch screen and a keyboard and a mouse and that they're different and they they they started in those different camps
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:47.480]   One started in the the windows camp because for that with air tablets and point and the touch events are in the apple camp
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:51.800]   And what's going on now is people trying to make them fit together and and and correlate. So it's one of these like
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:56.680]   Um, I think it's mostly a good faith effort, but they start from different premises
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:53:04.200]   If you want to have fun, uh, if this if you hadn't had enough of this discussion the uh, the bug tracker on the chromium
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:11.880]   site is issue 1 6 2 7 5 7 which was started in november 2012 and continues
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:16.760]   They actually closed it two days ago because there were so there were 148 comments in it
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:23.160]   And they've reopened it as issue 4 7 1 8 2 4 the debate rages on but it's really fun to actually watch
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:26.760]   the google engineers slowly uh change their tune and
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:33.160]   And the adopt uh, yeah point and then everybody else's pissed. So you can't you can't win. It's one of those
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.480]   And it's a lot of fun. All right, we're gonna take a break. We'll come back lots more to talk about
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:43.480]   Including meerkat. We haven't mentioned it in like three days. So it's dead already. You don't need. Oh, it's dead. Thank god
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.760]   What's the new thing?
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:53.000]   Our show today brought to you by fresh books. This is something that stuck around I started using it 10 years ago
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.600]   Uh, if you are in a business for yourself if you're a freelancer and you send out invoices biggest p
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.600]   I T a ever end of the month comes
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:05.320]   The last things I want to do is fire up excel
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:10.520]   Or word get all my expenses together and create an invoice, but if you don't do it
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:13.080]   Here's what I learned is a freelancer. You don't get paid
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:20.360]   So fresh I was it was really suffering and amber macarthur told me about fresh books back when I was going up to toronto every uh every month
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:25.560]   Uh, because I had invoiced rogers not only with with you know for my my day rate, but also for uh
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.360]   all the travel and stuff
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:32.120]   And I was literally wait like six months at a time. I would do it's not good
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:37.800]   Fresh books was the first web 2.0 site. I ever used now. It's kind of silly even to say that
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.720]   It's still great. It is it is a cloud based accounting
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:49.560]   That will help you save time with your bill and get paid faster. In fact on average fresh books customers get paid five days faster
[00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:53.880]   They also seem to double their revenue in the first 24 months. I'm not sure what that's all about
[00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:56.920]   I guess if you're smart enough to use fresh books or maybe maybe because
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.960]   You save so much time not doing invoices
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:04.360]   That you could you can do more work more of the important stuff the money making work
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:09.240]   I'm not sure what it is fresh books has award-winning mobile apps on android and ios which makes it easy
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:16.440]   Not only keep track of time and hours, but you can actually snap pictures of receipts get them right into the invoice works with multiple currencies
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:20.520]   That was important for me because I was you know invoicing in canadian dollars as well as us dollars
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:25.880]   You can build in any currency and most importantly it's really easy for your clients to pay you
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:30.600]   There's a pay button on the invoice and they work with stripe and pay pal
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.680]   fun box
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.240]   Zen payroll a lot of different services and apps
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:39.240]   So it's really easy for your clients to pay you and I think that's why you get paid faster
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:44.120]   Should you have a slow pay fresh books takes care of that too with automated payment reminders
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:48.440]   It is just the greatest and when it's time for taxes. I know we're thinking about that now
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:53.080]   Your accountant whoever does your taxes, maybe you you'll love it because the reports are so

[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.440]   Um, let's see we did uh, oh
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:31.800]   Is this a april fools joke smart box? Okay, we're not gonna do it. See I got bit
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.240]   The smart box by inbox
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:39.560]   Is this something that's yeah the mailbox of tomorrow gosh darn it
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:43.400]   Uh, I gotta say it's it looks pretty now
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:47.720]   Here's a question and I saw there's a couple of like a few days ago
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:53.160]   And I thought this can't be right globe runner, which is a big seo agency
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.600]   Claims they hired matt cuts to be their directors of search
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:00.440]   Is that true it is not thank god
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:06.680]   I emailed matt about it. I said is this true? He should be a little miffed because it doesn't look like it's a joke
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:08.760]   What did he say?
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.400]   So i'll touch it inside joke. I know that that would be a joke
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:17.000]   Yeah, he said uh the new career is just some search engine optimizers playing an april fools prank
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.960]   Yeah, but they did early that you like four days early. I saw it. I thought this cannot be
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:27.960]   Unless they offered matt so much money that he decided to go the outside matt cuts of course good friend of the show is a regular
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:31.640]   He's on next week. He's on next week. So i'm glad to have him back
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.400]   He is
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.920]   I don't know what's the part of this is he's free floating right now for years
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:41.800]   One of the first google employees he was in charge of fighting spam and search results
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:46.920]   Kind of and he did webmaster tools and he talked about good seo versus bad seo
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.840]   um
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.280]   But he's been on leave for a while and we thought maybe I don't know maybe he's
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:59.160]   So um he's met matt's own joke is there next on the rundown. Oh, is it yes?
[00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.160]   All right, he says

[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:26.840]   You have to know this is an inside joke

[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.720]   Oh, yeah, because that's what matt's always said you don't need to do seo just do good content
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:54.680]   Everything else is uh snake oil

[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.040]   I
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:23.240]   But now the jina is only every month we don't really do the change log per se but a couple of things new in google
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.160]   um
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:32.520]   Your photos and files together and drive all up to now photos have been stored in a separate thing called photos
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:38.200]   Uh, but now they'll actually just be visible when you look at your your google drive. I doubt they're gonna
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:42.360]   It's like they'll be an extra copy or anything. It's just you'll be able to see them
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:48.280]   Yeah, mine showed up. Uh, it's rolling out over the next few weeks. I showed up yesterday. So if you go to drive
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:54.920]   Yeah, let me see if i go the other way around as well to photos you've uploaded to drive previously end up in your photos up on android
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:56.360]   Yeah, I got it. Look
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:58.680]   No, well, no, mine are coming soon
[00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:05.400]   These these are google plus photos and what's cool also is that it will so for example, um
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:08.120]   There's no point you're showing me but you could plug this in
[01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:12.200]   If you really wanted to so what so what do I do? Where do I go for this?
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:17.160]   Just go to drive drive.google.com it's in the other side. You'll see you'll see a google photos
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:21.480]   Um, if you have it well even if you don't have it because I don't you're gonna have a
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.920]   In an entry under my drive and shared with me google photos
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:29.160]   But when you click it if you have it, you'll see photos. No, I don't even have the entry
[01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.720]   So you're really behind go to this
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.840]   Go to the go to the screen. I'll leave there you go. That's now mike mike is seeing his photos
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:42.440]   So so basically what this is this is these are a bunch of well, he's the pro. He's the google plus pro
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:45.720]   Well, I also have
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:50.520]   Terabytes of I'm exaggerating but tons of pictures on all you know, my horse is guess what?
[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:52.840]   I'm looking at my apps account. Oh
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.040]   All there you'll never get it
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.320]   But you can't see it on google apps
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:04.680]   But anyway, what's interesting to me is that um, it will put your auto awesome
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:10.040]   So you know google plus will create an auto awesome and then the auto awesome show up in
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:15.640]   Yeah, but this is I mean come on. This is just a link. It's not I mean you're in photos right now
[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:22.760]   It just appears to be in dry. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep new google photos. Yeah, and do you have photos in yours?
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.240]   Well, I have two mine say stay tuned your photos are coming soon
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:33.720]   Yeah, it might say that's your google photos to my drive make it easier add full. Yes. I guess I will add folder create folder
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:35.880]   Okay
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:40.200]   So this is okay, this is a face roller. This reminds me
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.840]   That uh, it was one year ago that the auto huff sums
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:50.440]   Were being done. Oh, that's right. This is oh, right the april fools joke where they'd add
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:57.400]   Or hassle off. Yes. They'd have david hassle off to your uh, that was awesome. That was hilarious. Yeah
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:03.160]   And uh, I think uh, I think they're still in there right there if you have a huff to I do I want some off sums
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.800]   They that was well done
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:13.240]   Quite a few huff sums in fact I remember that because I was using a time hop and it showed me everything from last year
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.840]   And they're i'm off time off. I should call it. I love time hop
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:22.600]   In fact time hop now I have photos so long. I actually got us time hop from seven years ago. Wow
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:29.000]   That's amazing. So time-ops an app android and iOS that will go through you add all your accounts
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.120]   I'll go through your tweets. I still haven't been able to export my tweets to add it
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.800]   But you export your tweets and you can add them
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:37.080]   But it also looks at facebook and uh google plus in your photos
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:42.920]   And then it says one year ago today two years ago three years, but this is the first time I've ever gone that far back seven years ago
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:47.880]   That's incredible. Yeah, I was what was I doing seven years ago? I think I was uh
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.440]   Sitting in the same chair door in the same job. I was a young man
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.480]   in search of a dream of a dream
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:01.080]   Uh, I was I was on travel. I was traveling somewhere. It was kind of amazing. That's not wow
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.600]   Yeah, they were black and white photos
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.400]   to garret types
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:11.160]   That's a that's a nice feature and then also
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.920]   They've updated gmail for android. I I've been using inbox
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:19.960]   So I I don't really care but if you still use the gmail app on android you now have a unified inbox view
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:23.880]   Uh, you get a conversation view for non gmail accounts
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:30.680]   And they say search is smarter and and you also have email from yahoo and outlook
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:36.200]   Right all in the same in the in there in the same inbox again. I don't use those. I don't want those
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.600]   I mean I have accounts, but I don't want my yahoo or no outlook mail. I'm like in my good mail
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.840]   You imagine what's in the you know, it's spam. Is it right there? Oh, yeah, it's all spam
[01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:49.800]   Uh and and notifications from yahoo and microsoft that something cool has happened
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.280]   Yes
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.720]   Yeah, you know, I I have a google
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.600]   Google for work account because we use it here at twit
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:03.160]   But I just stay away from it for the all of the pain points that you're talking about jafai
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:08.200]   They've kind of solved but it's too late. I'm committed because i'm committed on both sides. You can't go back
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:10.840]   No, I mean, yeah, no
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.120]   Well, you're you're you're uh, your example has cautioned me. Oh
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.200]   Yeah, and I get every google or has this problem. Yeah
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:26.520]   Yep, because they have an apps account for work and then they have their their personal gmail accounts and so it's all this
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.920]   Yeah, they do it's not that hard guys. It's really you're friggin geniuses
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:35.640]   So google is uh here give me the uh dongle
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.040]   You get my dongle
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:42.120]   Google is going to take ingress to the small screen
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:49.720]   I think as we used to call tv although actually really your biggest screen in your house is your tv your small screen is your phone your computer
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.840]   So I should reverse that now to the big screen
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:55.880]   Uh ingress which is kind of this wild
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.480]   Program which people who love love it. Yep
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.720]   um
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:06.840]   Chad johnson plays it and lost like pounds, right? You play it f and don who plays it here?
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:12.360]   Will's plays it here father robert father robert plays it chris plays it you guys don't know life i believe
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:19.320]   Uh brian bernette robert actually lost a lot of weight didn't he's like he like walks all over petaluma trying to find uh
[01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.280]   places to take over
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:24.520]   So I tried it for a bit, but it's um
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:30.680]   It was fairly opaque to try and also where I live it's it's everything's taken because it's full of google employees
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:35.560]   Right. That's the problem and when I first used it petalin was too small. They were only like three or four
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:40.840]   Points. Yeah, the post office. I'm like now right now. It's busy. Yeah
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:45.240]   Uh, but at the time and so I thought oh, this is for people living in new york or something
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:49.720]   What's brilliant about this coming to tv and they're basically talking about
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.320]   um
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:58.680]   Doing a tv series is that the tv series and the game will interact with each other the tv series will have it'll you know
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:05.880]   It'll dramatize but they'll be clues that can be then used in the game and it's like your cap your captain america decoder ring
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.720]   Yeah
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:13.800]   And they're talking about all kinds of contents, you know comic books and things like this and they'll all be intertwined
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:20.600]   And they'll be all this mythology behind it that'll boost the game and and so on one more reason they'll feel left out
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:27.400]   Yeah geek conversation. This news was broken by the information. Yeah, I mean our friday had the story and that you know
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.720]   He's very trustworthy. So I think it's not sure it's true
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:33.240]   But they haven't made a deal yet. They've just been talking about it, right

[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.040]   It's not not strong
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.840]   I think the Aussies would be a little more open-minded about this. I thought nudity was like big in Australia
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:39.240]   Aren't people in Australia naked under their clothes an Australian housewife who rose to internet fame?
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:44.680]   By exposing her boobies to a google street view car has been interrogated by the police
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:50.200]   And now faces a court hearing. Oh, come on. Yeah, it's ridiculous. Come on
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:56.520]   It's legal in New York. You could do that in New York is not even it's not even illegal
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   Yeah, it's illegal in San Francisco
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:05.880]   You know why it's illegal we had to make it illegal because people were wandering around cat the castro naked
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:14.040]   I thought I thought it was illegal legal. Is it illegal? All right in some places in San Francisco. It's required actually
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:19.800]   You got out of the castro and just everybody's letting their freak flag fly
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:23.320]   Um, so this is port
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:31.000]   Puri in southern, Australia, maybe they're a little more it's a maybe a little more conservative there. That's right. The south. Yeah, it's a south
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:38.760]   South might she was extremely bemused when the police questioned her and took a dna sample what
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:42.040]   Let's compare that with the picture
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:48.680]   She said it was her bucket list to flash google street view
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:54.120]   She said there was no child harmed in the making my children don't have to go to therapy because of it
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:59.880]   I didn't give any old man a heart attack that i'm aware of I spoke to my 19 year old son before he thinks it's funny
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:05.080]   Oh, oh, that is that is an embarrassing mom
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:13.080]   Hey, honey, i'm gonna go out and according to this story flash my sizable breasts
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:17.480]   That's what the story says i'm not making this up
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.560]   Um, they were uncensored because normally they blew the daily mail, huh?
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:26.680]   Is this the daily mail? It feels like it. It's no, it's uh, well, maybe it is
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.400]   This is even worse rt
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:32.680]   It might be a maten that in Australia. This could be made up. Oh, ABC's legit
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:39.800]   The Australian broadcast and there is the picture there, but rt has had the decency to block although google later blurred
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:41.480]   her
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.480]   Aren't you supposed to blur people anyway?
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:46.680]   Face faces faces or boobies
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:52.840]   So if she drew a smiley face underneath it, yeah, she has been flooded with friend requests on her facebook page
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:12:00.280]   She her next planted to skydive topless for her 40th birthday
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:04.840]   The FAA is gonna get her unless she's in jail
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:11.320]   Um google's response you saw this their public policy blog to the wall street journals
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:16.520]   Yeah, we're gonna save finally google's getting a voice rachel but stone who's in charge of public policy and stuff
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:22.120]   Finally has given it to rupert the way they should be doing she titles the blog post really rupert really
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.400]   And then it has a laughing baby gif
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:31.960]   Um, she does actually make some really good points one of you know the the smoking gun is the wall street journal said
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:38.840]   Saying the reason that the ftc dropped the investigation of google two years ago was because google lobbied the white house
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:42.360]   So assiduously claiming 230 visits
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:47.240]   From google to the abama white house, but then she makes she explains, you know
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.680]   Uh
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.560]   Yeah, but uh five visits were google engineer on leave helping fix technical issues
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:58.120]   33 were people
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.120]   Right, well, so let's go to that. Yeah, right
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:05.880]   Uh, and and we know that at least 30 of those were our own Alex lindsey from the pixel core
[01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:09.480]   Yeah, who was going to the white house for google hangouts
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:14.440]   Uh pixel core is contracted by google to do those hangouts the one after the state of the union and others
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:18.440]   And of course they they they show up as google contractors
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:23.960]   Several visits were advertising industry meetings attended by microsoft yahoo aol and others
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:29.560]   33 of them were people who work at google now, but didn't when they went to the white house
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:36.120]   So the number is a little yeah, what's ridiculous and and and and and today another story up on the rundown is that um
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:43.240]   Uh a former republican f tc commissioner. Yeah said this is ridiculous
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:50.920]   That the only test for anti-trust is is their consumer harm and there was no consumer harm and no the lawyers didn't push for
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.640]   Uh an anti-trust case and we said this unanimously because it was true
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:59.880]   And i'm in the gop and it wasn't political pressure and this i mean, you know, i'm sorry
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.120]   I respect the journalist of the maulshr. e journal
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.360]   But dammit
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:10.200]   I mean, that's why rachael wettstone at google was right to go after rupert right because this is his vendetta against google
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:14.840]   And he's using his paper as a bully pulpit. He's always done that and
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.280]   um
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.200]   Somebody at the journal a lot of be
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.440]   Revealing it or quitting or something because the story just stinks it just does
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:27.320]   Rachel wettstone is google's senior vice president for communications and policy and
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:32.040]   Very adept with the animated gif. Yes. She has two of them
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.400]   This is kind of a google thing right now because a week ago
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.280]   A google sent a reporter an animated gif
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:45.800]   Here as well to the daily pot reporter so they've got a little animated gif thing going on right now
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:49.480]   Maybe that's uh, they must have it on the servers. They're the internet
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.720]   A little little do they do they claim you google plus
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:57.480]   That's a good one. I haven't seen any of these
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:00.840]   um
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:04.600]   All right time magazine says google tricks us
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:10.520]   Actually, I agree with this one google tricks us into thinking we're smarter than we are
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:16.280]   Reason facts. Yeah, I know I i'm a lot smarter ever since google
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:20.040]   A study in the journal of experimental psychology general
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:22.680]   published uh last monday
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:26.280]   Even when participants couldn't find answers on the internet
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:30.120]   They still felt an increased self-assessment of how much knowledge they had
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.240]   When when they tried to use google
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:37.880]   Matthew fissure the lead researcher at yale
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:43.000]   Says it became it becomes easier to confuse your own knowledge with this external source
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.920]   If people don't have a browser, they don't have google if they're truly on their own
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:49.560]   They may be wildly inaccurate about how much they know
[01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:52.600]   And how dependent they are on the internet
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.320]   I love that final sentence
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:16:02.520]   The study adds to existing research that suggests searching the internet for information creates an increase in quote cognitive self-esteem
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:10.600]   Unquote though not necessarily an increase in intelligence. I have high cognitive self-esteem. Yes very proud of that
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.680]   truthfully
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:15.880]   When I first started doing the radio show and people would ask me tech questions
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:20.360]   It was uh with devorac in the early 90s with there was no internet search
[01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:22.600]   I had to know this stuff off the top of my head
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.960]   But I was a younger guy and there was less to know then yeah
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:30.680]   I don't think I could do the radio show without google anymore if you go under under numbers
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:35.960]   Uh, there's a related one. I'm not going to tell you okay. Subscribe. I'm giving you a license
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.920]   Okay, telegraph says and I think this is a really
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:42.680]   troubling idea here
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:47.080]   Uh that they're trying to argue this but that men are better at googling than women
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.600]   What I know it's a what it's a no
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:52.920]   Is that self-reported?
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.200]   Uh, no, it's all that so ridiculous study of of of boys
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:02.280]   I couldn't quite figure it out. I put it up right before the show started. Yeah studies are yes
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:07.880]   We know that I do believe that older people are better at searching google because we use boolean searches
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:09.960]   We remember when you had to do it anymore
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:18.360]   People just go and say like oh selfie stick. Oh, you're not the problem with the headline says scientific and anecdotal evidence suggests
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:24.120]   Yeah, lump those two together. That's brilliant. So everybody apple
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.600]   google
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:32.680]   And facebook all designing new corporate headquarters as they've cashed in on the internet facebook was smart
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:38.760]   They uh, they've opened their new headquarters and they invited a bunch of top instagram photographers to document it
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.880]   Which means we have no idea what it actually looks like. Yeah, right?
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:46.200]   Unfortunately, uh, because they picked all the most interesting colorful places
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.400]   facebook's was the guacchiest because they deliberately frank gerry
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:52.280]   Deliberately designed it to look unfinished
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.400]   Oh
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.400]   And so there's paints dripping everywhere
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:58.280]   Edges of the walls and things are are
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:05.240]   Rough there's like cement floors. It looks like it's under construction still which is gary did the uh,
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:10.520]   Experience music project in seattle. He did the the the what is it the la or whatever in
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.600]   Spain spain the bars in barcelona or madria bill county asked cafe bill
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:20.360]   Museum bill bill bow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, um, I think he does the the amici mouse
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.680]   Whatever it's called disney the disney
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:25.320]   Theater in la the disney auditorium
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.720]   Uh and all this stuff looks weird. Yeah
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:32.200]   This this one has a giant it's all one room, right?
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:37.720]   Uh, it's 430,000 square feet. It is lead certified
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:41.080]   The weirdest thing is that picture you have on the screen there that is a park
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:44.440]   That's on the roof. It's on the roof. The roof is actually a park
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.600]   Right and the uh garage is underneath
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:52.840]   What happened to their the headquarters? They've been in which has the kind of disney land courtyard. Oh, that's old
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:55.000]   No, it's still there. This is an additional
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.720]   They're using the house. This is the real hu now
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.320]   Uh, it's probably
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:05.880]   Zuckleby nine acres of grass on that roof 400 trees and a half mile walking loop on the roof
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:12.760]   But that offsets, you know, that's a carbon offset and they're on the water there too. So there's a there's a there's a water view
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.440]   And they own significant acreage next door
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:21.400]   So we haven't seen the end of it. I want better pictures. This is from fast company
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.440]   Uh, you know, there were some other pictures. I want some other pictures
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:27.000]   Remember when when we did the story about google's
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:30.920]   Propose new headquarters. They're really trying to enclose the outside
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:36.680]   So now i'm bright when they go walking, you know, nobody's gonna snoop on them. They can go up to the roof and get nature
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.200]   Yeah, it's like a bio. It's like the biosphere
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.440]   Yeah, you're inside this natural environment that's indoors
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:48.360]   Right the one place on earth where you actually don't need that at all
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.000]   I know your california
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.800]   Because the headcore has like perfect climate it never gets too cold
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.600]   Just down the road from kevin. He knows
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:00.680]   Every kevin body biosphere is a climatological humble brag
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:06.200]   I have my own little like mini biosphere here
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:13.080]   I've got a canopy of sits out over the gardens and and the apple spaceship campus is actually the the donut part of it is now
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:16.680]   Being constructed and there's a new 4k video
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:24.200]   Is there another drone video drone video, but you can see that it's um, you know, they've got they've got the first
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:31.080]   Sort of wedge of it sort of built up all the way to the to the ceiling with just the you know the frame
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:36.840]   It's the cyber pentagon. It's gonna be something to see that. Yeah, but I'm really excited about this one
[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:42.280]   One thing. Thank you for quadcopters. I'm saying this is great. We get these incredible views
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:47.480]   Is this illegal? No, it's public air space man
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:52.440]   If you're doing it for non-commercial if you're doing it for commercial then you fEA has FAA has rules, but
[01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:55.240]   Now you're flying right over it. That may not
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:59.080]   This is probably illegal and and the other thing is that there's a case
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:05.800]   a story that's hit recently that the FAA contacted somebody and said that because
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:10.360]   He posted a drone video on youtube. He also did it on his website
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:14.280]   But because ads are sold it's therefore was a commercial use of its own
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:19.800]   We'll see how that works out. The thing to remember is the FAA actually has no enforcement arms, so they're just
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.480]   They're just
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:25.800]   It's a bit of that's a bit of a first amendment issue. I think yeah, yeah
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:29.480]   But there it is you see that's the that's the chunk and and this
[01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:32.040]   Is a public safety issue with these drones
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:39.800]   I mean, I think it's it's it's appropriate for the FAA to have an opinion on this
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:46.360]   Yeah, because they're these things are flying through the air there some of them are very heavy profit versus not for profit is not the delineation
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:49.400]   There's a public safety and a privacy issue
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:52.280]   Right because they have liability right
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:56.600]   Yeah, I don't know why I guess probably because of the first amendment they can't
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.880]   Communist commies they're commie. They're all commies in DC. I have here a list
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:05.720]   Elon Musk
[01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.560]   Does he announced?
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:10.120]   What he's going to do tomorrow is tomorrow is his is
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:17.560]   Somebody said it had to be a watch and and his his um april fools joke is that it is a watch. Yeah. Oh
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:20.200]   No, he's gonna say he tweeted
[01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:23.560]   On march 30th two days ago
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:26.040]   Major new tesla product line
[01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.880]   Not a car
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:35.160]   Will be unveiled at our hawthorn design studio thursday 8 p.m. April 30th. So it's a month and the speculation is it's a home battery
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:38.360]   Yeah, he's building a battery factory right right yeah
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:41.720]   But just the tweet
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:45.320]   Given that musk has 1.86 million followers
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:52.040]   Increased the value of tesla's stock by more than a billion dollars. It's good work if you can get it
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:54.520]   So well so so now you can imagine
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:57.160]   uh the sec and lawyers
[01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:02.520]   Are our rub-in hands wondering whether just executives tweeting is gonna
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:08.200]   Is no seen as because they already been the population you remember them going after read Hastings
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:13.640]   Right because the netflix founder and ceo tweeted a couple of years ago
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:16.360]   And he was cleared
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:22.040]   Because the regulators decided that as long as you it's okay to use social media
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:24.440]   to disseminate material information
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.920]   as long as
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:32.120]   You it's the expectation of investors and you let them know you will be doing that as long as investors have been alerted
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:38.360]   About which social media will be used to disseminate such information the sec says it's legal so
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.320]   Elon musk obviously paying attention to this
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:48.360]   Um a battery a watch. It's not a car. Well, you see the watch on the next leg i just put up. Oh, let me look
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:56.120]   For a while I roll I know so he he uh he basically announced
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:24:05.320]   It's big ben on your wrist. I'm sorry that as I was told
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.120]   Many times when I was in London that is the Elizabeth tower on your wrist
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:16.280]   The bell inside is big ben. Am I right kevin marks? That is correct. It's been rene angela's with tower. Yes
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:19.320]   All right, it was just wasn't it used to be called big ben
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.600]   No, I didn't the tower itself didn't have a name
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.760]   It's just part of
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:28.200]   Parliament, but they named it Elizabeth tower for the golden jubilee right?
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:30.840]   It is the key is the bell is the imagine
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:33.480]   so uh, this is good it uh
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:36.120]   It's a new watch the model w
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:42.040]   I wouldn't i'd wear that. Yeah, it's a weapon. Yeah, you would I would
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:46.040]   As long as there's little rodents running up and down inside
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:49.480]   the model w
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:55.400]   This is in no way a competitive response to what some other company is doing
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:01.960]   No longer will you need to rudely examine your phone to read text messages
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.120]   Now you can politely stare at the tiny screen on your wrist without anyone noticing
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:09.320]   All right
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:12.760]   I think tesla's confused. I don't really know what's going on here
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:15.480]   Is it a watch? Is it big ben?
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:19.480]   uh back first just a second to elan musk and his and his tweet
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:26.280]   Um, uh zane up to fescue he was a wonderful sociologist on twitter and academic who's from turkey
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:30.600]   uh when when the far left
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:36.760]   Uh terrorists you have to call them took a prosecutor hostage in in turkey two days ago
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:44.200]   Yeah, they were tweeting it and then they then they went to facebook to yell at twitter for having killed their account
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:49.400]   And it has this has to be a first in history that you have you have uh terrorist
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.480]   uh kidnappers
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.200]   uh
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:55.080]   Complaining about a social network on a soft network. Oh
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.960]   They're terrorist trolls
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.720]   Yeah, yeah
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:02.840]   I loved speaking of trolls. This is definitely a trollish article
[01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:07.960]   The boy genius report meerkat is dying and it's taking us tech journalism with it
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:14.280]   Taking us and others to task for uh being so uh excited about meerkat
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:21.720]   J rosen and uh at nyu uh went after this piece on twitter with the author for not
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.160]   um
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:28.440]   naming any of the of the of the outlets that that he was accusing of doing bad tech journalism and then the author came back and said well
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:30.920]   I fear vendetta like it's the least
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.560]   Well, okay
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:37.000]   I will I will say we were one of them so we talked a lot about it
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.480]   But I but we don't so what his point or her point is
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:46.040]   That if anybody would just take a look at the top charts on itunes
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:53.800]   Uh or read app any you would know that no that meerkat is not a success. That's not why we talk about a program. We don't we're not saying
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:27:00.600]   I mean we we were genuinely excited. I still am about meerkat and we think it's good mike you've used it a lot
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:08.120]   Um, but that has nothing to do with the download numbers. We're not we don't right we don't vet our news stories based on download numbers
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:11.800]   That's a misunderstanding of what what the job of a journalist is
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:17.720]   So yeah, this is a ridiculous story. I think that I think the I think the bigger story
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:22.520]   It's a delicious irony. I think but a lot of the tech press
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:32.120]   Slam google glass as an invasion of privacy right and many of the same journalists carrying around their meerkat
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:36.760]   Yeah, the many of the same journalists who were slamming it now are the ones who are into you know
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:40.520]   Literally doing what nobody was doing on google glass
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:48.040]   Uh and so it turns out that the it turns out to the real crime of google glasses that camera is not pointed at you
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:51.000]   Aaaah
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000]   And so
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.320]   Mirror with you. Yes, exactly. No, it's not the cameras on your face if it's in your hand
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:01.400]   It's okay, but if it's on your face, it's not but I mean literally people are now streaming
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.480]   Powers recording strangers who don't have permission. No, it's true
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:10.040]   If we if you walk around the studio a little bit, there's there's no meerkat signs and places
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:15.800]   That's individual employees who put up signs in their in their offices saying don't don't come in here with that meerkat
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:19.000]   And we've actually had a caution employees. Please don't meerkat
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.720]   Uh in certain areas because there's you know, there's you finally said no more of the office
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:29.720]   No, I didn't say that people can still meerkat here. I I told one individual no more, but that's because yeah, but it's two
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:34.680]   All the time. Yeah, let's do it. But uh, uh, I don't know people get meerkat here. I'm meerkat
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:41.160]   But uh, we don't want them going by the accountant screen and people seeing, you know, private information and things like that
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:46.360]   And that's the real it is the issue with a little bit with meerkat is that you know, you just walking around but there's stuff, you know
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:50.440]   All over the place. Maybe you know, you don't have the right to show on your meerkat
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:52.920]   I think meerkat's cool though. I
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:54.920]   Periscope to me is a little bit less interesting
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:59.480]   Uh, it probably will win because it's twitter's right and they can just hang in there forever
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:04.520]   We had a great interview with ben ruben who's the founder of meerkat one of the founders of meerkat on uh
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.520]   on the triangulation
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:12.280]   Airing this week and I highly recommend it because he's a smart guy. He was actually really thoughtful and
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:18.360]   Intelligent and we talked about what makes something go viral what you know, why meerkat was a hit and so forth
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:24.760]   Although the point well taken from the boy genius report meerkat's uh download numbers have dropped dramatically
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.840]   um
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:33.160]   It peaked at 130 on the us 130 on the us iphone download chart and is now uh has dropped. Oh no
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.160]   He's talking that's a secret. I'm sorry
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:37.480]   um
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:44.360]   But again, you know if people already have it the questions are they using it right and that's that is a question
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:48.360]   And ben told me half a million users, which I think is a significant number. Yeah
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:51.000]   That's that's not a bad number. No
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.320]   Uh, I think you'd have more if you do an android version. He's working on it. Yeah, so is periscope
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:30:00.120]   I I not I think it's an interesting category this idea of instant live streaming
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:06.520]   He makes a point that he has he's in a very specific vertical the ephemeral instant live streaming the stuff that doesn't get saved
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:11.400]   Periscope, we thought was gonna be safe. It was only safe for a day. Yeah, so even that is ephemera
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:15.240]   Right and that makes it a little easier to do if you know nobody's gonna see it right
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:18.520]   Unless they watch live
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:21.560]   Uh
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:24.440]   Looking at the rest of this
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:29.960]   I think uh, I think we could take a break and uh and wrap this up with our picks. Y'all agree anything else you wanted to talk about
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:37.240]   Well, I was I was gonna give you my little perspective on real-time streaming if you if you if you want, but you know, here's the king of real-time streaming
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:39.720]   One of the authors of quick time. Okay, brocuss. Yeah
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:43.160]   uh, so
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.480]   So yeah, but the background here is that um
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.480]   For christ 15 years ago 17 years ago when I was at apple
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:56.120]   But the first thing that I got assigned was building quick-time broadcasting, which was um awesome
[01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:01.720]   Which was pushing out which was trying building this stuff in the os level and into quick time itself
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:04.600]   So the the quick time streaming part had been built
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:07.080]   um, but it was two weeks to
[01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:10.440]   Wwc and they only had stored streaming and
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:13.720]   Steve jobs said no, we need to demonstrate live streaming because that's the point
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:19.720]   And so as the new guy who hadn't been assigned yet. I got dropped on the can you build on live streaming three days two weeks?
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:23.400]   Um, which was you know, it was just gluing together bits of quick time was already there
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:27.000]   We already had this is a nice thing about quick time. We already had video caption audio capture and a
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:33.320]   The sequence grabber and that stuff and they already had the other stuff to do the hard bits of sequencing and playing it over the thing
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:35.320]   So it was just like call this piece of code
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:40.520]   For instance other piece of code right do that in the loop and so on so it sounds like I did some really cool
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:41.720]   most of you
[01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:45.400]   Coaches go then just suppose it's a lot of programming these days
[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:49.240]   But it was so that was my my first experience at apple was um
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:55.240]   Here's this thing we're on this and then two weeks data Steve jobs and Peter holly. We don't make it on stage at um
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:59.400]   That one went into that leave it doesn't go well. He'll have your head
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:05.800]   Well, Peter Peter was shooting me from from that aspect of it, but yeah, that was that but that was that was kind of fun
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.640]   but the point of it
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:11.080]   The thing that we then went on to build what was called quick time tv
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:13.800]   Which was a live streaming?
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:15.000]   Um
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.760]   Thing for doing what we're doing now on twig
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.160]   Um, but with broadcasts and things like that
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:24.840]   So that was we had we're trying to run like 24/7 streams of the vbc and things like that
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:30.760]   So that was fun in that I then had to write code that would maintain timing between audio and video across weeks
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:33.400]   Which is harder than it looks
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:34.360]   um
[01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:38.120]   But we got we got that you know, we got all that stuff working, but what we what I realized
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:45.960]   Having spent a couple of years on this is that the actual use case of live broadcasting is not very useful
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.600]   And in fact this generalizes to tv as well
[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:49.720]   um
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:50.840]   because
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.840]   most of the time
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:55.400]   The people aren't ready to watch it
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:01.080]   It's a it's a historical artifact of television that was based on the fact that we couldn't buffer anything. That's all we could do
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.240]   Right, so you know television was
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:08.600]   So all we could do was live broadcasting radio too. Um, there wasn't any way to record anything initially with radio and tv
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:12.840]   Recording tapes came later and was was very hard to do videotape only came in
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:15.800]   into widespread use in the 70s and so the
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:18.360]   um
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:21.400]   The the model was built around this live broadcast model put
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:24.120]   Everyone watching the same thing at the same time
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:29.640]   Um, and then we were replicating that in the computer and actually it's not that useful most of the time
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:34.760]   One of the the advantages of the computer is that it does store things and make it easier to store things and keep multiple versions
[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:39.160]   So the actual valuable thing is Netflix and youtube not so much the live broadcasting part
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:44.040]   And we struggled for a while trying to find uses for this and what I realized was that the valuable thing
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:49.400]   Is that when you have a live broadcast and the people watching it can respond to you
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:53.080]   So you have a chat room like we have here then it's actually useful
[01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:55.560]   um, then you're able to um
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:00.920]   Have this back and forth and it's useful for us as as broadcast is because we're getting directly back
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:05.720]   What we're saying and suggesting the thing is useful for you as an audience because you can have that back and forth
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:10.760]   With the people watching it isn't just in one way stream and without that piece it doesn't make sense
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:16.200]   So the the reason these things are more interesting than what we built then is that they built that piece into it
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:19.800]   They're using they were using twitter to bootstrap that back and forth conversation
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:21.240]   Um
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:25.640]   And that they built that the challenge is still that most of your live broadcasting is very dull
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:28.600]   Um because most of the time there isn't anything interesting happening
[01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:32.200]   Anything interesting does happen you want it recorded so that you can replay it later
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:36.120]   And you see this with tv whenever tv is like and we're live from
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:38.280]   um the
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:42.200]   The political summit and we're standing outside waiting for the president to come out and say something
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:45.640]   It's very very dull. In fact tv has moved away from doing that these days
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:50.280]   Well, but but even even more to the point as we learned with the brooklyn fire the fire in new york city
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.800]   Um people who are using meerkat and periscope aren't
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:57.160]   Doing even that they're not explaining what's happening
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:59.800]   And so sometimes people will go to a live event and
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:04.840]   To view on meerkat. They don't know what's going on. Nobody knew what was going on with that and there was no
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:09.560]   Expert commentary so it's even worse than than tv in that sense
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:13.080]   Right
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:15.800]   Exactly
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.720]   So, so that you know the challenge for all these things is
[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:24.680]   Um, it's also very exciting for you to be high here. I am live
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:30.360]   Right, we're doing it here now and it's there is a seductive part of that and that's been part of the problem with
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:32.360]   um tv
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:36.200]   People are understanding the internet in you know over the last 15 years
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:40.120]   Um has been there that is their mental model of it and that's what they cared about
[01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:44.120]   So a lot of the things that were built for tv over the internet were that
[01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.760]   Um, here i am live to the nation worldview
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:49.560]   Which matters a lot to the person doing it matters less to the people watching it
[01:35:49.560 --> 01:35:52.920]   And it took a while for the the people watching it to get the upper hand
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:57.640]   In terms of being able to watch what they wanted when they wanted rather than being stuck in their loop
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.480]   Because that was the tv's mentality as well
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:04.600]   And to some extent we're still stuck in in that model with watching video over the net in that
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:10.760]   Um, we have this very elaborate setup that's designed to not buffer things
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:15.000]   So if you're actually using a lot of these streaming services to to watch video
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.800]   You will still look at you will get like quality dropouts and buffer glitches and stuff like that
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:23.400]   Because the way they were designed
[01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:29.080]   Um by the cable companies and the tv people and the phone companies they all had this like
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:33.160]   Real-time presumption, um men that they're not buffering enough
[01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:36.280]   So they don't hope there's not enough stored locally to get you over the glitches in the network
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:41.400]   And that that's still that's you know, that's something that's been gradually addressed but mostly addressed by
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:46.040]   Um getting more massive than it has been by buffering things locally better
[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:48.040]   So it is it's one of these sort of ongoing
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:52.920]   You know problems with the designer things, but it was interesting to me to see this sort of sudden spike in this thing
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:55.960]   Because you know, I literally went through this 15 years ago where
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:01.560]   Um, it did really feel like deja vu not just for 15 years ago, but from five years ago
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:03.160]   From three years ago
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.480]   Well quick quick is q1 qiq
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:10.760]   Yeah, it was the other start that did this um went to it was young and did it very well and impressively on a bunch of very
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:13.160]   You know crappy phones compared to what we have now
[01:37:13.160 --> 01:37:17.240]   Yeah, and of course, you know just just in tv was the can we make a network out of this
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:24.360]   Um version of this before and that didn't do that well and the the the the ongoing challenge is to do what you do here
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:26.360]   So you know, it's a really big challenge
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:28.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:32.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:34.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:38.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:40.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:42.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:46.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:48.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:54.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:58.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:06.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:08.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:10.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:12.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.360]   And it's a really big challenge that you're going to be able to do it
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:18.360]   If you're going to do it and you don't have two takes, the minute you have take two
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:20.360]   The energy, it takes a professional because the energy just goes
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.360]   Bzzt, zero because there's no, it's not high stakes
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:27.360]   So for me take two always guarantees that take three
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:31.360]   Yeah, so doing it live raises the stakes for the performers
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.360]   So that's one of the reasons we do it
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.360]   The other reason is actually I think a very very valuable reason
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:42.360]   You can't really have really truly interactive programming unless you're doing it live
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:44.360]   People can't interact with you an hour later
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:50.360]   So I think we've sliced the baby well
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:54.360]   Which is that we know that our business, our business started on demand
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:58.360]   Our business did not start live, we added live for those two reasons
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:02.360]   But the main business is still the download business
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:08.360]   And of course, because viewers want, viewers want to watch when they want to watch
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:13.360]   I'm of the opinion viewers like to watch something that is, you know, look at Jimmy, look at the tonight show
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:18.360]   Like Jimmy Fallon, Letterman, those are all live to take because there's an energy that you get from that
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:22.360]   That you just don't get otherwise and you get audience interaction, you get a live
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:28.360]   There's no reason, if you've ever seen live to tape like the sound of music in Peter Pan without an audience
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:30.360]   It's horrible
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.360]   Yeah, yes
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:35.360]   It's just, it's flat, if they had put an audience in there it would have been great
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:40.360]   So to me, that's why we do live, but I completely agree with you Kevin
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:45.360]   That live isn't what the audience is looking for, and our audience proves that 95% of our audience is on download
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:49.360]   Well, for the people who do want it, it's there and it's exciting
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:57.360]   Well, and we offer a little value add because they see behind the scenes, you know, it's more of a, you get more of a relationship with the broadcaster
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.360]   If you're watching live and you can chat and so, right?
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:07.360]   No, but the other interesting part of that is Twitter in general as the back channel for live TV is also the piece that I wasn't
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:11.360]   Right, you need a signaling mechanism
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:18.360]   No, but actually bringing this to live TV, so the point is I've, you know, I had stopped watching any live TV at all
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:22.360]   But there are certain things that are more fun to watch with Twitter heckling
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:26.360]   Exactly, the Academy Awards with Twitter running in the background is awesome
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:31.360]   Exactly, and the one for me that made me realize this was the the row wedding
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:38.360]   Where I stayed up late at night to watch the row wedding precisely because I follow enough British people on Twitter that I knew that I would have a hill area side channel
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:41.360]   Right, it's why I watch Eurovision
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.360]   Oh god, yes, Eurovision is
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:51.360]   Right, because all my European friends get surprised, what's what's what's an American doing here? Geez, but that's the fun of it, exactly that
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:58.360]   Well, that's Eurovision is sort of this mass cultural bonding of like how ridiculous are we all? It's great
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:02.360]   And the Super Bowl live sporting events, you know, after the fact they're not as interesting
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:08.360]   So, and Mirkat, it's one of the reasons people point a lot to the news reporting issue of Mirkat
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:13.360]   There is that immediacy that you get on a live streaming app, are you periscoping? I'm periscoping
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:17.360]   What do you like better periscoping? I like periscope better
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:21.360]   It just feels more solid periscope? Yeah, that's why I don't like it
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:25.360]   Mirkat feels like you're really on the edge, anything could happen, anything could happen
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:31.360]   And also it just feels more rough, it feels a little more rough and ready, periscope feels very corporate
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:35.360]   You get, you get to see that when you first launch the app in the streams that are recommended
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:41.360]   Mirkat recommends streams of people you follow, people you care about, periscope is Twitter's agenda
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.360]   So it recommends stuff that Twitter wants
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:47.360]   And on Mirkat you get bigger audiences, much bigger, several times bigger, yes
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.360]   But that's a timing thing
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.360]   But it takes time, right?
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:54.360]   For some reason periscope, you get your audience and then it dwindles
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:57.360]   With Mirkat, it grows and grows and grows and grows over time
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:02.360]   So if you're going to do long sessions, Mirkat is better, if you're going to do short ones, periscope is better
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:03.360]   Ah, that's interesting
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:10.360]   You know, since the, my thing is, I want to buffer, I want to save it
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:15.360]   And, because I feel like, if I want to put the effort into doing a broadcast, I want
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:19.360]   So really, your heritage really shows in how you feel about all this stuff
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:25.360]   But, so then I started looking at, well, and what really bugs me, why can't Android do YouTube live?
[01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:30.360]   So I played with some devices that do that, like the HTC Re
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:35.360]   But shouldn't your phone be able to start a YouTube, what do they call it, hang it on, hang it on
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:37.360]   Hang out on air, exactly
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:40.360]   Shouldn't I be able to do that from an Android device?
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.360]   You should have been able to do that three years ago
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:44.360]   Google missed the boat here in Mirkat and Periscopes
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:45.360]   Exactly, exactly
[01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:53.360]   But I'd be very interested if I could do hang out on air here, as I travel, like, I'm thinking about for our Europe trip
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:56.360]   I would love to do a daily little thing
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:00.360]   Rick Steves does such a good job, his Facebook feed has all, little short videos
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:05.360]   They're just clearly shot like this, and they're great, they're really slices of life in all sorts of places
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:10.360]   If I could do that, and it would be saved to YouTube, I'd be very interested
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:11.360]   Yeah
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.360]   Come on Google, you can do it
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:16.360]   Seems like an obvious thing
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.360]   Did you read about, this is so funny
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:25.360]   So Lazlo Bach, who is a Googler, just wrote a book, he's a head of people operations, in other words, human resources at Google
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:30.360]   He's got a new book, but Christopher Mims reviewed it in the Wall Street Journal
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:34.360]   But today Christopher did cull a little anecdote from it
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:38.360]   That I think is so funny, this goes back a few years, 2008
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:43.360]   A Google employee sent Larry Page the following email
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:46.360]   Oh, this is from the menu today
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:51.360]   If there is no good answer or action from the company, I will quit in protest
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:57.360]   The employee was referring to food being served in the cafeteria
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:02.360]   Called the free-to-bet Goji chocolate cream pie
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:06.360]   I remember that, that was a huge thing
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:08.360]   Were you at Google? At the time?
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:11.360]   Apparently Google called it a "kilo thread"
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:16.360]   There were so many responses, the fastest thread in Google's history to exceed 100 responses
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:19.360]   The longest email chain debate in Google's history at the time
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:24.360]   It bounced back and forth across the globe between Google's many international offices
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:29.360]   Some in China were of course free-to-bet as a not a good phrase
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:35.360]   Some engineers were incensed that Google would imply that Tibet should be free even in the name of a menu item
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:40.360]   Others took the opposite stance, yet others worried that this was an issue of free speech
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:47.360]   If the chef can't name a pie as he pleases, what kind of talk would be regulated at Google next?
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:45:00.360]   The chef was suspended immediately, and Bach, as the head of human resources, says that he saw, among other things
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:10.360]   To make the point, some suggested Westerners would be equally offended if some chef in London had offered free whales pie
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:18.360]   Or free Northern Ireland cookie, others went so far as to suggest Texas polygamy steaks
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:21.360]   And war of Northern aggression hotcakes
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:22.360]   I like that one
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.360]   I would eat those
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:25.360]   I would eat that
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:29.360]   The thing with the Texas polygamy steaks is you get several of them
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:37.360]   Bach later reversed the chef's suspension as far as we know he's still making free-to-bet goji pie
[01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:40.360]   Do you have after you have your freedom fries?
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:43.360]   That cafe has been closed, but yes
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:44.360]   Has it? Oh, alright
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:47.360]   So you were there, you were there for that event?
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:49.360]   I think they should reincarnate the free-to-bet goji
[01:45:49.360 --> 01:45:52.360]   I'm gonna make some free-to-bet goji pie tonight
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:53.360]   I should
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.360]   Well, I mean, is there a recipe?
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:56.360]   I know
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.360]   It should be a recipe
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:02.360]   I think the thing, so that was the, there was
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:11.360]   A very sort of hippie vegan cafe that was on the main circle at Google Building 41 I think it was
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.360]   Which had that free-to-bet thing
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:19.360]   And what they didn't take into account was how many Chinese engineers worked at Google
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:20.360]   Right, yeah
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:22.360]   And this set off all their buttons for them
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:24.360]   And it is one of those things
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:30.360]   Now, also it's also this sort of default assumption problem that Google has
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.360]   Which is that everyone is like us
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:33.360]   Like us, right
[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:37.360]   And that is an issue that Google has and has bitten them on more than one occasion
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:40.360]   Because their mental model of the world is put around that
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:46.360]   And they haven't been that good at having the empathy that's needed to think of people who aren't like them
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:51.360]   And that's part of the difficulty of building a sort of campus like that
[01:46:51.360 --> 01:46:52.360]   Like both they and Faye
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:54.360]   Spooka doing as you were saying
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:59.360]   Is that you end up building this complete, like separated from the world enclave
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:02.360]   That is very hard for people to move out of the mindset of
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:06.360]   The book is called Work Rules Insights from Inside Google
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:13.360]   And does not include, because I just searched a recipe for free-to-bet goji chocolate cream pie
[01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.360]   You missed a bet, Sarah Ladslow
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:17.360]   Because I'm craving it now
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:18.360]   I'm one some
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:22.360]   Freedom fries, it is, it's like freedom fries, isn't it?
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:24.360]   Alright, we're gonna take a break
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:29.360]   And if you would, pick tips, ideas, thoughts
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:35.360]   And Jeff will give us a number of the week as we wrap this up, the back of the book
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.360]   I call it coming up next
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:41.360]   Our show today brought to you by Zippracruder, am I right?
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.360]   Zippracruder.com, yes
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:47.360]   Love Zippracruder, what a great idea, in fact we've used Zippracruder
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.360]   If you are Ladslow Bach or somebody responsible for hiring
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:55.360]   Maybe you have a small business and you're the chief cook and bottle washer
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:59.360]   You know that job boards have made this much easier
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:03.360]   But which job site is the right one for the employee you're looking for?
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:07.360]   And it's kind of a pain if you go to more than one unless you use Zippracruder
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:13.360]   Zippracruder lets you post to 50+ job sites and social networks like Twitter and Facebook
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:15.360]   With one click of the mouse
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:20.360]   And I love this because the worst thing of course about having an opening is the emails and the phone calls, right?
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:26.360]   Not with Zippracruder, all the applicants go into Zippracruder's easy to use interface
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:30.360]   So you can quickly screen them, rate them, and hire the right person fast
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:34.360]   Without all those annoying phone calls, if you want to find the perfect hire
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:37.360]   You got to post your job on all the top job sites
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.360]   And with Zippracruder you can
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:42.360]   You can post to 50+ sites including the social networks with a single click
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:45.360]   Find candidates in any industry nationwide, you post once
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:49.360]   And you watch your qualified candidates roll into Zippracruder's easy to use interface
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:53.360]   And since you don't mind when you get a lot of applicants
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.360]   Because you don't have to handle those phone calls
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:57.360]   You might as well try their premium traffic boost
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:02.360]   That gives you up to three times the candidates in any application
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:07.360]   This is so great, Zippracruder, no wonder it's been used by more than a quarter million businesses including Twit
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:10.360]   Try it free right now, zippracruder.com
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:13.360]   And you'll get 30% off your first traffic boost
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:17.360]   Zippracruder.com/twig
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:21.360]   And by the way, if you use TWIG or this week in Google when they ask you how you heard about it
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:25.360]   I should be ever eternally grateful to you
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:29.360]   Zippracruder.com/twig
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:36.360]   Now my friends, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for tips, tools, picks and numbers
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:38.360]   I'll like Kevin Marks
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:42.360]   Because he's kind of our guest today, I'll let him start things off
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:47.360]   So the tool that I wanted to mention this week is called Huffeduff Video
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:49.360]   Huffeduff?
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:54.360]   Now, I'm pretty into it like this is like a tool on top of the tool really
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:50:00.360]   Huffeduff in the ham world is high-frequency direction finding
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:03.360]   That may be the geekiest thing I've ever heard you say
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:05.360]   So Huffeduffer?
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.360]   Huffeduffer.com
[01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:09.360]   That was my direction
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:11.360]   Yeah, yeah
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:13.360]   Huffeduffer was named after that
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:15.360]   Huffeduffer.com
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:18.360]   That was not the geekiest thing I've ever heard you say Kevin
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:22.360]   I frequency direction finding, yes
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:26.360]   So this is a site that Jeremy made a few years ago
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:29.360]   And the point of this is it gives you a little bookmarklet
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:34.360]   And when you find an MP3 on the web, you click the bookmarklet and it stashes it in a podcast feed
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:36.360]   And then you subscribe to that podcast feed
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:40.360]   And then you get that when you're out walking, so that's been around for years
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:43.360]   2008, this is about, so that's a seven-year-old thing
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:45.360]   So it's got like Instapaper for MP3s?
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:49.360]   Yes, except I think it predates Instapaper, but it's 2008 that Jeremy built this
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:56.360]   So Huffeduffer was great, recommend that, sign up for that, subscribe to your own podcast
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:59.360]   Subscribe to mine if you like, I throw things in here every now and then
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:01.360]   Huffeduffer.com/KevinRox
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:06.360]   But the tool that I was talking about this week is one that's been built
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:12.360]   That will take a video file and turn it into an MP3 and post it to Huffeduffer
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:14.360]   Oh, neat tool!
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:19.360]   But the value for this is so, you know, unlike Twig which sends both versions so you can get both
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:26.360]   If you see something that's in video and you think that's actually really a tool that I'd like to hear
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:31.360]   There's a little button you can click and it sends it to Huffeduffer, it mums the video into audio into that
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:37.360]   So the great example this week for me was Neil Gaiman talking about Terry Pratchett
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:46.360]   So the day that Terry Pratchett died, Neil Gaiman had a pre-existing speaking event in San Francisco
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:52.360]   And so there's a video of that which is Michael Chabon interviewing Neil Gaiman and talking about Terry Pratchett
[01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:58.360]   But I also munged that into an audio file with Huffeduffer
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:05.360]   So Huffeduffer, I haven't Huffeduffer, so when I was walking the dog's the other night I got to walk around and listen to Gaiman reminiscing about Pratchett
[01:52:05.360 --> 01:52:07.360]   Which is great, I recommend that
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:10.360]   A lot of times you don't need, this is our show's a good example, but that would be also
[01:52:10.360 --> 01:52:12.360]   The audio's all you need
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:15.360]   Right, talking heads, you don't need to see the faces
[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:20.360]   Right, and you know, I have listened to things on YouTube while walking the dog
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:24.360]   But it's a bit silly because I've got video streaming to a screen I'm not watching
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:28.360]   I don't think YouTube is smart enough to just send me the audio, so it's a little bit wasteful
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:34.360]   Whereas this is a useful way to do that transformation if you want it
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:39.360]   And so if you've got, and it's not just YouTube, it works on Vimeo and a bunch of others as well
[01:52:39.360 --> 01:52:43.360]   It basically looks for the video file, pulls it out and turns it into an audio file
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:47.360]   So there's a certain use case for this that I think is powerful
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:51.360]   But part of it is this idea of transforming a time shift that I was talking about before
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:53.360]   With the live streaming stuff
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:56.360]   Making that on-demand experience more easy
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:53:03.360]   And the value of podcasting is very much that you want to be able to do this, listen to this at another time in the future
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:06.360]   So the combination of those two tools is great
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:10.360]   But it sort of plugs into the infrastructure of podcasting that's already there
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:13.360]   And can people subscribe to Kevin Mark's Houghthuff Feed?
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:16.360]   Yeah, yeah, there should be a subscriber there
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:18.360]   Yeah, there's the RSS right there, look at that
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:21.360]   You can even subscribe in iTunes
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:25.360]   Yeah, I mean that's the point, the idea is that you make this and then you subscribe to it yourself
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:27.360]   And so you've got this feed of things yourself
[01:53:27.360 --> 01:53:29.360]   But others could subscribe to your feed, right?
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:33.360]   Yeah, so it's like a curated list of things that I'm bouncing one place to another
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:37.360]   Neat, I don't know why I'm getting an iTunes quick tour, I really don't want that
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:41.360]   Wow, well this is the slight cue Apple
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:44.360]   There we go, look at that, here's your feed
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:46.360]   Look at that
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:49.360]   A pet peeve of mine is people only doing iTunes links for podcasts
[01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:53.360]   NPR is luxurious for this, where they say
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:58.360]   And here's the iTunes link for a podcasting like no, that is not helpful to me
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:00.360]   I don't use iTunes
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:04.360]   There is another tool that will turn an iTunes link into a thing you can give to Android
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:06.360]   I should find that one as well
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:10.360]   So you will like this, in fact, gosh, I should hire you as a consultant as we do our website design
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:15.360]   I'll tell you what, once we launch the private beta I'll invite you, Kevin
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:21.360]   But we debate this considerably because we're going to have a subscribe button, obviously, on our shows
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:26.360]   Currently we do a lot of, you know, it's a very long dropdown
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:29.360]   Because of course we don't just do iTunes, we do everything
[01:54:29.360 --> 01:54:33.360]   But what I've been saying, and I told the design team we're going to do this
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:40.360]   Is would you just please give me a text of the RSS feed
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:43.360]   And just put that text right next to every show
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:46.360]   So that somebody can copy it and paste it
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:50.360]   Because I feel like at the very least we should tell people
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:56.360]   Here's the actual RSS feed, and if you have your own way of getting RSS, you can use this
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:59.360]   Right, well I have here
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:06.360]   There's another site of mine, which is Unmung.com, u-n-m-u-n-g.com
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:08.360]   Do I show you that before?
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:10.360]   I don't think so
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:13.360]   This translates iTunes into...
[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:17.360]   No, this translates feeds into web pages
[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:24.360]   So if you've got a feed, it'll turn it into an indie web marked up age feed
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:27.360]   And if it's got podcasts and it'll give you little players in line
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:32.360]   It just brought it to its knees, of course, because you never anticipated more than a thousand people
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:35.360]   It should have spun up
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:37.360]   It'll take a minute to spin it up, okay
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:40.360]   Unmung.com
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:46.360]   It's a RSS to HTML
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:47.360]   So you can take the RSS feed
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:50.360]   Safari used to do that, by the way, and they took it out
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:52.360]   Such a nice feature
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:57.360]   So the point of this one is that it does it to the indie web marked up age feed and age entry and all that stuff
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:01.360]   So it works with the indie web readers as well
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:08.360]   That was my iteration, but actually I found it quite useful as I have a podcast and I want to see that
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:13.360]   The Permalink and play that episode, because many of those sites they're hard to find
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:16.360]   So it's a way of working with that thing
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:25.360]   The challenge is subscribing because there isn't a coherent prefix for saying this is a podcast feed
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:31.360]   So the Android apps try and claim this but it doesn't always work and you often need to copy and paste
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:41.360]   The link will probably be hot and say podcast colon slash slash because if you've registered a pod catcher on your machine
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:45.360]   Some machines will handle that properly, etc. Or is it PCAST?
[01:56:45.360 --> 01:56:47.360]   That's the problem, there isn't a problem
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:49.360]   Or is it feedly?
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:54.360]   Or is it so we try to do the right thing which is make it as easy as possible for you to subscribe
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:57:01.360]   Because obviously that's what we want, but it's non-trivial and I have enough history and context having done this for ten years now
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:06.360]   That everybody looks at me like what you want to have an XML file link?
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:11.360]   Well that is the problem, this is the problem with RSS in general, is that you click the link
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:14.360]   And you see a page full of gibberish and you back away again
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:17.360]   So that's the problem with direct RSS links in themselves
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:24.360]   So the thinking with Ammon was like, well this is the same information present in HTML which is probably more useful
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:27.360]   Maybe I should cross link to Unwon
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:29.360]   I won't do that, I promise
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:32.360]   I won't do that yet, if you're going to do that, I'm happy to do that
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:35.360]   Give me the code, maybe we could figure out a way to do that, actually be kind of cool
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:39.360]   I would need to add some caching because the moment it fetches the thing every time
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:43.360]   I could do that, but I'd have to add some caching to the same people
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:49.360]   I think what we decided is not to make it a link that you can click because of for that very reason
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:55.360]   But anybody who's smart enough to look at it and see the RSS.xml would say, oh yeah I can cut and paste that
[01:57:55.360 --> 01:57:57.360]   I think that's what we decided to do
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:57:59.360]   Right, but this is a structural problem with podcast
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:05.360]   Which is the reason that NPR says go to iTunes and search for whatever
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:12.360]   Hey, you can't put links in audio, but even when they do it on the page, it's how we don't have a good link format for this
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:14.360]   That sounds like something for us to
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:18.360]   Yes, we need to solve that, would any web get to work on that right away?
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:25.360]   I just asked them to think about it, but the challenges, there's a lot of infrastructure out there, you have to change
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:26.360]   That's the problem
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:28.360]   You see how long that drop down is? It's crazy
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:33.360]   And there's only a lot of decisions, you had a HD or less than HD from here
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:38.360]   But we still want to, so the challenge is to give people choice without overwhelming them with choice
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:42.360]   And I don't, I think we just assume our audience is intelligent and we leave it at that
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:45.360]   And give you the choices and let you figure it out
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:52.360]   I'm mean to ask you, does any of those formats, does serving it cost you or is that where cash fly comes in?
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.360]   Cash fly helps
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:59:00.360]   We pay for the website, but cash fly pays for the, you know, we have a deal with cash fly
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:07.360]   I mean, it's not free, but we, cash fly does the, so if I go to, here's the Docker episode, today's Docker episode
[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:10.360]   He ran a finally got the Docker guys on, that's great
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:17.360]   And if you, if you click subscribe to audio, we do iTunes, Feedly, my Yahoo, we probably take that off pocketcast, itcher, zoom
[01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:22.360]   What? Other podcast clients, that's the PCast, and then the RSS
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:27.360]   And the news site will do this a little bit differently, obviously, but look at video, it's crazy
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:35.360]   So this is the issue, and we've got to kind of simplify that, and we've spent a lot of time thinking about exactly what to do there
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:41.360]   Because we do want you to subscribe, ultimately, that's for us the best thing, as if you subscribe to it
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:47.360]   I think, my thinking has changed a lot about how important the web is and so forth to this
[01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:54.360]   I believe that, and this isn't necessarily a good thing, and I know as an indie web promoter you think it's probably terrible
[01:59:54.360 --> 02:00:00.360]   But really apps are going to be the solution for a lot of our users, and if we can get them to put a Twit app
[02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:06.360]   Or use their own podcast app on their mobile device, that's going to be the most likely way to subscribe
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:13.360]   The challenge with the Twit app, you know, the Twit app would work because you have enough forecasts in the same way that an NPR app works
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:21.360]   The challenge is, it doesn't actually solve the distributed problem, the value of half-duffer is that I can turn an arbitrary thing on the web
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:25.360]   I think that feeds into the app I'm already using to consume it
[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:32.360]   The value of an open standard for this stuff is that you can have multiple publishers and multi-consumers
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:34.360]   That's what makes it work
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:41.360]   The challenge is that the infrastructure for this was designed, you know, 2003-ish
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:46.360]   And so the methods we did to build it were built on what was available then
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:49.360]   And things that have happened since have been a bit clugey
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:56.360]   And the point where Apple sort of stepped up to the plate and said, "Yes, we're going to support this in iTunes"
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:02.360]   And later in iOS, that was extremely useful because it gave a place for people to do it
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:06.360]   But the way they did it didn't move the state of the app forward in an enormous helpful way
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:11.360]   The challenge of it is that Apple added a whole bunch of random stuff to the feed you have to add just for them
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:16.360]   The override is in the feed everyone else can read
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:23.360]   So there's still some craftiness there, but the problem is that there is a very diverse ecosystem of things that read podcasts
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:26.360]   And they don't all quite do the same thing
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:33.360]   So it would be nice if we could add things we talked about page that you could link to
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:36.360]   And you could put that in the post of the thing
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:41.360]   The number of podcasts, players that actually display that post as HTML
[02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:44.360]   Let you click on it is fairly small
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:48.360]   Podcasts are antiquated, we got to solve this
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:51.360]   Yes, please, somebody, somebody
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:54.360]   Maybe I'll ask you one more question if I can, we'll work with her for the second one of my students
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:57.360]   A couple of my students have podcast businesses, which is cool
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:02:01.360]   What do they consist of? What is the business?
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:08.360]   Yeah, what is the business? There's more than one business there, it's interesting to see what they're actually doing
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:20.360]   One, I don't want to give away too much, one immersive audio of people's experiences
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:24.360]   I know that sounds really vague, but I don't want to give away too much of a business
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:29.360]   And the other one is a, and right now there's two big media companies fighting over her
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:34.360]   Which I love is a better guide to podcasts, I think that's a big opportunity there
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:39.360]   So one of the questions was how do you deal with promotions?
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:40.360]   It's like audio
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:42.360]   Yeah, audio, there you go, that's it
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:46.360]   I know, well, but now the time wasn't there, maybe the time is now
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:49.360]   Whatever happened to him in Williams?
[02:02:49.360 --> 02:02:53.360]   No, no, it just has flop after flop, you know
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:03:00.360]   So, so, Leo, in a stream in Facebook now with the auto play and video
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:05.360]   What we were talking about in class yesterday was obviously somebody's not going to auto play an hour and a half of this
[02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:07.360]   Then stop their Facebook screen
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:09.360]   We're not real good on YouTuber's Facebook
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:12.360]   So, but you started doing the little snippets, right?
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:15.360]   Yeah, we have Twitbits on YouTube
[02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:16.360]   How's that much?
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:17.360]   Twit
[02:03:17.360 --> 02:03:20.360]   Oh, it doesn't, I mean it's promotional, because
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:25.360]   I know that, but is it helping to promote? Are you, are you, are you getting any metrics for that?
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:30.360]   You know, are, yeah, I don't know
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:32.360]   I don't know how this stuff works
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:36.360]   How do you get somebody to, how do you promote a little bit of video to get somebody to subscribe?
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:39.360]   Promotion, you know, here's the problem with promoting Twit
[02:03:39.360 --> 02:03:43.360]   It's really an acquired taste, and it's only for some people
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:49.360]   I don't really want to promote it to a mass audience because 90% of them will hate it
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:50.360]   Yeah
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:55.360]   So, right, I don't know how you market something
[02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:58.360]   It's like mustard or something, it's like horseradish mustard
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:01.360]   And you just, I think you have to hope that the people like Marmite
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:03.360]   Yeah, Marmite
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:06.360]   You're not going to run a big ad for Marmite or Vegemite
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:08.360]   Because if people try it and go, that's the worst thing ever
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:13.360]   And all you can do is create huge amounts of conversation about how bad Marmite is
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:18.360]   So what you really want is to be under the radar and have people discover you who might be interested
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:23.360]   But that's, but yes, but that's the question is some better tools of discovery
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:25.360]   Well, but it ain't Facebook
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:28.360]   I don't, you know, I used to do live with Regis and Kelly
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:32.360]   I've done that a dozen times in the last 15 years
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:37.360]   And I realized finally even though 4 million people watch it, none of them are interested in Twit
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:38.360]   Yeah
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:40.360]   So, so
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:41.360]   Yes
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:43.360]   You know, it's the wrong, it's just the wrong group
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:46.360]   So, I mean, I'm not going to buy ads in the computer world either
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:51.360]   I don't know, really, I think the best thing to do is hope that people will stumble upon us
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:57.360]   Well, you know, I promote tech news today in two ways
[02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:02.360]   The first way is that we have a lot of brilliant tech journalists on the show every day
[02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:04.360]   Yeah, so you're cross promoting it, so
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:06.360]   And I bring their audience to it
[02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:11.360]   I mention them on social media and then people who are interested in them might want to watch our show
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:12.360]   Because we have them on the show
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:15.360]   The other way is that I do regular blog posts on Google+
[02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:18.360]   You know, it's stories, like this happened in the news
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:23.360]   I throw some of the controversy, some of the conversation we had on the show
[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:26.360]   And then I link to that segment in YouTube
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:29.360]   So that people can go directly to that segment
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:35.360]   And my hope is that people will, after repeatedly going and saying, "Well, that's interesting, well that's interesting"
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:36.360]   Why don't I just subscribe?
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:37.360]   Yeah
[02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:40.360]   And I'm not sure if that's the solution, probably isn't
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:45.360]   But I see it as a link to that you put in a blog post
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:48.360]   For people who are interested in these topics
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:50.360]   I mean, we do that, we do a lot of tweeting
[02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:55.360]   And, you know, the thing that was the most successful ever for TNT was Stitcher featuring it
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:05:58.360]   Whenever Stitcher features your show, we get our audience doubles
[02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:01.360]   So I have no idea how this stuff works
[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:04.360]   Sometimes you and I will sit down, Jeff, and
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:08.360]   But I have this counterintuitive idea that it's not a good idea
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:10.360]   Market to the wrong people
[02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:12.360]   Yeah, no, I agree with that
[02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:13.360]   Right
[02:06:13.360 --> 02:06:18.360]   But the challenge is with podcasting what you're saying is
[02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:20.360]   It's like saying radio
[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:23.360]   I hate the word podcast, I've hated music
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:27.360]   I gave the second keynote podcast expos
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:29.360]   I said, "Stop calling it a podcast!"
[02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:30.360]   And everybody thought I was nuts
[02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:32.360]   Well, we used to call it audio blogging
[02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:34.360]   That's worse!
[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:38.360]   But podcast was an improvement, anything
[02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:42.360]   Yeah, but that's, you know, it's internet broadcasting
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:46.360]   And it's the same, how is this any different from meet the press or whatever?
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:49.360]   I have this argument all the time with people who do video online
[02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:51.360]   And I call it television, they get all mad
[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:53.360]   And I said, "No, no, take over the word"
[02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:55.360]   Right, right, it's our word
[02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:58.360]   Yeah, we are broadcasters, not them
[02:06:58.360 --> 02:07:00.360]   So to say, do we call it radio?
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:01.360]   Do we just say this is radio?
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:02.360]   Yes, yes
[02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:04.360]   Why not? It's way better than radio
[02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:06.360]   And you should basically get in your car
[02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:08.360]   And your podcast is true
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:10.360]   It's a parody with radio as far as
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:13.360]   Customizable radio and customizable television
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:16.360]   Well, I am amazed people all the time, Leo, I was at
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:17.360]   Sorry
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:20.360]   Not being a broadcaster, I banged my mic
[02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:21.360]   I do it too, so
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:22.360]   Everybody
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:28.360]   I was a Madrid a few weeks ago, you know, and I talked to Prisa, the gigantic
[02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:31.360]   publisher of El Pais, an owner of huge radio stations
[02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:35.360]   And I do this all the time, I die now on you all the time, Leo
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:39.360]   And I tell him the story of Twig and Twig
[02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:43.360]   And what amazing thing it is, just the idea that we make TV and radio at the same time
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:46.360]   And every time I mention this, that baffles the whole
[02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:49.360]   Oh, well, they're not going to get it, but it's just that much easier
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:50.360]   Yeah, it's easy
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:51.360]   Why didn't I think that?
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:52.360]   Right
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:56.360]   Yeah, I mean, my only thinking is make it available
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:59.360]   And make it as easy as possible
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:03.360]   For somebody to watch it, make it available as many different formats, as many different ways
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:07.360]   Whatever, anybody, however anybody wants it, that's how we'll offer it
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:10.360]   The trick that I want, the Burger King of media
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:14.360]   Yeah, however you want it, because our goal is eyeballs, we don't, you know
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:17.360]   You know, here's what I want, chat room
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:21.360]   You have this amazing public out there who God knows why you watch this whole time
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:23.360]   But I love you for doing it
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:29.360]   And if they would go to time codes of their top three favorite moments in the show
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:32.360]   Funny moment, you know, one minute here, minute 30 there
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:36.360]   That you could just embed a YouTube video with that in and out
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:44.360]   It would make it easier for us to get people who would be interested in sample things
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:45.360]   Well, that's true
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:50.360]   We have a pro, we have, you know, obviously the problem with podcasts, especially long form, is sharing
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:56.360]   And YouTube does have a way to share directly to a spot, but nobody knows about it, it's obscure, it's hidden
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:09:01.360]   It's easy now, actually, if you click share while you're playing it, it says share at this time now
[02:09:01.360 --> 02:09:02.360]   So it has got easier
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:03.360]   You have a check box
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:09.360]   But the trouble is you have to scroll back, because you think that was really funny, I like to show this like no, it's too much work
[02:09:09.360 --> 02:09:16.360]   And we've thought long and hard about maybe making our player have a share button that you could say, share here
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:21.360]   There's got to be a way, in fact, I think that's the solution is that if somebody's watching it on some form of player
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:26.360]   That they could press a button that tweets that minute, maybe minus 30 seconds
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:29.360]   But it's fine, you know what, I'm not
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:32.360]   You don't have to get big, we just have to get better
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:36.360]   So serious suggestion here, I mean, and this is something that
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:41.360]   Podcasts used to have chapter lists, because they inherited that from quite time
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:42.360]   So much work and it's iTunes only
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:47.360]   Yeah, and they've stopped playing it play anymore, so it's been broken
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:51.360]   But the idea is strong, the idea of a chapter list is actually what you want for these things
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:56.360]   And it would make sense to construct chapter lists for these shows
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:10:00.360]   And then YouTube has chapter lists, it's terrible idea
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:04.360]   I want somebody to listen to the whole show, I don't want them to jump to a part of it
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:10.360]   No, but you put, well that's the challenge, yeah, because the challenge is, you have a chapter list
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:14.360]   I have three ads, I want them to hear every single damn one of them
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:17.360]   Exactly list, this is what I'm saying
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:24.360]   I listen to it, as the audience what I want is the chapter list, because if I go to the indie web website
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:31.360]   We had a great discussion about this indie web thing, hang on, I've got to go and try and guess where in the thing it is, I would never mind
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:38.360]   So the question is, would sharing the snippets leave people to subscribe to the whole thing?
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:42.360]   And that's the trailer if you've got to do, or you've got to pre-roll ads on the chapters or something
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:49.360]   Which, the problem is then you get the, some of the TV shows do this, so like the cooking channel
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:54.360]   They have a web player for the shows on the cooking channel, which I thought was great
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:11:00.360]   Until I tried to pause one and come back, and when I tried playing for the middle it played all the ads I would have seen up to that point
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:02.360]   Before it would let me play the next one
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:03.360]   Even though...
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:04.360]   I'm not doing that either, that's...
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:07.360]   Even though I've already seen them and I'm pretty with them with a bloody saying
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:08.360]   Yeah, I don't...
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:11.360]   That just irritates, I don't want to make the pig sing
[02:11:11.360 --> 02:11:17.360]   So, but you know, the value here, oh my, my flag is gone, there we go
[02:11:17.360 --> 02:11:23.360]   But the value of the chapter markup is potentially that you could do, people could do that individually
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:26.360]   So I used to do this for Apple keynotes
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:33.360]   When QuickTime supported chapter list, I would watch the two hour long Apple keynotes and put my own chapters in to say
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:37.360]   This bit was interesting, bunch of waffle here, blah blah blah
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:41.360]   Which meant that people could skip through it and see the pieces they wanted
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:45.360]   I don't want to show anybody else particularly care, how much use they got
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:48.360]   But there's value to that, and it maps to the thing you were saying about the chat room
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:51.360]   The other thing that you could do is, as the chat room does have timestamps in it
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:58.360]   I think, you know, at the back end, if it's IRC, they are, you know, second timestamps or fraction of second timestamps
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:06.360]   You could tie that to the recording and give people in the chat room a command to say, you know, I like that bit
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:11.360]   So that it would then, no way of, you know, actually have some egg drops
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:17.360]   So, another concept that I pioneered but never implemented
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:21.360]   And the Tesla of podcasting is something I called the river
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:24.360]   We do audio and video streams, I wanted to do a textual stream
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:33.360]   That would include hosts wouldn't have access to it, it would include links, it would include comments curated from the chat room
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:41.360]   And we actually have a number of scripts that were written years ago for chat mods to go that one
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:47.360]   That one, and it would be very easy for them to extend that to that time code, that time code
[02:12:47.360 --> 02:12:53.360]   Unfortunately, there is latency, so the chat room is off by some number of seconds as much as 30 or 40
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:13:01.360]   There's all sorts of problems, you know what, my have decided, having thought about this non-stop for 10 years, screw it
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:06.360]   If people like it, they'll tell their friends and they'll tell people it's appropriate
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:11.360]   And we don't need to grow hugely, we're doing just fine, I'm happy with this situation, right?
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:17.360]   Right, and it's the loyalty that, again, the most amazing moments I have, it happened before last week's show
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:21.360]   When somebody stops me in the street of New York or Munich or Sydney
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:25.360]   And says, "You Jeff Jarvis, twig, we love Leo!"
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:28.360]   That's what makes this a special problem
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:34.360]   That's all I need, and then if all the effort I put into is not into marketing, but to making it a better experience for end users
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:40.360]   That's what we're trying to do with the website, that's what we're trying to make it a better user experience
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:43.360]   And if I do that, then that's enough, that's good enough
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:50.360]   Yeah, anyway, that's for you, part of my grumpy old man act from QuickTime is that we have lost a lot of this stuff
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:53.360]   So it's something when I mentioned QuickTime, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, QuickTime had some...
[02:13:53.360 --> 02:13:59.360]   You had more than that, you could click on regions, you had, QuickTime was amazing
[02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:03.360]   And Apple slowly stripped all the best stuff out of it
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:09.360]   Remember that, you could, like, I remember Alex Lindsey getting excited that Barreons could make videos
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:14.360]   And you could click on the tent, if you said that's an neat tent, and it would then go to a webpage
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:17.360]   Or you, I mean, there was some neat stuff in there
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:25.360]   Yeah, but the key thing that was neat about it was that it had the concept of edit points built into it
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:30.360]   So, the, you know, somebody said, "Oh, QuickTime was the worst media player"
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:31.360]   That is awesome
[02:14:31.360 --> 02:14:35.360]   Well, there were places where it didn't play well, it had some grief on Windows for a while
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:37.360]   But that did get better over time
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:46.360]   But the thing was that what it did have was a good understanding of combining and editing media together to sample accuracy
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:50.360]   So you could create a QuickTime movie that pointed into multiple different files
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:53.360]   And then flatten it out into one that you could share with other people
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:54.360]   Or you could share it with the pointers intact
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:55.360]   Right
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:15:01.360]   And it also supported more than just all the NVIDIA with support text tracks came in early early on
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:04.360]   So I could make these in chapter tracks for a special case of text track
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:12.360]   So you could have a text track that was running along underneath the video that was, you know, was just, you know, could be subtitles could be...
[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:14.360]   Yeah, could be links, could be a chatroom track
[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:15.360]   A chatroom track?
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:16.360]   It was a bit
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:17.360]   Yeah
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:19.360]   And that was all there
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:21.360]   And the loss was...
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:28.360]   Firstly, the loss was moving to streaming because streaming was, was seems the big thing
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:35.360]   But the second piece was that all the media, subsequent media players had this "I'm going to play it for the media" into one Go model
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:36.360]   And not the idea of editing
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:37.360]   Right
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:39.360]   So VLC is a wonderful media player, but it's a terrible editor
[02:15:39.360 --> 02:15:40.360]   Right
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:44.360]   And the editing process, and the audio editing thing has come so way
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:47.360]   The editing process now does involve re-rolling files all the time
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:50.360]   It no longer has its ability to point into different bits and pull it together
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:53.360]   And we get away with that because we have so much more storage
[02:15:53.360 --> 02:15:57.360]   But we've lost that dynamic editability piece that was there
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:03.360]   And that, you know, that, for the digital, you know, for my digital media players, that's the saddest thing
[02:16:03.360 --> 02:16:04.360]   In that there was a lot of power there
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:05.360]   Yes
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:11.360]   Now Apple screwed this up in lots of ways, one of which was like trying to enforce patents on the file format
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:13.360]   Which was like completely wrong
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:15.360]   In your idea, yeah
[02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:23.360]   But, and not being quick enough to, you know, open source bits of it, which was meant that other people could have adopted it
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:29.360]   But the actively sabotaging use of the file format was possibly the stupidest thing they did
[02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:35.360]   But what it means is that the actual audio/video file formats we have now do not have this concept of editing
[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:39.360]   And so they're doing this stuff is now quite hard
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:45.360]   And we had a talk, a digital talk that made this very, very viable and easy from, you know, the
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:50.360]   Whenever they first shipped QuickTime, early 90s through to mid 2000s
[02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:53.360]   Well, and that's Kevin Mark's pick for the week
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:54.360]   Now we're going
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:57.360]   [laughter]
[02:16:57.360 --> 02:16:59.360]   If you could remember it
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:01.360]   There's three chapters just in that pick
[02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:02.360]   Hufford duffer
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:05.360]   Ladies and gentlemen are
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:09.360]   Huffduffer.com
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:13.360]   And now it's time for our number of the week from Mr. Jeff Jarvis
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:17.360]   I just put a link into the far right column on the rundown, let me have a go to that
[02:17:17.360 --> 02:17:26.360]   So a tweet I just ran by, by Muhammad al-Sakaf looked at mentions of computer phobia in books over the last year
[02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:32.360]   So that was first step, is it starts in 78-78
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:34.360]   Yeah, yeah, mid 70s
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:36.360]   And he said about what 80-86
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:38.360]   86, yep
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:40.360]   So now to be a favor, add comma
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:42.360]   Technophobia
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:44.360]   Ah, computer phobia
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:46.360]   Technophobia
[02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:48.360]   Technophobia comes down
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:50.360]   Yeah, but guess what?
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:53.360]   Search lots of books, but look at Technophobia
[02:17:53.360 --> 02:17:56.360]   So the blue line is computer phobia, the red line which
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:18:01.360]   As soon as technophobia starts to, computer phobia starts to go down, starts to skyrocket
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:03.360]   And the technophobia
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:07.360]   So we were afraid of computers and computers became everywhere, we weren't afraid of computers anymore, we still needed to be afraid
[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:09.360]   So now we're just afraid of technology
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:11.360]   So Jeff, I vampir is in what happened
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:14.360]   I told you this by email, but I'm not sure if you saw the email
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:17.360]   I actually bought Technopanek.com
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:20.360]   Because I thought somebody would do that, and so
[02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:22.360]   If you wanted it's yours
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:24.360]   I might well be right in the bottom
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:25.360]   Oh, okay
[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:27.360]   You bought Technopanek.com
[02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:28.360]   That's the most brilliant
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:30.360]   I was stunned that it was available, so I grabbed it
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:32.360]   How long ago did you get it Mike?
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:34.360]   Oh, six months ago, something like that
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:36.360]   That's beautiful, I didn't see the email, that's cool
[02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:37.360]   I'm gonna tweet this
[02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:41.360]   So the blue line in the bottom is computer phobia, the red line is technophobia
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:46.360]   Zombies is the orange line, and vampires is the top line, alright?
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:47.360]   Okay
[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:54.360]   I'm just pointing out here, as afraid of technologies people are, it's still, you know, zombies and mostly vampires
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:57.360]   Should I put Justin Bieber in here?
[02:18:57.360 --> 02:19:01.360]   Yeah, is there a Bieber phobia? Probably
[02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:03.360]   Oh, yeah, I suffer from it
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:05.360]   No, look, Bieber's flat line
[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:07.360]   Nobody cares about Bieber
[02:19:07.360 --> 02:19:10.360]   Jeff, I mean, Mike, do you have a pick?
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:15.360]   I do, I have four things that I have some oldish news, new news, really new news
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:17.360]   All streaming related
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:21.360]   The first is that some time ago somebody came out with a site called
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:23.360]   MIRCATStreams.com
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:25.360]   Which shows all MIRCATStreams in one place
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:27.360]   So called God Mode
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:31.360]   In fact, there was a hack, if you held your finger on the MIRCAT head
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:33.360]   For five seconds exactly
[02:19:33.360 --> 02:19:37.360]   The MIRCAT would look the other way and you'd get God Mode, but they turned that off
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:39.360]   Too bad, yeah, too bad
[02:19:39.360 --> 02:19:40.360]   But now you can do it on the web
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:42.360]   So here's a really cool look at this
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:45.360]   Here's what you do when you actually open the stream
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:49.360]   It's a chrome plugin called MIRCATPlus
[02:19:49.360 --> 02:19:53.360]   What it does is it puts the comments, including the ability for you to comment
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:55.360]   On the web version of MIRCAT
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:56.360]   What?
[02:19:56.360 --> 02:19:57.360]   So what?
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:00.360]   Exactly, so here we are, this is the MIRCAT we're doing right now
[02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:01.360]   Yeah
[02:20:01.360 --> 02:20:05.360]   And this is the MIRCAT site, so it super-imposed it on the actual official MIRCAT site
[02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:07.360]   And what?
[02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:09.360]   And then you just comment and you see all the comments
[02:20:09.360 --> 02:20:11.360]   Does MIRCAT have an APR?
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:13.360]   They're just tacking into it
[02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:14.360]   I don't know
[02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:15.360]   Okay, so there's that
[02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:17.360]   I don't know how Mr. Rubin feels about it
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:20.360]   The same people who made MIRCATStreams created a periscope version
[02:20:20.360 --> 02:20:22.360]   Which came out today, I believe
[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:24.360]   It's called onpariscope.com
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:27.360]   It's called Periscope Streams
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:29.360]   And again, you just can refresh it
[02:20:29.360 --> 02:20:33.360]   And this is really fascinating because it shows you a different site
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:34.360]   It's much more global, isn't it?
[02:20:34.360 --> 02:20:37.360]   Yeah, you're seeing people driving around Saudi Arabia and stuff like that
[02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:39.360]   It's like really very, very cool
[02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:41.360]   Which has the most nudity
[02:20:41.360 --> 02:20:42.360]   I don't know
[02:20:42.360 --> 02:20:43.360]   Unfortunately
[02:20:43.360 --> 02:20:45.360]   I thought these would rapidly become
[02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:47.360]   Pouring it, Havens
[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:48.360]   Yeah, this was
[02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:49.360]   What was the
[02:20:49.360 --> 02:20:51.360]   Anonymous video chat with me?
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:53.360]   Chat Roulette
[02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:55.360]   Chat Roulette, there is MIRCAT Roulette
[02:20:55.360 --> 02:20:57.360]   The thing is though, that this
[02:20:57.360 --> 02:20:59.360]   Have small audiences, so the point people probably
[02:20:59.360 --> 02:21:02.360]   So you're MIRCATting right now, we can watch it
[02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:04.360]   And you could use this extension
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:07.360]   To chat into this MIRCAT
[02:21:07.360 --> 02:21:10.360]   You can just write there on the web, which I think is what everybody wants to do
[02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:13.360]   Okay, so here's the new new new new news
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:14.360]   The new new new news
[02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:15.360]   I think we started the show
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:18.360]   Oh no, it didn't, a little before
[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:21.360]   But Facebook has a new app called RIF
[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:23.360]   R-I-F-F
[02:21:23.360 --> 02:21:26.360]   And basically it's a collaborative video creation tool
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:28.360]   Where basically you create a video
[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:32.360]   And then your friends take your video and they add their video
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:34.360]   And then another friend adds another video
[02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:37.360]   So it's a way to have this sort of
[02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:39.360]   Serial additions to a video
[02:21:39.360 --> 02:21:42.360]   And it tells you what to do, so you tell your friends
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:45.360]   Okay, make a funny face, do this, do that, the other thing
[02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:48.360]   And so it's a fun way to create
[02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:51.360]   Not live streaming, but a video that goes, yeah, exactly
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:53.360]   But you do have to give it a hashtag
[02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:55.360]   Hashtag, hashtag
[02:21:55.360 --> 02:22:00.360]   Of some kind, and then your friends can view it and choose to add their own clips on that topic
[02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:02.360]   And that's how Facebook figures out that you're riffing
[02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:04.360]   Oh, you already have a RIF?
[02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:06.360]   This is your RIF?
[02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:09.360]   We have an insful now that's the desktop of it
[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:10.360]   This is the app?
[02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:11.360]   Yes
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:12.360]   Facebook RIF
[02:22:12.360 --> 02:22:13.360]   So this is what are you doing right now?
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:15.360]   So this is like Meerkat in a way too, right?
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:17.360]   Yeah, it's instant, and then
[02:22:17.360 --> 02:22:19.360]   Is this somebody you know?
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:22.360]   American and Paris backstage
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:24.360]   Oh, this is somebody else's riff
[02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:26.360]   Balancing act
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:31.360]   So somebody else, well let me see, is anybody rif on you?
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:33.360]   What is your hashtag on this?
[02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:35.360]   It's for me and my Facebook account
[02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:38.360]   Oh, so you have to be a Facebook friend with F&D on
[02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:40.360]   So maybe somebody's
[02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:43.360]   2,000 people have seen it, surely somebody
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:46.360]   Ah, there's a even better juggling job
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:48.360]   You're going to go one out of six next to the icon?
[02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:50.360]   Ahhh
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:54.360]   So this is actually the one they have on the
[02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:56.360]   Page actually
[02:22:56.360 --> 02:22:59.360]   Okay, so this is actually exactly the same as on the website
[02:22:59.360 --> 02:23:02.360]   They're just kind of demonstrating what you would do
[02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:03.360]   Oh, I'm going to get RIF in
[02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:05.360]   Yeah, that's great
[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:08.360]   So those are my, I guess those would be picks of the week
[02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:10.360]   But I have some breaking news, which is that
[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:14.360]   Nixon's mansion in San Clemente is now for sale for $75 million
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:15.360]   $75 million?
[02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:17.360]   You bought it for $1.4 million
[02:23:17.360 --> 02:23:20.360]   That's even more than Jay-Z paid for title
[02:23:20.360 --> 02:23:21.360]   I know, you should have bought some
[02:23:21.360 --> 02:23:23.360]   Hey, back to RIF for one more second
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:24.360]   Yeah, I know we're long
[02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:29.360]   Did they get rid of the horizontal versus vertical problem by making the video square?
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:30.360]   Square, that solves it
[02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:32.360]   That's all the fascinating
[02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:34.360]   That's what they should have done in Miracad
[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:37.360]   They made it square because they learned that from Instagram
[02:23:37.360 --> 02:23:39.360]   Does it have a
[02:23:39.360 --> 02:23:40.360]   Cafe filter, right?
[02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:42.360]   Yeah, a cafe filter
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:44.360]   Alright, I'm installing RIF right now on my phone
[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:46.360]   It's free from Facebook
[02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:50.360]   And inevitably the people who use RIF will be called RIF
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:52.360]   Right, the RIF RIF
[02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:53.360]   Do you use RIF?
[02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:54.360]   Now you're the RIF
[02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:59.360]   So I told you Jeff Jarvis that I'm slowly coming around on Chromebook
[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:01.360]   The new Pixel really sold me
[02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:03.360]   I know it's $9.99
[02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:04.360]   No ties, if no
[02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:06.360]   I know it's $9.99
[02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:08.360]   You know, one of the things that I realized is
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:12.360]   Part of the reason people have a bad experience with Chromebooks is because they're crappy
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:13.360]   Yeah, exactly
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:17.360]   But when you get a, and I understand now why Google did the Pixel three years later
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:21.360]   Because if you have an experience on good hardware, it actually is amazing
[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:24.360]   So the new Pixel has a bit amazing screen
[02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:28.360]   It's touch, it's got a great, everything's great, great keyboard
[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:31.360]   The experience is phenomenal, great battery life
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:34.360]   But then I'm starting to use it more and more because I like using it
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:35.360]   It's a little heavy and clunky
[02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:37.360]   I mean industrial design is a little, you know, squared
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:39.360]   It's not elegant, but that's, it's Google
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:41.360]   It's an engineer's notebook
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:44.360]   But then when you start adding extensions, but there's two things I do
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:47.360]   And I've even said this to you that I can't do on a Chromebook
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:50.360]   That are part of, you know, something I like to do, they're both hobbies
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:52.360]   One is photography
[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:58.360]   So Adobe's already announced they're going to do a new version of Photoshop, a streaming version for Chrome OS
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:03.360]   If you're a subscriber to the Creative Cloud, in fact they're already beta-ang this
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:07.360]   The work is done on their servers, it's kind of like online, it's like the streaming gaming
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:11.360]   The work is done on their computers, but displayed on yours
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:16.360]   So not exactly a VPN, or VNC, it's something a little different
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:18.360]   I haven't tried it, so I don't know
[02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:20.360]   But then the other one is I like to write software
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:22.360]   Just for fun, I don't write anything good
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:23.360]   Just for fun
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:26.360]   And I tried a couple of things, tried code anywhere as one
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:28.360]   And then I found this one, somebody tweeted at me
[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:31.360]   coding.com, K-O-D-I-N-G.com
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:32.360]   Kevin, are you familiar with this?
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:34.360]   I haven't seen this one yet.
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:39.360]   You would like it, so it's a new startup, it's out of San Francisco, let me make it full screen
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:42.360]   And the thing is they have a free tier
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:47.360]   So you can, it spins up instances on Amazon
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:51.360]   That will host a variety of things
[02:25:51.360 --> 02:25:54.360]   Basically it's a Ubuntu instance
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:58.360]   With a very nice IDE on top of it
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:01.360]   Which is kind of amazing, that runs automatically
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:04.360]   And you can do coding in a variety of languages
[02:26:04.360 --> 02:26:07.360]   This is web focused, because in fact you even get a website
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:09.360]   As part of it
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:11.360]   It has full SSH and terminal commands
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:16.360]   It's very Chromebook friendly, I'm going to log into it in just a second
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:18.360]   So it's just a browser window
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:20.360]   It's an H, it works great on a Chromebook
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:24.360]   You could do Go, Python, Node, Ruby, Angular, PHP
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:27.360]   You could play with Docker, WordPress, you could set up a Django
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:30.360]   Ruby on Rails, Laravel instance
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:33.360]   You could create apps, you could write iPhone apps or iOS apps
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:35.360]   So if you're Gina, looking at this
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:38.360]   She could totally use this, because she's doing web programming
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:40.360]   What would she miss?
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:44.360]   I don't know, local storage I guess
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:47.360]   You can't compile an EXE
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:49.360]   So here's the interesting thing
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:52.360]   For free, you can get an instance
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:26:55.360]   So it's one core giga ram, three gigs of space
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:57.360]   By the way, that's plenty
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:00.360]   I've created this, they're only smart
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:03.360]   The one thing it does is the VM turns itself off if not used after an hour
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:06.360]   So it's not persistent enough to use for a website
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:08.360]   But for $10 a month if you buy
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:10.360]   This is what I end up buying as a hobbyist
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:12.360]   So that the VM stays spun up
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:15.360]   In fact, I put Giggle-Om on there
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:18.360]   So remember we were talking, I didn't want to do Giggle-Om before this
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:20.360]   Because they, Giggle-Om went offline
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:23.360]   So we made a little web, somebody sent me some CSS
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:24.360]   It's a very simple site
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:26.360]   But this is running on coding
[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:28.360]   I'm not sure everybody should go there
[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:29.360]   But let me log in
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:32.360]   To my coding account and show you what it looks like
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:35.360]   Because I have to say, for free, this is truly amazing
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:39.360]   And let me see, don't look at this
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:42.360]   Don't look while I log in
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:44.360]   Actually, it doesn't really matter
[02:27:44.360 --> 02:27:48.360]   You can spin down the VM, you can spin it up
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:50.360]   You can do all sorts of things with it
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:52.360]   It's got a, let me, last pass, don't see it
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:54.360]   It's got a bash terminal
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:58.360]   And you can see I've got a web root
[02:27:58.360 --> 02:28:02.360]   So I put in the web root, that's the, there's the Giggle-Om stuff
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:07.360]   And I can do, see the index, I can even, you know, this IDE is, of course, completely functional
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:09.360]   I even have it set up
[02:28:09.360 --> 02:28:12.360]   So that I can, let's go to my terminal
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:13.360]   I can even run Emacs
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:15.360]   I put on Emacs on there
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:20.360]   So you really, if you want a box, a Linux box that you can code on
[02:28:20.360 --> 02:28:24.360]   This is amazing, I've set it up for Go, but you could use Python
[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:27.360]   You have workspaces, so this is my Go code workspace
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:30.360]   So it just jumps right there, it roots it at the top
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:32.360]   And now I can just work in my Go code
[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:34.360]   So you're not installing a darn thing in life
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:37.360]   It's all installing on this Amazon instance, on this EC2 instance
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:40.360]   KODING.com
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:42.360]   The thing is, it's free
[02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:47.360]   I end up paying 100, they get you, because I end up saying, oh, you know, I like that, I don't need more of this
[02:28:47.360 --> 02:28:50.360]   But I think they've done an amazing job
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:51.360]   Can you store your stuff on GitHub?
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:53.360]   Yeah, it supports GitHub
[02:28:53.360 --> 02:28:55.360]   It's a lot of plug-in with GitHub, yeah
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:57.360]   It supports GitHub, supports SSH
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:28:59.360]   So you see I have some authorized keys in SSH
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:03.360]   Which allows me to go from any terminal in SSH into this
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:05.360]   I'm really impressed
[02:29:05.360 --> 02:29:06.360]   Oh
[02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:10.360]   So now, this is the other objection was
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:12.360]   I want to be able to code
[02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:14.360]   And now I can
[02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:16.360]   I would say the one reason left
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:19.360]   That you wouldn't, you wouldn't get a Chromebook is video editing
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:23.360]   And there are video editing things, but I do not video editing it, so
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:26.360]   Yeah, I'm going to leave that to the professionals
[02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:27.360]   Well, my journalism students
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:30.360]   I can't have this, right, just become the computer for journalism
[02:29:30.360 --> 02:29:33.360]   But boy, if you're a regular student like a K through 12
[02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:34.360]   Yeah
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:40.360]   This is all, this, you'd be crazy if you're at a school doing a one-to-one program to do anything but a Chromebook
[02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:41.360]   You'd be crazy
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:42.360]   Yep
[02:29:42.360 --> 02:29:45.360]   Well, I can't wait to get the new Asus Chromebook
[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:48.360]   Because on some trips, just take along this thing
[02:29:48.360 --> 02:29:50.360]   That's both a tablet and a Chromebook at the same time
[02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:52.360]   Lighter, Geez
[02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:55.360]   It's pretty impressive
[02:29:55.360 --> 02:30:00.360]   So, you know, you're winning me over, Jeff
[02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:01.360]   Inch by inch
[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:03.360]   It gets better and better and better
[02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:04.360]   And it's really a-
[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:05.360]   Follow the light children
[02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:09.360]   At this point, I would rather use the pixel than use my Mac
[02:30:09.360 --> 02:30:10.360]   Which is crazy
[02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:15.360]   Yeah, well, just when I had to go in to, you know, find things on the Mac that I'm using right now
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:18.360]   Yeah, and then the Mac is so much better
[02:30:18.360 --> 02:30:20.360]   Well, but the beauty of this is I am on my Mac
[02:30:20.360 --> 02:30:23.360]   And coding and everything that I do on my pixel is here
[02:30:23.360 --> 02:30:27.360]   So it's not like, you know, it's everywhere I use a computer
[02:30:27.360 --> 02:30:33.360]   The thing that I think is the least appreciated fact about Chromebooks
[02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:36.360]   Is the mental state that they put you in
[02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:37.360]   They give you peace of mind
[02:30:37.360 --> 02:30:38.360]   Yes
[02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:39.360]   Right
[02:30:39.360 --> 02:30:40.360]   Because you know it's always there
[02:30:40.360 --> 02:30:41.360]   I can lose it
[02:30:41.360 --> 02:30:44.360]   It's always safe, it's not going to be, you know, you don't have malware running
[02:30:44.360 --> 02:30:49.360]   It's just relaxing to have one and to use it as your main device
[02:30:49.360 --> 02:30:50.360]   Yeah
[02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:56.360]   So I'm working on a chatbot for a chatroom
[02:30:56.360 --> 02:30:59.360]   What was it going to do?
[02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:00.360]   Jeopardy
[02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:02.360]   Do you know about-
[02:31:02.360 --> 02:31:06.360]   Did I tell you about J-Service that I owe? You must know about this, Kevin
[02:31:06.360 --> 02:31:10.360]   Somebody has written, this is hysterical, a full API
[02:31:10.360 --> 02:31:12.360]   To every Jeopardy question ever
[02:31:12.360 --> 02:31:16.360]   There's half a million- no, I'm sorry, 155,000 on here
[02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:20.360]   They don't say Jeopardy anywhere except that looks suspiciously like somebody we know
[02:31:20.360 --> 02:31:24.360]   And you can call this through the API
[02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:29.360]   So I want to have the- so if you're on Slack, there's a- there's a- you could put it on Slack, it's Trebekbot
[02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:31.360]   And obviously they say Jeopardy me
[02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:35.360]   And he'll ask you a question, they keep track of your dollars
[02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:38.360]   And, huh, you get double Jeopardy?
[02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:40.360]   That's cool
[02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:42.360]   Anyway
[02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:45.360]   That's my- that's just, you know, you always need a little something
[02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:48.360]   A little project on this side, I always have something on this side
[02:31:48.360 --> 02:31:52.360]   Kevin, Mark's great to have you, what do you want to plug? Anything going on in your life?
[02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:54.360]   Or you just enjoying the weather?
[02:31:54.360 --> 02:31:55.360]   Um
[02:31:55.360 --> 02:31:58.360]   I think it's Kevin's orange stand
[02:31:58.360 --> 02:32:01.360]   I actually do that, there's always money in the orange stand
[02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:04.360]   Um, indie- indie web is a thing worth mentioning
[02:32:04.360 --> 02:32:07.360]   indiewebcamp.com, um
[02:32:07.360 --> 02:32:10.360]   Which is the website, there's a chat room attached to that
[02:32:10.360 --> 02:32:12.360]   And we have, um
[02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:15.360]   Every other week events in several cities in the US
[02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:19.360]   And we have, um, the weekend-long camps at various intervals
[02:32:19.360 --> 02:32:22.360]   Um, and it's basically a group of people who get together
[02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:26.360]   Trying to build their own websites and work out how to plug them into the rest of the web
[02:32:26.360 --> 02:32:31.360]   So that we're not ignoring the large social net worth
[02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:33.360]   Just making sure that we're not dependent on them
[02:32:33.360 --> 02:32:34.360]   Yep
[02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:38.360]   No, I feel like, I just feel like you're doing God's work here
[02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:40.360]   Well, we've done
[02:32:40.360 --> 02:32:43.360]   It's a small group, but it's good
[02:32:43.360 --> 02:32:48.360]   It's a small group, but the- I've had that big conversation about standardization
[02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:53.360]   It's one of these, like, well, we decided to go off and do our own thing-type groups
[02:32:53.360 --> 02:32:56.360]   And we're starting to get somewhere with it, which is good
[02:32:56.360 --> 02:33:00.360]   indiewebcamp.com, find out more
