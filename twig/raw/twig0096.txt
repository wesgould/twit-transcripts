[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.320]   Gina Trapani is joining us, actually.
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.160]   What?
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.000]   What?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.840]   Gina Who?
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.640]   Trapani.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.880]   Trapani.
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.400]   Tomato, tomato.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.720]   Trapani is here.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.480]   I can't do it.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.280]   I can't do it.
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.720]   Gina Trapani is here from smarterwhere.org.
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.640]   And think up app.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.960]   Hello, Gina.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.880]   Find gentlemen of the free and open internet.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.280]   And we must say, a bullswow to our good friend, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.400]   who is still in Paris.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.040]   Is the EG8 all wrapped up?
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.600]   It did this evening, yes.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.560]   Jeff Seif.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.600]   You've had your soul mall.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.360]   And you've spoken to the president.
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.960]   In fact, I'm going to play the question you asked the president.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.920]   This is-- there's a couple-- there's
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.080]   quite a few videos of you actually at the EG8 summit.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.600]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.680]   Do you want to set this up?
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.840]   What is the EG8 summit?
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.240]   The E8, of course, is the eight world leaders who meet once a year.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.640]   And Sarkozy and France are the president of it this year.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.800]   And he decided to bring the internet to the agenda.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.840]   So he held a prior EG8 meeting in Paris the last two days,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.440]   trying to get a discussion going about internet policy
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.360]   and his belief that he should bring regulation to it.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.320]   He used to talk about wanting to symbolize the internet.
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.800]   He stopped doing that according to my French friends.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.280]   But that's still kind of his attitude,
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.680]   is that he wants to bring order and civilly
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.840]   to this very strange thing we have here.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.760]   As does the Chinese government, by the way.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.360]   Yes, yes.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.600]   Well, it's a problem.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.000]   Yeah, it's pretty out.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.520]   So he kicked off the EG8 forum.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.040]   How many people were there?
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.640]   About 1,000 people in a gigantic tent structure
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.800]   catering by Le Note and party last night in the Louvre,
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.920]   right next to that.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.840]   The tent structure was built on the twillery.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.240]   And so he opened up with more easily from publicists,
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.120]   the big giant edge, the agency that organized this,
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.000]   interviewing Sakhwa Zee after he gave a talk.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.240]   And so he gave the talk and they talked.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.040]   And so then there were some questions.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.360]   And then I, like a rude, a medic hat,
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.600]   drew attention to myself.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.080]   My journalist told me today that she said,
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.760]   well, do they arrange the question with you?
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.640]   I said, well, may know.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.920]   And she said, well, every other question was arranged.
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.000]   Oh, you.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.320]   Oh.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.360]   And somehow, according to her, at least,
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.360]   she has some of the link yet, I don't just verify.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.760]   But according to her, I guess LeVie made the mistake
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.840]   of calling on me and a big mistake of was.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.920]   Jeff, we are so proud.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.680]   I love you.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.960]   Representative Rebel, baby.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.720]   We are so proud you went.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.560]   And here is--
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.560]   I had a job to do.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.520]   I was only there.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.920]   Only there at all, because Leo LeBort, president of the internet,
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.600]   was asked the president to do that.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.240]   And Leo couldn't go.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.880]   And so I went and I figured I had a job to do.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.840]   So I wrote a post beforehand, telling me what I would say.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.800]   And indeed, that's what I did say.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.880]   Yeah, the post is on buzzmachine.com.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.640]   The great post.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.920]   First do no harm.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.960]   Here is the official.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.560]   This is the official EG8 video.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.960]   Which is available on YouTube.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.000]   But of course, because it's--
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.800]   from Sarkozy, it's only 360p.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.320]   So apologies for the poor quality.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.200]   I don't hear any audio.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.360]   Oh, here we go.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.240]   That's Sarkozy, right?
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.720]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.600]   Yes.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.840]   And there's Maurice LeBort.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.840]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.840]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.760]   I'm Jeff Jarvis, University of New York.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.520]   You say that-- acknowledge that government does not own
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.600]   the internet.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.440]   Yet we see governments trying to claim sovereignty there.
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.280]   A US official calls the internet an eighth continent.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.880]   It is a new land.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.240]   And what makes it free and open is
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.320]   its very structure of being distributed and open.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.800]   And so as you go to the G8, I have one small request.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.480]   I think this discussion is wonderful.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.280]   I think this discussion about principles and the internet
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.320]   and shared understanding and potential
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.720]   is very much what we need.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.000]   But I would ask of government to take a Hippocratic oath
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.560]   for the internet, and that is first, do no harm.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.200]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.720]   Not everyone applauding, I know.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.080]   No, a smattering in the back.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.160]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.680]   Well, honestly, it's not difficult to answer that question.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.960]   Do no harm, absolutely.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.800]   I mean, why should you think we would harm you?
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.760]   You've got tremendous potential for growth and knowledge.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.960]   It's extraordinary.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.080]   I like the expression of the eighth continent.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.480]   But what do you mean by harm?
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.320]   I will certainly pay very close attention to this.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.520]   Now, do you mean that bringing up the matter of security
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.840]   from terrorism is a question of harm?
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.440]   Is that harmful?
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.840]   Or if we say to you, you are creative people.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:28.400]   What you've created has to be respected.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.320]   And we have to also respect and protect other creators.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.480]   Is that harmful to you?
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.160]   If we say.
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.560]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.360]   You wanted the eighth continent to be
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.600]   the continent of freedom and openness.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:51.920]   We say that we mustn't give rise to new monopolies.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.640]   Is that harmful?
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:07:00.000]   We can say there's sacred universal values, such as--
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.120]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.960]   --protecting a child from some predatory nature of some adults.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.320]   Is that harmful to you?
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.760]   I do not think so.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.200]   I think what would be harmful to you
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.440]   would be to not recognize that you
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.920]   are responsible competent people, good citizens,
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:30.320]   good global citizens, shouldering their responsibilities.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.880]   What would be harmful to you would be to not even bring up
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.000]   the issue, being afraid you wouldn't understand it.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.200]   You've understood the future so well.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.760]   I certainly fully capable of understanding this matter.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.160]   So if I'm to do a Hippocratic oath of doing harm, yes,
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.680]   I would accept that oath.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.960]   I could even say to you, I like you.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.920]   And I'd rather the sunshine than the rainfall.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.600]   I'd rather businesses making money than businesses losing
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.400]   money.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.360]   [SPEAKING SPANISH]
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.480]   That's a great being here.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.360]   But ask for stronger commitments on my part.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.160]   And what I can say to you--
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.960]   and I'm convinced that for my colleagues
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.760]   as a state and government, the same holds true--
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.640]   we're fully aware of the power of the internet.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.680]   At the same time, the fragility of the overall internet ecosystem,
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.440]   we mustn't enact any measures that
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.360]   would complicate the development of this system.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.800]   I agree with you fully.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.240]   Yes, indeed.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.720]   And I think with the best intentions,
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.440]   we could make for problems.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.680]   So we'd be very careful.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.480]   So I think in this market that you are creating, which
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:43.840]   hasn't yet stabilized, we have to be very careful.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.680]   Think things through carefully before taking a decision.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.320]   The idea of regulating once and for all
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.120]   is ill-suited to your economy.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.520]   We have to be very pragmatic, move forward, evolve,
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.520]   use our experience, learn from it.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:06.760]   We must decide to do nothing rather than do the wrong thing,
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.080]   better just hold back.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.760]   Yes.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.240]   Sector of growth and therefore instability.
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.600]   So that's my oath that I'd certainly be prepared to adhere to.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.920]   And let me say that the fact that some of you
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.320]   came is a good sign.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:26.800]   Because if you felt that it weren't meaningful,
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.320]   you wouldn't have come.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.440]   I really do believe it's extremely important for us
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.800]   to continue this dialogue in mutual respect.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.280]   Believe me, what we want as a state and government
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.360]   is to make no mistake in your area,
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.680]   in your economy, which is a work in progress.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.000]   It's a very fragile, which is very powerful at the same time.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.520]   We do not want to create any instability.
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.760]   So we change a sector.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.800]   That's a good-- I think that's a-- well, certainly
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.960]   a politic answer.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.520]   Yeah, I mean, he started off-- most of it was quite mocking.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.320]   But what is harm?
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.840]   Of course, I'm not going to call it harm.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.800]   There was a--
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.200]   The also journal, which quoted you
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.880]   and unfortunately, without quoting your name,
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.520]   did, in fact, pick up on that kind of dismissive response.
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.520]   And hey, you were just--
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:20.040]   I was just--
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.400]   I was just looking at the wall.
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.480]   And he got quoted around.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.080]   But yeah, he was dismissed above it and said,
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.840]   the good news is he takes the pledge to bad news
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.640]   is he doesn't believe it or know what it means.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.600]   Well, that's-- and I guess that's the difficulty,
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.080]   is that he was smart enough to hit the right notes
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.160]   towards the end there about its nascent economy.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.320]   And we don't-- we'd rather do nothing
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.800]   than do something wrong.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.640]   But what you're saying, and what others are saying,
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.040]   is that he doesn't believe that.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.360]   No, no, no.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.000]   And the New York Times today reported
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.360]   that the final report of the event
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.520]   was as much as written before the event.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.040]   Yeah, that was what Corey Doctorofe feared,
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.040]   is that by going, he would give an imprimature to an event
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.800]   that was really just a dog and pony show
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.560]   so that the document that resulted-- which, by the way,
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.160]   I think Mark Zuckerberg is delivering, right?
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:16.720]   Various.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.880]   Zuckerberg Schmidt, I think, six or seven internet executives
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.000]   are going to go with Snarko Z.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.720]   And really, they're the guys who are putting the imprimature
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.680]   on that.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.160]   Yeah, two of the things that they are,
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.480]   and there's some report coming out.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.240]   Already, the Germans have said that they don't go along.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.800]   The Americans said that they don't go along.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.560]   Sarko Z was trying-- the way Corey Doctorofe
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.920]   was this was a smokescreen on his effort
[00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.120]   to get the G8 to regulate the internet.
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.120]   Another friend of mine said to two of us who went--
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.800]   he sent an email to us, you are the lipstick on the pig,
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.800]   smooch, smooch.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.320]   That's just mean.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.680]   Well, yeah, he wasn't going.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.320]   He was a jaws.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.320]   But--
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.560]   It is true that at least President Obama, maybe other G8
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.120]   leaders, didn't want the internet on the agenda at G8
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.040]   at all.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.840]   He said there's more important things,
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.400]   but also not having it on--
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.920]   is it better not to have it on the agenda?
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.800]   That's the question, you know.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.160]   What I argued there, and my post more strongly even
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.720]   after being there, was that I don't blame Sarko Z for filling
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.840]   in the vacuum.
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.360]   The vacuum was left by us, the people of the internet.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.680]   We didn't hold this meeting.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.920]   We didn't bring this large-level discussion.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.440]   He did.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.400]   Now, the problem is the meeting occurs at Covenants Table,
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.440]   and he invited who he wanted to that table,
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.360]   and that was big executives and a lot of really big,
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.920]   old-time executives to it.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:43.720]   And very few--
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.360]   Ruford Murdoch was a designer.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.680]   Murdoch, my favorite black--
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.520]   Stocking Het's News, the internet, right?
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.080]   The head of Universal in France was just laughable.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.120]   The head of the Italian newspaper company
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.640]   was somewhat laughable.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:00.720]   And there was just-- it was jolly, old-time 1998 internet
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.920]   attitude.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:02.800]   Well, on those people.
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:10.880]   On the other hand, you had Sean Parker and Mark Zuckerberg,
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.720]   Eric Schmidt, and other people like that there.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.840]   And so it was a very strange mix.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.440]   Susan Crawford, ex-member of the ICANN board, who's one of my heroes,
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.520]   said that she knew we were lipstick on the pig.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.520]   I asked her whether she was glad we came.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:28.200]   And she said, yes.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.080]   She thinks that we at least showed them
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.480]   that there was opposition to their view.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.080]   The two heroes of the event to me were Larry Lessig and John
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:37.960]   Perry Marlow.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.320]   They were both there.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:42.200]   They were both there, and they were both on panels.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.600]   There was an intellectual property panel that
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.360]   was just unbelievable.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.840]   And I was tweeting at the moment this came on.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.240]   Because Sargis, he had talked about how this is a revolution.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.840]   And I said, well, here's the revolution.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.680]   Who the hell are the revolutionaries in the room?
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.880]   And all on the stage, what?
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.040]   John Perry Barlow.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.760]   OK, done.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.240]   There they are.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.320]   And yeah, God bless him.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.000]   God bless him.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.080]   He was just wonderful.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.040]   And he was ready to erupt like Iceland the whole time.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   He was the only guy who was defending.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.320]   He said, let's see this panel.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.920]   I think I can go to a different planet.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.600]   He talked about the Grateful Dead, giving away music,
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.320]   and how it worked for them as a business.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.600]   He was the only one up there who actually made content.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.200]   And it was pretty disgusting all around.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.120]   So John was like, I think, all his name was John Perry.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.480]   John Perry Barlow.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.920]   Barlow Barlow.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.360]   And so he was great.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.440]   And Larry Lessig did a presentation this morning.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.640]   I'm honored to say that he remade the presentation last night
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.600]   and included Douda harm in it.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:47.640]   I was the lead.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.120]   I'm on Twitter and Twig.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.920]   I've been used as a hours turn bumper.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.720]   And I've been part of a Larry Lessig keynote.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.280]   You made it.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.120]   You're done.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:55.960]   Fucking list.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.360]   Frost off.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:58.960]   Done.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.000]   No, he's got more to do.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.120]   We want more, Jeff.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.600]   Yeah, yeah, we want more.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.760]   Lessig was just great.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.920]   And the problem is, as Lessig says these days,
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.280]   they're using the wrong architecture to judge all this.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.480]   And they're still judging.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.800]   As we know about the old architecture,
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.320]   but they can't understand the new architecture.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.480]   They can't understand how to make this world work.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:22.560]   And John Perry was mocking the numbers
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.680]   that the entertainment folks came up with and said
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.240]   that even at the highest number you give me,
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.960]   that industry is not worth saving for the price of hampering
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.240]   the internet, the freedom we have.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.120]   Right.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:34.880]   Right.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:35.800]   I mean, it's small.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.160]   It's tiny.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.600]   Compared to even Google alone.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:47.920]   I guess one question is if Google and Facebook are--
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.200]   which camp are they in?
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:49.880]   I mean, are they--
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.320]   Well, it's--
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.960]   Are they going to pull the ladder up camp?
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.680]   We made it.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.920]   Now let's stop innovation cold.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.560]   Yeah, it's a problem.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.760]   Yochai Beckler from Harvard, Berkman Center.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.040]   And I respect greatly was there.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.200]   And he was all eager to buy--
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:09.480]   he told me an Android phone until the deal came along
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.800]   between Google and Verizon.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.840]   And he pulled out his iPhone out of his pocket.
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.200]   It was now the less readable.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:20.400]   And there was a lot of talk there among folks like us
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:22.760]   of the great disappointment at Google.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.480]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.920]   Beckler, by the way, his classic book, The Wealth of Networks,
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.800]   he released it for free on the internet.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.920]   Yeah, and also he has-- the audio version is--
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.000]   Mechanicized--
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.160]   Mechanicized voiced--
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:37.720]   Mechanicized?
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.060]   No.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:38.560]   Mechanic.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.560]   what a boy.
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.560]   Yeah, computer voice, yeah.
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:45.320]   Uh, and the latte, listen, I've tried listening to that book, which is about 900 pages, and
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.560]   that voice is really challenge.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.100]   You know, I'll read it.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.100]   Uh, yokey.
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.340]   Ah, I'll read it.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.360]   Yeah, cat LEO.
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   I'll record it.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.360]   I'd love to record it.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.240]   I'll have the domain ofversion if, if anybody wanted to.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.240]   I'd love to do it.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.240]   I'll be glad to do that.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.240]   You're going to have my voice.
[00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.240]   Should be.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.240]   It's a great book.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.080]   It is a great book.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:08.000]   Uh, the only problem with it is, uh, you know, even after a couple of years, everything
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   has changed.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   Yo guys.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Yo guys.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Brilliant.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   He's brilliant.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   There was a press conference today that, uh, Susan Crawford and Yochai and then, pardon me,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.760]   literally, and they had a report of that borders, uh, which I would say in French, but my French
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   was bad.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:29.360]   Um, all held with a guy who did, uh, try to bring in the civil society.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:31.680]   So we tried to get, you know, a voice in opposition going there.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.200]   Listen, it was fine for them to have a discussion.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.400]   Uh, obviously, I'm not going to last person to say someone should have a discussion, but
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.280]   I, and again, I criticize us in the internet more than I do.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:46.080]   Sarcozy and Populis, uh, that, uh, you know, they held the meeting.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.080]   We didn't.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.080]   Right.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.640]   Well, you know, what's great is, uh, as the G8 is a, is a, uh, incredible spur to protest.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:58.080]   This E G8 was a spur to a quite an active internet protest around it.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.080]   There's a web page.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.280]   There's a lot of people talking about it.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.000]   Um, so in some ways credit to.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.280]   Uh, to a publicist group and, uh, Sarcozy for starting the conversation.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.280]   I agree.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.600]   Um, we can't be really surprised by what came out of it.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.400]   What, what, what, what did that white paper say?
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.360]   Uh, frankly, I was, I was talking to people outside.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:22.120]   They had, uh, bullet points kind of tweet length points from all the sessions.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.800]   There were complaints about other points didn't mean anything.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.640]   Uh, that's kind of inevitable.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.800]   You know, they showed us, I was on a panel about data and privacy.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.120]   And, uh, you know, so it becomes namby pambby.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.120]   What's to be expected?
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.840]   You try to summarize an hour, uh, in four points.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:46.480]   I, I think what he's saying is that it is time to, in his view to, uh, regulate the
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.040]   internet and to bring some safety to it.
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.920]   And a lot of us were saying, no, it's too soon.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.080]   You don't know what it is yet.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.800]   And it's a fairly obvious disagreement there.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.000]   I think that inlet resistance he'll have put it on the agenda.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.600]   And that's pretty much what he must do.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.840]   And, and Corey doctor is right.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.760]   We were a smoke screen for it where we used.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.080]   Yeah, we absolutely were.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:08.160]   Um, and full disclosure is I got travel accommodations, uh, to come to this.
[00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.480]   So I was, you know, I didn't even pay the company, but I got that.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:17.360]   No, and I'm glad you had it because it's very, I, it was very expensive to do it.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.120]   Uh, why would notice?
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.880]   They didn't give us a lot of notice.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.680]   I had a pizza and beard night for a 50 euro.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.480]   Welcome to, welcome to Paris.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.280]   But I'm so Jeff on behalf of all of us.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.760]   Uh, no, no, no, we're so glad you're grateful that you were generous enough to, uh, let
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:39.360]   me come to the party and, um, uh, I'm sorry I missed the mesh conference in Toronto, which
[00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.360]   I was supposed to be at.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.360]   Right.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.440]   But I think this was probably important to do and to see what was going on.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.200]   And those of us who were rallying were there, I still said it was important to be there.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.520]   So I think it was a, a good move.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.880]   And I thank you for being generous enough to open me into the party.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.680]   It wasn't up to me, but I'm glad Loey Klamour heard us talking about it on Twig.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.640]   And it was he, uh, who got me in.
[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.400]   And of course he was there and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, you too now.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.920]   And I bet you get an invitation at low web in December.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.760]   So you get some.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.080]   I'm not sure I'll be back at this one.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.360]   Uh, the, uh, do no harm meme, I'm grateful to say continue throughout the meeting, uh,
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.880]   when living in Zuckerberg at the end, he brought it up again.
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.520]   And so, uh, so we shall see.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.720]   So it's good for you, Jeff.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.760]   That was the whole, that was, that was what you were charged with and you did a great
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.800]   job mission accomplished.
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.520]   Now, if you think it, if an, if an event like this was organized by the people, Jeff, who
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.800]   do you think should do it?
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.880]   The F F.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:43.880]   Is he frozen or is he thinking?
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.880]   I couldn't hear you.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.880]   Wow.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.880]   He blinked.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.160]   I was trying to be cool.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.480]   And it, it, it, it, it broke up.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:58.200]   She was, she was just saying if, if there were an event like this, uh, with, uh, all
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.840]   the players on the internet, who should organize this?
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.840]   The E F F.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.840]   That's a good question.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.320]   I think it could be many parties.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.480]   It could be the E F F. It could be Berkman Center.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.240]   It could be Mozilla Foundation.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.640]   Mitchell Baker was here.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.000]   Oh, just a little, I'm having a little, you know, they're, they're, they're, they're
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.560]   implementing do not track and they're kind of in the, in the play there.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.440]   Um, it could be a bunch of universities.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:26.720]   Um, I don't know who else, but I think it could be a lot of different parties could
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.280]   do this, uh, South by Southwest.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.480]   I think the E F F and I think a number of those parties would be seen as partisan.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.320]   I think that a university, I like the Berkman idea.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.120]   I think the university is more appropriate than the E F F. E F had to be at the table,
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.120]   of course.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.560]   Uh, and, and you can't do it with that John Perry Barlow.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.680]   Well, I think, you know, it's, it's great.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.000]   I'm really sorry I couldn't be there for those who were wondering, I had a family emergency,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.640]   wasn't able to make it, but, uh, I'm so glad that Jeff was there and I, uh, obviously didn't
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.640]   need to be there at all.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.640]   You did a great job.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:59.960]   Boy, you know, you, you, you set the, uh, table really for that, do no harm conversation.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:03.880]   The other highlight we would miss was, was we were right next to the Louvre that we had
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.120]   the dinner party last night in the Louvre.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.560]   And, uh, that's pretty cool.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.520]   I don't imagine that happens too often.
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.920]   That was cool.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.920]   And, uh, Joe Shorndorf and his cell brought the wine.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.640]   And, uh, one bottle was a, one was supposed to have two, that two red wine.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:19.640]   Wow.
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:24.960]   And then they had some tour guides and so we got to go and see a little bit of the Louvre.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.040]   So, you know, he stood up close to the Model 8, so which was cool.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.040]   That's great.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.440]   That makes it a little worthwhile.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.680]   You coming home tonight or tomorrow?
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.680]   When are you coming home?
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.680]   One morning, one morning first thing, flying in.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:35.680]   All right.
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.680]   Well, we're so glad.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.680]   Help me.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:38.680]   There's no ash this time.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.680]   Darn, Val, came along.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.680]   This is funny.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.680]   The same thing happened again this year.
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.680]   That happened to you last year.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.640]   Well, MG Seagler who writes for TechCrunch was stuck in Iceland itself.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.560]   He was there for a bachelor party.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.560]   And I don't know.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.560]   I think he had misdisserrupt in New York because of it.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.560]   Did he make it to disrupt?
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.200]   I don't think he's there now.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.200]   Sarah says he's.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.360]   Yeah, I was going to strip him for.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:07.040]   Mad Cuts says that Delio, you're the president of the internet and I haven't spoken to him.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.240]   I think I am now a completely president emeritus and I'm handing, I'm handing the crowd and
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.240]   answer over to you.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.240]   I will not.
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:15.240]   I will not accept.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.240]   VP VP.
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.120]   If nominated, I will not run.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.080]   If elected, I will not.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.080]   Be on my lead.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.080]   Actually, this is a day.
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.080]   I do want to mark this.
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.080]   I don't know how historic it is, but this is the day that John F. Kennedy announced before
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:36.480]   a joint session of Congress on May 25, 1961, that for this decade is out, the US will put
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:41.680]   a man on the moon and he did do it.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.760]   But it's been very interesting.
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:54.320]   We live in such a great age of information to go back and look at the tapes.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:02.040]   The White House tapes have been released in the past by the Miller Center, WhiteHouseTapes.net
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:07.080]   and they've released some new tapes that showed that Kennedy was chiefly interested, what
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.040]   a surprise, and the PR impact of the moon launch.
[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.120]   In fact, he says we've spent half the expenditures.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.120]   We've wrecked the budget and all these other domestic products and the only justification
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.080]   for it, in my opinion, to do it in the Pelmel fashion is because we hope to beat them, the
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.040]   Soviets, and demonstrate that starting it behind them, as we did by a couple of years,
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.720]   by God, we passed them.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:36.840]   I think it would be a hell of a thing for us.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.840]   If you haven't gone to this, I had never heard of this site, the University of Virginia's
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:47.680]   Miller Center for Public Affairs, they have all of these Kennedy tapes and it's fascinating
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.600]   to hear what really goes on in the Oval Office.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.960]   Yeah, he admitted that he worried that it was just a stunt.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.000]   It's good to know and even JFK has doubts.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Well, there's the proof they didn't really go.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   It was just a stunt.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.200]   That'll feed the conspirators.
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.200]   They've got Roosevelt here.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.360]   They've got all sorts of incredible stuff.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:16.480]   I just, even the Cuban Missile Crisis stuff is in here.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.480]   So if you haven't, I didn't know about it.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.560]   I can't wait now to spend a lot of time here.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.400]   It's all the audio is actually surprisingly good.
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.040]   What means the audio?
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.040]   We have Uleo.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.760]   I could just talk like this.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:36.400]   Actually, all I'm doing is an impression of the guy in the Simpsons.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.160]   And the mayor, is it the mayor on the Simpsons?
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.040]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.960]   And so he sounds just like Kennedy, so it's close enough.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.120]   But yeah, anyway, it was 1961.
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:55.240]   It was 50 years ago today that we made the decision to go to the moon and whether you
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.080]   agree that it was a stunt or not, and I think it probably was kind of a stunt.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.400]   It was one hell of a stunt.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.400]   It sure was.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.880]   What an element, inspiring stunt.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.880]   Jeff and I.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.360]   One hell of a PR move, that's for sure.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.280]   Jeff and I are old enough to remember it and how inspiring it was and how exciting it was.
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.720]   And I think that the long lasting benefits, there's no doubt that the science that this
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:21.960]   country, the number of scientists alone that it spawned were valuable.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:30.200]   Let's see, Facebook revolution comes to the French presidency.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.960]   So Mark Zuckerberg was meeting with Sarkozy.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.960]   It's so funny.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:41.080]   Zuckerberg has now met with Obama and Sarkozy in the same week.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.080]   He's 20.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.080]   What is he?
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.080]   27.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.200]   And he's taking you seriously because he has a suit on.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.200]   Oh, yes.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.600]   He's wearing actually, well, his tie is loosened, which I think kind of gives it that rakish
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.560]   sporty school boy look.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.160]   He doesn't he look like a private school?
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:59.600]   He looks like he's going to Groton.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.480]   Which he, I think he did go to Groton, didn't he?
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.440]   Or no, was it X or it was X or?
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.200]   Phillips, X or.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.600]   He appeared then at the EGA after this.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.600]   Right.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.600]   And by that he had changed into a into the T-shirt and James.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.600]   Good.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:21.280]   They said on the invitation that we were to wear business casual during the meetings,
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.880]   the smart casuals of the dinner.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.480]   And I put on Twitter yesterday, what the heck is the difference?
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.480]   Somebody said $100.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.200]   From today Zuckerberg defined smart casual.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.200]   It's a T-shirt and jeans.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.760]   T-shirt and jeans on stage.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.720]   I'll say it.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.800]   He said when asked about meeting with Sarkozy, he said it was fun.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.400]   I understand where he's coming from.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.560]   I appreciate the chance to be here and be part of the dialogue.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.040]   He's learning to be a politician too.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.000]   Oh, he's yeah, we're always here.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.840]   You know, it saddened me because Zuckerberg, when I saw him at Muckney Muck meetings in
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.120]   years past, he was always direct.
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.640]   It's how he got the reputation of being an aspiratory, though he's not.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.640]   But he would say we had to say and then look at you.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.440]   And now he has the cool lines and he knows how to do that.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.120]   But there's still Zuckerberg moments.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.120]   He's talking today.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.000]   And at one point he said, he got distracted.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.840]   And he said, oh, it's a bug on me.
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.080]   And Marisle, Denise has something to do about it.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.080]   Oh, no, it's normal.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.080]   I had a bug on me.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.080]   Sorry.
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.080]   They lost his place entirely.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.920]   You couldn't do it.
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:33.080]   I actually appreciate him like that.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.240]   I do too.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:38.480]   I'm not sure I appreciate Mark playing politics, though.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.680]   Here's an opportunity to really fight the fight.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   I don't know.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.400]   When you go and when you walk in the court as your power, even though he obviously has
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.480]   a lot of power and clout, it's intimidating.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:29:02.360]   Access now, which has been really vociferous in its opposition to the EGA today, said
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.200]   in a statement, "President Sarkozy's disastrous design for the internet has become glaringly
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.360]   apparent.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:13.480]   The world's most developed economies are poised to impose strict copyright enforcement and
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:18.400]   heavy-handed government regulation of the internet."
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:24.960]   It's based on leaked drafts of the G8 final declaration.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:31.760]   Rupert Murdoch called for the G8 to protect intellectual property.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.400]   We hope the G8-- how does he tie his Australian?
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.560]   We hope the G8 was strongly a fan that property rights of artists and creators are more than
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.440]   just a matter of protecting cultures.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:42.440]   Right.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:48.280]   In this new century, there are essential requirements for a dynamic economy and the digital future
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.280]   - Essential requirements.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.280]   Well, okay.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.280]   I'm a play devil's advocate.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.720]   Doesn't he make a point?
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:00.000]   Even if you're an old school content creator or somebody who's created some very expensive
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.600]   content, you are scared of putting it out on the internet.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:08.960]   Look at Google and Netflix.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.960]   Or actually, it's not Netflix.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:17.200]   Google and their movie rental system, it doesn't work if you root your phone because
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.040]   they can't then apparently guarantee you're not pirating the movie.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.960]   So Google says, "Well, all right, it will check.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.960]   Are you rooted?
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.960]   Yeah, you're rooted.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.840]   Okay, well, you can't rent movies from us."
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.880]   Doesn't that protect-- I mean, isn't that necessary?
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:37.080]   Doesn't Google have to do that to get paramount and Sony and everybody to put their movies
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.000]   on the Google system?
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.800]   Isn't Murdoch saying, "Yes, these are essential requirements.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.840]   We're not going to do it unless we know we're not going to get ripped off."
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:54.600]   I really liked what Barlow had to say about this, that these rules-- I mean, Google does
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.100]   that because the company said that--
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.100]   They have no choice.
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.100]   They have no choice.
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.100]   Right, they have no choice.
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.600]   It's that or we can't offer it.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:08.800]   Right, ours wrote up Barlow's take on this and I'm trying to find a good quote.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.040]   I may be one of the very few people in this room who actually makes his living personally
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:15.520]   by creating what these gentlemen are pleased to call intellectual property.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.880]   I don't regard my expression as a form of property.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.480]   Property is something which can be taken from me.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.400]   If I don't have it, someone else does.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.720]   Expression is not like that.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.160]   The notion that expression is like that is entirely a consequence of taking a system
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:33.320]   of expression and transporting it around, which was necessary before there was the internet,
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:37.080]   which has the capacity to do this infinitely at almost no cost.
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.480]   But, okay, again, I'm going to stay devil's advocate and I'm going to--
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   Go ahead.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.120]   We should get John Perry, but we've had him on the triangulation, but we should come on
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.640]   this show to talk about these things specifically.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:52.080]   I know he'd be-- I'm sure glad to do it because he's very accessible.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.040]   But to me, that's kind of a misdirection.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:02.920]   We're not talking about the fact that you can make a copy of-- this is a physical thing
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.600]   and intellectual property nowadays is no longer physical.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:11.600]   There's still the issue of if you kind of copy this willy-nilly or allowed to be copied
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:17.320]   willy-nilly at no cost, how do you make money on it?
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.760]   And so it's not the issue of, yes, these new technologies allow us to make infinite
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.360]   perfect copies of your ideas and disseminate them worldwide.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.720]   Nobody's-- that's great.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.360]   But then how do you make a living?
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.080]   Yeah, well, a few things.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.440]   One is that John argued that from music and tells the story of the Grateful Dead where
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.880]   they gave away the music, they made a fortune, they made more money that way.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:42.760]   The same time he did say that the movie makers, yeah, I understand what you make costs a great
[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:46.240]   deal of money to make at that level.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.640]   And that's different.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.600]   And he got that.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:54.640]   The other interesting thing to me was that Zuckerberg today when he was talking said that
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:33:03.200]   he pointed to the success of Zinga and game platforms on top of Facebook.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:09.800]   And he said that Zinga now has a higher market cap than-- oh, once the other big market
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.520]   game company like Tronic Arts.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.520]   Thank you.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.920]   And Zuckerberg argued that it was because they understood both the games and people.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.080]   They made it social.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.880]   And he argued that that was next to them to come to media.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:26.000]   The next person who's successful in music will be the person who figures out how to
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.480]   combine knowledge of people in music.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.480]   Well, yeah.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.480]   I'm just going to say.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.800]   So who's doing it?
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.800]   Right.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:38.000]   So same with movies or TV or I would argue news as well.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   I don't think all media--
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.360]   I don't think movies-- let's use movies.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:43.840]   Movies don't lend themselves to that.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.800]   Well, novels do--
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.800]   No.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.960]   All you're talking about in the case of a movie or a novel is a superior marketing campaign.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.600]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.600]   You're absolutely right.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.480]   Well, but there could be an involvement in the whole process of making it or a sense
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   that you're involved or a belief that you're involved.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.480]   Well, that's better marketing.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:08.440]   I mean, I guess you could say, well, we've got what we've got to communicate to our kids
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.480]   is that if they like content, they're going to have to keep paying for it or it won't
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.480]   happen.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.480]   Is that right?
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.480]   Yes.
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:16.480]   But the argument is--
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:17.480]   No.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.480]   --to.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:24.400]   I'm not sure that we necessarily have to argue in all cases that it's the content itself
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.720]   that holds the value.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:30.760]   Sometimes the relationship, the knowledge of that relationship, the data around that
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.680]   relationship may hold more value than the content.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.040]   Well, that's for sure true of everything I do.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.800]   It's not about the content.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.800]   Exactly.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:42.360]   Though your content is beautiful except for what I want.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:47.120]   And we have good content, but the good content in and of itself, our content is no better
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.120]   or different.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.720]   It may be worse in some ways than say, ours, technical.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.560]   There's a content rich environment.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.760]   What we do that's different is it's social.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.760]   Right.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:03.520]   And I was talking to an executive former head of news, a TV network who has a new gig right
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.520]   now.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.920]   And he was trying to argue with the content is valuable.
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.800]   And so I said, well, he was arguing that Zuckerberg devalues content.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:11.800]   It doesn't value him.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   It doesn't care about it.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.720]   And I said, no, actually, it's the opposite.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:21.240]   I think Zuckerberg cares more about content in more ways because he sees value in it in
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.080]   more places.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.720]   I'm pixelating like mad.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.720]   No, that's OK.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.720]   You look good here.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.320]   I don't know how we sounded you, but you sound great.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.320]   OK.
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:36.560]   And so what I said was that he doesn't narrow the definition of content to a little bit.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:40.040]   He sees the content we all create has value.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:45.960]   And then the executive said, well, but content is the steel that makes schools, cars and
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.960]   so on and so forth.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.680]   And I said, well, yeah, but not necessarily.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.360]   That assumes that the content again has all the value.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.800]   Zuckerberg sees the value in the relationships, Google sees the value in the data and the
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.800]   signals.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.720]   I just think it's not all one thing.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.720]   There's different kinds of content.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.520]   Gina, you've read it.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.720]   Gina, you've seen the product about it.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.720]   Gina, go ahead.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.720]   Finish your thought, Jeff.
[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.800]   And I'm going to let the young person speak.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:15.800]   Go for it.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.320]   It's a common it's a combination of all these things.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:21.120]   I'm not going to read a book unless I get a recommendation or I hear a reference.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.040]   And it's all I mean, it's a combination of the socials, a combination of the data.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.040]   It's a combination of the data.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.040]   It's a combination of the data.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   It's a combination of the data.

[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.360]   All these big, old, monopolistic businesses are trying to be able to bring in the same
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.360]   revenue they used to.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:41.360]   Right.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.360]   This is the thing.
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.000]   Not everyone's going to be Gaga.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.720]   A lot of people are going to be Jonathan Colton, but they don't want—labels don't want those
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.720]   musicians.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:50.720]   They want the gagas, right?
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:51.720]   Because they're an easy money.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:55.160]   Well, and John, the way Jonathan Colton is very happy being Jonathan Colton.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.640]   As he should be, he's awesome.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:57.640]   And he's done great.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.600]   I mean, he's not making Gaga money, but he's making a good living.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.880]   Anyway, that is expectation.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:07.080]   I think some artists coming up a few years ago might have said, "How can I become a
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.080]   platinum artist?"
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:12.160]   I don't think they're going to be platinum artists.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.280]   So maybe there's a smaller number of people making obscene amounts of money, but a much
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.960]   larger group of people who can make a living doing this.
[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:25.000]   Choice inevitably brings the end of the blockbuster economy.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   Right.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.960]   Once we are fragmented and to use the word that the big media like to use, or once we
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:36.760]   have a choice the way that I would like to see it, then the blockbuster is still possible.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.480]   But the risk is much higher.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.520]   The cost of getting there much higher.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:48.600]   I'm the last person to moan because Transformers 4 won't be made, but there is a market for
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.880]   blockbusters, and they do cost a lot of money, and you'd have to have investors.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.880]   I mean, it takes hundreds of people to make.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.480]   Are we going to still see those?
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:59.080]   Well, you know, you know, opera is expensive.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.680]   Yeah, we still see opera.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.320]   We do and we don't.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.560]   We see a lot less than we used to in the world to survive.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:08.480]   You know, it's self-janes.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:12.240]   Is Transformers La Traviata of the 21st century?
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.520]   New York City Opera is leaving Lincoln Center because it can't afford to be there.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.520]   You're kidding.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.520]   Oh, that makes me sad.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.960]   Not that I've been to an opera in the last 15 years.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.960]   Right.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.200]   It's more of a sentimental thing.
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.800]   I mean, Leo, you're an artist making your art, making a living at it because of the internet.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:34.240]   Yeah, and I, of course, knew from day one that I could not charge for what we do, that
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.840]   we would have to give it away, and that if we were going to make a living doing it and
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:43.200]   grow, that we would have to find a way to give it away and make money.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.920]   We have found a way to do that.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.920]   Right.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:50.400]   And you also, you know, you keep saying that if the network came to you tomorrow, you'd
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.400]   say no thanks.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.400]   Right.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:58.320]   It comes from a background in free advertising based, so I understand that medium and that's
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.840]   a natural medium, but not everything lends itself to that.
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.840]   True.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:03.840]   No, absolutely.
[00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.840]   Right.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.680]   Music is not it's pretty much a popular sponsored music.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.680]   Right.
[00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:10.800]   But God, you know, the marketing piece is important.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:15.560]   God God's audience distributes her, promotes her, sells her, makes her bigger than she
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:16.560]   would be.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:21.240]   You know, I found her chatterer at the HBO thing unbearable.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   I thought God bless her.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.760]   Little monsters loved it.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.280]   You know, it's funny because I had a conversation with a chat room over the weekend in which
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:32.880]   I was saying, Oh, if Gaga truly engaged with her audience over Twitter, then I would be
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.880]   impressed.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:34.880]   And they said, well, read her Twitter.
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:35.880]   And in fact, she does.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.880]   She does.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:42.480]   Or some, well, and I don't know if it's hers or Paris Hilton, but somebody is, you know,
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.080]   and it's very engaged.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.080]   And that blew me away.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.600]   I thought, Oh, okay.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:50.640]   She's not because I watched the chroma and I said, well, there's no real engagement.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:55.320]   She's saying, I'm so impressed by our little monsters, but that was not a good sampling
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.000]   when I went back and actually looked at her Twitter.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.360]   She was very engaged with her audience in a way that is kind of amazing.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:07.160]   Yeah, it was interesting that commercial, the text box she was typing into to put out
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.960]   status updates to her fans was definitely not Twitter, but that's what she uses.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.360]   I mean, Twitter has been a huge platform for her.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.240]   10 million little monster followers.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.440]   Yep.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:21.240]   It's interesting because Gaga is, of course, polarizing.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.960]   Since we talked about people saying, I hate lady Gaga.
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.760]   I know everyone's getting a bag of beetles.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.760]   Yep.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.760]   The Beatles did not did the Beatles polarize?
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.760]   Maybe they did.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.240]   I guess, you know, the older generation didn't like him so much.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.640]   Oh, it's true.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:38.320]   Well, when they started off, they were bubble gum.
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.240]   I mean, they were there were the right.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.000]   They be able to their day.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   All right.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.240]   I guess we're going to have to watch the ad.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   Yes.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:51.720]   I just want to make you a little jealous, Gina.
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:56.960]   Eileen is going to the Glee concert tonight in San Francisco.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:57.960]   Live Glee.
[00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:58.960]   Oh, Eileen.
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:04.640]   I bet she stopped at your portal on the way.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.240]   I heard it when you're there, Eileen.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.040]   She said she will.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.040]   Just watch your Twitter stream.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:14.600]   It won't be like being there, but it'll be close.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:17.120]   Here is where did this add?
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.120]   Air first.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.720]   I saw it on 3 Saturday Live.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.720]   That's right.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.720]   Because she was on Saturday Live.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.440]   And of course, let's not forget, this is all a marketing campaign.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.120]   Yeah, this is a commercial people.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.120]   Yes.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:33.880]   For Gaga's new album, which came out the next day.
[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:37.400]   I'm sure it'll start any minute now.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.360]   I don't know why my YouTube is so.
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.720]   Here we go.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:50.080]   She's running on the Brooklyn Bridge in short shorts.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.080]   That's my girl on my bridge.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:56.800]   And then what's great is she pulls up all these YouTube videos of things.
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:57.800]   Singing.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:58.800]   Lip syncing.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.800]   There she is typing.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.800]   You're right.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.800]   I don't know what it is.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.800]   That's the Twitter clone.
[00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:19.560]   I guess Google didn't want to show the Twitter clone, nor did they want to show Buzz.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:20.960]   I don't think Gaga buzzes.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.480]   There's a Google image search.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:37.120]   I guess it's really more visual because if you're listening, you're not really seeing
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.120]   what's going on.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:41.120]   Lots of, yeah, this is dancing.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.960]   Lots of, lots of headband.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:49.040]   This is our moment, this is Gaga.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.640]   She obviously uses prom.
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:51.640]   Oh yeah.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.520]   Lady Gaga uses prom.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:47:01.560]   The Google Gaga Nexus is fascinating.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.960]   It is.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.960]   Is it Marissa?
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:09.120]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.040]   She's a fan, right?
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:12.720]   Yeah, she definitely is a fan.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.880]   Well, you know, there's the fashion thing, right?
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.880]   There's that connection.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:20.480]   And she interviewed Gaga and she giggled like, I've never seen Marissa so sort of kind of
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.160]   real and, you know, coming apart at the seams.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.320]   Just so excited to see Gaga's as that interview.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:30.120]   So I wouldn't be surprised if the sea Marissa remade by Gaga.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:33.160]   Oh, Marissa and the meat dress.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:37.000]   One of those like wild hair pieces and some bad eye makeup.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.680]   I would love to see that.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.680]   That would be awesome.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.680]   Marissa, let's make that happen.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.360]   I'm going to take a break.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.200]   You're listening to this week in Google watching it too.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.280]   I hope you can do both.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:50.920]   We are live, of course, every Wednesday at 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.120]   2000A UTC at live.twit.tv.
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:56.360]   Gina Tarpani from smarter word.org.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:59.000]   Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.480]   And more to come in just a moment.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:06.480]   But I do want to mention our friends at Squarespace who make the most elegant, the most beautiful,
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:14.200]   the most sophisticated web software for websites ever.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:15.440]   They do the hosting too.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.920]   I think that that's really what makes it such a great system because you're getting hosting
[00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:25.840]   from Squarespace as well as software that's tuned to work with that hosting.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:29.120]   And there's some nice features they get, for instance, the virtual server technology allows
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:34.360]   them to pour on the bandwidth when you need it.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.360]   Great software too.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.480]   I mean, the software is, and people, I think, think of it as blogging software, really,
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.840]   it's just for any kind of website.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:45.200]   All you have to do is go to the examples right at the top of the page, squarespace.com/twig.
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:51.400]   And you'll see there are blogs, of course, but there's businesses, design and art, e-commerce,
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.000]   food and drink, health and wellness.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.080]   These are all sites, media and publishing in the use squarespace in these fields.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.960]   Bob Woodruff's site.
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.560]   Triune film.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:10.880]   There's our inside, Twitsite, Kevin Pollock, Dane Cook, our own Brian Brushwood, the totally
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.880]   ratchet.
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:15.120]   These are all sites in, and this is the beauty of squarespace.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:19.400]   They can handle the kind of traffic a Dane Cook's going to generate.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:20.640]   And each site looks unique.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.160]   You couldn't say, "Oh, I recognize that design."
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.160]   No.
[00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:25.160]   Each site is unique.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.800]   Your site too.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.800]   Squarespace is it.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.360]   It's a secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.920]   I want you to go to squarespace.com/twig.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.240]   Click that green button, try it free, and set up a site.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.000]   Maybe you've already got a site.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.240]   If so, you can import all the content from the site using the traditional APIs, movable
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.520]   type word press type, or blogger.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.960]   And when they do that, they do everything.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.680]   The links work, the URLs still work.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:52.560]   Everything works, which is really nice, and export too, so you're never trapped.
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.680]   I do like that.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.880]   And get that site going.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:59.280]   And take a look at what it looks like with the new squarespace software behind it.
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:02.640]   If you have a friend, a family member, a favorite business that doesn't have a site, the next
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:07.600]   time I go into the hair salon, I'm going to say, "Can I set up a site for you?"
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.920]   Because you need a site.
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.760]   If you don't have a site, you don't exist on the internet.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.320]   Squarespace.com/twig.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:16.640]   You can set that site up absolutely free, no credit card or anything.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:21.560]   So transferring it is as simple as giving them the URL and the password, and it's theirs.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.920]   They can take it over, make it theirs.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.720]   It's kind of a nice little gift.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.920]   Give grandma her own website.
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.120]   Couldn't be simpler.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.280]   Squarespace.com/twig.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.280]   Give it a try.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:40.360]   I'm a big believer in everybody getting on the net, speaking their mind, letting people
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.760]   hear what you have to say.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:47.000]   And boy, if you don't take advantage of these incredible technologies to do that right now,
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.880]   you're missing the opportunity of not just the lifetime of the century.
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.840]   It's the ultimate platform.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.760]   It really is amazing.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:03.960]   I mean, that's what ultimately we talk about all these issues, but it's hard not to just
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:06.800]   say it's going to all work out.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   Do you think, Jeff, having sat at that table that you feel like these guys could in the
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.720]   long run be damaging?
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.720]   Or is it just a short run blip?
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:25.160]   I really think that the urge to regulate the urge to slow down the progress.
[00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.440]   Eric Schmidt talks about how the money and the resource goes to the legacy companies,
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.120]   not to the disruptors.
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.160]   The internet is profoundly disrupting the government as well.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:39.200]   Vivian Redding from the EU talks about four pillars that she wants in regulation, which
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:47.760]   includes the right to erase, which we've talked about, and default privacy, which would have
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:52.440]   meant if that existed, then Flickr never could have happened.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.360]   I think there can be a do not track.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.360]   There was discussion about that.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:59.480]   Mitchell Baker, who's brilliant from Mozilla, was there, and they're going to implement
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:05.520]   do not track, they basically started on Mozilla, but if they decided to make that default,
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:08.880]   I think that could be very damaging to media as we talked about.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.080]   So yes, damage can be done.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:17.200]   At one point in the meeting, I got through the press conference that we rebels had.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:21.480]   I just turned to my colleagues there on the stage and I said, "What do we do?
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:26.200]   I don't know what we really do, and we can talk and we can change the agenda."
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.640]   We do that like that, but I don't know if that's enough.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:30.840]   I'm not sure what we do.
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:36.920]   So I accumulate scared of the people who are scared of the internet.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:40.240]   You know, I think they could do damage.
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.400]   There's no question about that, but I also feel like the internet is like, it's like water.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.400]   It's happened.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.960]   I don't know how long you can fight it.
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.520]   There's no way you can really, truly regulate it.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.200]   I'm the eternal optimist in the group.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.200]   Me too.
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:56.160]   I kind of feel like there's no way, no matter what they put into place.
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:58.760]   This is an unstoppable force.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.960]   I hesitate to say that because I don't want to discourage people from fighting.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:02.960]   Right.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.960]   True.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.960]   Okay.
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:05.960]   I'll take it back then.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:06.960]   Fight.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.960]   No, you need to fight.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:14.600]   But it's not going to happen just passively, but I think we will fight and I think we will
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:19.240]   win, but it's not going to happen if we just go, "Yeah, whatever, internet, it's permanent,
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.320]   it'll be there forever."
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.320]   It's not.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:25.040]   Yeah, well, there's Ms. Hackaround talking.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.760]   You can hack around a lot of this.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:32.760]   Well, but in the UK, there's a new rule coming out now that says that basically the entire
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:38.320]   internet turns into COPA, and if you keep information on anyone, you're going to have
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:40.520]   to get written or faxed per making.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:41.680]   Yeah, but you know what?
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:47.040]   If they do that and then all of a sudden the UK is falling behind as development occurs
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:51.160]   in other places, then how long is that law last?
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.320]   Well, it depends on the regime.
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.640]   The point is, in some regimes, it doesn't matter.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.840]   In China, they would just soon fall behind in certain ways because they'd rather have
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:53:59.840]   control.
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:00.840]   Yeah, yes and no.
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.600]   I mean, Egypt turned off the internet, but how long?
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:09.040]   And I think that it would become so quickly apparent that by doing so, you're hobbling
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.160]   your future.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:15.600]   That was the main message to me that Sarkozy needed to hear.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.200]   Let's not worry about today's stakeholders.
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.200]   Let's think about tomorrow.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.960]   Yeah, one of Larry Lesch's great lines, and he had many of them, but he said that
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:26.000]   the future of the internet is not here.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.440]   They didn't know how to get invited.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.440]   Right.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.440]   So the future of the internet is not Google, it's not Facebook.
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:31.440]   Right.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:32.440]   Some kid, we don't know yet.
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:35.160]   I tried to get my daughter in.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.840]   She's the future of the internet.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.240]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.160]   Jake is the future of the internet.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:45.560]   Oh God, nobody's going to do that.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.920]   And there are children being born today that are the future of the internet.
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:54.840]   And it's really for them that it's important that we keep this open as possible.
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:55:01.400]   Google made a big statement about NFC, according to the chief of commerce at Google speaking
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:02.480]   at Disrupt.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:06.000]   NFC is a big bet for Google.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.600]   Right now, which Google phones, Android phone support NFC?
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:09.600]   Is it only the next assess?
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.600]   I think so, yeah.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.600]   Except for so far, yeah.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.120]   Yeah, I'm sure there'll be more.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:18.080]   There's rumors that Apple too wants to be in this near field communications.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:23.720]   The idea that you can wave your phone in front of a soda machine and it'll pop a soda out
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:27.560]   or in front of a Starbucks cash register and you'll get coffee.
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.360]   In fact, Starbucks was one of the places that was being tested in Europe.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.360]   Oh, really?
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:37.640]   I used the Starbucks app, which is just a scan of a barcode.
[00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:38.640]   Right.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.640]   It should have NFC.
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:40.640]   It's wonderful.
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:44.200]   They said there was a successful trial at Starbucks in London.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.920]   Yeah, I mean, there's definitely something magical about being able to pay the device.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:53.000]   I mean, even just using Square, which is swiping your old credit card, you know, is kind of
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   cool.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   Square is disruptive.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   Square is really disruptive.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.600]   Just look at Verifone's getting upset about it.
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:58.600]   It's very disruptive.
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:55:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:03.120]   But Verifone made a good point and I have the same point about NFC.
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:04.120]   What about security?
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.120]   All right.
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.120]   Right.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:07.120]   This is the question.
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:15.000]   It was Stephanie Telenius, VP of Google Commerce and Payments, who said we're making a
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.760]   big bet on NFC as a company.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:22.120]   There's a lot of potential there.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:27.720]   They wouldn't confirm any partnerships, particularly a partnership with Citibank, but that's what
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:31.680]   they're going to have to do, right, is have a big financial player get behind it.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.680]   What's in there?
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.680]   A lot of hardware to be installed.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:41.120]   I mean, you know, every vending machine, every parking lot, pretty store register.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:43.520]   That's a lot.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:50.320]   If it increases sales and increases profits, which I'm sure it would.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:54.160]   This Wall Street Journal article says that they're going to make an announcement tomorrow,
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:57:00.080]   which will involve a couple of retailers, American Eagle, Subway, Macy's, will have
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:01.720]   the ability to accept payments.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.520]   If this is true, this is how it's going to happen.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.120]   That's kind of funny, though, because how are you going to do it?
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:07.720]   Maybe they'll give you a little card with something in it.
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:08.720]   Right.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.720]   Right.
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:11.280]   Does it have a passive chip?
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:13.280]   Is it just like an RFID?
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.280]   It just sits there?
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.360]   Doesn't need power, does it?
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.360]   I think so.
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:21.120]   I'm not sure I had my first NFC experience at Google I/O thanks to Eileen, who lent me
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:22.120]   her Nexus S.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:23.120]   Yes.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:26.160]   It's a write my NFC tags.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:31.920]   A Googler who shall not be named lent me an XSS.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:34.640]   Oh, and said, "Oh, you're going to do NFC development?"
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.800]   That's not that question.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.800]   Interesting.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.800]   Yes, very interesting.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:43.400]   Well, they consider the added value that comes out of it.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:47.400]   Again, my argument is that they're looking for signals, so Google will know more about
[00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:53.160]   what you buy, where you buy it, and can offer great deals.
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:55.480]   Use your NFC and get 3% off.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:59.760]   Use your NFC and get an extra good cream.
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:04.800]   Well, an interesting and little-known feature of Google Latitude is it has automated check-ins.
[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:08.360]   One of the pains with four squares, every time I go somewhere, if I'm going to play
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:12.480]   this stupid game and I am, because Liz Romero stole the mayor ship of our new studios from
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.480]   me, is...
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:18.600]   Doesn't it suck you in, by the way?
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:24.920]   I got the mayor ship of the cottage, though, from Eileen, so I'm okay.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:25.920]   What was I saying?
[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.920]   Oh, is that it's a pain.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:27.920]   I'm embarrassed.
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:28.920]   My wife says you're checking in.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:29.920]   Yes.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.480]   Every time I go to a restaurant, you're going to check in, aren't you?
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:33.480]   Yes.
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:35.680]   And so, Latitude just checks you in automatically.
[00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:36.680]   You could check a box.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.000]   And then when you get there, you're checked in.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.720]   Even more embarrassing, my wife, who knows I'm a creature of habit, when I suggest going
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:45.120]   to a new restaurant, she'll be like, "You just wanted a check-in."
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.120]   You want a mayor ship.
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:47.120]   Just wanted a check.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:50.840]   And when a new restaurant opens, you want to be the first one there, so you get the extra
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:53.920]   five points for creating the venue in the...
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:54.920]   Exactly.
[00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:55.920]   It's embarrassing.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:56.920]   It's so embarrassing.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:58.760]   Pwned by game mechanics.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:58:59.760]   Pwned.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.160]   You know, I never got a new restaurant, because it's where I always go.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:04.160]   Chipotle.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.160]   Yes.
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.160]   Don't say it.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.160]   We got a whole chipotle.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:08.160]   We got a whole chipotle.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.160]   We got a whole chipotle.
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:10.160]   We got a whole chipotle.
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.160]   We got a...
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:12.160]   Because they're getting free advertising.
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:14.160]   Okay, you're right.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:20.320]   So, we got it like, use a code word for chipotle, so that when we say it, people won't know...
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.320]   So, Wendy's.
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:26.280]   And then that way, unless chipotle buys advertising from now on, it's Wendy's.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:31.280]   By the way, I went to another Wendy's in New York, because we actually had the Tereto
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:33.600]   there, but a different place.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:36.080]   Oh, wasn't the one is in the Wendy's?
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.080]   We were talking about...
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:39.120]   Oh, no, it was an extra Wendy's.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:46.880]   Somebody on Twitter is at Wendy's and just tweeted a picture of both the computer screen
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:49.800]   with the show up and the Wendy's burrito.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.840]   Oh, man.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:52.840]   It's pretty...
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:54.840]   This is gay.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:55.840]   Dang.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:59.640]   Wendy's a sure-making bottle jealous, I'm sorry.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:01.640]   I'm such a prostitute.
[01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:05.120]   To be honest, I don't want Wendy's advertising.
[01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.880]   I wouldn't accept it.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.880]   Really?
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:08.880]   No.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.880]   That stuff will kill you.
[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:13.120]   Oh, it was good.
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.800]   Come on, Jeff, we have standards here.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.960]   I went to Wendy's the other night.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:17.960]   Actual Wendy's.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:18.960]   Not the pseudo.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.960]   I want the actual Wendy's.
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:21.960]   Not the Mexican Wendy's.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:23.960]   There was no...
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.600]   I was stuck somewhere and there was nothing else to eat.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.600]   Honeycomb...
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.120]   It didn't taste pretty good, Leo.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.360]   Yeah, it tastes great.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.360]   The American way.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.200]   John food tastes great.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:35.200]   It does.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.200]   Sounds sad.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:40.920]   Until about an hour afterwards.
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.760]   That's when it tastes bad, is later.
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.520]   That's when you taste like regret.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.080]   Yeah, it tastes like regret.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.560]   I love crispy creams in the morning.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:54.240]   It tastes like regret.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:01:01.360]   The Galaxy tab that you and I have, Gina, will be shipped next week with 3.1 on it.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.360]   3.1.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.360]   No!
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.480]   But now Zoom has 3.1.
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:11.440]   By the way, I stood around the Zoom display at Costco yesterday.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.440]   No takers.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.440]   Oh.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.200]   I was like, "The what?"
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.200]   The Zoom.
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.200]   You know, Motorola, the Zoom.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.200]   Oh, wait.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.200]   Oh, that thing.
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:23.240]   I had to say when you compare the Galaxy tab 10.1 to the Zoom, it's like there's nights
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.240]   like night and day.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.240]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.880]   Motorola really missed the boat on that one.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:29.800]   Yeah, when I saw some story of it, go ahead.
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.320]   Oh, sorry, Jeff.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.120]   No, I just, I got onto my tab and was like, "Wint a software update."
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.560]   I had to sign up for a Samsung account, which I hadn't done.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.200]   I did that and no updates.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.200]   No.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.200]   But I imagine that we'll get it, you know, soon, right?
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:43.960]   Because it's the next couple weeks, do you think?
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.560]   Yeah, because I think it was June 6th that it's supposed to come out.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:46.560]   So two weeks, yeah.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.560]   Yep.
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:48.560]   Oh.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.560]   Droid 3 coming out with a big, big, big keyboard.
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.560]   4, was it 4, 3 inch screen?
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.800]   A big screen.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.200]   The details leaked.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.400]   Let's see what else.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:06.360]   Google says they're going to use seawater to cool their data center in Hamana.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.400]   Hamana, Hamana, Hamana.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.200]   And that's they're going to get blamed for global warming.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:14.120]   I was going to say, they're going to boil the ocean.
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.280]   It'll be good until the ocean evaporates.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:20.040]   Yeah, it was interesting.
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.160]   They actually, my first thought was like, "Wow, they're going to heat up that whole
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.680]   golf there."
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:29.360]   But they mix the outgoing warmer water with existing Rossi water to get the time.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.840]   The temperature backed down to closer to the existing temperature so it doesn't disrupt
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.280]   the environment on the way out.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.280]   Aren't they smart?
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.600]   They bought, apparently it's a, this is going to be in Finland.
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.840]   And they bought a former paper mill, which already had seawater tunnels.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.920]   They didn't have to do new tunnels, but they had to check them so they got an Android.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.920]   I mean, a robot.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:50.920]   Maybe it wasn't Android.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:51.920]   And it was a robot.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.920]   Was it an Android controlled robot?
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:53.920]   I hope so.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.120]   To check the tunnels.
[01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:00.240]   This is the first time anybody's used seawater to cool a data center.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.800]   Because I mean, you got to clean it.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:02.800]   It's not easy.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.800]   You got to corrosion issues.
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:09.160]   And I imagine it takes a lot of energy to pump that water.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.440]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.440]   Right.
[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.440]   Well, that's why it probably only works in some places.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:21.400]   That's one of the Google plan to have the, the, the central data center that was actually
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.480]   on the ocean where the waves were going to power it as well.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.000]   And did they happen something like that?
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.400]   I mean, it's really very cool.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.400]   Right.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.280]   Well, it's a big, you know, it's not merely environmental.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.280]   It's expensive.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.280]   I mean, this is, it's funny.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.040]   Nobody really thinks of the fact that every search you do costs a little bit of power.
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.400]   I think about how hot your MacBook Pro gets.
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.400]   I multiply that by like 10 million.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:50.000]   So this kind of efficiency is very, very important.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.640]   No more offline Gmail and Google Chrome, but it's funny as they move closer and closer
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:04:03.560]   to the Chromebook, they kill gears, but Google doesn't maintain gears.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:07.520]   And so they're, I guess they're, they're taking offline mail out.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.480]   Yeah, but they're going to have the HTML5 offline version out.
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:13.120]   They said early summer so soon.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:19.400]   I'm not sure why they didn't, at least if not create overlap, do it kind of one version
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:24.200]   to the next, but it looks like they just needed to have a cutoff point for the gear support.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.840]   And then so they can introduce the HTML5 offline version.
[01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:29.720]   So there are going to be, there's going to be a few weeks where you can't do offline,
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:33.720]   offline Gmail and Chrome and I actually recommend using the Firefox version.
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:34.720]   Oh, no.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:40.280]   And the, you know, the Python help document, you know, in the interim, which seems, which
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.280]   seems awful.
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.280]   Oh, no.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.280]   You too.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.280]   But it's on the radar.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.280]   It's coming.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:52.840]   YouTube users now, the new stat upload 48 hours worth of video a minute, two days per
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.840]   minute.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:54.840]   Amazing.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:58.320]   Three billion videos a day they serve up.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:04:59.320]   That's nutty.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.320]   Six.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.600]   And YouTube is six years old now.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:09.320]   So that's, wow, that's just, I would love to figure out how much, what the storage
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:12.200]   costs now, what would have cost 10 years ago.
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:14.560]   Do you think YouTube is profitable?
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.920]   They've ever broken that out of their, in their financials.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.920]   They don't.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:21.000]   I think they said it's profitable though, didn't they?
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   I don't know.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   What's the profit?
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.680]   I mean, that made definitions of that.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.600]   They made a penny.
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.960]   Hey, you know what?
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.080]   If you had YouTube and you made a penny a year, you'd be happy.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:38.040]   Doesn't, you know, as long as you don't lose a billion dollars a year or a month or whatever,
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:39.040]   be hard not to.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.880]   I mean, that's a lot of storage, a lot of, I'm a huge amount of bandwidth.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.960]   Three billion videos a day uploads alone.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.960]   Forget the white.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.960]   Right.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:49.040]   Forget just the play, the playback, right?
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:50.360]   Somebody do some math in the chat room.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:55.800]   It's 48 hours of video a minute assuming that the video is kind of medium quality video.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:03.120]   How many gigabytes or terabytes or petabytes a minute is that?
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:06.640]   According to Forbes, Facebook's getting into the music business.
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.960]   Now we got Google, we got Amazon.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:15.320]   Sure, surely we're going to have Apple any minute now doing a cloud service.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:17.240]   Facebook is an interesting player in all of this.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:21.160]   They're going to work with Spotify.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.320]   Now that's Europe only.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:27.160]   So maybe this won't be a US, something we could do in the US.
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.280]   Facebook has partnered with Spotify, a music streaming service that could be launched in
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.000]   as little as two weeks.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   According to Forbes, the integrated service is currently going through testing.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:41.160]   But when launched, Facebook users will see a Spotify icon appear on the left side of
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.920]   their newsfeed along with the usual icons for photos and events.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:49.160]   Clicking on the icon will install the service on their desktop in the background.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:53.360]   Facebook's got it down in terms of making it easy for people to add these features to
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:54.960]   Facebook.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:58.160]   And then you could just be in your Facebook, which people already are, right?
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.960]   And listen to music.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:01.200]   Millions of songs.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.200]   This makes a lot of sense, right?
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:05.720]   Especially with young people's music, what you listen to, the music they identify with
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.440]   is so much a part of your identity and so much like defines your tribe and you want to
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.720]   know what your friends are listening to.
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.280]   And this makes sense.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:16.520]   This makes a lot more sense than paying or even Amazon or even Google music.
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:22.120]   A quick poll, which are you either of you two using Google music regularly right now?
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.120]   I uploaded almost 7,000 songs.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.960]   What do you mean using it?
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:27.960]   Actually listening?
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:31.800]   Are you reaching forward when you get on your phone and you want to listen to, are you
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.560]   reaching forward as your primary music?
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:34.800]   What do you want to listen to music?
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.760]   So many ways that I can listen to music now.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.480]   I have a MOG subscription.
[01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:43.120]   MOG's on my Sonos, but I also have Pandora.
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.480]   And I prefer to listen to those than the music I already have and know.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.520]   But I have to say the idea that I now have on any phone, any Android phone or device
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:56.040]   that I pull out, I just log in and I have access to my entire music collection.
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.040]   It's nice.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.040]   I like that.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.040]   Yeah, it is nice.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:01.120]   Nothing wrong with that and it's free.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:04.240]   But where did I buy Gaga?
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:05.240]   Amazon.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.240]   Right.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.240]   I didn't even bother downloading it.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.480]   It's in my cloud.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:10.980]   Right.
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.280]   What do you think of this, Jeff Jarvis?
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:14.920]   We both have college kids.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:20.000]   Peter Thiel is paying 24 college kids to drop out, basically.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:23.800]   A hundred thousand bucks.
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.560]   Jake told me that he almost applied.
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560]   What?
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.800]   I said, oh, oh, to have been there the moment you told your mother you won it.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.800]   Ah!
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.640]   He would have been killed.
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:37.480]   It's a mixed blessing, though, because that's a significant amount of money you don't have
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.040]   to pay.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040]   That's true.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.160]   Yeah, I mean, he told me that the application is not about the product.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.960]   It's kind of what you want to do in the world.
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:49.560]   Which is interesting today, by the way, with Zuckerberg, he was saying that he sees this
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:52.960]   very strange, taken Silicon Valley, where people decide that they want to start a company
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.680]   before they know what they want to start.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.800]   And he said, that doesn't mean any sense.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.360]   And he tells the same way.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.000]   He's trying to say you want to change something.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   You want to disrupt something.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   You want to fix something.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.720]   You want to fix that.
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:05.720]   And that's the driver.
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:07.120]   It's not starting a company.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.280]   And I think he's right.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:14.040]   I think that if you look at the great successes, they have the all of them, but not for them
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.040]   who made by dropouts.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:21.480]   It really makes me think that in the days when we had a draft, how much innovation
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:27.400]   were we ruining by making you regimented, putting you through college, how much we were
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.520]   ruining by making you regimented.
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:29.520]   So I...
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:35.320]   Wait a minute, though, Israel requires military service of all of its young people.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.320]   True.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:39.920]   And I don't think you could say Israel is not a hotbed of innovation in the text.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.920]   That's true.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.920]   You're right.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.920]   So I don't...
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:43.920]   I think that that's...
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.640]   I think we could say that's not the case.
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.520]   It's the old draft Dodger at me talking to you.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:50.120]   Are you a draft Dodger?
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.840]   No, I was 256.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:52.840]   Yeah, me too.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.360]   I had a very high number in the...
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.360]   I was in the...
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.360]   I was in the...
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.360]   I was in the last...
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.360]   I think the last lottery.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.520]   I was too.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.680]   But I had that argument with my...
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:03.680]   I was ready to...
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.320]   I was to be in jail or Canada.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:09.320]   I wasn't going to Vietnam, that's for sure.
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:12.480]   With all due respect to those who serve our nation, I...
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.480]   It's...
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.480]   That is...
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.480]   It's ultra.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.480]   I have no disrespect to you whatsoever.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.480]   For Gina.
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:18.480]   For Gina's...
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.480]   Oh, God, here go the old Prince.
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:20.480]   Yeah, remember?
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.960]   I remember when beer, you had to use a can opener and open the can.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.960]   Remember that?
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:31.440]   It hasn't been another Sinatra, has it?
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:33.440]   You can take your Michael Buble and...
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.880]   Maybe you can judge us off the system.
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:36.880]   I'm just a...
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:39.080]   I'm a sponge, I'm learning from my elders.
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:42.640]   I'm just saying, Gaga ain't no Zha Zha.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:46.840]   That's all I'm going to say.
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:52.720]   We had stars in our day.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:56.480]   We had Conan and can't light a candle to Merv Griffin.
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:59.760]   Show title, show title.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.560]   Gaga ain't no Zha Zha.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:04.360]   Half of Facebook walls have profanity.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.360]   What the...
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:09.800]   Oh, fudge.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:11.880]   This was interesting.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:17.480]   We kind of got the story on Uber media, Twitter and Tweet Deck.
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:22.240]   Twitter did officially close that for $40 million.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:27.680]   The marketing article and business insider talking about Bill Gross, who is a legend
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:33.960]   in this business as an entrepreneur, as a smart businessman, kind of fumbling the deal
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:34.960]   for Tweet Deck.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:38.600]   Uber media was trying to buy Tweet Deck, which would have given them a significant percentage
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.800]   of Twitter traffic.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:45.400]   Foolishly before the deal was closed, he announced that he was going to compete with Twitter.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.600]   I don't think he announced it so much as it leaked.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:50.480]   Somehow it got out.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.560]   Apparently, he was messing...
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.760]   I want to say, dicking around with Tweet Deck.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:02.600]   Tweet Deck, instead of closing the deal and he was trying to get a better deal, basically
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.840]   signaled Twitter of his interest.
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:08.240]   Twitter swoops in and steals Tweet Deck and saves the day.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.640]   I hope they keep Tweet Deck alive.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:13.360]   I have to think though, with their existing clients, they probably won't.
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.640]   At least they kept it away.
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.040]   The stuff work is Twitter means to me.
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.840]   I'm using my iPad.
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.900]   It was the first conference I went to where it was good.
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:26.800]   As long as we got the irony of the EGA was of course the internet sucked.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.800]   No, really.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:32.720]   The question was saying, did the internet connection was down?
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.560]   But they were...
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:43.880]   Just Twitter refuses to acknowledge, as much as they like the fact that we all add in
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:48.640]   new features and conventions, the RT, the way we like to use it.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.320]   It just amazes me.
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:59.160]   Google Doodle winner depicting a doodle of life in space.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.960]   This was the contest they got in a little trouble for because they were asking kids for
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   their home address or something.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960]   I don't remember.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.960]   They were in Social Security number or something like that.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:09.960]   I think it was social, wasn't it?
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:10.960]   It was the last four digits.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:11.960]   Last four digits, right?
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:12.960]   Yeah, last four digits.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:13.960]   So that's not so.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:14.960]   Verify.
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:15.960]   Unique.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.960]   I don't know.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:24.280]   One of those two seven-year-old Mateo Lopez of South San Francisco is 107 submissions, five
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.720]   million votes cast.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.360]   And it's like for a seven-year-old?
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.920]   That's a damn fine drawing, Mateo.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:31.920]   It really is.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.920]   I put that on my fridge.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:34.920]   Wow.
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:35.920]   Kids today.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:36.920]   Oh, the feet.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:37.920]   You're the feet.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:38.920]   Kids today.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:39.920]   Yeah, the G is really good.
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:40.920]   Both Gs are good.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:42.320]   The first G is particularly good.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:45.520]   You were supposed to draw on the theme of what I'd like to do some day and of course,
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.520]   he's obviously once.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:51.400]   He either wants to be a little green man or an astronaut.
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.400]   I would guess the one in the middle.
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.400]   That's nice.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.400]   I like a happy story.
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:57.840]   We should end with that on a happy note.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:58.840]   Yes.
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:13:59.840]   Yes.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.160]   Amazon offering a 3G Kindle now for $164 ad supported.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.640]   I bought the $114.
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.640]   I think we talked about it.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.560]   It's not in any way intrusive.
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.560]   Good deal recommended.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:12.680]   Let me ask you about the whole run.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:15.520]   You saw the John Malone is looking to buy Barnes and Noble.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.560]   I'm trying to figure out why.
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.560]   Why?
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.800]   John Malone who was, wasn't he Liberty Media?
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:24.800]   He's a media moguls.
[01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:31.160]   Yeah, he's the most barracudish, toughest cable guy in an industry that's all tough.
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.400]   And some say he wants to know, but I don't buy that.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:36.160]   You can come up with a device that has Android on it and make it China.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.480]   And then it's not even going to be a winner in the long run.
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.040]   It's going to be Google or, I mean, Amazon.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:46.320]   Well, you know, I see some opportunity to attack Amazon.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:50.200]   It's fine, but the price of more cost you a fortune.
[01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:51.200]   I don't get it.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.200]   I don't either.
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:55.040]   Yeah, it doesn't make sense.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.280]   They want to buy up 70%.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.760]   Of course, Barnes and Noble's probably fire sale priced, right?
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.760]   $17 a share.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:07.000]   Well, that gives it a billion dollar value.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.600]   They're betting Liberty Media Chairman, John Malone, and Chief Executive Greg Muffet told
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:15.840]   investors money the potential for the Nook platform to become the ebook platform of choice
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.840]   for consumers.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.840]   No, no, no, figure.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.560]   But he's a cable guy.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.920]   So he thinks about distribution.
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:24.880]   He thinks about controlling distribution.
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.720]   But I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:28.720]   I can't get it.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:29.720]   There's, that's misdirection.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.720]   That's not their plan.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:36.720]   Liberty Media execs are hoping to gain popularity with publishers who might not want Amazon
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.720]   to get too big.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:40.720]   I could be.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:43.520]   Ah, I could be.
[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:49.760]   And they said retail stores aren't such a bad idea.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:50.760]   Jesus.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:58.120]   He says, Seth wrote a really good post about libraries and how libraries, you know, the
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.400]   value of libraries, librarian, blah, blah, blah.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.400]   And it was current to me after he was posted.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400]   I've written this up.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.240]   Most of the bars and no more stores should become a place to browse, becomes the third
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:08.240]   place you hang out.
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:09.240]   You know what they should do?
[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:10.240]   They should hire librarians.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.840]   A good, a good, a good book store.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:16.000]   Clerk is worth it.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   Her weight in gold.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.160]   That's what Abby wants to do this summer is work in the bookstore.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.200]   I say right on, right on sister.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.280]   He, he says the strong store presence will give the company's physical stores an enduring
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:33.280]   role.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.280]   What?
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:41.200]   I mean, I love bookstores, but really you think, I mean, it's like saying, you know,
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:44.640]   we'd like to buy that blockbuster company too, because we think VHS sales are going to
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.800]   go through the roof next year.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.320]   Holy cow.
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:54.440]   Uh, I just want to make sure I get every major story.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.360]   I think we, I think we've hit them all.
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.360]   Good job.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:01.080]   Um, but Leo, I'm sorry, just to rewind for a second.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.000]   You think they're going to kill tweet deck Twitter?
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   What, why would they keep it?
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.960]   They've got the official Twitter app on all platforms now, right?
[01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:08.960]   I love tweet deck.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.120]   It seems like they're looking to like cater to the pro users.
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.120]   I think it was defensive by.
[01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.120]   Mm.
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:19.040]   I don't, I don't think it makes sense for Twitter to have two clients on any platform,
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:22.360]   but like the, what about if they market is kind of like the power of your client?
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.240]   I mean, there's also Facebook and buzz and four square support and tweet deck.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:28.160]   I mean, you know, I don't know that they might kill that.
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.160]   I love tweet deck.
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.160]   Interesting.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:31.160]   I love to eat deck too.
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.160]   I live in it.
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.160]   It's sad.
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.160]   Yeah, it would be a bummer.
[01:17:34.160 --> 01:17:35.160]   I don't know.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.160]   I don't know.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.760]   I thought maybe could go along with their analytics.
[01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.760]   I think it's kind of like the analytics package for the kind of the power user, the big organizations
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:45.560]   with lots of accounts and maybe I just wish we thinking because I love it.
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.560]   Okay.
[01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:48.120]   I want to give a quick thank you to Restoration Hardware.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:49.120]   Our furniture came.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.120]   Have you seen the front?
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:51.960]   Have you been over to the studio and seen the fridge?
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:52.960]   It's so fun.
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:57.760]   The, we got the desks for the newsroom and they're just, they're predestressed.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:03.360]   They look like they're, they look like something from France in the, in the 18th century.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.360]   They're great.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.440]   And then we've got these other desks for the office desks.
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:07.440]   They're really cool.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:08.440]   They have like airline.
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:14.560]   They're looking for something that really looked cool for the new office to fit the, that kind
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:16.880]   of the deco retro look.
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:19.200]   I just wanted to mention that there is a restoration.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:22.600]   We want to thank them and tell you about the Restoration Hardware app, which is out for
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.280]   the iPad that gives you their full source book.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.280]   This is 384 pages.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.120]   Actually, I have to download it.
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.120]   I have the other one.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.000]   I have the summer outdoor source book.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.880]   If you want to see the furniture we're getting and all the great stuff at Restoration Hardware,
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:37.360]   I'm a huge Restoration Hardware fan.
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:40.440]   We are so thrilled that they were able to help us out with our news.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:44.080]   So they should do an AR version of it with your studio so you can see the items in the
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.080]   studio.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:46.080]   I will do it for them.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.080]   You bet.
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.080]   I will do it for them.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.720]   They actually have, it's pretty, it's pretty kind of interactive catalog.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.720]   Okay.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:56.880]   So you can look at something in the catalog, double tap it to zoom in.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:59.080]   And then there's, oh, that's kind of interesting.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.080]   I like that.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:04.320]   I want every time I look at the catalog, I want to buy something.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:08.720]   And then when you, then the pages have zones that you can tap on to order so you could
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:09.720]   pull up an order page.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:10.720]   It's pretty cool.
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.400]   I tell you commerce is changing rapidly.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:18.200]   Thank you Restoration Hardware for your support of our Twitch cottage.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.240]   Don't forget folks too, those Twitch bricks.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:24.880]   They're available at brick stud as long as I'm plugging stuff for the cottage.
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.880]   They're available.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.480]   You're going to be eating those Wendy's burgers right there on those chairs.
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.480]   Too bad.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.000]   It would have been fun to have a little something else there, but I guess we'll eat Wendy's
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   burgers and the brick to it.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:41.080]   I'm kind of more of a fan of the Mexican, the down the south, you know, south of the border
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.520]   style, but that's okay.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.520]   Brick stop.
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:45.520]   Good.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.520]   And Chorito.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520]   Chorito.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:57.240]   It is time for our tip number and tool of the week starting with Gina Trapani and her
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:59.640]   tip of the week.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.960]   We've talked about Gmail labs before, which are these experimental features you can enable
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.320]   in Gmail.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:06.960]   Calendar has them as well.
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:10.360]   So if you use Google Calendar, they don't roll them out as quickly and there aren't as
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.880]   many as for Gmail.
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:15.680]   But if you go into your Google Calendar settings, you can see there's a labs, there's a labs
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:20.520]   section and there's a new labs feature called next meeting, which tells you basically how
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:23.520]   many hours until the next schedule thing that you have.
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:24.520]   That's good.
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:25.520]   I like that.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.520]   It's really neat.
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:28.520]   It shows in the sidebar.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.960]   Which is nice if I put on my personal productivity hat.
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.680]   It's a nice way to say, like, what can I get done in two hours?
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:37.960]   So I won't start on a big project or maybe, you know, what can I get done in a few minutes?
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:40.200]   But there's a bunch of cool labs features in here.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:44.200]   Once you're in there, you should check them out automatically, decline events during certain
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:48.120]   times and show me who's scheduled things with me.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.040]   If you're a big Google Calendar user, definitely check them out.
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:54.000]   But I like this next meeting, which really helps you kind of plan out your day.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.480]   You know how much time you have until your next commitment.
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:57.480]   Love it.
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:01.120]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.120]   I've got one.
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.120]   It's 27.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.120]   27.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:08.960]   When asked about his legacy for humanity, Zuckerberg said, I'm 27.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.520]   Give me a break.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:13.040]   See, that's the suck we like.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:15.160]   I love it.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:18.640]   You know, I'll get back to you in a few years.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:24.280]   Morris Levy also said, you know, it was amazing.
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:26.120]   He turned out a billion dollar check from Yahoo.
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:32.640]   He said, you were, you know, 25 and Zuckerberg said, no, 22.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.720]   My tool is really just a way to waste time.
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.320]   I hope you don't mind.
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:42.960]   But this was, you know, I tell you, if you haven't yet put the Amazon App Store, I know
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:46.240]   it's a little hard on your Android phone or your Android device.
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:50.480]   Do because they give away a free program every day.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:55.200]   And it's now part of my ritual in the morning to get up and see what's free this morning.
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.320]   And I've discovered so many great free Android apps.
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.240]   Here's one that really works well on the tablet, but you can also get for the phone.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:02.240]   It's called chalk ball.
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.240]   Did you try that yet?
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.240]   Gina?
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:05.240]   No, I have it.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:06.240]   It's so much fun.
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:07.240]   I'll play it.
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:08.240]   It sounds dangerous.
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.800]   See, there's the ball and you have to draw a chalk to bounce the ball and you have a limited
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.200]   amount of chalk.
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:13.760]   So you're trying to bounce the ball.
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:14.760]   Keep it alive.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:18.240]   If it falls off the screen, see, now I'm going to get a refill of chalk because I hit
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:19.480]   the right thing.
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:21.280]   If it falls off the screen, then you're kind of dead.
[01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.880]   Now, watch, I got to put a little chalk there.
[01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:23.880]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:24.880]   Whoa.
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:27.160]   Oh, this is dangerous.
[01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:33.240]   This is deceptively fun and simple, but it's really a great game.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:40.160]   It's called chalk ball and I can't-- oh, yeah.
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:41.880]   If you tip the tablet, it will go the other way.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.880]   Wouldn't that be good?
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:43.880]   No.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:44.880]   Oh, you distracted me.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.880]   Sorry, sorry.
[01:22:45.880 --> 01:22:51.920]   So, but it's kind of a very realistic-- it really feels like you're drawn on a chalkboard.
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:52.920]   It's kind of fun.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:53.920]   It was free.
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.440]   I think it's a buck or something.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.000]   It's not expensive.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.440]   But again, I just want to underscore-- get that Amazon Web Store on your Android phone.
[01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:04.720]   You'll be glad you did.
[01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:07.000]   I've downloaded a bunch of free crap.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.200]   Yeah, crack ball.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.280]   That's another name for it.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:12.600]   Gina Trapani is at smartherware.org.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:14.560]   That is her site.
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.800]   She's also on Twitter as Gina Trapani.
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:17.800]   Yup.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:18.800]   You know Trapani?
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.800]   Gina Trapani.
[01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:20.800]   Trapani.
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:21.800]   Trapani.
[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:22.800]   Trapani Trapani.
[01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:23.800]   Trapani.
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:24.800]   Trapani.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:30.240]   She also is at the thinkuplabs.com site where your thinkup app is.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.240]   Thinkupapp.com.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.240]   Thinkupapp.com.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.840]   Yeah, we're starting our summer mentoring program.
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:39.240]   So if you're an open source expert veteran or your newbie come and we'll pair you up
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:41.920]   and I'll put you to work for me.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:42.920]   Good.
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:43.920]   Awesome.
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.440]   What a treat that would be to get to do that.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:46.440]   Are you kidding?
[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.920]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.160]   Jeff Jarvis is the new president of the internet.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.160]   Elected by acclamation.
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:54.720]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:56.960]   I am your servant by the usual.
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:57.960]   No, no, no.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:00.880]   Thank you for doing such a great job in France and for going.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.880]   VP, VP.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:02.880]   No, he's--
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.800]   Oh, so are they.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.280]   He's my president.
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:07.280]   Have a great evening.
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.120]   Thank you for joining us late at night in Paris.
[01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:12.120]   Enjoy your rest of your visit and we'll see you soon back here.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:15.560]   Jeff is at buzzmachine.com also at Jeff Jarvis on Twitter.
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.360]   The author of the book, What Would Google Do?
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:21.760]   It is a fascinating read but to look for his new book, Public Parts Out soon.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.960]   I have better bookstores everywhere.
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:25.360]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.960]   We'll see you next week on This Week in Google.
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:31.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:38.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
