[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   but the cloud, the social media, the journalism.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And that's because of the panelists we have who are so great.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   He's here all the time, buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   We love him.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   He's the heart and soul of the show.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I'm the angry pink guy.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I recognize that chuckle.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   It sounds like I can't, I must be fit.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   It is.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It's Gina Trapani.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Oh my goodness.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Gina Trapani is here as she is once a month because we, she needed space and time to work on think up.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And we're going to talk about the
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   news at another startup, which we're going to find out about debuted yesterday at demo day at the White House.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Yes.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Hello.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Welcome back.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   We missed you.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Thank you.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And along with this embarrassment of riches, Lindy Johnson is back.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Lindy Johnson, a community expert, social media expert.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's worked all over the place.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Nice to have you, Lynn.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Welcome.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Hi.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Lindy Johnson.com, L-Y-N-E.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I don't know where to begin.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   There's so many interesting Googly topics to talk about.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Why don't we start with Google+, Mashable?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Is Mike in the studio?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   No.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I just need to know.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   No, you can speak freely.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Mike, of course, is a fan of Google+, in fact, he wrote a rebuttal of the Mashable article that really started this conversation.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Actually, the news story that started the conversation was that Google was going to decouple your Google account from your Google+ account.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   For a few years now, you've been required to have a Google+ account whenever you created a Gmail account or any other Google service.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   You needed that Google+ account to comment on YouTube to post on YouTube.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Google announced that they're decoupling it.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Vic Gundotra, who was the heart and soul of it, left some time.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   It's been a year now, right?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And the article, which I think is well researched by Seth Feigerman or Figurman at Mashable basically said this Google+ is a failure and a very expensive failure
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   for Google came about.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   He says, "Because Vic just wouldn't give up.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Pested Larry with words like, "Facebook's going to kill us.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Facebook's going to kill us."
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Until Larry just finally said, "Okay, let's do something social."
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   And boy, when they did it, they went all in.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   In fact, threatened by Facebook, spent hundreds of millions of dollars to create Google+.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   We're four years in and it's according to this article anyway.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Pretty clear it's over for Google+.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Photos is left to the building.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Hangouts is left to the building.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   They've decoupled.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   First of all, let's talk about the premise.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Is Google+ over?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I'm not there as much as I used to be.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I have Big Sigh from Lynn.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Yeah, there was Sighs all around.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   That was great.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Lynn, I want to hear what you think about this.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I mean, there's no there there, right?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I mean, no one is there.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   But people have said that for years.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Right.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I mean, even when it was supposed to be big, right?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   But that was more about, there were a lot of people signing up,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   but not necessarily a lot of people using it, right?
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And you know, you had some of those, you know, like scoble types using it for a while really hard.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And that made it look like people were using it.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Yeah, scoble was one of the first to give up and it has been for two years now saying.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Plus the scoble cycle.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   But no, he's been pretty consistent that Facebook wins and if you spend time cultivating your
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Facebook profile, you will win too.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   And he's been very adamant about that.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   I just think of different things.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I still, I still, that's what Mike would say.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I think they're different things.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   And he's right about Facebook, but I still enjoyed Google+ and there are still people there.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   But like any social network, if you don't put yourself into it, if you don't contribute to it,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   you're not going to get anything back.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And it's just one more thing to do for me now.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Mike's rebuttal that sorry tech press, Google+ is alive and well, essentially said, well, yes,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   if you say that the goal of Google+ was to beat Facebook, well, then you're right.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   It failed.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   But people still use it.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Somebody still uses it.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Mike's important point, I think, is the tendency of the tech press to extrapolate from a data
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.600]   point of one and say, well, this is what everybody sees, this is what everybody gets, and not
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.000]   to see that things are built around communities.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I mean, if you ask most people my age where their Snapchat were, and if anything, they'd
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   say, oh, no, it's nothing.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   That's obviously wrong.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   There are people there.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   There are people who enjoy it there.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.280]   Because Bradley Horro has, too, is in charge of it, Bradley Horro has said, Google+ is
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.280]   not dead.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.000]   We're still all in on it.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   What's this saying that a pivot is a failure, right?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   That's like making that leap from it being a pivot.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.200]   Zooming out, I think about Google's products and this whole idea that Vic was in Larry's
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.680]   ear saying Facebook is going to get us.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.400]   We have to beat Facebook.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.360]   That's really interesting to me, the idea that they were chasing taillights on this.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.440]   Because if you look at all the super successful Google products, Google search, plenty of
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.120]   search engines existed, right?
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.440]   They were all terrible, right?
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.800]   Google search exploited that invulnerability and was so good, and there's no cost in switching
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.080]   search engines.
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.800]   Google Maps, so much better than MapQuest.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.440]   Unlike anything we ever saw before, blew the doors off everybody switched to Google Maps.
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.400]   Now Gmail's an interesting story, right?
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:21.600]   Because I was deeply embedded in my Yahoo email address when Gmail launched.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.080]   Again, that was so innovative and did a thing that no one else did, which was off for so
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.600]   much space, I changed my email address, which is something I wouldn't do.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.720]   Now, Gmail, I think, is the closest thing comparator you can make, right?
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.840]   Because all my contacts are in Yahoo, all my email histories in Yahoo, switching an email
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.360]   address is at pain, or switching maps or something.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.360]   Very sticky.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.360]   Yep.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.360]   So Google+, I think, is comparable.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.480]   But the difference is that Google+, didn't do anything.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:51.560]   That was so innovative and so different that everyone was compelled to switch on maps.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.560]   And also email.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.560]   Or the Facebook didn't just switch.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.600]   Facebook, Facebook is as good as it gets.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.400]   I shouldn't say as good as it gets.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.480]   That makes me look like that feels like giving up a little bit.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.720]   Facebook is really good.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.320]   Twitter is really good.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.880]   And Google+ didn't do anything that was that innovative circles, it turned out, were
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:16.560]   kind of complicated and took a lot tedious to maintain the different public and privacy
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.280]   levels, which everyone wants to wanted that on Facebook.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.920]   That didn't really work out, right?
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.640]   Like, Hangouts was amazing.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:23.640]   Photos was amazing.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.720]   They're separating those out.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:31.080]   So it's interesting to me to see that Google tried kind of what they've done so many times
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.280]   before, which was make a product that already existed in the market.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.840]   And they were trying to make a really superior product.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.720]   And in this case, the stream didn't make it.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.720]   It wasn't successful.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.880]   It's really insightful, Gene.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.400]   I think it's always as usual.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:53.080]   But I think it really is because there were two trajectories there in that in the sense
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.160]   that you're right, Google didn't go far enough beyond Facebook and Facebook kept developing
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.760]   like crazy and doing amazing things.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.960]   And so it was the one time that Google was caught behind from the beginning and never
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.680]   was had any part of it.
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.560]   Though, I think there are wonderful things about Google+.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.760]   If Mike were here, he'd be sputtering at this point.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.400]   And Mike and I have always had the conversation for us as better on Google+ than it was elsewhere.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:24.200]   Well, and this is kind of what at the end of this Mashable article, Seth Feagerman quotes
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:32.400]   Bradley Horowitz as saying, this is kind of what's happening, that Google+ can now focus,
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.600]   this is Bradley's quote, can now focus on what doing what it's already doing quite well,
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:44.040]   helping millions of users around the world connect around the interest they love.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.480]   That's what he said at I/O.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.080]   And that's the strategy.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.760]   And of course, they have added new features.
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:53.520]   They added communities saying that's exactly what that does.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.800]   And so Mashable saying Google+ is shifting from a Facebook clone to more of a Pinterest
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.800]   look-alike.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.800]   Is that the pivot?
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.120]   It's a Pinterest or groups.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.240]   I mean, I feel like Mashable was being quite consistent.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.240]   It's just snarky.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.240]   Very dismissive.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.120]   They call it a Pinterest look-alike was sort of hard.
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.080]   Pinterest is doing okay.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.120]   Well, yes.
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.640]   But what I mean is Pinterest is doing great.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.800]   Pinterest is a great product.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.480]   What I mean is that they, the premise of the article is that Google was chasing Facebook
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.000]   and now they're chasing Pinterest, right?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Right.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Which I think was a little unfair.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.800]   I think it's a return to Google groups.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.760]   Isn't that what Mike says?
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.760]   Somebody said that.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.760]   I can't remember who.
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:34.760]   Maybe it was on Twitter on Sunday.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:38.640]   It's amazing to the geek bitterness about reader continues.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:48.080]   Well, but this is the peril for Google because Orcut, reader, wave, you know, there is a
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.040]   long list of terminated projects.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:56.520]   People become more and more reluctant to invest in something Google does if they continue
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:58.520]   to, sorry, I'm not talking to you.
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.440]   If they continue to, my phone, I say the word Google now wakes up.
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:08.480]   And since I say that like hundreds of times a day, it's very annoying.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.440]   People might be getting some fatigue, some Google fatigue.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:17.800]   What about this notion that Google should buy Twitter?
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.880]   Twitter's stock price continues to go down.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.880]   They're now worth less than $20 billion.
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.880]   Being easy.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.200]   I just love that every tech pundit is, it's absolutely going to happen or it's absolutely
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   not going to happen.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   I know.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.200]   I know.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:38.480]   I mean, the thing that would happen if they did, you know, buy Twitter, it would give them,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.720]   you know, more things to surface and search, right, in terms of news, right, and in real
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.600]   time news, right, to add to their news features.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.000]   But they have renegotiated with Twitter and have started that fire hose up again.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.440]   Right, right, right.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.760]   So I mean, there's the possibility of that, right?
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.400]   Maybe that's what this is about.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:01.560]   I mean, but the thing to Gina's point about circles, about circles, you know, not being
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:07.520]   really intuitive or working that well, I mean, I think the theory behind circles though was,
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.720]   you know, it was a really good theory in that, you know, you keep family separate from friends,
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.840]   from workmates, from whomever.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.280]   And I think that's the whole thing back to Scoble.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:23.200]   When Scoble talks about how Facebook wins, that's kind of how he uses Facebook in a way.
[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.080]   He talks differently to different groups of people.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:33.400]   So the idea that Google enabled you to do that, I think, you know, was a really great
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400]   idea.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.360]   And if they could work around people's interests, you know, that could still, again, it doesn't
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.840]   have to be Facebook to be good or to be successful.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.760]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.280]   I mean, and actually the idea of circles really has kind of informed some of the community
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.280]   stuff, right?
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:54.160]   I mean, if I love Android and I love Ronda Rousey and I love, you know, Twit, right?
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.520]   And I'm going to tag those things differently and I have different followers who enjoy those
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:12:59.520]   topics.
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.120]   It's similar to circles in a way.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.240]   And that's how I split up my circles in the beginning too.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.800]   Like these are my tech friends and these are my sports friends.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.200]   I never used circles.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.640]   I just, I just used Google+.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.640]   Maybe you were right.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.480]   It's, I mean, Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg very famously said that nobody wants to make
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.400]   lists and it's a lot of work to get your circles just.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.040]   You're never ahead.
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.520]   And Facebook really decided to do it algorithmically, programmatically, rather than have users put
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.760]   a lot of effort into it, although you still do have that capability.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.560]   Which the truth is so did Google+.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.600]   I mean, you know, versus Twitter, Twitter, when you ask for what you, what you get what
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.800]   you ask for and Google+, and Facebook, both the algorithm just prioritizes for you.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:46.800]   So maybe the failure is they just didn't do as good a job.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:52.360]   Is it an ex, is it a failure of execution?
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.360]   More timing.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:57.720]   I think that's, that's part of, well, well, there's okay, there's three possibilities.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.960]   Gina's point is a failure of inspiration.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.480]   They didn't have that idea that was, that was that far ahead.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.800]   There's a failure of timing that Facebook was just too far ahead to attack or there's
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.600]   a failure of execution that they didn't, that didn't kind of stay ahead.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.960]   It's like the point that Nashville made about Hangouts or somebody made about Hangouts.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.120]   I miss Google groups.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:21.840]   I think this might just be a more better look in Google groups is not a bad thing.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.160]   Well, but the, in the key difference here, and I think it's the nature of a decentralized
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.640]   network where you're either on it or you're not, right?
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.240]   Like Gmail, I could change to Gmail and I could still email you Leo and you could be
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.880]   using whatever you want, right?
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.040]   But, but you, but you basically had to go to Google+, and invest and be on Google+, it's
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.160]   not like you could use another client.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.840]   I mean, you could, there are hacks to do with that syndicate across the market.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.120]   I said this, I said this on Twitter.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:51.680]   I said, maybe this, you know, if Google, maybe Google should create a right API.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.680]   They never did.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.640]   They only, it was read only.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.720]   What if now, okay, yeah, maybe we couldn't figure it out.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.800]   Let's, let's let the market, or is it too late?
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.560]   When are my close for that?
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.560]   I think I would write it.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.720]   Would you, as a developer, would you even consider writing something for the Google
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.720]   API at this point?
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.720]   I might.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.960]   Because I might, because then you could use it.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.520]   If my audience was there, that's, that's the answer.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.880]   Always to the question of what, whether or not to use a particular API, particularly distribution
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.440]   API, if the audience is there, you know, I would do it.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.440]   You know what, Gina?
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.320]   The audience that was always there from day one was the photography audience.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.320]   Yes.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.680]   And I think Thomas Hox piece is somewhat damning because photography worked on Google+, so
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.680]   it worked brilliantly.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   It made stars.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.520]   It was a wonderful gathering point.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.240]   Everything about Google+, worked well on photography.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.320]   And then Thomas just says, I feel abandoned.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:49.200]   Yeah, that was, he posted it on Google+, and then later was reposted.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.120]   On a magazine, I can't remember.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.440]   He posted, I think he posted it initially on Facebook.
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.680]   And then somebody said, why don't you post this on Google+, and so he went to Google+,
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.320]   and put it there.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.480]   And then it's on some other magazine.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.960]   They were like, you're talking so much about Google+, why did you put this there?
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.960]   Okay.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.520]   So here's the Facebook post, which is by the way where I saw it, not Google+, he also
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.000]   says, look, these are just some thoughts I'm putting down.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.080]   He didn't, he says more of a rambling list than anything else.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:27.080]   But he said face, again, Thomas is a photographer who has used Google+, a lot for his images.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.520]   By the way, he's also used LO.co.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.760]   He's the last person still posting on LO.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.800]   I'm talking about Loli.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.720]   I'd like to know what Trey Radcliffe thinks.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.200]   I think Trey still likes Google+.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.680]   That's the one that I ask you.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.280]   Here's a guy who's really made his career posting on Google+.
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.840]   I'm having a senior moment.
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.840]   What was the other service that was started as the open Facebook?
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.040]   Young guys are not asked.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.040]   Diaspora.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.040]   Hello.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.040]   Diaspora, which I don't know.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.040]   Is it still no?
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.040]   That's anywhere.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.040]   I don't know.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.400]   That was my first Kickstarter contribution was Diaspora.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.400]   You schmuck you.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.320]   I think I gave him a hundred bucks to talk about a schmuck.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.760]   He had Diaspora Foundation, but this was a federated.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:13.760]   It was federated.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760]   And it still is.
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.000]   It still looks like it's still around.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   Still around.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.480]   So you could create your own Facebook in effect.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:26.000]   I think LO is kind of inter- I'll log into LO, which I haven't-
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.080]   I haven't been there in a year.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.320]   And by the way, if I do log into LO, probably mostly what you'll see is pictures from Thomas
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.440]   Hawk at this point.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.440]   That's mostly.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.680]   But one of the reasons Thomas likes this is the big images.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.680]   Right.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.200]   And that's mostly the photography community and the arts community.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.520]   They really like LO.
[00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.520]   Right.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:49.120]   And not having ads around this is kind of nice and all of that.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.560]   Actually, you know what?
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.920]   I see a lot more than Thomas now.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.960]   The last time I was there was all Thomas, but look at all these people posting here.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.480]   And you see how big these images are and maybe that's something about it, you know?
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.480]   And as you said, artists-
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.680]   Those are all shares by LO or-
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:04.680]   Oh.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.680]   Oh.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.680]   Oh.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.000]   Oh, these are reshars from LO.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Hello.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.160]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.920]   These are all LO's reshars.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.920]   Wow.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:20.320]   So that's partly my fault because I haven't added enough people, I guess.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.720]   I don't know if that's the problem in LO.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.360]   I don't think that's it, huh?
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.120]   I have a question that Thomas.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.120]   Um.
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:35.200]   Well, I really put some effort into LO when it first launched, but I don't know.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.000]   Maybe, you know, and I tried to follow new people, different people, then I follow on
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.360]   other networks just to have a different experience.
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.320]   But again, it just wasn't sticky enough.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:55.960]   We're, you know, I don't think we as consumers are real thoughtful in how we choose which
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:58.680]   social networks we're going to participate in or not.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.240]   It can have as much to do with how it looks.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:07.000]   Um, you know, face, every Facebook's ugly is sin.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.160]   Um, but the only reason I'm there is because family and friends are there, right?
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.480]   And somebody named Gina Tarpani.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:20.960]   Uh, but I've, I've really, I've, I've taken to Facebook and I'm not going to say it because
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.080]   it's a school, but I, you know, for other reasons, and I just decided I'm going to pay
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:29.240]   attention to Facebook and my, it's, it's, it's a really good experience.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.560]   It's gotten better and better too.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:31.560]   That's the other thing I've noticed.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.760]   And, you know, Scoble came here about a year ago.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.280]   We did a special on making your Facebook feed work better and moving people into acquaintances
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.120]   and friends and things like that and tuning it a little bit.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.360]   That didn't make such a difference, but something Facebook's done in the last three months has
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.720]   made a very big difference.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.560]   I see stuff now I want to see in my Facebook feed and very little that I don't.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.880]   They've also gotten much, much, but I thought, listen, I, I've now, uh, hit peak Facebook.
[00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.840]   Everybody I know on the earth, I'm already a friend of and then there are recommendations
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   for who to befriend.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.840]   Right.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.760]   And just now, oh, I'm not, I'm maybe, oh, shucks.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.960]   I'm not his friend.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.960]   Right.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.800]   And, and so that's improved a lot.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.920]   I, you know, I come across people for purposes of business and other things that worked.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.480]   More organizations are there with neat stuff.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.320]   Incidentally, somebody like Trey is going to always and has hedges bets.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:25.520]   He posts, yes, not just on Google plus, but he's does the same thing on all the big social
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.520]   networks.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:32.680]   I think it's the, the, the, when you, when you spend time giving any attention to one
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.040]   post how it pops up immediately below that with you, with the other recommended things.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.040]   Yes.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   Yes.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.040]   They've done a good job.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.760]   Facebook has been doing this for a really long time.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.360]   And the reality is that that when it comes to social product development, they're the,
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.600]   they're the best, they're the best out there, the best minds and it's, and they just, they
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.760]   have the head start.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.400]   But don't we want to fight the monopoly?
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:00.520]   I mean, it's not good for the ecosystem for everything to be on Facebook or is it?
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.520]   Follow the light children.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.160]   No, I don't think it's good for the ecosystem.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.800]   And certainly I don't want to discourage any young, young entrepreneurs or innovators from,
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.080]   from thinking about what problems it ain't over or solves badly or what audiences it
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.520]   doesn't, you know, it's not good for coming up with, with different solutions.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:25.360]   But as a generic, like kind of generic social network, like Facebook and Twitter, I mean,
[00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:31.800]   you know, I feel like we've kind of, we've reached, we have that, we have that now.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.640]   I think there are other specialized social networks.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.000]   I basically built on myself.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   You know what Facebook, I'm thinking, I'm thinking back a few years to the Facebook experience
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.640]   a few years ago, it was jammed by Farmville and Candy Crush.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:51.360]   The games have been deprecated, pushed aside, the apps have been deprecated, pushed aside.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.680]   It's really the news feed.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.360]   I think Facebook realized that's what people use Facebook for.
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.120]   And they've worked very hard algorithmically to make sure the news feed is germane.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.040]   I met the head of the news feed in New York a few weeks ago.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.960]   And I said, you know, one thing that I'm thinking this is Facebook knows all it knows
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.960]   the best way.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.680]   And I see, you know, one thing that irritates me is the repetition of memes that I'll see
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.080]   the same meme come up three weeks later.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.080]   And I've never seen it.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.520]   And he said, yeah, I know, we're working on that.
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.120]   And I thought, oh, they're, they're human.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.120]   Yeah, they're painting.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.120]   You know, it's okay.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.480]   They're trying to fix this.
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.480]   They're always trying to fix this.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.080]   They're always trying to improve it, you know, and I think there's.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:34.480]   What's interesting is I feel like they have, I don't see repetition of the same viral videos
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.480]   and all of that.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.640]   They must be paying attention to that.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.280]   I see good stuff on Facebook used.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.800]   I used to feel bad when I went out to Facebook.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.600]   After spending time there, I would feel like you don't feel that way anymore.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.920]   You have the Nets politics story up there?
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.920]   You want to talk about that?
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.920]   Yes.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.120]   So I just said, no, was that on your Facebook page?
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.080]   No, where did I see that?
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.800]   I think I believe that I believe or not, I saw that on hacker news.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   Oh, okay.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   Sorry.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   No, no, we go get that later.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.960]   No, no, I just thought that was weird that it came out on Facebook.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:11.760]   No, but see, that's why it isn't you don't want a mono culture because you're right.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.080]   There's stuff that's not going to appear on Facebook.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.600]   But then if you've, and one of the, I love hacker news and that's an example of, this
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.880]   is a wide combinator feed that for a while is getting gamed a lot, had a lot of spam,
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.240]   but it's kind of what digger or slash that was supposed to be people vote up comments
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.960]   and so forth.
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.640]   And it's quirky stuff that tech geeks like.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.680]   That seems to me to be a good thing is there should be many of these that are that cater
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.760]   to niches, right?
[00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.600]   Yes.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.600]   Or niches.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:51.040]   Um, should we, should we talk with this, this, uh, this R's piece about, about Hangouts?
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.720]   I think Jeff mentioned it earlier saying that Google speaking of, of more specialized products,
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:01.280]   uh, that, that Google should invest in Hangouts, like put all the, all the effort and, and
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.080]   money that they've spent on plus in general into, into Hangouts as a messaging app.
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:08.560]   I think it's too, I hate to say it, but they're too late on that.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.560]   You think it's too late?
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:13.160]   You look like a unified messaging platform.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.760]   Oh, I don't think so.
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.760]   Well, maybe on Android.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.760]   Okay.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.760]   On Android.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:18.760]   It's not too late for Android users.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:19.760]   Definitely.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.280]   No, but that's just Android users and it ain't Skype.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:28.160]   Well Skype is Microsoft's all in on Skype for Windows and, uh, Windows phone and I think
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.720]   Skype for people who use Windows is going to be the default messaging system.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.160]   We talked about this yet earlier on Windows weekly.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   Windows.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:40.080]   The messenger app is going to be decoupled from the Skype app, but you'll still be using
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.920]   Skype messaging.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.720]   And I think, no, I think for Windows users, it's Skype.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.160]   I think for Android users, it's Hangouts for iOS users.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.160]   It's messenger.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.200]   And what's sad is that there is there siloed a little bit.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.360]   A lot, right?
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:59.560]   This is back to the old aim versus I see Q days.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:05.360]   Well, so now the Skype messaging, uh, except SMS, so I can SMS an iOS user and it'll come
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.760]   up in I mess.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.440]   Is it still called I message or is it messages?
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.440]   Messages.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.440]   Right?
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.680]   But I get the green bubble, right?
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.320]   I got the, I get the- Yeah, you get to be a green bubble.
[00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.320]   And Hangouts too will accept SMS, right?
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:21.240]   So there's some, there's some interactivity, but yeah, but if you're an iOS user, there's
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.720]   all sorts of broken bits of that that make it hard for you to message people who are
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.320]   out in the Apple ecosystem.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.480]   It's not, it's kind of messed up.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.880]   And if you, if you dare move from iOS to Android, you're screwed.
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.800]   You'll never get messages again.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.360]   Not from your iPhone owning people.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.080]   And I didn't know this, but I've been told in no uncertain terms that people discriminate
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.880]   against the greenies.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.960]   Oh, Paul Ford did that great piece about.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   And I thought, oh, that's a joke.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:56.360]   And people, everybody tells me, oh no, we don't like those green people.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.360]   No green bubbles.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.360]   No green bubbles.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:59.360]   No green bubbles.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.120]   Anyway, it's not right.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.880]   Lynne, are you, you're an Android user and iPhone user.
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.800]   I'm an Android user.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.680]   And I mean, the thing I was going to say about the Google products, like talking about Hangouts,
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:14.040]   talking about Google+, is that there's a core group of people who once they buy an Android
[00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:18.760]   phone, whatever software Google gives them, that's what they're going to use.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.960]   They're not going to look for other things.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.960]   Right.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.400]   So there's a core group of users who are not techies, right?
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.640]   Who, that's what they use.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.240]   They use the Google products that come on the Android phone.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   So.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:35.480]   But Google still kind of udies the water by providing both messages and Hangouts.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.480]   So they have a messaging app.
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.760]   In fact, Google's five users are suggest, they suggest don't use Hangouts.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.600]   This is back to the R's point about Hangouts.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.600]   That's the job.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.600]   Sorry.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.440]   Hangouts is too bloated, right?
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.240]   So messages is more lightweight and easier to use, right?
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.240]   Exactly.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.440]   I like, I'm only on Hangouts.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.440]   That's what I use.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.040]   And even on Google five, I didn't say I said I'm, no, I like Hangouts.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:05.880]   Hangouts has the real merit of being it, you can use it on the desktop and I can receive
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.960]   text messages from people who think they're texting my phone on my desktop and respond
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:10.960]   to it.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.960]   As long as I have Chrome.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.320]   And that stopped working for me for some reason I can't figure out.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.720]   There's always some little complication about it, really?
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   That's also me.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.400]   Even though I'm a Google boy, I just think Hangouts.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.200]   I tolerate Hangouts.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.640]   That is my relationship with Hangouts.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.640]   I put up with it.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.640]   What don't you like?
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:31.560]   I mean, I'm like, I guess I'm a specialist, no, I have multiple Google accounts, right?
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:36.080]   So I have to be signed into two different tabs in order to have Hangouts, the desktop
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.440]   and both, switching between the two accounts is possible in the Android app.
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.360]   It's just annoying to switch back and forth.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.720]   What's better on Android than it is on Chrome?
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.920]   Yes, it is better on Android than it is on Chrome.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:54.080]   Sometimes I some of the cutie stuff, like when you message somebody, yay or whatever,
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.320]   and the little guy comes up and dances.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.040]   I mean, you know, share your location is nice.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.680]   There are certain features I like.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.480]   There's times that it's just kind of laggy and just feels a little bit bloated.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.880]   And I feel like the video quality is good as Skype for falls.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.760]   But here's, here's, since you just, since you raised the Niagara Falls for me, Gina,
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:13.760]   multiple accounts.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.760]   Multiple accounts.
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.760]   Multiple accounts.
[00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:16.760]   That's fine.
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.760]   Yep.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:25.840]   Is, is the other news report here that the Gmail is going to allow you to have domain email?
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.200]   Does that mean I get rid of my apps account because it's really the reason I have apps
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.280]   is just to have my domain email.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:37.480]   Can I become a full-fledged Gmail regular Google blessed citizen with my own address?
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.040]   Is that what that means?
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.600]   Yeah, that's, that's, I was wondering about that.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   This, this custom domain.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.040]   So Gmail, so Gmail is going to, at some point, offer you the option to do a custom domain
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.040]   with your Gmail.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.680]   There were no other details really offered, right?
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.960]   But like, we all, we know how domains work.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.640]   You have to read, you know, you, you have to own them or register them or at least Google
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.240]   has to do so for you if they're, you know, if they're available.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.480]   So I'm not sure what this means for Google Apps users.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.680]   I mean, this is essentially what Google Apps does, but it sounds like it's going to align
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   here.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.840]   Yeah, you're forwarding the, right, map, you're right.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.920]   Invisible, easy kind of mapping in the background.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.760]   This, this domain's issue, this Google Apps issue is Google's Achilles heel.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.160]   This is, this is their, you know, a mobile me.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:26.520]   They, and you would think of all companies in the world that they would figure this thing
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.520]   out.
[00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.520]   It can't cause their own dog footing.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.720]   This is, this is the complaint of every single employee in the place.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.480]   They have multiple accounts.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.960]   How would you solve this?
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:40.880]   You would, you would tell Google my technological genius that I am.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:41.880]   Yes.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.200]   Um, uh, it's half-solved on Android.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.600]   On Android, it's pretty easy.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.440]   You can be in different accounts on different apps and it's okay.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.440]   It's very easy to switch.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   Uh, not a problem.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:55.800]   That's one and two, I would tell, how they means to tell Google that, that, that are
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   me.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.800]   Right.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.280]   And, and here's how I want to use those accounts across these various apps.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:05.160]   Not merge them, but just say these are all me.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.080]   Yeah, which would be good for Google's.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.840]   Great for Google's business to say, aha, that geeky lady named Gina is also that mommy
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.840]   with all the kid.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   Okay.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:15.840]   It's true.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.840]   Would you have a unified inbox or would you have just multiple?
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.840]   Yeah, choice.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.840]   Yeah, choice.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.640]   Yeah, I would love to have a unified inbox.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.640]   That's what I would love about Hangouts.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:27.240]   I just want to have, you know, just all comes to the same place and yeah, we have, uh, of
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.640]   course we use Google for work here at Twitch.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:38.720]   So we have a twit.tv Google domain and, um, I never, I never use my Twitter address because
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:44.840]   it's just so much easier to use my own personal Gmail address.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.040]   I would love to see you.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.040]   Right.
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.160]   I don't have the problems you do, Jeff, because you use your domain address.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.160]   I do.
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.160]   You don't, you're not at Gmail.com.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.080]   That is my everything.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:02.320]   But, but my, my Google play is all still left by my, my, my Google plus and Google photos
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.920]   are all still left in my Gmail.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.840]   They could solve this.
[00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:12.000]   The thing is, Jeff, though, like I, I use both the Gmail account and my domain, right?
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   But the thing is so many features don't come to apps users first.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Right.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   So that's always the problem.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.400]   And the people who are paid is the only company on earth that people will actually pay them
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.960]   are the second class citizens.
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.960]   Yes.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.960]   Yes.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.960]   That's right.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.960]   Slowly I turned.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.960]   I miss the disgust around.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.960]   Aren't you glad that nothing has changed?
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.960]   I did.
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.960]   It's very good.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.960]   You brought it up to you.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:35.960]   You did it.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:36.960]   I know I did.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.960]   I did.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:38.960]   I did.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.960]   I needed to be reassured.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:40.960]   I had a rough fall.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.960]   Nobody gets that reference to that.
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.960]   Do you get the reference?
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.960]   I get it.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.960]   Oh, you do.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.960]   Slowly I turn step by step.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:53.960]   Okay.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.960]   But I remember it from the three stujis, which I don't think is the original.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:05.960]   Gina Lynn, do you know what we're talking about?
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:10.800]   I, I, I assumed it was a pop culture reference that I, it's generational.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.800]   Not because I'm young or old, just because I'm sometime miss pop culture.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:16.800]   I'm gonna find it, your Leo.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:17.800]   Yeah, I'll find it.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   I'll find it.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.800]   I'm not that young, but hey.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.600]   Oh, compared to you and me, we're young.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.600]   You're young.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.560]   Compared to Jeff and me, you're young.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:30.120]   Here's the three stujis version of this.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.120]   Are you hearing me?
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.560]   Was Abbott and Costello, which one was first?
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:37.000]   Well, Abbott and Costello, you want to go to the Abbott and Costello?
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   I don't know which one was first.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.760]   I think Abbott and Costello started it, but I, but I do think the three stujis, I don't
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.680]   know who started it.
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.640]   Here's the Abbott and Costello a bit.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.640]   Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.640]   Here it is with the PDF course.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:48.640]   Hey, Abbott, send me out of here.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.640]   We'll have to hold person for a last.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.640]   What are you worrying about?
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:51.640]   I'm here.
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.640]   It's a little rat I'm afraid of.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.640]   Don't worry about a thing.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.640]   I actually love that.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.640]   You want to be here and say some 20 years.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.640]   What does he care about?
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.640]   Time.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.640]   He's on the ball and you're telling me.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.280]   I'm going to talk to him.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.280]   Don't go away.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.360]   Where's the Niagara Falls?
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.360]   It's coming.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.760]   It's been, it's been, it's been, it'll be worth it.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.160]   Look at her advise my earlier statement and say, yes, I am too young.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.160]   I did not watch Abbott and Costello.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.160]   It's a vaudeville.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.160]   It's a vaudeville.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.360]   Yeah, it's in Wikipedia.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:26.360]   What do they say?
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:32.520]   It was actually started by vaudeville comedians Harry, Step and Joey Fay.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.560]   Oh, Harry and Joey Fay, of course.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.560]   So here is the, here's.
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.560]   Mine is rather a sad story.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.560]   Would you watch?
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.560]   Oh, sir.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.560]   Here we go.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.560]   And I'll tell it to you.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.680]   You see it began many years ago when I was just a little boy.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.280]   My father gave me the benefit of a good education.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:53.080]   14 years of grade school, preparatory school, college and UCLA.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.800]   Did you go to school, sir?
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.320]   Oh, yes, sir.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.960]   You passed your examinations?
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.960]   No, sir.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.120]   But I was first on a list of those who failed.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.120]   I was childhood.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:06.240]   Well, then I met her.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.240]   She was young.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.240]   She was beautiful.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.400]   She was a little bit older than she was.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:13.160]   She was a little bit older than she was.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.160]   She was wonderful.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:18.920]   She was like a flower booming frequently in the sanding gate.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.000]   Oh, yes, I was a fool.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.880]   One day when I returned to my work is with my one, I called to.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.280]   She was gone.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:33.920]   My wife, my baby in the seven hours at Portland.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.160]   Oh, is it gone?
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.160]   Oh my God.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.160]   All right, I'm stopping now.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.160]   Let's do the.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.720]   There's another one on YouTube.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.320]   Let's do the I love Lucy version.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.320]   I think that that's.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.040]   But the point is this is an old vaud vaud vaud, right?
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   It goes way, way back.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.840]   Just say the words Niagara Falls.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.120]   The guy goes wacky.
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.120]   Niagara Falls slowly.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.520]   I turned step by step.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.320]   So if you say Google accounts, I turned.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.680]   I stepped.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.680]   I stepped.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.680]   Multiple accounts.
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.680]   All right.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.680]   Wow.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.440]   That was a long way to go.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.120]   Now we need the opposite of that.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.720]   We need a safe word for when when.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:12.720]   Yeah, safe word.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:16.600]   Like what's the like, you know, I don't know Michigan or something.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.600]   Michigan.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.920]   Ah, Michigan.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.920]   How about this?
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.920]   Let's let's try this.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.880]   See what see what reaction Jeff has to this.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.880]   Nets.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.880]   Politic.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.560]   Slowly I turn.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.880]   So a Nets.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.360]   Politic is an independent news source in Germany.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:34.560]   Is that correct?
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:41.240]   They reported some stuff about what the prosecutors were doing in terms of spying in NSA.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.920]   Prosecutors in Germany was investigating them for treason.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.720]   And I mean the word treason, which has not happened there in 50 years.
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:56.040]   And huge, huge, fewer about the same prosecutors who by the way just declined to prosecute the
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:01.160]   US and UK spy agencies who were spying on Angie's smartphone.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.880]   Now smart phone.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.960]   So much, much fewer about it.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.520]   And then they kind of backed off, but it was only temporary.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.680]   We still didn't know where it was going to go.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.680]   We're still investigating.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.920]   Don't know.
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:21.480]   And then the basically the justice minister attempted to fire to demand the resignation
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.440]   of the prosecutor, the state's attorney who done this.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.120]   Prosecutors now saying no, you're meddling in the case.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.800]   And this is a constitutional crisis all around free press.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.800]   What?
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.000]   It's a constitutional crisis now.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.680]   Well, it's heading that way.
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:41.040]   And so Jake Applebaum sent out a tweet and a bat signal.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:46.280]   And if you go to netspolitik.us, there's a letter that are signed by many and you can
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.720]   sign it to that protests this and demands this be stopped in some matter of a free press
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.960]   and free speech.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.040]   So it's just our little German moment for the day.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:55.240]   It's over now.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.240]   But wow.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.240]   That was that.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:59.240]   Wow.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.240]   Wow.
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:01.800]   I like Jacob.
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.800]   He's he's a guy.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:03.800]   Oh, he's the greatest.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.640]   He will never see him in America again.
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   But no, I can't come back.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.640]   Wow.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:10.640]   All right.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:11.640]   I'll add my name to that.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.680]   I don't even understand what's going on, but there's 654 of us and I must it must be
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   right.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.520]   Jeff, did you add your name to that?
[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.160]   I did indeed add my name and I put my blog because the first thing that good enough for
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.120]   me.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.560]   My affiliation.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.360]   I'm an American.
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.920]   There.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   Okay.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.920]   See if we can get Donald Trump to sign.
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.560]   By the way, we're all looking forward to tomorrow night.
[00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:42.360]   I bet you the streets will be empty tomorrow evening during the Republican debate with
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.360]   what happened.
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.520]   How many hundreds of candidates are there in this debate?
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.680]   When is Stewart's last night?
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:48.760]   Is it tonight or tomorrow night?
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.760]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:51.160]   It is this week is tomorrow night.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.160]   Okay.
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.240]   Yeah, I believe tomorrow night's last night.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.840]   So he might wait till after the debate to do his show.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.680]   But it's the greatest material he could have in his career.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.680]   I know, right?
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.680]   He'll be recorded.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.920]   Yeah, it should be fun.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.320]   It's going to be fun.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:10.800]   Back to Google+, Janetan Zungar says, we're not dead yet.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   He's great.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.360]   He's the guy who built it, right?
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:16.800]   Yeah, chief architect.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.200]   And he's the current chief architect, right?
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.920]   I mean, it's not to discount, but you know, I thought one of the interesting things about
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.640]   Thomas's piece is he said, you know, for so long, there were all these Google employees.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:28.640]   It's so enthusiastically.
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:29.640]   Yes.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.960]   And I'd interact with them every day and they did these great photo walks.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:34.880]   And then all of a sudden it stopped.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:36.120]   And you know why it stopped?
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.680]   Because it was no longer their job, right?
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.080]   And that's telling.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.720]   You know, so okay, carry on.
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.680]   So he's the chief architect.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.920]   Well, I mean, obviously he's got it.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.080]   So this is the problem, Bradley has a vested interest in this.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.640]   Janetan has a vested interest in this, but the users themselves.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:57.840]   And when you see somebody like Thomas Hawks say, where are all the
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.840]   disturbing part?
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.440]   Where are the Google stories in the show before?
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.800]   I've told the story in the show before many, many years ago, my daughter joined a safe
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.640]   community of American girl fans.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:11.080]   And then Mattel just one day just killed it, crushing little girls across the country who
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.080]   lost their friends.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.080]   It was their only because it was anonymous.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:15.400]   It was the only way that the friends they lost friends.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.560]   When you start a platform for a community, you have a responsibility to the community
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.160]   that grows.
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.920]   It's like saying, I'm Mr. Levitt.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:23.920]   I'm going to build this whole town.
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:24.920]   I'm not bored with that.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.520]   I think I'll tear down all those homes.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:28.320]   But that's the internet.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:33.160]   Break, move fast to break things.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.440]   Look at all the initiatives which nobody brings up that Facebook is abandoned, partly
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.320]   because Facebook abandoned them because nobody invested in them.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:45.800]   There was nobody to complain when they abandoned them.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.800]   Facebook does this work.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.800]   What's the responsibility?
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.320]   I feel like the responsibility, I agree with you, there is a responsibility.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:57.000]   But I feel like the responsibility is to give enough notice so that folks can find a place
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   to go.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.680]   If I'm hosting a party at my home and I say, all right, everybody out, people can kind
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:07.000]   of get together and decide, okay, let's go meet down at the bar, or let's move to the
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.800]   so-and-so's house, right, and give folks the time to do it.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:16.680]   But if I am hosting the party at my house and I'm done, it's a delicate balance.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:22.640]   For a social network, for girls, that's anonymous, I feel terrible about that.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.800]   It was awful.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:26.560]   It was really awful.
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.480]   Luckily she had violated the rules enough that she managed to make a connection to one
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:33.600]   friend, which you're not supposed to be able to do, and stayed with one friend.
[00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:38.680]   But you know, Gina, I certainly take your point that it's my computers, it's my effort,
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.120]   it's my investment, Jesus is not working on this on the business.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.320]   I absolutely understand it, completely understand that.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.360]   But at some point you have to say that a community is not, this is the real question.
[00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.480]   When is the community owned by the community not by the platform?
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.960]   If you're making a platform, a true platform, my argument is that one, right?
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:01.040]   That a true platform is that in which people find a use for what you created that you
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:06.560]   couldn't have imagined, and they take it over and use it for their purposes.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.480]   When that happens, you succeeded, you hit that magical moment of having a platform,
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:15.760]   but it also means that you now have a responsibility to those people who brought this value to
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.760]   you.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:21.440]   I learned that in a very small way when I decided to kill the chat room.
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.320]   And I heard from them and I realized, oh, this is not mine to kill.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.320]   What am I thinking?
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.320]   Right.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.880]   But I mean, you know, there's still a business.
[00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.800]   Whoops, where's my head?
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   You're sinking.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.360]   It's still a bus.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.360]   She's going away.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.360]   Sorry.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.400]   Oh, there's still a business.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.240]   You know, I mean, think about ning.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.880]   Think about all those communities that people made on ning, right?
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.880]   Still there.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.840]   I mean, things still there.
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.840]   No.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.840]   How is it there?
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.640]   Why didn't they give you no?
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.720]   I think I bought by glam slash mode.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.000]   I thought I thought you could still use all the ninjas.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.760]   No, I don't think so.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.560]   Because I remember you being able to get all your data.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.560]   Yeah, you can.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.560]   It says you can.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.560]   There you can.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.560]   Oh, you can.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.560]   Oh, really?
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.920]   It's now ning known media, ning node media.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.800]   Not a very solicitous name.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.800]   Ning node media.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.800]   Load load.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.480]   Well, I just talked to you.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:24.400]   Right before the show, I talked to some Aurora and he used ning as the platform to
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.960]   build a top and build mode media.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:31.080]   And on mode media, he just put out 100 years of women's fashion, 100 years of men's fashion,
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.920]   100 years of women's fashion, a two minute video.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:39.960]   He got it to a million views in six days and it's down to two million views in six weeks.
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:43.280]   He's built this huge platform and he used ning as the basis, but ning still sits there.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.240]   This is a really interesting point.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:50.000]   Had Google plus been not been owned by Google, it would have been a ning.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   It would have.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.640]   It would be kind of a little corner of the net that persists, perhaps as long as somebody's
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.440]   willing to spend money on it.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:59.800]   But because it's part of Google, it's a much bigger deal, right?
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.800]   Yes.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.160]   And what happens to it is a much bigger deal.
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.160]   Right.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:10.200]   But I mean, Jeff, I see that it's still here, but I remember not being able to access communities
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.200]   I had built.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.360]   I had a community there and I was told to get it back.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.520]   Oh, okay.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:20.760]   I was told I could, you know, download all my data if I wanted.
[00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:25.280]   I think maybe now maybe that was before the purchase was probably before the purchase.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.280]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.280]   That's why I thought it wasn't.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.280]   I didn't know it was purchase.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.280]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.280]   It just shows you.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.640]   Oh, so you could get it back after you.
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.640]   I don't know.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.480]   I don't know.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.280]   So that raises the interesting question.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:47.160]   If somebody were to buy Twitter, if Google were to buy Twitter, what could could they even
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.160]   keep it alive?
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.080]   You just throw in money and I mean, do you rename it?
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.080]   No, you can't.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.320]   You do the picture of Eve Williams with Larry Page.
[00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:59.720]   I've heard whose story had it was, which is the pictures that everything happens.
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:00.720]   Just come up.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.520]   Well, Google looked at him a couple of years ago, right?
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:03.720]   Well, it happened with Blogger.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.720]   Blogger?
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.720]   I was gonna say, yeah.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:07.720]   Eve has sold Google before.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.720]   Oh, that's right.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.040]   He knows what that's about, right?
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.960]   I don't even know if this ever owned Twitter.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:13.960]   I mean, he owned the blog.
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:14.960]   He owned the blog.
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:15.960]   He's on the floor.
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.960]   Is he?
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.960]   It's bigger.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.760]   He's probably publicly held at this point and could easily be hostile taken over because
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.600]   of its value is so low.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.840]   All Google has to do is offer $21 billion for it.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.680]   Would Facebook take it over and just let it be what it is?
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.840]   Facebook doesn't need it, right?
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.400]   No, it doesn't.
[00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:36.400]   Google, you could argue, needs the social signals.
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:40.920]   They are currently buying them from Twitter, but maybe Twitter might change its tune or
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.800]   if somebody else buys Twitter, they'd cut off Google.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.600]   That's the real threat, right?
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.200]   What's going to happen?
[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.680]   Microsoft will buy it and everything else.
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.680]   Not know what the hell to do with it.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.440]   Yeah, I could see Microsoft buying it.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.440]   Oh, that's true.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.880]   And well, look, they shouldn't change the name.
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.680]   They should let it be, right?
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.680]   Give it the backend.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.360]   Your best, your best, that'd be your best option, right?
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:05.280]   Is to not even let anybody know you bought it as much as you could.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.280]   Try.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.280]   Just more, you know.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.280]   I've been to see here.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.280]   Move it along.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.280]   Nothing to see here.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.280]   Keep Twitter.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.280]   Let Twitter be Twitter.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.280]   Verizon.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.280]   Oh, God.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.520]   Well, oh, what about Yahoo?
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:21.520]   What if Yahoo bought it?
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.120]   See, I don't have any money.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:25.760]   What is Yahoo's cash position?
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:30.040]   Well, they've got all the holdings in that other company.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.640]   No, no, they sold off that.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.000]   They're making that a subs of Alibaba.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   They sold.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   Was it Alibaba?
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   They sold off.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.640]   They're turning that into a, you know, see, because it was the AOL thing.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.720]   And mobile phones and streams.
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.160]   Everybody needs a stream now.
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:52.000]   That's where, that, that to me is the real battle now.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.360]   It's all about streams, streams of attention.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:59.080]   Well, I think it's legit if you're a search engine that you need those signals somehow.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.320]   You need to get those signals in.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.320]   Let me just say.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.320]   You're an ad company.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.320]   You need them.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.320]   Right.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.320]   Well, who's an ad company that we, we know?
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:11.560]   Can you imagine the uproar of Twitter was taken, if there was a hostile takeover or Twitter,
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:12.560]   that would be amazing.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.560]   Well, it'd be good for us.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.560]   Fascinating.
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:17.760]   Fascinating to watch.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.360]   I don't know where I find the cash position on this.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.720]   I can't figure it out.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:28.840]   I'm not exactly a big stock investor.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:32.800]   Finan, financials, income statement.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.360]   Anyone who did buy Twitter, if they're smart at all, they would leave it be.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:40.920]   They would leave the name and most users would have no idea.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.920]   Balance sheet.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.920]   Let's see.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.520]   That's where the cash will be.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.520]   Cash.
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.520]   Yeah, it was $2 billion.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:48.120]   They ain't got a name.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.840]   They won't be buying Twitter any time.
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:51.840]   What's Twitter?
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.840]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:53.840]   That's in thousands.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.280]   So that would be, yeah, $2 billion, $2.6 billion.
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.280]   This is why not really a zeros throw.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:01.840]   There's zeros in there.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.200]   Google's got something like 80 billion cash so that that Twitter they could actually buy
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   in cash.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.520]   What's Twitter's current market under 20?
[00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.240]   16 or something.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.480]   I don't know what it's current.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.560]   It's gone down quite a bit.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:17.560]   Stock's not doing well.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:26.000]   Let's see how they're doing.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.800]   Market cap, $18.79 billion and going down.
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:34.640]   But that means a German media company could actually spray or couldn't buy them.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.640]   Well maybe they could.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:39.360]   You see, the most credible thing would be to come to the shareholders with this cash
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.040]   offer that's over the current value of the stock.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:45.320]   Give them a premium of $5 or whatever.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.680]   No shareholder in their right mind would refuse it.
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.720]   And that's a hostile thing and then you're done.
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:55.560]   It's a little harder if you're offering stock and actual spring.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.560]   Apple could buy them.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.560]   I don't know what Apple would do with them.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.160]   I don't think Apple wants them.
[00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:01.160]   Hmm.
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.160]   That's interesting.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.680]   This is the picture you were talking about that goes along with this article from Business
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:07.680]   Insider.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:14.680]   Well, that's got a little bit of great guys going out there.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:15.680]   You see, I'm on the abs face.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:19.120]   He's kind of thinking of looking a little bit of great guys going out there.
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.120]   Get your hand.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:22.400]   Where's your hand going, Larry?
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.680]   Get your hand off me.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:25.880]   Wow.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:27.360]   That's gridded teeth.
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.360]   Yikes.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.360]   Yikes.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.840]   That's just a bad moment.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:33.760]   Yeah, I mean, that's just a little bit of a smile.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.360]   But it does illustrate the article.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:40.760]   Well, the article's title by J.A.A.R.O. Google CEO reportedly does not give an F, probably
[00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:45.880]   stands for FIG about Twitter.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:49.120]   Is this based on fact or just J.A.J.'s...
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:54.200]   It's what's his name from the information and the argument is, well, he's one of the
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.800]   best tech reporters on Earth, so he must be role.
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.600]   Amira Efrodi said it.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.600]   Okay.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   I'm here to say.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.440]   He said it in a tweet.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.840]   Well, it's amazing.
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:07.520]   Yeah, you can turn that into a whole business and a article.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.320]   Yes, that's it.
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:12.800]   That's the entire premise of the article that and I got a great picture.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.920]   It's all thanks.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:17.000]   That's journalism, kids.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.920]   It is now journalism.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:19.920]   Nowadays.
[00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.920]   One oh one.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:21.920]   Let's take a break.
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:22.920]   We're having fun.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.920]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.920]   Gina Trepani is back.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:30.760]   Lindy Johnson joining us as we talk about the world of Google and Twitter and social media
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:36.080]   and there is plenty more to talk about, but first a word from Harry's.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.080]   You like a clean shave?
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.200]   Who doesn't?
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.000]   And that's where I get my clean shave each and every morning.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   Harry's dot com.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.280]   Harry's is a great story.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:48.120]   It's how, you know, another one of those internet disruption stories where a guy came along
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:52.800]   and said, "Why am I paying $4 a blade for my Gillette Fusions and why are they locked
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.640]   up at the drug store?"
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.240]   And they decided, "We could do a better job."
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.120]   And charge less, they did a little research, raised some capital and said, "You know,
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:05.840]   the best thing to do with this would be to buy the company that makes the blades."
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.000]   Turns out there are really two companies in the world that make great razor blades.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   They're both in Germany.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.480]   Harry's bought one of them.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:16.320]   So now they can specify to the company, they say, "We want them to be engineered for
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:21.480]   performance, for sharpness, and because they're selling direct from the factory, they can
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.080]   cut the price in half."
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.600]   Literally in half.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:28.360]   I get Harry's blades by mail directly from Harry's.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.520]   You start with a kit because of course you need a handle to match the blades.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:35.320]   Everybody's got some proprietary blade solutions.
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:39.000]   But these handles are great and they're very affordable, so it makes it easy.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.040]   For instance, this is the Truman kit.
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:42.040]   It's $15.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.440]   I'll tell you how I can get it for less.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.880]   It includes the handle.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.040]   Three blades.
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:53.080]   They never talk about this, but I love these travel covers because it keeps you from cutting.
[00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:58.840]   You can put this in your shaving kit and you don't cut yourself.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.840]   And look at that.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:00.840]   I'm like doorbells ringing.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:04.960]   I'm sorry, I have to turn that on.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:07.160]   Everything now in my life rings at me.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.480]   You also get your choice.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.160]   These are not sample size.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:13.760]   This is a full size between the foaming shave gel or the cream.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.360]   This is all for $15.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.240]   By the way, I love both the cream and foaming shave gel.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:24.760]   If you're one of those folks who uses Gillette Edge and you like that kind of gel, this
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.760]   is great.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.880]   It really smells good and gives you a very smooth shave.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:30.920]   I use the cream at home.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:31.920]   I love that.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:36.840]   That just comes in a little tube and smells good and conditions your skin.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:40.200]   This is all for a fraction of the price of what you'd pay at a drugstore.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.200]   Now what do I do?
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:46.480]   I get the gel on my fingers here.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.480]   Shave somebody.
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:48.480]   I should just shave.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:50.360]   All right, let me just put it on.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:52.000]   That'll help.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.920]   And then, oh, it smells good though.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:01.520]   And then you subscribe and you get the blades in the mail.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.520]   You're going to love it.
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:03.520]   Now let's take five bucks off.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:09.480]   This is $10 when you use our offer code TWIG at harries.com.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.600]   The smoothest shave you've ever had.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.440]   You're going to love it.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:20.720]   Raise.com spend less on your shave means more for summer fun.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.720]   Aries.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:26.920]   I don't know why I'm shaving.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:31.640]   When you commit to squirting the stuff on your hands, then you got to do something.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.640]   I'm all in.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:35.680]   But I commit, I commit.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.520]   You've reminded me I got to order more blades.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:40.080]   Well, if you subscribe, you won't have to ever think about it.
[00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:41.680]   It just needs to arrive.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.400]   That's what I do.
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:48.120]   We had an error at the blade factory.
[00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.760]   And both Lisa and I subscribed without each other's knowledge.
[00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:53.160]   So now we have lots of blades.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.920]   You know what's good about-- first of all, they're not very expensive.
[00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:58.200]   And what's great about that is you change the blade more often, which means you get
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.200]   a better shave.
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:00.200]   Yes.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:04.040]   Because I think that when the blades cost eight bucks or whatever, there's a real temptation
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:06.200]   to never change your blade.
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:07.960]   With harries, I change it at least every week.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:08.960]   And I love it.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.960]   I really do.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:10.960]   Harries.com.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:14.640]   You see offer code Twig, by the way, at Checkout to save five bucks.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.480]   And when you do that, you'll be letting Harries know you listened to Twig.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.640]   And that's a good thing.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.240]   Let's talk phones.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:27.400]   You were at-- I really-- truth in advertising.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:34.520]   You went to the OnePlus event, Jeff Jarvis, but you only stood in line.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.520]   Yes.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.080]   There was no one I signed up.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.080]   I was fishing.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.080]   It was a hot day.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.400]   We went and fated in front of us.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.400]   Oh, God.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.040]   There were people there since seven o'clock the night before the first, like, six people
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.840]   got a really nice OnePlus backpack.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.400]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.080]   And the first, I think, 50 people got a bag with an invite in it.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.640]   And so the presumption was that nobody after that was going to get an invite.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.640]   Oh.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:58.800]   Apparently, I think everybody did get an invite.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.800]   You got a couple.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.080]   Well, I went and talked to the founder.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.080]   Oh.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.520]   But I had to go to work.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:05.520]   I went and did a photo call.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.400]   It came back, so it was like, put some pictures up.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:09.600]   And people were in great mood, and they were happy.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.520]   And I talked to them, and he was really quite charming.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:14.000]   He was the guy who was in the video.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.640]   He was saying to him something forgetting, sorry.
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.880]   But it was in the Google cardboard video.
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:21.520]   And was charmed by this.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:25.160]   You know, he said that the only applicants lines, and they were happy to add lines.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:29.560]   They did at the same time, like, six cities around the world.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.120]   And people were happy, and they were waiting just to see the phone.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.120]   That was it.
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.760]   It was celebrity phone.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:35.760]   And I thought it was nice.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.440]   It was not overdone and hype.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.440]   It was charming.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.040]   I'm glad they made the right specs, and I don't care if it doesn't have NFC.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.720]   They make the point on that.
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.160]   And I think it might not be a bad point.
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.240]   Nobody's yet really using NFC for payments.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:51.320]   That's a year or two out.
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:53.040]   By then they said you'll have a new phone.
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:54.040]   Oh, a new phone.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.040]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.000]   But I have to say, I very rarely use touch to pay.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.600]   And if I do, I use it because I'm like, oh, I've got to use this Apple Watch for something.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:09.320]   I'm really glad on USB-C, the only problem is there's no quick charge.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.240]   That to me is a little surprising.
[00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:17.400]   Yeah, it's USB-C, but it's a Snapdragon 810 processor, which isn't compatible with USB-3.1
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   spec.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.400]   Only 2.0 and 3.0.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:22.840]   So you won't get the high speed USB connection.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:26.240]   So it's USB-C connector, but it's not--
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.640]   But you could do fast charging.
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:29.960]   In fact, USB-C's rated up to 100 watts.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:34.440]   They could slam electrons into this phone, but they just have decided not to.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:36.200]   Nor do they have wireless charging.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.200]   Yeah, just the other ones that either--
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:41.800]   On the other hand, remember, this is roughly the same screen that they had last year, so
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:46.080]   they're not going Quad HD anymore, like some of these other guys.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.000]   So and the last one got great battery life.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   So this may be moot.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.240]   I mean, if you can get through the day, you get through the day, you don't need to worry
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.240]   about it.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:53.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.200]   So I'm very, very tempted.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.880]   And sorry, folks, I don't have any more invites.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:02.280]   You gave them to me and Jason, that was very kind of you.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.160]   I was just about to ask for that.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.160]   Sorry about that.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.240]   Though I think once you buy Leo, you get an invite.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.960]   I will invite you.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:12.920]   Absolutely, Lin, as soon as I get an invite.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.920]   Sounds great.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.120]   And Gina, too, if you want one, because I think Gina is using the OnePlus and is ready
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:19.160]   for the OnePlus 2, right?
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.840]   I am ready for the OnePlus 2.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:26.200]   So the question is, Gina, the question I'm trying to figure out, as I said earlier, is
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:32.040]   OnePlus 2 Moto X, similar price.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.040]   Not sure what to think.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:42.160]   I'll be honest, I'm truly looking forward to the Nexus, because I love the OnePlus 1.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:47.920]   The issue was I waited so long for Lollipop, and I just want to be in the Nexus track so
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.480]   I get updates right away.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.840]   The Moto X looked really cool.
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.880]   And I was saying to Leo and PreShow, I had the Moto G in my cart.
[00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:58.320]   I stopped myself from the Moto G just because I felt like it might be too underpowered
[00:56:58.320 --> 00:57:01.320]   for me, not for post users, just for me.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:03.040]   And the Moto X looks really good, but I don't know.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.440]   I feel like there's a Nexus on the horizon, and I just want to hold on and wait for that.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:09.560]   But Gina, forever, as an Android user.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.680]   But Gina, are you waiting for the Nexus 6?
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.280]   Are you waiting for the new Nexus 5?
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:17.320]   I'm waiting for the Nexus 4.
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:21.040]   I don't even-- yeah, I don't know what the Nexus is.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.800]   I'm betting-- and I don't know, actually, you guys maybe at more of the date than I
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:25.800]   am on this.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:29.280]   I'm assuming that there's going to be a new Nexus phone in time for the holidays.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.280]   I don't know, though.
[00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.280]   There's not been any--
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:32.280]   I don't know.
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:33.280]   We haven't heard any rumors.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:39.240]   I'm basing this idea solely on the fact that it's a holiday season, and it's been a
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.240]   while since it's been a new device.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.240]   I don't know.
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.240]   I could be wrong.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.240]   So Lyn's not joking.
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:45.760]   There is a rumor that there's going to be a Nexus 5.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:46.760]   Right.
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:47.760]   There's going to be two.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:51.280]   There's a rumor that there's two, which has never really happened before.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.200]   Not a larger one or a smaller one.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.880]   This 5 would refer more to the size than-- now, Ef is coming up in September, about a month
[00:57:57.880 --> 00:57:59.440]   from now.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:02.040]   So that's the rumor that they'll announce it in a month.
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:03.240]   So that's what feels you--
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.200]   So it feels you're in Nexus 5.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.200]   A new Nexus 5.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:09.800]   And I imagine if they announce a new Nexus 5, if there are two, they'll announce them
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:10.800]   both at the same time.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.360]   Why would they spread that out?
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:16.880]   Yeah, the rumor says one by Huawei, which would be the larger one, which would be interesting.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:17.880]   That's a bad one.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.680]   And then one by LG, which would be the new Nexus 5.
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:24.520]   And I mean, yes, there is the original Nexus 5.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:25.520]   Right.
[00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:30.080]   And Nexus 5, by all accounts, is one of the most popular Nexus devices, still very used
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.080]   crappy camera.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:37.880]   I mean, you could get some good results with the camera with HDR on the crappy camera.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:38.880]   Pretty bad.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.800]   Nowadays, I think camera is so important.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:41.800]   You've got a good camera.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:42.800]   Yes, I agree.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:44.680]   One plus two will have a good camera.
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:45.680]   Actually so will the Motorola.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:46.680]   So will the G.
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:50.480]   The G is the same camera as the 6 without--
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:53.000]   Optical image stabilization.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.560]   And this is, I think, a pretty good camera.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.560]   I've been happy.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:56.560]   How about you, Jeff?
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.560]   You're happy with this Nexus 6 camera.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:59.320]   Yeah, I think it's pretty good.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:05.240]   It's not as good as this S6 or the LG 4 or the iPhone, but it's right up there.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:10.800]   I think it would be very surprising if Google released M officially and didn't have a phone
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.200]   to launch it with.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:14.040]   That's kind of the way it is now.
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.240]   And that's in a couple of months.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:20.000]   So remember a couple of things.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.960]   The one plus now using oxygen is a pretty pure version, almost as pure as the Motorola
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.480]   version of Android.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.480]   So I would expect--
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:28.480]   That's pretty solid.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:33.160]   The one plus, the Motorola is both to get updated pretty, almost as quickly as an Nexus
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:34.160]   device.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.120]   So I don't know if you'll be--
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:39.560]   But then too far behind the curve on that.
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:45.040]   But of course, it all pales to the iPhone and the next OS 9.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.040]   And there was a preview of that show.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:47.520]   Did you see the video there on the--
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:50.840]   All hail to the great iPhone in the sky.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:51.840]   The Dutch Rightsters.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:52.840]   You see the--
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:53.840]   Oh, this one.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:54.840]   Let's play it.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.520]   This is to die for.
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:57.520]   Do you have it?
[00:59:57.520 --> 01:00:00.320]   Did you do this yesterday in all about Android?
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.320]   You know what?
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:07.000]   I kept it out only because I feared that people would watch it and think we were being too
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.520]   trollish with it.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.520]   Oh.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.520]   It's funny.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:11.520]   Let's see here.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:12.920]   Is this the German YouTube?
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:13.920]   No, that's different.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:14.920]   Where did you put this?
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:15.920]   It's right under my--
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.920]   Here it is.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:17.920]   I have it.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:18.920]   It's in the--
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.920]   It's the CNET story, right?
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920]   Here it is.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:23.920]   So what--
[01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:24.920]   There it is.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.920]   Is it all right to say what's going on?
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.920]   Yeah, yeah, it is.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:32.520]   So they took an iPhone, they put Android on it, and they told iPhone fans that it was
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.600]   iOS 9.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.200]   And so you can guess the hilarity that ensued.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:41.600]   We'll have to-- for those on audio, we'll have to read the subtitles.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.600]   That's in German.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:43.600]   Yeah, it's pretty much in German.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:44.600]   It's entirely.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.600]   It's in Dutch.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:46.600]   Not all.
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:47.600]   There's some English ones.
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:48.600]   Dutch is the strangest language.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.600]   I love it.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.600]   It's beautiful.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.600]   It's kind of-- it sounds like an alien language to me.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.600]   It's a lot of--
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.600]   The newspaper is the newspaper-- the telech.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.600]   The state of the world.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.240]   That was really-- that was really disappointing.
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.000]   Apparently, I clicked on the ad.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   And that was my mistake.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   Oh, there we go.
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.800]   I clicked on the ad instead of-- and no wonder it was all ad.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:13.800]   OK, that's good.
[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:14.800]   Here we go.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.680]   Let's start over again.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:17.680]   This is--
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.680]   It is not.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:19.680]   It is not.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:22.440]   The couple of weeks Apple will be releasing iOS 9.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.080]   This update will include a lot of new functions, a couple of which have been available in Android
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.480]   for years.
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.880]   Still many people believe iOS is better than Android.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.880]   But what happens when we show people Android?
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.360]   Open iPhone and check on the iPhone.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.720]   And then tell them it's iOS 9.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.200]   This is like J. Leto.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.520]   Anybody will fall for anything.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:41.520]   I know they will.
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:42.520]   I love them.
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:43.520]   It's a good version.
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.200]   It takes some getting used to.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.200]   I like that thing with the music a lot.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.120]   It looks completely different, doesn't it?
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.080]   It looks easier.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.080]   Nice icons for the apps.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.760]   I like it a lot.
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:59.180]   When you're on a website, you can still control your music with a widget.
[01:01:59.180 --> 01:02:05.120]   When you go on your music and you come off it, that's a great little thing.
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.920]   Shaky things.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:07.920]   Why is this better than Android?
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.920]   I don't know.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:09.920]   Apple's just chill.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.880]   I think it looks a little smoother.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.880]   It's prettier.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.880]   It's more.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.520]   It's better for me.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.520]   It's just because it's a lot faster and smoother.
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.720]   I think it looks a lot like Android.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:20.720]   We've got this exactly.
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:21.720]   Yeah, my opinion.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.720]   It does look better and I would recommend to get it.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.920]   If I could get one on iPhone for myself, I would.
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.040]   I just think Apple's always better.
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:29.040]   I do think it looks better.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.800]   I also prefer the way the apps look, but I still remain a Samsung fanboy.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.760]   That's what Android guy didn't get.
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.760]   Poor guy.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.280]   Well, he's got the Samsung skin.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.280]   He doesn't.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.600]   How does iOS 9 compare to iOS 8?
[01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:43.640]   Every time there's a new update it takes some getting used to, but it's always better.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:46.360]   Well, you definitely have a bit more few things.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.080]   I think the rebooting thing is great.
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.080]   Is a great invention.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.120]   It's an improvement, of course.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.080]   So how do they get this on an iPhone?
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:02:55.080]   I don't know.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.080]   That's kind of cool, too.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.160]   Maybe it's one of those Chinese knockoffs.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:04.120]   Things you can just pinch on your screen to turn the power off.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.120]   All in all, it does look better.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.280]   I feel like this isn't, you know.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.240]   Well, I thought it was amused.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.240]   It's amusing.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:13.400]   I like Pawning Apple fan.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.600]   Inclusion, it doesn't matter what Apple releases because people are going to think it's pretty
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.600]   or bigger and better than the competition no matter what.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:24.400]   And to all Apple users, don't forget to update soon to Android.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:27.760]   Okay, that's fine.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:28.760]   It's a good bit.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.760]   It was a good bit.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:37.040]   I feel bad for people when they get ambushed on the street.
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.440]   I know it's like an old version.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.440]   They call.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:40.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:43.440]   Let's see.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:47.480]   You want to keep it on updates?
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.480]   Did you see the news that hit today?
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.480]   No.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.440]   As far as updates are concerned, basically Google announced that they're going to be
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:01.040]   providing monthly OTA over the air security updates for all their Nexus devices down to
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.000]   the four to three years.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.840]   But they can do it from launch.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.840]   They should do it forever if it's security.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:14.440]   Samsung is also, well Samsung says they're also going to be delivering monthly OTA over
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.440]   the air security updates.
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.760]   This is because of the stage fright vulnerability.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:22.200]   Everybody's up in arms about about almost a billion Android devices are vulnerable to
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.400]   it and a small fraction of those are up to date and will get or will get updated mainly
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:33.200]   because they're by manufacturers who don't care or carriers who don't care or both.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.800]   I mean my Samsung Galaxy S6 was fixed almost immediately.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.480]   All Nexus devices have been fixed.
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.440]   It's a nasty bug.
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:46.280]   Your phone can be taken over by somebody sending you a MMS message even if you don't
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.040]   open it, even before you even know it came.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:51.840]   So it's a really nasty bug.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.600]   I don't know of anybody who's been bit by it yet although they do say I think it's in
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.600]   the wild now.
[01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:01.760]   There certainly will be in the wild once we see the proof of concept code which will
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:06.440]   come out at Black Hat or DEF CON this week.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:07.880]   So that's what Google's trying to respond to.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.200]   And as you know, and we've talked about this, Gina's talked about this.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:13.440]   One of the things Google's doing to try to fix this is move more and more of the operating
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:20.200]   system out of the core AOSP code and into apps which can be updated or modules which
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.760]   can be updated on the Play Store.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:25.840]   So that's why your web services now get mod, even though you never see an app for web services,
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.600]   it gets updated from the Play Store.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.280]   That means Google can push out an update.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.600]   They can't right now, it's out of their hands.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.320]   Yeah, that update pipeline.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:38.360]   I mean, the thing about Google Chrome that always stuck with me was that like the first
[01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:41.760]   thing that they built for Google Chrome was the updater.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.840]   Like before they started building it.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:47.000]   And it was this idea that they could just push updates because Firefox had that thing
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.160]   where you had to restart it.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.160]   It was real pain update.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:54.800]   So Google knows how important it is to be able to push updates aggressively to everyone.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.800]   And yeah, so that this Android issue, that stage fright and vulnerability, man.
[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.360]   It's the name alone.
[01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:02.640]   It's worthy of the name.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.040]   Yeah, even though Google named it, it's Google.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:08.880]   It's a Google name for that video.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.040]   Yeah, you didn't really have to go far.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:12.840]   You should have chose something a little bit.
[01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:15.040]   I feel like that was the developer, not a marketer.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.040]   Yeah, all right.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.880]   Don't worry about this vulnerability.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.960]   You probably won't get hit with this.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:25.680]   And really, when people say, oh, well, you see the iPhones more secure, what they don't
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.280]   understand is the reason this is a problem in the Android world is because it's an open
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.280]   source, freely distributed operating system.
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:35.560]   And anybody can use AOSP.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.120]   And so it makes it difficult to update because it's being used by so many people in so many
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.200]   different ways.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.440]   That's a boon as well as a security issue.
[01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.320]   Apple, of course, can keep it secure because they control it entirely.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:49.440]   They control what updates go out when to which phones.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:56.760]   And so a closed system is going to be a more secure system in that respect.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.200]   But you give up so much.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:02.960]   I mean, I think the openness of AOSP really is to be praised.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.880]   Is there something architecturally that Google should have done differently?
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.360]   I don't think you can.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.400]   If you're going to open source it, in other words, say anybody could take this code and
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.120]   make a phone with it, which they do.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:19.440]   Then you can't ensure that it will get updated ever again because what you have is a lot
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:25.520]   of handset makers making $25 phones in developing in the developing world who there's no way
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.720]   or no desired updated.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.800]   But that has put those phones in people's hands.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:37.960]   You don't see iPhones in those people's hands because they can't afford them.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:42.720]   There's a lot of good stuff in there though.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:50.280]   Somebody's pointing out that address space randomization is in there, which according
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:56.840]   to Android Central, putting ASLR means that 90% of phones are protected from the issue.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:01.960]   You need to know if you're going to take advantage of a vulnerability like stage fright, you
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:07.240]   need to be able to jump into, need to be able to put malicious code memory and jump to it.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:11.360]   But when you randomize address space, it makes it much more difficult.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:16.920]   So Alan Ludwig, who's a Google engineer told NPR, currently 90% of Android devices have
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:22.720]   a technology called ASLR enabled that protects users from the issue.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:26.560]   So that's good news.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:32.840]   That was ASLR was enabled in the default Linux kernel in 2005 and was added to Android with
[01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.840]   version four.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.200]   See, that's the problem.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.200]   So that's good.
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.400]   That means four and five are safe.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:43.800]   But the big difference from 900, 900 devices are overall.
[01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:48.200]   But all these people running gingerbread phones, you know what, you might be in trouble.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.880]   I don't know what the answer is to that.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:58.200]   Once you let it be open source, it's out of your control.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.360]   Samsung is going to fix it.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.560]   Alcatel is going to fix it.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:08.520]   Sony, HTC and LG, all say they'll be releasing patches this month.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:12.440]   The problem is it won't be till Black Hat that we'll see the details.
[01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.800]   So one of the things Steve Gibson wants, and I agree, this is something we need and I hope
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:25.320]   that the security firm's Imperium who discovered this will do, is put out a website that would
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:32.960]   demonstrate this and let people who have Android phones test their phone against it.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.800]   So you could go to a website and say, "Yes, send me a message.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.240]   It won't obviously hack your phone.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:41.360]   It'll say something like, 'Yes, you're vulnerable or no, you're not.'"
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:42.360]   That's what we need.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:46.640]   If you are, if you do get hacked, what's the fix?
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.000]   Put Cyanogen Mod 12 on your phone.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   Really?
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.720]   Well, that's one fix.
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.080]   Cyanogen's been fixed already.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.840]   Get a new phone for...
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:02.800]   That's the real problem is you know, if you're somebody in New Delhi who bought a $25 phone,
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:06.040]   you probably don't even know about this issue.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.040]   Right?
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:12.920]   So, but we don't know if mass attacks with this yet anyway, so I don't know what's going
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:13.920]   on.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:19.080]   I don't know how big of a problem it's going to be.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:23.240]   August 6th, I guess.
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.240]   Did I find out?
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.240]   Did I?
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.240]   Is that tonight?
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.240]   Tomorrow.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.240]   Tomorrow.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.240]   Tomorrow.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.640]   It's a bad one.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:39.120]   Let's see, what else?
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:43.800]   So I'm curious what Linn and G to think of the Facebook kerfuffle.
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:46.680]   All right, let's take a break and we'll talk about that.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.920]   "Article on Medium by Hank Green, who's a Facebook star.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.760]   Theft lies and Facebook video."
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:56.760]   Facebook says it's now streaming more video than YouTube.
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:02.640]   They're able to make that claim because they cheat, lie, and steal.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.640]   What do you think?
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.640]   We'll find out.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.200]   First of words, from brain tree.
[01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:12.120]   If you're an mobile app developer, if you've got a website where you do payments, you should
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.600]   know about brain tree.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.600]   We love brain tree.
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:23.480]   They with a simple integration of 10 lines of code can actually put mobile payments for
[01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.160]   everything into your app.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:32.200]   We're talking credit cards, PayPal, Venmo, Bitcoin, Apple Pay.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:37.520]   I'll tell you, I talked a couple of weeks ago to Juan Benitez, who's the CTO of brain
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.520]   tree.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:42.560]   He said, "Developers love brain tree."
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.560]   Take a listen.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:49.040]   When we talk to iOS engineers, they get really excited by how fast and easy it is to have
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.720]   Apple Pay through brain tree.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:54.720]   Just a ton of feedback from Android developers saying, "Wow, great.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.120]   Now I can get Android Pay."
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:00.800]   Then you see people really responding and saying, "Wow, I can do more than one of these
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.680]   through one integration, one SDK, and one report too.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.840]   Wow, that's going to make my finance guys happy."
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:07.840]   Everybody's going to be happy.
[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:12.320]   Most importantly, your user's Uber uses brain tree.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.320]   So does Lyft.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:14.800]   Airbnb uses brain tree.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.800]   So does hotel tonight.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:19.120]   When you see competitors using the same mobile payment solution, you know it must work.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.680]   Living social, muntry, GitHub.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.040]   Come on, developers.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.160]   If GitHub uses it, that's a pretty strong recommendation.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.160]   Want you to try it.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.320]   You can actually get there's a sandbox.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.600]   You can give it a try, see what your app would look like using brain trees integration.
[01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:35.680]   They solve the problem of mobile card abandonment.
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.520]   70% of mobile shopping carts are abandoned before the transaction.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.400]   You've got to capture those users.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.400]   You can.
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:48.600]   By the way, superior fraud protection, customer service, and fast payouts.
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:49.640]   It is awesome.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.040]   That one touch is fantastic.
[01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.040]   That's what Uber uses.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:53.040]   You don't even have to do anything.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.920]   You just get out of the car.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:58.960]   Braintree gives you full stack payment solution and I want you to try it and get your first
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.840]   $50,000 in transactions fee free.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:10.480]   Braintreepayments.com/twigbraintreepayments.com/twig.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.880]   Try it today.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.160]   Hank Green has YouTube channels like SciShow, Crash Course.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:18.360]   He's one of the Vlog brothers.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.560]   He organizes VidCon, which just ended.
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:28.880]   He's a well respected, well liked creator on YouTube.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.720]   He's concerned about a few things.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:37.400]   Of course, Facebook is going to YouTube creators like him and others, saying, "Put your video
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:38.400]   on Facebook."
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.920]   I don't mean put a link to your YouTube on Facebook.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:47.960]   Put your video natively on Facebook.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:53.520]   He says, "The information they give us and they're giving out to the public is lies,
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.120]   is cheats."
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:59.720]   He says, "If I embed a YouTube video or a vine on Facebook, only a tiny fraction of
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.280]   my audience will see it.
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:07.880]   If I post the same video natively on Facebook, suddenly it's in everyone's feed everywhere.
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:10.560]   Facebook is happy to admit this strategy."
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:17.120]   Facebook's argument is also that this is the same with instant articles that it is going
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:21.360]   to serve a lot better and faster and nicer and people don't want delay.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:22.360]   Right.
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:24.600]   I mean, that part is not surprising.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:30.960]   Anyway, I mean, with any third party app, it just seems that that stuff is not shown
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:34.360]   to as many people.
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:38.440]   Anything that's natively done on Facebook, if you post directly to Facebook, definitely
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:39.680]   more people are going to see it.
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:41.240]   That's just the way that algorithm works.
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:46.520]   It's kind of like the complaints people make about Google's search terms favoring YouTube
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:47.520]   videos though.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:48.520]   Right?
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:52.960]   It's kind of like, "Well, Facebook shouldn't really promote," because they control what
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.440]   you see in your feed.
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.440]   So that's the question.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:58.320]   Is Facebook saying, "Oh, well, I see you linked to YouTube.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:02.360]   I guess we won't push you to your friends."
[01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.720]   Why is anyone shocked about either example?
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.480]   Well, let's do in business.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:13.520]   In fact, he says, "I guess that's their prerogative, but as a creator, it seems like an abusive
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.240]   power."
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:19.280]   The other one, and this is to me more damning, is how you count a view.
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:20.280]   Now, I don't...
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:21.280]   Yeah, this is an issue.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.760]   The advertisers are going to give them hell about.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:23.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.760]   This is an interesting part.
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:31.040]   Facebook says, "If you have that video visible on your screen for three seconds, you've
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.040]   viewed it."
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.800]   And by the way, of course, you didn't play or interact with it.
[01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.800]   You viewed it.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.640]   However, Facebook also says the numbers they pay attention to are if you turn up the sound,
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.200]   if you did something with it.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.240]   So they've got a shift to those more meaningful metrics.
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.600]   Because he's saying they'll count you as a view, even if you don't turn on the sound.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:52.240]   But the nature of Facebook, unless you've turned off autoplay video, is that the minute
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:55.640]   you start scrolling past something, it's playing.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.640]   And if it takes you three seconds...
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640]   11,000, 31,000.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.720]   Yeah, it's real quickly.
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.800]   That's a view.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:02.800]   So...
[01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:06.960]   Basically, if it just shows up in your feed, you viewed it without doing anything.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:07.960]   Right.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:08.960]   I think so.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:10.940]   Of course, Lynn, you're right.
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:15.500]   Of course, now the big deal in advertising is more than half the ads you didn't even actually
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:16.500]   ever see.
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:18.460]   So now it's a big deal viewability means that you...
[01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:23.860]   The ad appeared on your screen before your eyeballs, and now we can charge you for it.
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:27.580]   So viewability has a very funny definition that comes to advertising where we are kind
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:30.180]   of ripping off the advertisers for its...
[01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:31.180]   Shh.
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:32.180]   You're not...
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:33.180]   You don't make money that way.
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:35.180]   It's the on the Ip-ing ray.
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:36.500]   You're not making money that way.
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.780]   Over years, radio has gotten away with...
[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:40.780]   Well, newspapers.
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:41.780]   Yes.
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:42.780]   Does newspapers...
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:43.780]   Yes.
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:46.380]   And people sometimes ding podcasts for exactly the same thing.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:49.780]   Well, people downloaded it, but did they listen to it?
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:53.140]   People bought the paper, but did they see every single ad in the paper?
[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:54.300]   I don't think so.
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:56.700]   Well, but in this case, Leo, we had ads...
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:16:57.700]   Right.
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:01.220]   But we had ads that were on pages that we know didn't ever scroll up.
[01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:02.220]   Right.
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:06.100]   I'm just saying that's the nature of the world until you have a way of counting people where
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:08.020]   people are looking.
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:09.020]   You're gonna be...
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:10.580]   There's gonna be some slop.
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:14.780]   Yeah, we charge people for downloads, not for views, because we can't tell whether somebody
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:16.100]   actually listened to a show.
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.100]   Only that they've downloaded.
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:19.860]   But they can tell and they've decided not to, right?
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:21.540]   Like that's Hank's point.
[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.660]   They've changed how they count it, right?
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:27.540]   But you can make the argument that, well, they do that because otherwise their numbers
[01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:35.220]   are gonna be grossly uncomfortable to other media because other media is inflating their
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:37.460]   numbers, so we need to do the same.
[01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:38.460]   Yeah.
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:40.220]   I'm not defending Facebook.
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.180]   I'm just saying that might be the thinking.
[01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:45.500]   So he's saying they should do what YouTube does.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:50.860]   The view is candid at the point where people seem to be actually engaging with the video,
[01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:56.700]   which is usually around 30 seconds, but it's different for videos of different lengths.
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:59.860]   So in other words, YouTube, and the two graphs are pretty telling.
[01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:03.140]   Here's Facebook retention at 30 seconds.
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:05.180]   It's about 20%.
[01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:11.700]   YouTube retention at 30 seconds, about 86%.
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:16.900]   He says this might seem a little like a victimless crime, by the way, and Neil Dash underlined
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:19.900]   this.
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:24.900]   I love this feature of Medium where you can see others, people annotating and underlining
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:26.060]   and stuff.
[01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:29.980]   This might seem a little like this is a victimless crime, but it fundamentally devalues the
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:32.500]   number one metric of online video.
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.380]   The view is the thing that everyone talks about.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:38.700]   It's the thing creators sell to advertisers.
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:42.260]   Applying that word to something far less valuable is going to be extremely disruptive
[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:43.260]   to creators.
[01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:48.420]   Adageeses and brands are confused enough without Facebook muddying the waters by calling something
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:51.300]   a view when it is in no way a measurement of your view.
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:56.940]   Now does YouTube report only fully viewed videos or does it also count?
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:58.100]   No, portion is a view.
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:18:59.100]   No.
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.140]   In fact, it does not count fully viewed videos, but it does.
[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:03.820]   It doesn't count as a view right away.
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:04.820]   You have to.
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:05.820]   So it's degrees.
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:06.820]   We're talking.
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:09.220]   It's a matter of degree, yeah.
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:12.140]   Why is Facebook defining what a view is or YouTube for that matter?
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:13.140]   I mean, why?
[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.460]   Because there's no standard.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.460]   There isn't.
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:16.460]   There isn't a standard.
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:17.980]   No, there isn't in podcasting either.
[01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:21.220]   There has been for years in radio and television, but there have been competing standards.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:22.500]   There's been arbitron and Nielsen.
[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:25.060]   They're now all kind of unified.
[01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.700]   But for years, it's always been relative BS.
[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:28.700]   Right.
[01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.700]   Okay.
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:30.700]   That's the thing.
[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:35.340]   Like, that's the thing like the kids like Hank don't realize is we've always been lying.
[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:36.340]   Right.
[01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:39.380]   Because it was immeasurable before, but now it is miserable.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.180]   Well, maybe we needed three sink it.
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.180]   That's right.
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:46.980]   Listen, I thought that Hank's framing of this, the the lies, the steel, the stealing, the
[01:19:46.980 --> 01:19:47.980]   viciousness.
[01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:52.100]   However, he put it was extreme, but I also feel like, look, you know, like Taylor Swift
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:54.260]   told Apple they were screwing up and Apple.
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:55.740]   We got our attention.
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:59.580]   We need creators like Hank who are really well known who have been in his business and
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:03.900]   who are on the creative side to kind of, you know, speak truth to power in a way.
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.860]   Like, Hey, I'm building a business on this.
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:08.100]   This is this is confusing and hard.
[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.700]   And this, this free booting free booting is what it's called this free booting issue.
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:12.700]   Yeah.
[01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:15.780]   With Facebook video is also just infuriating and I'm alike.
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:16.780]   Information wants to be free.
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:17.940]   Hey, share my stuff.
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:23.140]   I would be infuriated if someone took my video stripped out attribution and ads and whatever
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:26.020]   else I put in it and then republished it under their own.
[01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.260]   That would make me crazy.
[01:20:27.260 --> 01:20:33.980]   He says, according to a report from Ogilvy and tubular labs of the 1000 most popular Facebook
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:37.820]   videos in the first quarter, 725 were stolen.
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:43.180]   And in a sense, stolen because they were downloaded from YouTube or somewhere else and
[01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:45.900]   re uploaded to Facebook.
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:51.980]   And he says that's 17 billion views last quarter.
[01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:58.740]   So, and by the way, if you complain to Facebook, they'll take and he, I guess he's maybe some
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:00.060]   of those videos or his.
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:04.780]   He says you could complain to Facebook and in a couple of days, they'll take it down.
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:10.300]   You know, he says, once it's received 99.9% of the views, it's ever going to get.
[01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:14.420]   These are lessons that, that, you know, in some fairness here, YouTube had to go through
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:19.100]   all these lessons in its early days of video and Facebook has made this big push to video
[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:23.820]   further recently so that obviously YouTube had to create an entire system.
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:29.420]   Remember the, the, the Viacom suit, an entire system to recognize copyright material to
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:31.900]   get rid of it, to deal with challenges.
[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:33.260]   It took building.
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:36.460]   I think what might have been, I think Gina is right that he raises important points.
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:39.540]   The positioning is, is rather harsh and extreme.
[01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:43.420]   The better way to raise this might have been to say that as an end, as a growing industry,
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:50.260]   which Hank is a real leader, we need some standards and whoever the platform is, whoever comes
[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:55.060]   down the line when YouTube starts playing videos natively, when Viacom, I mean, when
[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:59.660]   the Verizon's door and the phones, we as a new industry need standards so that we can
[01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:02.900]   know what our own data is and so we can give advertisers reliable things.
[01:22:02.900 --> 01:22:06.260]   That's the more mature way, I think, to put it.
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:11.780]   He talks about Dustin, Dustin Sandlin, who runs a great channel called Smarter Every Day,
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:14.740]   spends a lot of money in time making his videos.
[01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:17.540]   One of his videos was, see, this is what happens.
[01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:19.500]   It's not Facebook doing this.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:24.180]   Some other company that wanted traffic on their page just took his video and put it
[01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:25.660]   on their page.
[01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:28.660]   It got 17 million views.
[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:33.660]   Dustin has made a video that talks about this issue.
[01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:35.460]   And I do think that that's unfair.
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:41.740]   Although, couldn't you be just as upset about YouTube taking the vast majority of the video
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:46.900]   and the majority of the profits from you and on and on and on?
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:50.900]   I mean, it's not like creators are well treated in general.
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:56.180]   Well, and this goes, Facebook would have to be really, really bad to make YouTube look
[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.180]   good.
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:58.820]   Apparently, they are.
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:01.660]   That's the other principle here is some means of rev share.
[01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:02.660]   Yeah.
[01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:07.020]   And, you know, again, I talked to my friends, Mira, Laura, and Glam, and with all the videos
[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:11.980]   they're doing, they always pay a creator, full stop.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:15.780]   If you natively just recommend something, they don't honestly pay you.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:19.820]   But if you embed it, they will pay you.
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:22.780]   Maybe that's what that's maybe this is what Hank's point is.
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:25.700]   I think that's what the argument really is.
[01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:26.700]   Yeah.
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:29.380]   Facebook doesn't have a partnership with creators in the same way that YouTube does.
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:31.180]   I think that's what it really comes down to.
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:35.620]   And if Facebook didn't first either and if Facebook were smart, they could they could
[01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:39.060]   actually, if they did it right and said, no, no, you know what, we're going to do this
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:40.060]   right.
[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:41.060]   We're going to share it with you.
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:42.060]   We're going to protect you.
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:43.580]   They could they could be YouTube easily.
[01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:46.740]   It could leapfrog it, which is, which is by the way, exactly.
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:51.380]   And there's a precedent for this exactly Facebook's strategy with, with news organizations,
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:53.460]   with instant articles, we're out of the gate.
[01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:55.700]   They said, if you sell the ad, you keep 100%.
[01:23:55.700 --> 01:23:59.060]   If we sell it, we keep 30%.
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:00.420]   You get 70%.
[01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:01.420]   There's the deal.
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:04.140]   You're going to get better serving because you're natively done.
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:07.100]   You're going to get more traffic as you're natively done and people complain about that,
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:08.980]   but hey, it's our business.
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:12.820]   They could make similar deals with video creators.
[01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:16.060]   And the advantage that you're in right now, which I, which I argue with the news industry,
[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:19.500]   which I would say the same thing to Hank and companies rather than just saying, I'm a
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:21.580]   YouTube guy and Facebook's all bad.
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:25.820]   The smarter thing to do, the clever thing to do is to play them off each other and to
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:27.660]   say, well, Facebook did that.
[01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:28.660]   You, why don't you do that?
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:33.460]   Well, look, Facebook, YouTube do this and in a position where if content from these big
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:38.380]   guys does matter, when I called him to Stern, we talked about it in the last week's show.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:39.380]   And he was a guest.
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:45.460]   There was somebody named PewDiePie making huge amounts of money, but he was a dog.
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:48.580]   He talked about Booker, one of his DJ friends, and he said, Booker's been in the industry
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:49.580]   for 30, 40 years.
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:50.580]   He's not making $8 billion a year.
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:54.340]   He's just going to work for PewDiePie.
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:55.340]   And it is amazing.
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:25:03.860]   There are now 35 presenters on YouTube that have more than 10 million followers each.
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:05.220]   That's a phenomenal ecosystem.
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:07.580]   There is revenue sharing going on with there.
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:11.540]   So there each, but meanwhile, Google is not revenue sharing.
[01:25:11.540 --> 01:25:13.060]   It doesn't have the means to embed.
[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:18.340]   I yelled at them two years ago saying make content embeddable on Google+, put ads in
[01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:19.340]   their start.
[01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:23.820]   But I see, you know, I, I, not a lot of issues in the me, but, but this mechanism has been
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:30.300]   there and, and content creators should see the opportunity to, to negotiate.
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:34.580]   And Hank, I think has an opportunity because he, he has a huge, I mean, I was so impressed
[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:35.580]   with VidCon.
[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:37.700]   And it's an incredible creation.
[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:39.500]   And that middle floor is creators.
[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:43.580]   And I'm not suggesting they start a union among them, but you can start a negotiation
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:44.580]   platform.
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:45.580]   That's a great idea.
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:49.060]   I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I think the wrong work is it's going around a lot with Gawker
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:50.260]   and places like that.
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:53.780]   But you look at what the Guardian did and bringing together eight publishers with, you
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:56.140]   know, Google and the digital news initiative.
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:59.260]   There is a mechanism where we're, we're, we're German publishers.
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:02.820]   We're going against Google, Google needed friends, the Guardian put together friends
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:04.700]   and said, okay, let's talk Turkey.
[01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:05.700]   Let's get real about this.
[01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:09.740]   Isn't that what maker should be doing though, companies that are doing this kind of aggregation
[01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:14.540]   on YouTube these, this, this is, that is a union in effect.
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:18.860]   Shouldn't you be going to YouTube and say, yeah, guild.
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:20.820]   And what should Facebook do about free booting?
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:21.820]   Because that's really nasty.
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:25.980]   They should do the same things that, that YouTube eventually had to do, which is number
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:29.900]   one, you have a detection system, content ID and cut it ID.
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:35.460]   And number two, that when challenged, you operate pretty quickly and take stuff down.
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:41.420]   Content ID has worked on YouTube hasn't finally took a long time to build.
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:46.940]   And, and you know, you can almost hope that Google would open source it for the sake of
[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:49.860]   the entire nascent video industry.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:52.660]   I got to say Facebook is working on a content ID.
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:54.140]   They need to, they need to.
[01:26:54.140 --> 01:27:00.020]   So the product product manager for Facebook video responded to this medium post.
[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:01.820]   And it's a bottom that he imposed.
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:02.820]   Yeah, go ahead, Lynn.
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:05.020]   I was going to say the same thing you're saying.
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:08.420]   It looks like Facebook is trying to do something, right?
[01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:09.420]   Yeah.
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:10.420]   So, and then there.
[01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:15.460]   It says, my name is Matt Packis or Pakes and I'm a project manager at Facebook responsible
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:16.460]   for video products.
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:21.900]   I want to be clear that we and I absolutely do care about digital video creators.
[01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:26.460]   We also care about the people who watch videos on Facebook as well as advertisers.
[01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:31.260]   Our goal is to build and support products for video creators and to create a sustainable
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:35.140]   video ecosystem that works well for everyone.
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:37.620]   To that end, I'd like to address your concerns.
[01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:38.620]   I need to.
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:39.620]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:40.620]   So this is the product manager.
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:46.060]   He defends autoplay by saying that people only see videos in their newsfeed if they
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:51.100]   have interacted with videos in the past, which means they're more likely to care about videos.
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:56.860]   So they see more videos and so they know that they feel like autoplay is the best experience
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:01.380]   because forcing the user to actually interact and tap the play button doesn't doesn't make
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:02.380]   sense.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.260]   It's a better experience because their newsfeed is smarter.
[01:28:04.260 --> 01:28:07.860]   I think now he says the data bears that out.
[01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:08.860]   Okay.
[01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:13.060]   He also says, if you've stayed on a video for at least three seconds, it signals to us
[01:28:13.060 --> 01:28:16.860]   to Facebook that you are not simply scrolling through feed and that you've shown intent
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:17.860]   to watch the video.
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:22.660]   So he's saying three seconds on a video shows intense and you can, by the way, if you're
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:27.740]   a page owner, see a little bit more like how long people watch and so forth.
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:32.820]   So the public view count is just one data point that they provide.
[01:28:32.820 --> 01:28:35.380]   If you're if you own the video, you get a lot more.
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:36.380]   Right.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:39.860]   And then he says that they've got an IP system.
[01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:45.100]   They have an audible magic system that they that they've used and that they're working
[01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:46.100]   on it.
[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:50.300]   Significant technical challenge on our scale, have a team working on it, you know?
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:51.300]   So look, this is the cut.
[01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:53.140]   You know, this is the line, right?
[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:55.740]   This is a this is a decent response.
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:29:01.220]   It's interesting that they defended autoplay this way over years of developing and tuning
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:02.220]   newsfeed.
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:05.460]   We know that clicking on a link to play video is not a great user experience.
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:08.940]   So 10 people tend to interact slightly less with non native video.
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.980]   So the posts get less engagement.
[01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:14.620]   Native native video posts with autoplay tend to see better engagement, more watch time
[01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:15.700]   and higher view count.
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:17.100]   Here's an example on my page.
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:23.820]   So Jim Cutler, our friend, post a video of Billy Joel at the NASA Coliseum from YouTube
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:24.820]   in order to watch that.
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:26.860]   I don't have to press the play button.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:31.980]   And it would then play at least I wouldn't have to leave the YouTube page.
[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:37.780]   But if I keep scrolling down, I'm sure I'll find some this galley Lewis, some native video
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:39.100]   somewhere in here.
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:40.100]   There's another YouTube.
[01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:46.540]   Actually, I don't maybe I don't interact a lot with native video because they're not
[01:29:46.540 --> 01:29:48.900]   putting any native video in here.
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:51.020]   Hey, here we go.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:55.860]   And then Felicia Day, who was smart enough to make that native video and you see and actually,
[01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.340]   you know, it does kind of make you stop a little bit.
[01:29:58.340 --> 01:29:59.340]   A lot better.
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:00.340]   It's brilliant.
[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:01.740]   And the sound doesn't come up.
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:02.740]   Right.
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:06.060]   I have to click it for the sound.
[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:09.820]   And if you if you keep scrolling, it will stop unless you've done there's some kind
[01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:13.460]   of threshold that if you if you listen for a certain amount of time, if you turn the sound
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:15.100]   up, I think it'll keep going.
[01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:16.100]   It's still going.
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:20.740]   So I think they learned that from Instagram too, because it's the same thing.
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:21.740]   Right.
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:22.740]   Right.
[01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:23.740]   They tried it first on Instagram.
[01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:24.740]   I'll go point.
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:28.540]   And the thing we all thought it would be about is forcing us to watch ads, but they haven't
[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:29.540]   really done that.
[01:30:29.540 --> 01:30:30.540]   I don't think it is that.
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:34.820]   No, it's about making the experience better and you know what?
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:35.820]   They're right.
[01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:37.740]   They're consistent instant articles in this.
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:40.260]   They're quite consistent about this.
[01:30:40.260 --> 01:30:46.460]   So I think the key for Hank and others is I think they're right to put the screws to
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:49.620]   Facebook and but but there's a.
[01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:50.620]   Okay.
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:52.220]   So here's Mary with though.
[01:30:52.220 --> 01:30:54.020]   That's the German model.
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:55.180]   You asked you didn't from us.
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.180]   We are.
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:57.180]   Yeah.
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:59.180]   No, I think those words were too loaded that with those were the wrong words.
[01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:03.780]   Yeah, I think flies and honey, you know, even Facebook is human.
[01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:04.780]   Right.
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:10.780]   Whereas and one could argue it takes that to get their attention, you know, but but having
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:15.180]   said that then the way you're going to get somewhere is by having a reasonable discussion
[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:16.900]   of mutual self-interest.
[01:31:16.900 --> 01:31:17.900]   Right.
[01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:24.020]   And I think really one thing Facebook could do is to is to show is to step up and say,
[01:31:24.020 --> 01:31:25.140]   look, we really care.
[01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:27.620]   We want you to have a great experience.
[01:31:27.620 --> 01:31:31.580]   We're doing everything we can and we'd like to share the revenue with you in a equitable
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:32.580]   equitable way.
[01:31:32.580 --> 01:31:33.660]   But well, here's the difference.
[01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:36.780]   I think that right now they're not really doing revenue around video.
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:37.780]   They're just building video.
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:38.780]   Right.
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:39.780]   They're building it.
[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:40.780]   This is what Facebook always does.
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:41.860]   There was a great moment.
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:45.220]   I tweeted it or I Facebook, I hear from her what the what the it was.
[01:31:45.220 --> 01:31:48.100]   It was Mark talking about his numbers last time.
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:54.180]   And and when I started in this business on digital, the old saw the early early on in
[01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:57.140]   the 90s was when you got to get to 100,000 years before the average time is the pay
[01:31:57.140 --> 01:31:59.740]   attention to you, then it was a million that it was extremely.
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:03.380]   Mark Zuckerberg said basically he doesn't deal with monetization until he hits a billion.
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:04.380]   Wow.
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:06.180]   And he has a billion users.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:09.780]   So what they're doing right now with video is they're just building the hell out of it.
[01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:11.300]   So there's no revenue to share yet.
[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:13.420]   So the exact thing happened at YouTube.
[01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:18.260]   Glenn, are we going to start posting videos natively on Facebook or are we going to keep
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:19.260]   posting links?
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:20.740]   He's in with somebody.
[01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:21.740]   He's got the door closed.
[01:32:21.740 --> 01:32:24.140]   Jason, don't you think we ought to just start?
[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:25.140]   Let's just let's do it.
[01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:26.140]   Do it.
[01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.180]   Because I will get like 10 times the game.
[01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:30.020]   I mean, the numbers are significantly different.
[01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:33.620]   Well, if you were my client, I would advise you.
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:34.620]   I'm your client.
[01:32:34.620 --> 01:32:36.980]   I would advise you to post natively.
[01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:37.980]   Definitely.
[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:38.980]   What?
[01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:39.980]   Yes.
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:40.980]   Yes.
[01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:44.460]   Glenn, where else should Leo, where all should one post videos now?
[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:47.620]   If you're a YouTube star, where else should you be?
[01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:53.860]   If you're a YouTube star, I think, I think even just having a clip on Instagram.
[01:32:53.860 --> 01:32:54.860]   Ah, smart.
[01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:55.860]   Smart.
[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:56.860]   Vine.
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:57.860]   Vine.
[01:32:57.860 --> 01:32:59.900]   Vine is different, though.
[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:06.460]   Don't you think Vine is really transmogrified into, I don't know what Vine is?
[01:33:06.460 --> 01:33:07.460]   I'll be honest.
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:10.500]   I don't look at it often, but I have friends who just love who, I mean, apparently they're
[01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:12.860]   folks who just vine stars who just made it to start.
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:13.860]   Well, that's what I think.
[01:33:13.860 --> 01:33:17.020]   It's become a medium in and of itself, a six-second medium.
[01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:18.020]   Right.
[01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:22.500]   But like a teaser, you know, I don't know.
[01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:23.500]   I think people.
[01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:27.700]   I think people who do well in Vine are native to Vine.
[01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:28.700]   Yeah.
[01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:30.980]   Because six seconds, I can't post something in six seconds.
[01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:32.900]   It's going to be compelling.
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:33.900]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:34.900]   Right.
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:35.900]   So Instagram.
[01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.260]   You don't do visual dance.
[01:33:37.260 --> 01:33:38.260]   Right.
[01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:41.300]   There is a certain sameness, isn't there, to vines at this point?
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:43.220]   It gives me a headache after enough time.
[01:33:43.220 --> 01:33:44.220]   It's for the youngsters.
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:45.220]   It's not for us.
[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:46.220]   It's for the youngsters.
[01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:47.220]   Yeah.
[01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:50.020]   Vine is one of those things that makes me feel really, really old.
[01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:51.020]   Yeah.
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:52.020]   Yeah.
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:53.020]   The youngsters love it.
[01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:59.180]   Tony tells me that we do TN2 on Facebook natively because it's shorter.
[01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:01.380]   And the other shows that we have are too long to do it.
[01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:02.540]   Twitbits, we should do that one.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:03.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:04.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:05.540]   Twitbits, for sure.
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:06.540]   Well, I didn't even try the whole show.
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:09.340]   You know, I talked to Kevin Delaney at Quartz.
[01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:11.580]   And they put up-- they started doing some video.
[01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:18.780]   And they had this beautiful thing of deep undersea, strange, sea monster things.
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:20.580]   Monster being the theme of the day.
[01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:24.660]   And so they put it up only on Facebook at first, nowhere else.
[01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:27.180]   What they found was that people, they watched it.
[01:34:27.180 --> 01:34:29.500]   And it was like a-- it was not an hour.
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.060]   It was not like doing this.
[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:32.660]   But it was just assumptions.
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:34.180]   It wasn't fun.
[01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:37.900]   And the number of likes went up.
[01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:39.300]   People wanted to see more.
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:42.140]   And so they wanted to signal and say, yeah, show me more.
[01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:43.700]   So I would try every possible.
[01:34:43.700 --> 01:34:47.460]   I would try TN2bits, but I would also try a couple of full shows.
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:48.460]   Just to see.
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:51.820]   We must take your stay.
[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:55.220]   Well, I mean, somewhere like Vine, you could do like, you know,
[01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:57.980]   quick clips of like funny outtakes or something, you know.
[01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:00.300]   Yeah, just a big word, the Vine crowd.
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:02.540]   They're not the Vine crowd, but Instagram, definitely.
[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:03.980]   Instagram, I like that idea.
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:05.820]   And that's 15 seconds, right?
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:06.740]   Right.
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:09.580]   Because you could do promo videos, you know?
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:10.740]   Yeah.
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:11.740]   But, Sagan?
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:13.380]   45 minutes.
[01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:14.380]   What?
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:16.220]   No, he doesn't know what you're talking about.
[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:20.420]   45 minutes is the length cut off for Facebook native video.
[01:35:20.420 --> 01:35:22.180]   Oh, I guess we do TN2.
[01:35:22.180 --> 01:35:23.500]   No, we can upload two shows.
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:27.300]   But we could upload tippets, not tippets.
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:28.900]   That's for somebody else.
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:32.700]   We could upload tippets and clips.
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:35.860]   I think we should probably.
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:38.700]   But I don't know if Vine is going to really work for us.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:42.780]   I don't run into enough walls to really--
[01:35:42.780 --> 01:35:46.140]   To make it viable.
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:49.140]   Yeah, you'd have to have a blooper reel.
[01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:50.220]   A blooper reel to work.
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:51.980]   Six seconds and blooper reel.
[01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:53.380]   Yeah.
[01:35:53.380 --> 01:35:55.140]   Yeah.
[01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:56.780]   You know, I get a headache, too.
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:35:59.220]   Maybe it's just you and me, Jeff, I don't.
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:00.220]   We're just old.
[01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:02.260]   We're just old.
[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:04.540]   Do the kids still love Vine?
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:07.260]   Lynn, is this still a viable?
[01:36:07.260 --> 01:36:08.140]   It is.
[01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:10.700]   But I mean, they're more into Snapchat now.
[01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:11.220]   You know?
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:11.740]   Yeah.
[01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:15.260]   Finestly viable, as I think Gina just said,
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:17.460]   there's some stars who are built there.
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:19.540]   Some of those kids go on college tours.
[01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:20.060]   They're huge.
[01:36:20.060 --> 01:36:20.660]   And it shows.
[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:21.500]   Right, yeah.
[01:36:21.500 --> 01:36:23.180]   But we talked about that with YouTube, too.
[01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:25.660]   I mean, there's these video stars from YouTube.
[01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:26.740]   But they don't even do anything.
[01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:29.140]   They just show up, do selfies.
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:30.500]   There's a guy got a question.
[01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:31.700]   I got a question for all you guys.
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:35.220]   So I decided to go into Facebook and throw myself in.
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:36.740]   And I found that in Richie.
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:38.900]   I've been trying to do the same thing with YouTube.
[01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:41.380]   It's hard to get a purchase on the mountain.
[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:43.900]   Because it just recommends stuff to me based on what I've known,
[01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:45.980]   or stuff that's wildly popular that's not for me.
[01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:49.180]   And it's hard to explore, isn't it?
[01:36:49.180 --> 01:36:51.460]   Well, have you seen-- you're on Android, right?
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:53.980]   Have you seen the new layout?
[01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:55.140]   On the-- yeah.
[01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.300]   I was trying to web.
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:58.220]   And that's still on the Android.
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:00.260]   The new layout makes it a little bit easier,
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:02.900]   because, well, if you subscribe to anything,
[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:05.980]   you can see your subscriptions separately now.
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:09.740]   And the recommendations come separately in a stream.
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:12.100]   I think this new layout on Android
[01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:13.980]   has made it a little easier.
[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:15.260]   But yeah, they recommend things to you
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:18.220]   based on what you've watched in the past.
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:20.780]   Well, and I think really, if you think of it,
[01:37:20.780 --> 01:37:24.580]   YouTube is like pulling a thread off a sweater.
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:26.020]   The key is to start.
[01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:27.860]   So pick something that you're interested in.
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:31.540]   Because then afterwards, I feel like you could just let it go.
[01:37:31.540 --> 01:37:34.780]   Because now it's just going to autoplay more like that.
[01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:35.980]   And it does kind of--
[01:37:35.980 --> 01:37:37.980]   like the old days when you stumble upon when
[01:37:37.980 --> 01:37:40.900]   you would wander through the web.
[01:37:40.900 --> 01:37:45.500]   So for instance, I start watching "Fails" video.
[01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:48.140]   Our son's very interested in "Fails" videos.
[01:37:48.140 --> 01:37:48.860]   People falling apart.
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:54.380]   But here I was watching "Talk Show," "Talk Show" nightmares.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:56.460]   And then it just keeps going.
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:58.220]   And then you'll get more and more and more and more.
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:00.780]   And it really is like a thread off a sweater.
[01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:01.980]   You just keep pulling it.
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:05.140]   But it's the same problem that Twitter and Google+
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:06.020]   have in the early days.
[01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:06.660]   You come on.
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:07.860]   What's here?
[01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:08.300]   Discover.
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:09.380]   I don't see anything here.
[01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:12.260]   Well, let me go back to the front page.
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.020]   I don't like this, by the way, this little thing.
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:15.820]   I don't never know how to-- how do you get rid of that?
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:16.820]   Swipe it off.
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:17.820]   Swipe it off?
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:18.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:18.820 --> 01:38:20.020]   That was easy.
[01:38:20.020 --> 01:38:22.780]   But what's that-- you really don't like that?
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:23.780]   I know.
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:24.860]   Well, because it keeps playing.
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:25.940]   That allows you to--
[01:38:25.940 --> 01:38:28.180]   Even if I exit, even if I go back to the home,
[01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:29.540]   it keeps playing.
[01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:31.780]   Because they want you to remain engaged.
[01:38:31.780 --> 01:38:32.620]   I know.
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:33.100]   Something else.
[01:38:33.100 --> 01:38:35.100]   I feel like they're going, hey, hey, Tato, stop.
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:35.900]   No, no.
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:37.140]   Hey, I'm still-- I'm talking here.
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:42.860]   So I think the recommendations are pretty good, Jeff.
[01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:44.180]   Look at the recommendations.
[01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:45.540]   They're good for me.
[01:38:45.540 --> 01:38:47.740]   Maybe you just don't watch enough stuff.
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:48.900]   That's the problem.
[01:38:48.900 --> 01:38:50.500]   I've got a devote time to it.
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.380]   And then you start watching music videos,
[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:53.900]   and you just never-- you can leave it on.
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:55.700]   So the other problem is it gives me nothing but frigging
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:57.140]   Ted Talks.
[01:38:57.140 --> 01:39:00.340]   Well, that's because you did that.
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:01.140]   You did that, Jeff.
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:03.380]   It gives nothing but Elmo, and that's all my fault.
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:04.380]   Yeah.
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:05.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:05.980 --> 01:39:08.180]   You get the YouTube you deserve.
[01:39:08.180 --> 01:39:09.180]   You do.
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:10.180]   You do.
[01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:12.500]   So I mean, you have to subscribe to a few channels,
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:14.660]   and you have to watch a few shows.
[01:39:14.660 --> 01:39:17.180]   Yeah.
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:18.860]   So I was on-- I had the honor--
[01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:19.820]   Oh, it's now available.
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:20.460]   I should plug this.
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:23.460]   I had the honor to be on Neil McGrass Tyson's star talk.
[01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:23.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:24.700]   So you're sitting there.
[01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:25.220]   That's cool.
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.220]   It's now get-able.
[01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:27.260]   Yeah, it was really.
[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:29.180]   He's just great.
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:31.780]   So I've been-- for that and other reasons I'll say later,
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:33.740]   I've been watching a lot of Neil McGrass Tyson videos.
[01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:36.500]   And he's just compelling everything he's got.
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:36.940]   He's great.
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:37.540]   Yeah.
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:38.820]   It's just phenomenal.
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:40.980]   So that is picking up and giving me--
[01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:41.340]   Yeah.
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:41.980]   So there you go.
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:44.860]   You probably subscribed, right?
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:47.660]   But in that case, it's not-- no, it's everybody in the world
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:48.820]   is putting them in the world with real McGrass Tyson
[01:39:48.820 --> 01:39:49.900]   moments they like.
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:50.700]   So that's what the algorithm is.
[01:39:50.700 --> 01:39:51.500]   But isn't that what I should do,
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:54.460]   Lyn, is subscribe to stuff that I think is good?
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:57.140]   Because that's the signal you need to send to YouTube.
[01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:59.060]   Yes, you have to subscribe to a few channels.
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:39:59.580]   Yeah.
[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:01.900]   Don't want to subscribe to that.
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:03.220]   The young Turks I like.
[01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:05.220]   Young Turks-- see?
[01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:06.580]   Oh, now this is so nice.
[01:40:06.580 --> 01:40:08.820]   Lyn, you just saved me a lot of--
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:10.900]   a lot of upset.
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:13.020]   Swipe it off.
[01:40:13.020 --> 01:40:14.980]   That's not intuitive.
[01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:17.020]   I've been dragging it around.
[01:40:17.020 --> 01:40:18.780]   I've been messing with it.
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:20.500]   It just drives me crazy.
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:21.620]   So now that's there.
[01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:22.660]   See, I've been doing this.
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:24.540]   If you were 12, you would know what to do.
[01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:25.100]   Yeah.
[01:40:25.100 --> 01:40:25.740]   It was obvious.
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:26.580]   It's just like Tinder.
[01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:27.500]   You swipe right.
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:34.020]   Have you seen the AP and movie tone videos?
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:34.820]   Isn't that exciting?
[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:36.420]   I think we talked about it a couple of weeks ago.
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:37.060]   When you were here--
[01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:38.020]   Oh, there was a production we did yesterday.
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:39.060]   They put-- how many?
[01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:43.500]   Tens of thousands of old-timey newsreels up on YouTube.
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:44.700]   Watch out, you kids.
[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:47.220]   Well, references will be there with our microphones.
[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:48.500]   Eye-hag-ruff.
[01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:49.540]   Fuzz.
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:51.380]   All right, you know you want to talk about it.
[01:40:51.380 --> 01:40:57.620]   Jeff Spain joined, I think, Germany started it.
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:40:58.580]   Where's Germany started?
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:40:59.780]   It almost--
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:02.900]   Which wrecked where they got upset because Google
[01:41:02.900 --> 01:41:08.180]   was putting snippets from the news in their Google news
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:11.300]   and that's stealing.
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:14.220]   Then they created a tax.
[01:41:14.220 --> 01:41:15.700]   A Google News tax.
[01:41:15.700 --> 01:41:20.700]   Basically, if you link, you must pay for the privilege
[01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:21.460]   of linking.
[01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:22.580]   Belgium did it first.
[01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:26.100]   So Google just took the publications out.
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:29.020]   Then Germany did it so they took the snippets out,
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:31.020]   which the publishers got upset about.
[01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:32.700]   And the public-- yeah, then they all went around
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:34.140]   and it was just a game.
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:36.540]   So Spain said it's mandatory.
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:38.540]   You don't get to opt in or out.
[01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:40.020]   Google said--
[01:41:40.020 --> 01:41:41.180]   How are we saying a few of Spain?
[01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:44.100]   I'm opting out of Spain.
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:46.220]   And that's still the case.
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:47.900]   There's no Google News in Spain.
[01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:49.260]   Nope.
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:52.100]   So a study by the Spanish Association
[01:41:52.100 --> 01:41:55.620]   of Publishers of Periodical Publications--
[01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:57.500]   By the way, I bet the ones to pressure Google here.
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:00.660]   So you'd think that they would be trying to sugarcoat this.
[01:42:00.660 --> 01:42:03.540]   But there's no sugar to be found because they say, yes,
[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:05.540]   indeed it hurt the publishers.
[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:10.540]   And what's more tragic is it killed a whole bunch of little guys.
[01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:11.620]   Just killed them.
[01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:13.500]   Because they said we killed a board of pay.
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:18.020]   Planet de ludico nayagaranc in Faulement.
[01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:22.180]   Multifreeky shut down entirely.
[01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:24.740]   Gone.
[01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:27.100]   Nayagaranc ignoring the extent quantity
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:28.260]   and methods followed to determine
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:31.900]   whether they should pay the fee they preferred to close down.
[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:33.740]   Yeah.
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:35.300]   So everyone was worse off.
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:36.940]   The news ecosystem was worse off.
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:38.740]   Those places were going to link to the big guys
[01:42:38.740 --> 01:42:40.580]   and couldn't afford to link to them.
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:41.460]   And that's that.
[01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:43.380]   And it's tragic stupidity.
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:46.180]   It's technopatic.
[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:47.260]   Si.
[01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:50.740]   Links to your site are good.
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:51.740]   Yes.
[01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:53.380]   It's just-- they are not theft.
[01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:54.460]   They are a gift.
[01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:57.060]   It's a gift from Google.
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:42:58.460]   So we have that spreading.
[01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:01.180]   And then we have the other wonder out of Europe,
[01:43:01.180 --> 01:43:03.140]   which is the right to be forgotten spreading.
[01:43:03.140 --> 01:43:04.740]   The New York Times just wrote, "Fears
[01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:06.500]   is going to spread all around."
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:10.580]   I'm, as you know, appalled by that.
[01:43:10.580 --> 01:43:13.700]   There was an argument in one of the clips up there that, well,
[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:17.100]   so Google's refusing to do worldwide takedowns
[01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:18.700]   on right to be forgotten cases.
[01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:20.860]   And France and other European countries going after them.
[01:43:20.860 --> 01:43:22.780]   And somebody said in a piece today,
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:25.220]   "Well, they take down copyright at the world around.
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:27.700]   But as Jonathan Zittren from Harvard Law School--
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:30.540]   so I'm in Krusten Kannold Jonathan-- said in the New York
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:32.860]   Times today, that's because copyright generally
[01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:36.260]   has an agreed upon set of laws around the world.
[01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:37.740]   And as a regime that works, there's
[01:43:37.740 --> 01:43:40.980]   entire bodies that manage copyright in the world.
[01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:42.420]   This notion of right to be forgotten
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:44.820]   is this freakoid idea that just came out
[01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:46.500]   of a few politicians in Europe.
[01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:47.980]   And it's taking off there.
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:49.580]   That doesn't mean they should run the internet
[01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:52.740]   and run the world and determine what I can and cannot see.
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:54.820]   But there's a danger that's going to keep spreading.
[01:43:54.820 --> 01:43:57.540]   And as Zittren said, we're going to end up
[01:43:57.540 --> 01:44:00.540]   with a Swiss cheese internet.
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:03.140]   So are you featured in this documentary,
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:04.460]   this German documentary about you?
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:07.380]   Yeah, I wouldn't bother because it goes on forever.
[01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:08.380]   I can't find myself here.
[01:44:08.380 --> 01:44:09.420]   But you are too.
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:11.540]   There's a picture of somebody who found a screenshot with you.
[01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:12.260]   Yeah, you know why?
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:15.100]   Because I think that it looks like the clip they're using
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:17.860]   is from the old call for help we did in Canada
[01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:21.180]   where Amber MacArthur discovered YouTube.
[01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:24.540]   And said, Leo-- and by the way, it's still airing in Canada,
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:27.540]   which makes this look like nitwits.
[01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:29.660]   Leo, there's a new site around that
[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:31.260]   lets you upload your own videos.
[01:44:31.260 --> 01:44:33.020]   It's called YouTube.
[01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:34.820]   And she does a whole demo, which you can see on YouTube.
[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:36.660]   You know, Amber, all about that won't ever work.
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:37.460]   That'll never work.
[01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:39.540]   I think I did bring up copyright issues.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:40.420]   I think I said, you know, they're
[01:44:40.420 --> 01:44:43.460]   going to have trouble with copyright issues.
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:47.300]   But at the time, we were talking to Hurley and Chen.
[01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:49.820]   And I mean, we were early advocates.
[01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:51.620]   Amber was-- I should give Amber credit-- Amber
[01:44:51.620 --> 01:44:53.620]   was an early advocate of YouTube and really knew
[01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:55.100]   that this was going to be something big.
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:58.700]   This is before Google Bonham.
[01:44:58.700 --> 01:44:59.700]   So yeah, that's nice.
[01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:04.980]   It's a German YouTube documentary at zdf.de.
[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:06.460]   Which is a big public broadcaster.
[01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:07.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:07.060 --> 01:45:08.780]   Oh, it's a public broadcaster.
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:10.540]   We're on real TV there.
[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:11.260]   Real TV?
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:12.260]   Wow.
[01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:13.380]   It's my dream.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:15.860]   I left a watch, yeah.
[01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:19.180]   There's a new YouTube HTML5 player.
[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:23.500]   If you go to youtube.com/testtube,
[01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:27.900]   you can experience ultra high definition 4K videos.
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:28.940]   It's a little prettier.
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:30.020]   Try out the redesigned--
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:30.540]   I'm not using it.
[01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:31.580]   Is it?
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:32.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:33.380]   So oh, I'm already using it.
[01:45:33.380 --> 01:45:34.380]   I don't even know it.
[01:45:34.380 --> 01:45:36.180]   You just go there and you click a little box.
[01:45:36.180 --> 01:45:37.180]   Just go to YouTube.
[01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:38.180]   I'll just go to YouTube.
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:38.180]   Yeah.
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:39.180]   Sign up.
[01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:40.900]   I'm going to sign up.
[01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:41.620]   They don't want me.
[01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:44.180]   I can tell you because I'll leak it.
[01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:45.860]   I'll tell the world.
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:48.420]   YouTube's trying a new electrification project
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:49.420]   or something.
[01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:53.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:53.540 --> 01:45:57.020]   And remember when you first upload a YouTube video
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:46:00.740]   and you start getting a lot of hits, it stops at 301.
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:02.700]   That's going away.
[01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:04.620]   They're going to do something different.
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:07.340]   They're ditching the 301 plus video view counter.
[01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:12.500]   And they're doing--
[01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:13.820]   3.01 plus.
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:14.980]   Oh, this is a bug?
[01:46:14.980 --> 01:46:15.420]   The 301 plus?
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:16.700]   No, no, it was on purpose.
[01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:19.700]   The first people thought it was.
[01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:22.740]   So they'd see 301 plus and then after a few hours,
[01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:24.180]   it would be updated.
[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:28.660]   Now what they're going to do is just do it.
[01:46:28.660 --> 01:46:30.140]   What was the rationale though?
[01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:31.740]   They couldn't keep up.
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:32.740]   Was that all?
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:34.660]   Well, actually no, spam.
[01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:36.860]   When a video passed 300 views, we'd
[01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:40.980]   freeze the video view count while we checked for spam.
[01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:44.380]   They felt like they wanted to verify they were real.
[01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:45.700]   This was a bug.
[01:46:46.580 --> 01:46:49.540]   This was not a feature for users.
[01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:50.740]   This was a bug.
[01:46:50.740 --> 01:46:53.100]   Yeah, there's no-- OK, gotcha.
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:56.380]   Well, not exactly a bug.
[01:46:56.380 --> 01:47:00.620]   By the way, they announced this on Twitter.
[01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:02.340]   I feel like is it 2015?
[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:04.860]   That sounds crazy to me that YouTube--
[01:47:04.860 --> 01:47:06.260]   particularly 301.
[01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:08.500]   I'm not obviously not using YouTube a whole lot,
[01:47:08.500 --> 01:47:10.100]   so I wasn't even aware of this.
[01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:11.500]   It's just interesting.
[01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:15.180]   It says, people at a few sneaky robots--
[01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:17.700]   bad guys-- watch a video stored on many servers
[01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:18.620]   around the world.
[01:47:18.620 --> 01:47:20.060]   Now we count views.
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:21.220]   We're confident.
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:24.820]   Come from real people as they're recorded.
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:26.940]   And then we review the others.
[01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:29.100]   So they have some sort of process that filters out
[01:47:29.100 --> 01:47:31.620]   the fake, turn the camera on, on your machine.
[01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:33.980]   And we look at you and make sure you're human and watch it.
[01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:34.940]   We know who you are.
[01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:36.460]   If Google doesn't know I'm human,
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:38.100]   then they're not paying attention, right?
[01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:40.140]   There's got to be plenty of signals that let you know
[01:47:40.140 --> 01:47:41.700]   whether it's real or a robot.
[01:47:41.700 --> 01:47:43.180]   Yeah.
[01:47:43.180 --> 01:47:45.780]   So they freeze the counter at 301 in order to run some sort
[01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:47.940]   of batch process to work through the views.
[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:48.700]   OK, and they use to.
[01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:50.100]   Now this is fixed.
[01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:53.100]   Now they can do it in real time because they have many
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:54.940]   programmers working there.
[01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:55.900]   And a lot of computers.
[01:47:55.900 --> 01:47:56.740]   Do you think it's interesting?
[01:47:56.740 --> 01:48:00.780]   They did not announce this on Google+ but used it--
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:01.700]   YouTube instead.
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:04.540]   I mean, Twitter instead.
[01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:06.500]   Ooh.
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:07.660]   Not even on their own blog?
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:08.180]   Maybe they did.
[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:08.700]   I don't know.
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:09.940]   What about their blog?
[01:48:09.940 --> 01:48:11.060]   It's a tweet.
[01:48:11.060 --> 01:48:11.740]   That's all I got.
[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:16.180]   [SINGING]
[01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:16.740]   That's it.
[01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:17.780]   Google's buying Twitter.
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:19.420]   Yes.
[01:48:19.420 --> 01:48:22.100]   Amazon has created an API for Alexa if you want to put--
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:24.020]   I'm sorry.
[01:48:24.020 --> 01:48:27.420]   The lady who lives inside your Echo,
[01:48:27.420 --> 01:48:31.420]   you could put that inside your own device.
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:32.820]   The matchstick is dead.
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:34.660]   Remember this?
[01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:37.060]   It was a Kickstarter campaign to create basically
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:43.500]   a competitor to the Chromecast.
[01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:48.300]   And a lot of people put money into it for $70,000.
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:50.100]   Email went out to backers on Monday
[01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:54.180]   that you're going to get your money back because it's too
[01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:57.420]   hard to make this work with all the copy protection schemes
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.580]   required by content creators.
[01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:01.660]   Google obviously could figure that out
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:03.020]   but kind of hard to do this.
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:06.180]   It was going to be based on Firefox OS.
[01:49:06.180 --> 01:49:10.140]   And they were selling it for $16.
[01:49:10.140 --> 01:49:15.940]   They had partners like Philips and the TV manufacturer TCL.
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:19.220]   But the DRM defeated them.
[01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.100]   That's too bad.
[01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:22.780]   It seems like they would have figured that out
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:25.100]   before they even started.
[01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:26.900]   Well, they might have underestimated
[01:49:26.900 --> 01:49:31.780]   the challenge of getting these content companies to go along.
[01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:34.300]   You could go to Kickstarter with just an idea.
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:37.940]   And yeah, you don't have that kind of due diligence.
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:41.180]   Built in until too late.
[01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:41.820]   Wow.
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:44.300]   Does Kickstarter support reimbursements?
[01:49:44.300 --> 01:49:45.300]   I don't know.
[01:49:45.300 --> 01:49:47.860]   I think they'll have to send an email out saying,
[01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:49.300]   hey, can we give you your money back?
[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:50.660]   Oh, wow.
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:53.300]   That's going to be something.
[01:49:53.300 --> 01:49:55.500]   I don't think that Kickstarter supports reimbursements.
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:50:01.820]   We're going to wrap this thing up with your picks
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:04.940]   and your numbers and your stuff.
[01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:06.940]   And Lynn, I don't know if you remember from last time,
[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:09.500]   but oh, I see you do have a pick.
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:12.380]   Never mind.
[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:14.020]   You're way ahead of me.
[01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:14.540]   I showed it.
[01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:16.660]   They brought you by FreshBooks.
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:18.420]   Now that you're an entrepreneur,
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:21.940]   and you don't have some boss paying you,
[01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:23.380]   you got an invoice, right?
[01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:24.420]   That's the worst.
[01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:27.340]   The worst part of my month, every month, the last day
[01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:31.100]   when I said, oh, no, I got to get my invoices out.
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:33.380]   But the problem is, if you don't send out the invoices,
[01:50:33.380 --> 01:50:34.900]   you don't get the checks.
[01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:36.020]   And you don't get the checks.
[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:37.420]   You don't really have much of a business.
[01:50:37.420 --> 01:50:39.500]   FreshBooks changed my life.
[01:50:39.500 --> 01:50:43.940]   Been 10 years now since I discovered FreshBooks.
[01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:46.820]   The folks who do this make it very easy
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:50.660]   for you to create professional looking invoices that
[01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:55.700]   will save you time billing and improve the payment time.
[01:50:55.700 --> 01:50:59.940]   In fact, on the average, FreshBooks users
[01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:02.620]   get paid five days faster.
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:03.500]   Take you about a minute.
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:06.780]   Five million people are using it right now to save time billing.
[01:51:06.780 --> 01:51:08.100]   It's also online accounting.
[01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:11.100]   You're going to get reports that you can easily use come tax
[01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:12.740]   time.
[01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:15.060]   It makes it easy to manage your expenses as well.
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:16.740]   You can literally use the FreshBooks app
[01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:19.180]   to take pictures of expenses and integrate them
[01:51:19.180 --> 01:51:22.420]   right into the invoices.
[01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:25.260]   Keep track of billable hours on the go.
[01:51:25.260 --> 01:51:27.340]   Again, integrate it right into the invoice.
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:29.140]   And if you ever need help or have a question
[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:31.220]   or want a feature added, they're very good.
[01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:35.580]   FreshBooks support rock stars are fabulous.
[01:51:35.580 --> 01:51:38.660]   Nice people in the FreshBooks offices will help you.
[01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:40.540]   Getting started is simple, totally free.
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:42.980]   30 days, yours, no obligation.
[01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:45.340]   Go to freshbooks.com/twig.
[01:51:45.340 --> 01:51:47.220]   Don't forget to tell them you heard about it on twig
[01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:49.060]   in that form there when you fill it out.
[01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:51.580]   30 days, free.
[01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:53.500]   If you're still doing invoices by hand
[01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:55.900]   or in a Microsoft Word template or Excel or something
[01:51:55.900 --> 01:51:57.580]   like that, you trust me.
[01:51:57.580 --> 01:51:58.940]   You've got to try this.
[01:51:58.940 --> 01:52:01.780]   Changed my-- rocked my world.
[01:52:01.780 --> 01:52:06.620]   FreshBooks.com/twig.
[01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:08.180]   We didn't ask you, Gina.
[01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:11.060]   So Makerbase, which we have talked about before,
[01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:13.620]   makerba.se.
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:15.780]   Yes, a .se.
[01:52:15.780 --> 01:52:18.220]   Thanks to the country of Sweden for that.
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:20.020]   Yeah, yes, thank you Sweden.
[01:52:20.020 --> 01:52:22.500]   It's a great site that lets makers--
[01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:24.140]   it's a database of people who create stuff--
[01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:27.940]   podcast books, art, whatever, music.
[01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:30.140]   And it lets makers create an entry.
[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:31.620]   It's kind of like a Wikipedia for makers.
[01:52:31.620 --> 01:52:33.020]   Is that a good way to describe it?
[01:52:33.020 --> 01:52:35.220]   Yeah, it was very much like, yeah, it's
[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:38.140]   IMDb for apps and digital culture.
[01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:39.220]   So it's the liner notes.
[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:39.940]   It's the credits.
[01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:43.260]   It's the credits role for apps and, like you said,
[01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:46.940]   podcasts, web series, software services websites,
[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:48.940]   and it's live now.
[01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:50.860]   And it's completely editable by everyone.
[01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:54.220]   So it's just like Wikipedia in that I can add you,
[01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:56.940]   and I can add you as-- and I have added you--
[01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:57.780]   Thank you.
[01:52:57.780 --> 01:53:02.700]   --as the host of all the various shows at TWIT.
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:04.660]   So it's makers and projects.
[01:53:04.660 --> 01:53:06.700]   And we really don't have a whole lot of guidelines
[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:08.540]   about what makes a maker or a project.
[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:11.780]   It's the most liberal use the word maker you can imagine.
[01:53:11.780 --> 01:53:13.660]   But only that a project is not a company.
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:15.660]   So it's a thing.
[01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:17.940]   So that's why on your page of the OE listed all your shows,
[01:53:17.940 --> 01:53:19.940]   for example, but not TWIT the company.
[01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:20.780]   OK, that makes sense.
[01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:22.940]   So that's not really our only guideline is that it's a thing.
[01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:26.660]   It's some sort of digital project.
[01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:28.340]   So yeah, it's really a lot of fun.
[01:53:28.340 --> 01:53:30.580]   And it just opened up to the public yesterday.
[01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:32.260]   And we've gotten a really great response.
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:33.140]   It's very simple.
[01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:35.620]   This is an MVP.
[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:37.420]   Sits in the big chair, really.
[01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:38.900]   You sit in the big chair.
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:39.380]   You do?
[01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:42.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:43.380]   That's me.
[01:53:43.380 --> 01:53:45.380]   I was trying to figure out how to describe your role.
[01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:46.220]   And that's really fun.
[01:53:46.220 --> 01:53:47.140]   I sit in the big chair.
[01:53:47.140 --> 01:53:48.140]   That's pretty much what I do.
[01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:49.300]   Or the big ball, one or the other.
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:50.460]   Go to this week in Google.
[01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:53.260]   I want you to see what I put down for Jeff
[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:55.460]   on this week in Google page.
[01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:57.260]   Rance about Germany and how hard it is
[01:53:57.260 --> 01:53:59.580]   to live with multiple Google accounts.
[01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:00.740]   Pretty accurate.
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:02.540]   Slowly I turn.
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:04.700]   Pretty accurate.
[01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:05.580]   Yep.
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:06.740]   Smiles a lot.
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:07.900]   That's nice.
[01:54:07.900 --> 01:54:08.940]   Jason runs the board.
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:10.540]   This is good.
[01:54:10.540 --> 01:54:12.100]   And we should manage it, too.
[01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:13.180]   I mean, we can.
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:16.260]   Unlike Wikipedia, we're allowed to enter our own stuff.
[01:54:16.260 --> 01:54:16.740]   Yes.
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:18.420]   You don't have to be a Wikipedia word.
[01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:21.900]   Everybody, we encourage everyone to add at their own page
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:23.900]   and to add their own roles and to change things
[01:54:23.900 --> 01:54:25.100]   and to clarify things.
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:25.820]   Absolutely.
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:28.420]   Yeah.
[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:30.660]   So I can easily change all this.
[01:54:30.660 --> 01:54:31.580]   And that's nice.
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:32.100]   Everything is better.
[01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:32.580]   Yeah.
[01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:33.100]   Yeah.
[01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:33.100]   Yeah.
[01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:35.180]   Or you can archive things.
[01:54:35.180 --> 01:54:36.740]   So yeah, it's been really fun.
[01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:39.540]   We wanted to weigh Anil Dash and my co-founder and I.
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:40.660]   And this is a think up product.
[01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:41.620]   This is a product from Think Up.
[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:43.380]   So it's sort of Think Up sibling.
[01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:46.620]   We wanted a way for people to give credit to the folks who
[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:48.420]   make the things that we love.
[01:54:48.420 --> 01:54:50.260]   And you can go to any company page
[01:54:50.260 --> 01:54:53.580]   and see the founders and the C-suite folks, right?
[01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:56.100]   But you don't get to see the designers and the copywriters
[01:54:56.100 --> 01:55:00.940]   and particularly community managers and the customer
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:01.620]   support folks.
[01:55:01.620 --> 01:55:05.100]   We want everyone to be listed on all these pages.
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:07.780]   So that's our goal.
[01:55:07.780 --> 01:55:10.620]   Now, tell us, you launched yesterday.
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:11.100]   Yeah.
[01:55:11.100 --> 01:55:13.300]   We've seen it before in beta, but it's now out.
[01:55:13.300 --> 01:55:14.740]   And anybody can use it.
[01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:16.460]   That's right.
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:18.980]   Tell us where you launched.
[01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:21.140]   We had a really exciting day yesterday.
[01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:25.740]   We were invited to the White House's first ever demo day,
[01:55:25.740 --> 01:55:30.260]   which was an event that was focused on diverse engineers--
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:33.100]   entrepreneurs, excuse me-- diverse entrepreneurs.
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:34.460]   So this was so cool.
[01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:37.660]   Anil, my co-founder and I, got to go to the White House
[01:55:37.660 --> 01:55:39.740]   and visit the East Wing where--
[01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:42.740]   it happened to be the president's birthday yesterday also.
[01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:45.180]   But there were several different companies that had their
[01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:48.500]   products laid out who demoed to the president in person.
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:52.180]   He got off and made some amazing remarks about the state
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:56.060]   of our industry, how abysmal the numbers are, how less than 3%
[01:55:56.060 --> 01:56:01.900]   of venture capital goes to founding teams that are African-American.
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:05.460]   People might underrepresented minorities or female-founded.
[01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:09.620]   And his message was like, if we're going to win the game,
[01:56:09.620 --> 01:56:11.860]   we've got to have everybody on the field that we have to create
[01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:13.620]   access and opportunities for everyone.
[01:56:13.620 --> 01:56:16.500]   And that's one of our big goals with Makerbase is that people
[01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:19.980]   who aspire to be a digital entrepreneur and make apps can
[01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:22.700]   go to these pages and look up who made this app that I love,
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:26.460]   how can I get in touch with this person, how can I help?
[01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:28.420]   Are you featured anywhere in this video?
[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:29.900]   I'd sure like to see.
[01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:33.180]   Anil and I didn't demo in front of the president.
[01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:35.340]   There were lots of companies in very little time,
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:37.380]   as you would expect.
[01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:38.980]   But yeah, this is amazing.
[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:41.820]   We were literally in the room, kind of right next to them,
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:43.500]   and then after the demo.
[01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:45.740]   And did some and made some remarks.
[01:56:45.740 --> 01:56:46.740]   Yeah, here we go.
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:47.660]   And then he spoke here.
[01:56:47.660 --> 01:56:50.420]   And then the whole room sang, "I'm happy birthday."
[01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:52.900]   My favorite part of this, though, at the end of his remarks,
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:56:55.380]   he said, it's amazing to have all these smart people who
[01:56:55.380 --> 01:56:57.100]   are building businesses in this room.
[01:56:57.100 --> 01:56:58.460]   I want you all to keep in mind that I'm
[01:56:58.460 --> 01:57:00.020]   going to be out of a job and looking at mine.
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:02.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:05.020]   Keep mine.
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:06.100]   Just keep me in mind.
[01:57:06.100 --> 01:57:07.620]   I wouldn't mind working for a startup.
[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:09.620]   You guys are pretty cool.
[01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:10.660]   This is really neat.
[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:11.820]   This is really neat.
[01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:14.260]   Congratulations for being invited.
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:14.940]   Thank you.
[01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:17.180]   What an honor that is.
[01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:18.980]   It was you, John, or--
[01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:20.220]   Yeah.
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:21.300]   Really cool.
[01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:22.300]   It was a great amount.
[01:57:22.300 --> 01:57:22.800]   And--
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:23.620]   --a new world tie.
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:25.380]   Did Anil wear a tie?
[01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:26.820]   Or a suit, Anil wore a tie.
[01:57:26.820 --> 01:57:28.340]   Anil, Anil, it's OK to get in a tie.
[01:57:28.340 --> 01:57:31.260]   I was in a business suit, which was very rarely happened.
[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:35.020]   Did you go buy a business suit just for this?
[01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:37.660]   I have my one suit for such occasions.
[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:38.160]   Yes.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:38.660]   So do I.
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:39.540]   I have one suit.
[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:41.620]   That should be enough for any human.
[01:57:41.620 --> 01:57:43.020]   Time to guy in the background.
[01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:44.060]   And he's got the t-shirt on.
[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:44.940]   Yeah, that's all right.
[01:57:44.940 --> 01:57:46.620]   He's got the company t-shirts.
[01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:47.500]   Yeah, that wasn't usual.
[01:57:47.500 --> 01:57:48.740]   Most people were very--
[01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:50.660]   I would dress up to meet the president, I think.
[01:57:50.660 --> 01:57:52.140]   Oh, yes.
[01:57:52.140 --> 01:57:52.620]   Yeah.
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:55.580]   But he is-- I mean, it looks like--
[01:57:55.580 --> 01:57:57.580]   did it feel like he really got what was going on,
[01:57:57.580 --> 01:57:59.300]   or was it a press opportunity?
[01:57:59.300 --> 01:58:02.580]   It was really interesting to listen to the president take
[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:04.660]   pitches, because he doesn't work in tech.
[01:58:04.660 --> 01:58:05.460]   He's not a VC.
[01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:08.300]   So I mean, I have to say, he did such a good job
[01:58:08.300 --> 01:58:10.420]   of listening to the pitch and then saying, OK,
[01:58:10.420 --> 01:58:12.900]   so if I'm this person and I have this problem,
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:15.700]   your product helps me this way.
[01:58:15.700 --> 01:58:19.500]   But you don't often hear the president speak kind of haltingly
[01:58:19.500 --> 01:58:20.380]   or ask questions.
[01:58:20.380 --> 01:58:22.220]   You know, like you can tell that he was--
[01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:23.500]   He was thinking.
[01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:25.060]   He was thinking and it's not what he does.
[01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:26.420]   He doesn't speak in tech terms.
[01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:27.900]   It wasn't prepped.
[01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:28.740]   Yeah, that's nice.
[01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:30.620]   It's not something very endearing about that, actually.
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:32.540]   And a couple of years, Donald Trump will do this.
[01:58:32.540 --> 01:58:34.900]   He'll just say, you're fired to everybody he meets.
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:36.980]   It'll be very, very exciting.
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:37.500]   I can't wait.
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:38.500]   He told every entrepreneur in the--
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:39.500]   Are you Mexican?
[01:58:39.500 --> 01:58:41.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:42.500]   He said the opposite.
[01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:43.700]   The president said to every entrepreneur,
[01:58:43.700 --> 01:58:44.420]   I'm proud of you.
[01:58:44.420 --> 01:58:46.500]   Let's take a picture after every demo.
[01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:47.260]   It was really great.
[01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:47.940]   It was incredible.
[01:58:47.940 --> 01:58:49.580]   Yeah, neat.
[01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:50.500]   Well, congratulations.
[01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:52.380]   And everybody should go to makerbase.
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:54.660]   Makerbay.se.
[01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:56.900]   Maker-- our Maker Bays are our users.
[01:58:56.900 --> 01:58:57.900]   Maker Bays?
[01:58:57.900 --> 01:58:58.900]   I see.
[01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:00.180]   Maker Bays.
[01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:01.260]   Go there right now.
[01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:03.420]   You'll love that.
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:07.860]   And Gina, did you have a tip for us?
[01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:10.660]   Yeah, kind of along these lines, I wanted to point out--
[01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:12.740]   and Lynne was in on this as well--
[01:59:12.740 --> 01:59:14.660]   this hashtag-- I don't know if you guys have seen this--
[01:59:14.660 --> 01:59:16.020]   I look like an engineer.
[01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:16.460]   Yes.
[01:59:16.460 --> 01:59:18.900]   What a great-- so it started with a medium post
[01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:21.260]   by an engineer at--
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:22.700]   I think I log in.
[01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:24.540]   I think his company called something like that.
[01:59:24.540 --> 01:59:27.940]   And she was on a billboard in an ad campaign that ran on Bart.
[01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:31.580]   And there was all this feedback about this ad campaign,
[01:59:31.580 --> 01:59:34.020]   particularly about her photo, where people were saying,
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:35.460]   engineers don't look like this.
[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:36.420]   They should-- they could--
[01:59:36.420 --> 01:59:37.540]   How insulting is that?
[01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:39.100]   She's too cute.
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:40.100]   You know?
[01:59:40.100 --> 01:59:40.860]   Yes, too sexy.
[01:59:40.860 --> 01:59:42.220]   They shouldn't really found somebody who actually
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:43.100]   was an engineer.
[01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:45.220]   She is actually an engineer.
[01:59:45.220 --> 01:59:47.540]   So she wrote this medium piece and then kind of started
[01:59:47.540 --> 01:59:49.500]   this hashtag, I look like an engineer.
[01:59:49.500 --> 01:59:50.860]   Let me tell you, if you search for I
[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:53.260]   look like an engineer on Twitter, it is really--
[01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:56.580]   it's an amazing, amazing collection of pictures
[01:59:56.580 --> 01:59:57.980]   of gorgeous humans.
[01:59:57.980 --> 02:00:01.140]   I mean, just of all shapes and sizes and colors and genders
[02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:02.900]   and identities, and it's really incredible.
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:05.220]   So that's my tip for--
[02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:06.820]   It made me wish I were an engineer,
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:07.980]   so I could--
[02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:10.940]   Yeah, I'm a great mind is I look like a doofus.
[02:00:10.940 --> 02:00:12.940]   I look like a journalism professor.
[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:13.900]   Oh, I look like a--
[02:00:13.900 --> 02:00:15.140]   I was worried as I look.
[02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:15.980]   --podcast her.
[02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:17.100]   I should do hashtag.
[02:00:17.100 --> 02:00:18.300]   I look like a podcaster.
[02:00:18.300 --> 02:00:19.460]   I'm a podcaster.
[02:00:19.460 --> 02:00:21.940]   I wonder what that would look like.
[02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:22.460]   Here it is.
[02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:24.380]   It's actually the first thing that comes up when you type,
[02:00:24.380 --> 02:00:25.580]   I look like--
[02:00:25.580 --> 02:00:27.420]   this is really, really neat.
[02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:30.540]   The WordPress engine--
[02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:31.660]   there she is again.
[02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:33.220]   A lot of pictures of her and then
[02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:35.740]   some lot of other engineers.
[02:00:35.740 --> 02:00:36.900]   See that one, why?
[02:00:36.900 --> 02:00:37.780]   Yeah.
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:38.980]   Yeah, I think those are the top tweets.
[02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:41.020]   The top tweets are really focused on her.
[02:00:41.020 --> 02:00:42.260]   Yeah, a lot of her.
[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:42.780]   Yeah.
[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:45.580]   Yeah, but then it gets--
[02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:46.700]   as you said that.
[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:50.140]   This is inspiring for any young women who are watching
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:53.460]   and saying, gee, engineers don't look like me.
[02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:54.980]   There's Lady Ada.
[02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:56.460]   That's an engineer, boy.
[02:00:56.460 --> 02:00:57.300]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:57.300 --> 02:00:59.300]   Yeah, that's nice.
[02:00:59.300 --> 02:01:02.220]   This is great.
[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:04.580]   Grace Hopper, yeah, she looks like an engineer.
[02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:07.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:10.100]   What's the name of the picture that everybody's been loving?
[02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:12.140]   Meme keeps going around every two months.
[02:01:12.140 --> 02:01:18.300]   The NASA engineer, the young woman with the huge pile of code.
[02:01:18.300 --> 02:01:19.300]   Oh, yeah, Margaret Hamilton.
[02:01:19.300 --> 02:01:19.820]   Yeah.
[02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:21.380]   Yeah, Hamilton.
[02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:22.540]   That's my favorite.
[02:01:22.540 --> 02:01:23.540]   This is so cool.
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:26.020]   If you look like an engineer, you should post a picture of yourself
[02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:27.460]   in that hashtag.
[02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:30.460]   I mean, if you are an engineer, look like--
[02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:30.940]   look at that.
[02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:34.300]   My mom, Pearl Hacker, and 20 years plus Sis and analyst,
[02:01:34.300 --> 02:01:38.860]   nuclear physicist, started coding on punch cards.
[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:39.380]   Cribal.
[02:01:39.380 --> 02:01:40.740]   That's awesome.
[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:44.340]   Really, this is just-- I love this hashtag.
[02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:45.660]   Love it.
[02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:46.420]   It's so great.
[02:01:46.420 --> 02:01:50.220]   Yeah, it's-- I can't stop.
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:51.180]   It's like celebrity kitchens.
[02:01:51.180 --> 02:01:52.180]   Yeah.
[02:01:52.180 --> 02:01:53.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:53.680]   Yeah, it is.
[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:54.980]   It's better than celebrity kitchens.
[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:56.740]   And Jeannie, you can go try to hire them all.
[02:01:56.740 --> 02:01:57.100]   That's just--
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:58.300]   Yeah, right.
[02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:00.460]   Now I can know how to find an engineer.
[02:02:00.460 --> 02:02:01.540]   It's incredible.
[02:02:01.540 --> 02:02:03.780]   She's working on Watson.
[02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:04.500]   Love it.
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:05.620]   Love it.
[02:02:05.620 --> 02:02:06.180]   There you go.
[02:02:06.180 --> 02:02:08.140]   So now, any tech company that says,
[02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:11.460]   I don't know where to find women--
[02:02:11.460 --> 02:02:12.340]   Isn't paying attention.
[02:02:12.340 --> 02:02:13.140]   Yes.
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:15.020]   That's a very good point.
[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:16.380]   Proof you're not paying attention.
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:17.740]   There's a few here.
[02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:19.180]   You've got a file folder full of them.
[02:02:19.180 --> 02:02:19.980]   Yep.
[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:22.620]   I've done LISPR, Lang Python, and JavaScript.
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:25.580]   I make the NPM CLI work.
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:27.580]   Never wear jeans and a t-shirt.
[02:02:27.580 --> 02:02:29.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:31.260]   Love it.
[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:34.420]   Getting some NPM folks in here, the Node Package Manager.
[02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:36.020]   That's awesome.
[02:02:36.020 --> 02:02:37.660]   Nice.
[02:02:37.660 --> 02:02:39.500]   Love this.
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:42.300]   Augmented reality, biometrics, piloted drone.
[02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:47.340]   All right.
[02:02:47.340 --> 02:02:49.060]   Jeff, you're number of the week.
[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:49.540]   Oh, right.
[02:02:49.540 --> 02:02:51.820]   So what we might as well do for giving the week
[02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:54.540]   a bunch of Trump numbers?
[02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:55.300]   We can bear it here.
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:55.980]   Where to go?
[02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:59.420]   We're very excited about tomorrow's--
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:01.340]   I've started an intrepidacious--
[02:03:01.340 --> 02:03:06.140]   Locked off time for the big GOP debate.
[02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:06.620]   Hold on.
[02:03:06.620 --> 02:03:07.860]   I got the ad.
[02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:08.860]   Lock, Monty, here.
[02:03:08.860 --> 02:03:09.300]   It's like, yes.
[02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:09.820]   All right.
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:10.980]   No, what's the wrong link?
[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:11.540]   I'm an idiot.
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:12.020]   I'm an idiot.
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:12.500]   I'm an idiot.
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:13.580]   Hold on.
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:14.020]   Where is it?
[02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:15.900]   How tall is Hillary Clinton?
[02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:17.900]   Are these Google queries?
[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:18.380]   Yes.
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:20.500]   So only New Hampshire--
[02:03:20.500 --> 02:03:26.780]   People asked about Donald Trump is the most asked about
[02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:29.980]   candidate in Google in 49 states,
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:33.980]   except in Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:35.140]   That's it.
[02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:37.260]   Among the questions about his age,
[02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:39.020]   how much he's worth 10 million?
[02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:40.540]   Yeah.
[02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:42.180]   Will Donald Trump be president?
[02:03:42.180 --> 02:03:43.980]   Like, Google's going to know--
[02:03:43.980 --> 02:03:46.180]   Guy, you know, doesn't Google know these things?
[02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:48.100]   If you type in will Donald Trump,
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:50.260]   you'll see that I think that the moral question will he
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:51.460]   be a good president?
[02:03:51.460 --> 02:03:52.740]   I don't know how Google would know that.
[02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:54.900]   So I think folks, we need to--
[02:03:54.900 --> 02:03:56.740]   Google bomb that, folks.
[02:03:56.740 --> 02:03:58.740]   Donald Trump be president.
[02:03:58.740 --> 02:04:00.940]   Will Donald Trump make a good president?
[02:04:00.940 --> 02:04:02.140]   Will he win the presidency?
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:03.140]   Will he run?
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:04.460]   Will he run for president?
[02:04:04.460 --> 02:04:06.380]   Those are old, obviously.
[02:04:06.380 --> 02:04:09.580]   3.3 million tweets in the past month,
[02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:13.340]   100,000 tweets in the 24 hours ending Tuesday.
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:17.380]   Meanwhile, Jeb Bush had only 27,000 during the same period
[02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:20.860]   and 727,000 in the past month.
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:23.340]   However, I should point out the number one trending story
[02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:26.660]   on Google last night was the reported break
[02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:28.980]   up of Kermit, the Frog, and Miss Piggy.
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:31.300]   What a PR bunch of--
[02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:32.900]   Who are you?
[02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:34.860]   I missed this.
[02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:38.020]   Well, you're obviously not paying much attention.
[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:41.260]   I guess I get a headband here.
[02:04:41.260 --> 02:04:44.060]   And I presume this is to promote the new Muppet show,
[02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:46.740]   which I'll be launching any moment now.
[02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:51.420]   OK.
[02:04:51.420 --> 02:04:52.420]   Well, we fell for it.
[02:04:55.860 --> 02:04:58.380]   Lynn, what's your pick of the week?
[02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:01.380]   Well, it's neither an app or a tip.
[02:05:01.380 --> 02:05:03.700]   It's just basically kind of dovetails.
[02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:06.140]   What Gina was talking about with--
[02:05:06.140 --> 02:05:09.100]   I look like an engineer and also being at demo day,
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:13.060]   where there's all this talk about increasing diversity in tech.
[02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:17.220]   Today, I noticed on motherboard, which is one of ISIS sites,
[02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:20.940]   that the Congressional Black Caucus went to Silicon Valley
[02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:26.060]   to talk to a bunch of tech companies like Apple and Google
[02:05:26.060 --> 02:05:28.460]   and try to get some really concrete plans around,
[02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:30.500]   kind of like the way Pinterest has laid out
[02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:33.660]   numbers and goals for that diversity,
[02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:35.940]   for their inclusion plans.
[02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:40.300]   I think this to me is very laudable,
[02:05:40.300 --> 02:05:43.060]   because now we can really start seeing real plans
[02:05:43.060 --> 02:05:45.140]   around diversity as not just talk.
[02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:45.660]   Or money.
[02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:47.500]   I mean, a lot of people are putting money behind it,
[02:05:47.500 --> 02:05:48.500]   the intel is--
[02:05:48.500 --> 02:05:49.500]   But money, right.
[02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:50.860]   What is that going to do?
[02:05:50.860 --> 02:05:51.860]   It's not going to do anything.
[02:05:51.860 --> 02:05:54.340]   It's just putting money at a school,
[02:05:54.340 --> 02:05:56.380]   giving a school some money and saying here,
[02:05:56.380 --> 02:05:58.020]   train some students, right?
[02:05:58.020 --> 02:06:01.100]   But what the Congressional Black Caucus is doing
[02:06:01.100 --> 02:06:04.620]   is they want to see long-term goals, as well as short-term
[02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:10.220]   goals, so that there are really plans that create a pipeline
[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:11.260]   for folks.
[02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:12.780]   Fantastic.
[02:06:12.780 --> 02:06:15.540]   Now, in our journalism school, we had a great program this summer.
[02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:19.020]   We went to a bunch of colleges and areas
[02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:23.420]   where historically black colleges and universities and others
[02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:25.220]   and said, give us your best students.
[02:06:25.220 --> 02:06:28.380]   They came to New York, got an internship, got training,
[02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:31.100]   got paid, got here free.
[02:06:31.100 --> 02:06:33.060]   Every company just went gaga.
[02:06:33.060 --> 02:06:34.580]   And that's what you have to do.
[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:36.140]   You have to-- exactly what you just said,
[02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:38.100]   then you have to feed the pipeline.
[02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:39.780]   I talked to a big magazine company today that
[02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:40.660]   should go unnamed.
[02:06:40.660 --> 02:06:41.100]   That's right.
[02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:42.900]   Well, how do we try to appeal to more people?
[02:06:42.900 --> 02:06:44.180]   We've got to hire different people
[02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:46.100]   to say you do the right things in the beginning.
[02:06:46.100 --> 02:06:48.900]   There's no cheap or easy or fast way around that.
[02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:52.140]   You've got to meet it.
[02:06:52.140 --> 02:06:52.660]   Yep.
[02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:55.380]   And it's in every industry.
[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:57.780]   One of the organizations that was at demo day yesterday
[02:06:57.780 --> 02:07:01.500]   is Black Girls Code, which is a fantastic org that
[02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:05.540]   does hackathons for girls, focused, particularly on girls
[02:07:05.540 --> 02:07:06.060]   of color.
[02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:08.700]   And they had a hackathon here in Brooklyn two or three
[02:07:08.700 --> 02:07:09.780]   weekends ago.
[02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:10.460]   And I volunteered.
[02:07:10.460 --> 02:07:11.780]   It was my first time volunteering.
[02:07:11.780 --> 02:07:15.220]   And it was an incredible, incredible event.
[02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:17.340]   These girls were so smart and so insightful.
[02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:20.060]   And let me tell you, it is fascinating to watch
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:25.260]   11 to 17-year-olds design apps.
[02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:27.060]   Being digital natives and growing up
[02:07:27.060 --> 02:07:30.500]   with phones in their pockets is so smart and so interesting.
[02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:32.580]   But Leo is going to say to you, if you're
[02:07:32.580 --> 02:07:34.100]   looking for someone for triangulation,
[02:07:34.100 --> 02:07:36.220]   you should definitely invite Kimberly Bryant, who's
[02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:37.500]   the founder of Black Girls Code.
[02:07:37.500 --> 02:07:40.260]   She's doing a lot to fix the pipeline problem.
[02:07:40.260 --> 02:07:42.500]   And really, I saw firsthand that the events are doing
[02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:42.980]   are amazing.
[02:07:42.980 --> 02:07:45.660]   And I think I'm going to start mentoring a little bit more
[02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:47.580]   as well, really, really great stuff.
[02:07:47.580 --> 02:07:48.460]   Tell me if I'm wrong.
[02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:49.660]   I don't want to insult you, Gina.
[02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:51.140]   You're an engineer.
[02:07:51.140 --> 02:07:54.780]   But coding is not rocket science.
[02:07:54.780 --> 02:07:56.780]   It's not that hard.
[02:07:56.780 --> 02:07:57.180]   Nope.
[02:07:57.180 --> 02:07:59.980]   And so really, it's a question of just choosing to do it.
[02:07:59.980 --> 02:08:03.300]   It's not like, oh, I'm not good at something.
[02:08:03.300 --> 02:08:04.900]   I couldn't-- you know, I'm not brilliant.
[02:08:04.900 --> 02:08:05.660]   I couldn't do it.
[02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:07.700]   No, it's actually--
[02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:08.540]   anybody can code.
[02:08:08.540 --> 02:08:09.620]   Anybody can code.
[02:08:09.620 --> 02:08:10.140]   Right.
[02:08:10.140 --> 02:08:11.580]   But here's the thing, Leo.
[02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:14.300]   It's knowing that it's something you can do.
[02:08:14.300 --> 02:08:15.540]   Precisely.
[02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:19.460]   I mean, I was fortunate enough in high school
[02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:24.020]   to learn basic on Commodore 64, right?
[02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:26.740]   Which led me to have an interest in coding,
[02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:28.100]   which I didn't continue to do.
[02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:31.580]   But I did it for a while for Trampaskal, Cobol,
[02:08:31.580 --> 02:08:33.980]   a bunch of old school languages.
[02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:37.100]   But it's because it was in my high school.
[02:08:37.100 --> 02:08:38.620]   Had it not been in my high school?
[02:08:38.620 --> 02:08:40.300]   Yeah.
[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:41.940]   I didn't know anyone else who coded.
[02:08:41.940 --> 02:08:43.420]   Right.
[02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:45.020]   That's the key.
[02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:46.340]   People can do it.
[02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:48.300]   They just have to know they can do it.
[02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:50.540]   And be given the opportunity to do it.
[02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:51.980]   And it's access to the tools.
[02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:52.900]   It's role models.
[02:08:52.900 --> 02:08:55.540]   I mean, I spoke to a woman at this event who said--
[02:08:55.540 --> 02:08:58.060]   who has been coding for 30 years and said,
[02:08:58.060 --> 02:08:59.700]   she started coding on paper tape.
[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:03.700]   And she said, I have been the only one in the room for years.
[02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:04.700]   Right?
[02:09:04.700 --> 02:09:06.220]   So it's having role models.
[02:09:06.220 --> 02:09:06.860]   It's having mentors.
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:07.660]   It's having access.
[02:09:07.660 --> 02:09:08.660]   It's having--
[02:09:08.660 --> 02:09:10.100]   What it's not having--
[02:09:10.100 --> 02:09:12.580]   is it's not not having ability, because it has nothing
[02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:13.420]   to do with ability.
[02:09:13.420 --> 02:09:13.940]   Right.
[02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:14.940]   Exactly.
[02:09:14.940 --> 02:09:15.940]   That's absolutely true.
[02:09:15.940 --> 02:09:16.940]   It's access.
[02:09:16.940 --> 02:09:17.940]   Right?
[02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:19.860]   It's knowing you can do it and it's access.
[02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:22.980]   And here's why you want to do it.
[02:09:22.980 --> 02:09:26.500]   People who can code are the powerful people going forward
[02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:27.260]   in this world.
[02:09:27.260 --> 02:09:28.940]   They're the ones who will have an opportunity.
[02:09:28.940 --> 02:09:32.020]   They'll have a lever that can make a massive difference.
[02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:32.940]   Plus it's fun.
[02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:34.260]   It's a hell of a fun.
[02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:35.980]   But the thing that's interesting--
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:38.220]   and I don't know that this happens at every school,
[02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:42.780]   but I've had parents tell me that their daughters have
[02:09:42.780 --> 02:09:48.020]   been kind of persuaded not to follow math or not
[02:09:48.020 --> 02:09:49.700]   to follow science.
[02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:50.700]   Right.
[02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:51.700]   Right.
[02:09:51.700 --> 02:09:53.500]   Have parents tell me that all the time?
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:54.500]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:57.300]   Even by other women, which really makes me sad.
[02:09:57.300 --> 02:09:59.660]   And there's this specter of hard math?
[02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:01.140]   I mean, I'm not--
[02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:02.140]   It's not.
[02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:03.140]   I'm not--
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:04.140]   Exactly.
[02:10:04.140 --> 02:10:05.140]   A huge mathematician, right?
[02:10:05.140 --> 02:10:06.140]   Like, it's not--
[02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:07.140]   There's not--
[02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:09.140]   You did a lot of calculus on Makerbase?
[02:10:09.140 --> 02:10:11.300]   No, I mean, it's a logic.
[02:10:11.300 --> 02:10:13.060]   And it's logic flows, right?
[02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:14.820]   And I mean, it's really not-- it's not that.
[02:10:14.820 --> 02:10:18.180]   So I think a lot of it is just sort of busting those myths
[02:10:18.180 --> 02:10:22.460]   and access and showing girls in particular, like, hey,
[02:10:22.460 --> 02:10:25.220]   you don't want to be just the person using this stuff.
[02:10:25.220 --> 02:10:26.620]   You want to be the person creating this.
[02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:27.660]   And also being an atmosphere.
[02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:31.260]   One of them are very proud to have a woman
[02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:33.460]   named Adam Bernier as one of our graduates who
[02:10:33.460 --> 02:10:34.860]   started a company called Skill Crush.
[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:36.460]   And she goes back and forth on this.
[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:38.180]   But the reason she started it really was that she taught
[02:10:38.180 --> 02:10:41.540]   herself to code, but the bro culture around it.
[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:42.700]   Yeah, that's sad.
[02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:43.700]   Just was an issue.
[02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:46.100]   And so she says it sometimes doesn't say it
[02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:47.940]   other times, but it's basically a company aimed to teach women
[02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:49.740]   to code.
[02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:52.660]   And that's not to say that the risk here is, well, no women
[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:54.500]   aren't different in that sense.
[02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:56.540]   And you're not trying to get a wise--
[02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:57.540]   they're learning.
[02:10:57.540 --> 02:11:00.060]   But you are trying to say that maybe the way a guy's teaching
[02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:02.900]   guys and coming in, maybe it's not the natural and best way
[02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:03.900]   to teach.
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:05.980]   And so we need other methods and other ways.
[02:11:05.980 --> 02:11:06.500]   I also--
[02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:06.500]   Right.
[02:11:06.500 --> 02:11:07.780]   --I've been going through a little learning
[02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:08.780]   to project myself.
[02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:11.340]   And you'll be amused at this.
[02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:14.700]   So I signed up for the basic coding course, the Udacity
[02:11:14.700 --> 02:11:15.220]   in hand order--
[02:11:15.220 --> 02:11:15.980]   Oh, good for you.
[02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:16.480]   Good for you.
[02:11:16.480 --> 02:11:17.380]   Oh, that's great.
[02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:19.100]   Yeah, yeah, I thought, but you know what?
[02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:21.060]   You're going to laugh.
[02:11:21.060 --> 02:11:23.380]   Because of course, I wanted to be able to do it in code.
[02:11:23.380 --> 02:11:26.220]   Even all journalist professors can learn to code.
[02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:27.700]   I'm also taking Spanish right now.
[02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:29.140]   Well, I don't know about that.
[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:30.260]   That's going to be hard.
[02:11:30.260 --> 02:11:30.700]   That's hard.
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:31.700]   You're a German speaker.
[02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:33.060]   It's going to be tough to learn Spanish.
[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:34.260]   No, I spent your old.
[02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:35.420]   Yeah, it's not working out well.
[02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:36.140]   No, this is good.
[02:11:36.140 --> 02:11:36.740]   This is good.
[02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:37.260]   You got to go.
[02:11:37.260 --> 02:11:40.100]   No, no, but I couldn't do it on my Chromebook.
[02:11:40.100 --> 02:11:41.020]   And I said, I don't want to--
[02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:44.340]   Oh, you can't do Udacity on a Chromebook?
[02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:46.700]   No, because you need to download the stuff to do the stuff.
[02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:48.540]   [SIGHS]
[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:49.540]   Oh, that's a bomb.
[02:11:49.540 --> 02:11:51.540]   What language were you learning?
[02:11:51.540 --> 02:11:53.300]   Oh, I forget what they were going to do it in.
[02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:54.780]   It was just starting.
[02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:57.060]   You can do what we can help you.
[02:11:57.060 --> 02:11:58.460]   So the nice thing about the Chromebook--
[02:11:58.460 --> 02:11:59.700]   because I wanted to solve this too,
[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:02.220]   because I wanted to code on a Chromebook.
[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:05.180]   K-O-D-I-N-G.
[02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:07.020]   Oh, OK, that's easy to remember.
[02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:10.260]   Go to www.python.com.
[02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:12.580]   Because you can't put Python on a Chromebook,
[02:12:12.580 --> 02:12:15.940]   but you can log into a computer running Go Python Ruby.
[02:12:15.940 --> 02:12:16.460]   Exactly.
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:18.260]   The problem with Udacity is obviously
[02:12:18.260 --> 02:12:20.140]   to be able to teach everybody the same,
[02:12:20.140 --> 02:12:22.100]   they're using some of the same tools.
[02:12:22.100 --> 02:12:23.940]   I will be shocked if you couldn't do--
[02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:26.700]   unless it's Windows-based or Mac-based--
[02:12:26.700 --> 02:12:29.580]   if you couldn't do-- this is-- you'll get a Unix instance.
[02:12:29.580 --> 02:12:31.980]   It's free for what you want to do.
[02:12:31.980 --> 02:12:35.260]   You'll get a Unix instance with all the languages.
[02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:38.940]   You'll get a very nice editor with syntax checking
[02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:42.380]   and coloring and all of that stuff.
[02:12:42.380 --> 02:12:45.100]   It gives you a chance to play with all this kind of stuff.
[02:12:45.100 --> 02:12:47.180]   And this is a product called Chromebook.
[02:12:47.180 --> 02:12:50.540]   Yeah, the beginning of this is HTML, which even I can--
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:51.580]   yeah, can I do with that?
[02:12:51.580 --> 02:12:54.980]   At least to see if coding will do the things you need to do
[02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:55.820]   in order to take your course.
[02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:57.060]   Well, just to be able to-- yeah, I mean,
[02:12:57.060 --> 02:12:58.620]   because here I am when I screw about it.
[02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:00.100]   And yeah, I've got some familiar with it.
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:02.660]   I've been doing HTML for years, but that's not coding.
[02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:04.020]   That's markup.
[02:13:04.020 --> 02:13:05.020]   Yeah.
[02:13:05.020 --> 02:13:08.260]   And yeah, I learned a bit of basic way back many years ago,
[02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:10.700]   but that's-- if you don't--
[02:13:10.700 --> 02:13:14.100]   Lynn used that as the jumping off point for a life
[02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:15.660]   that I dropped.
[02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:18.700]   So yeah, I should try to do it, and I want to be able to do it
[02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:19.180]   easily.
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:21.740]   Actually, Alan Kay says the first language you learn
[02:13:21.740 --> 02:13:23.580]   will imprint you for the rest of your life.
[02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:26.780]   So it's really important that you don't learn basic
[02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:28.140]   whatever you do.
[02:13:28.140 --> 02:13:29.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:29.620]   I've forgotten.
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:30.140]   Good.
[02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:33.020]   Let's hope that those pathways never really took.
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:37.020]   Why don't you just put Linux on your Chromebook?
[02:13:37.020 --> 02:13:38.020]   He did that.
[02:13:38.020 --> 02:13:38.020]   He did that.
[02:13:38.020 --> 02:13:39.020]   He did that.
[02:13:39.020 --> 02:13:40.020]   The developer channel.
[02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:41.020]   And it gets buggy.
[02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:42.020]   That's--
[02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:43.020]   Do this.
[02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:44.020]   I mean, serious, it's free.
[02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:45.020]   There is a paid version.
[02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:47.020]   I use the paid version, but it's free.
[02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:49.660]   And it basically gives you a development environment
[02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:52.260]   that you log into on your Chromebook.
[02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:54.660]   And so I mean, I've been able to use this to write code.
[02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:56.260]   No problem.
[02:13:56.260 --> 02:14:00.940]   So you'd ask if he has these nanodegrees now in full stack
[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:07.140]   development, iOS, Android, basic programming, data analysis.
[02:14:07.140 --> 02:14:08.300]   And I think there's one more.
[02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:09.300]   Two or a bucks a month.
[02:14:09.300 --> 02:14:10.300]   I'm doing the Android one.
[02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:11.300]   Yeah.
[02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:12.300]   Nice.
[02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:14.300]   I'm going to be with all these nanoductors.
[02:14:14.300 --> 02:14:16.300]   It's not the intro to Android.
[02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:18.260]   It's intermediate Android.
[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:22.140]   It's for Java programmers, people who program in Java.
[02:14:22.140 --> 02:14:23.020]   And it's great.
[02:14:23.020 --> 02:14:25.380]   I've been really enjoying it.
[02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:26.860]   I make an Android app.
[02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:29.780]   Everything I learned, I sort of top myself piecemeal.
[02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:32.380]   I might have contributors say, hey, this is a better way to do this.
[02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:34.060]   Doing this course, I'm really learning.
[02:14:34.060 --> 02:14:37.300]   I'm getting kind of the context and the back story.
[02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:39.260]   So it's been really-- I've actually really learned a lot.
[02:14:39.260 --> 02:14:39.900]   I've been enjoying it.
[02:14:39.900 --> 02:14:40.860]   I've been impressed with Udacity.
[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:41.860]   It's been great.
[02:14:41.860 --> 02:14:42.860]   I think it's very good.
[02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:44.060]   Yeah, Jake-- son, Jake, signed it up
[02:14:44.060 --> 02:14:46.060]   for the full stack development.
[02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:48.460]   And so you were doing the introduction to programming?
[02:14:48.460 --> 02:14:49.460]   I was doing the introduction.
[02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:50.460]   Yeah, that's fine.
[02:14:50.460 --> 02:14:55.460]   It's Python and CSS, both of which you can do on coding,
[02:14:55.460 --> 02:14:58.860]   unless they want you to have a Windows Python ID or something
[02:14:58.860 --> 02:14:59.860]   like that.
[02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:01.060]   But I bet you they don't.
[02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:03.980]   They had to download certain programs to use and to share stuff.
[02:15:03.980 --> 02:15:06.540]   But I might try it again and see if I can't do it.
[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:07.540]   I have to look at that.
[02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:08.540]   I'm looking at that.
[02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:09.540]   I just don't want to have to carry it on.
[02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:10.540]   I want to be able to do it.
[02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:11.540]   But these are not free.
[02:15:11.540 --> 02:15:12.540]   This is $200 a month.
[02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:16.580]   No, it's-- but as they say, it's an Android degree.
[02:15:16.580 --> 02:15:18.940]   The idea here is-- and I'm doing similar--
[02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:22.220]   similar to CUNY-- if you go to General Assembly,
[02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:23.780]   you know nothing.
[02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:27.420]   And you go in and say, teach me Ruby.
[02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:29.300]   I don't know how long it takes, six weeks, whatever you leave,
[02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:30.460]   you can get a job.
[02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:31.780]   You were certified as saying--
[02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:32.780]   Are you looking for something else?
[02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:33.780]   Are you looking for a job?
[02:15:33.780 --> 02:15:35.300]   I think I might need it.
[02:15:35.300 --> 02:15:36.300]   Pythonista?
[02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:37.300]   I thought.
[02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:38.740]   I think I got cheated on hiring me.
[02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:43.900]   But I think that's really important,
[02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:45.980]   is training people for entirely new jobs that exist
[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:48.260]   and being able to go in and come out with a job.
[02:15:48.260 --> 02:15:50.020]   And what's happening in General Assembly
[02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:52.500]   is a lot of-- your art history majors are going in there
[02:15:52.500 --> 02:15:54.260]   saying, OK, now what do I do?
[02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:55.300]   And they can create something.
[02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:56.940]   So when journalism, we're going to do the same thing
[02:15:56.940 --> 02:15:59.220]   with product development, project management, data analysis,
[02:15:59.220 --> 02:16:00.300]   those kinds of things.
[02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:03.020]   Udacity lets you go in and become an iOS developer,
[02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:04.700]   or an Android developer.
[02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:08.100]   And I think that's-- it's competency-based,
[02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:09.380]   outcomes-based education.
[02:16:09.380 --> 02:16:10.140]   I think it's great.
[02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:10.860]   This is not bad.
[02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:13.900]   One of your instructors is Steve Hoffman, the guy who wrote
[02:16:13.900 --> 02:16:17.140]   Reddit and is actually now CEO.
[02:16:17.140 --> 02:16:19.340]   One of my instructors is a Rita Meyers doing a bunch
[02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:21.100]   of the videos for the Android thing.
[02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:22.460]   And it's been interesting.
[02:16:22.460 --> 02:16:25.500]   I'm not putting myself on the market for jobs
[02:16:25.500 --> 02:16:28.860]   and Android developer, but this course is very much focused
[02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:29.260]   that way.
[02:16:29.260 --> 02:16:32.340]   So they're focusing on building up your LinkedIn
[02:16:32.340 --> 02:16:34.980]   and your GitHub and filling out your projects
[02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:36.860]   and what's your education and how do we connect you.
[02:16:36.860 --> 02:16:39.340]   Because I think Udacity does some of this--
[02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:41.940]   has some ties to recruitment sources.
[02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:43.780]   So I've been really impressed with that.
[02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:45.780]   And their idea is, hey, you come out of this.
[02:16:45.780 --> 02:16:47.980]   You finished a standard degree, and you are qualified
[02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:50.060]   to be hired as an Android developer.
[02:16:50.060 --> 02:16:50.460]   Which is a bad thing.
[02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:52.820]   So back to Liz's point, the opportunity here
[02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:55.260]   is to take entirely new populations.
[02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:55.860]   Yes.
[02:16:55.860 --> 02:16:58.700]   We're told I can't do this or I can't do that to say,
[02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:01.740]   not only can you do it, give yourself a few months
[02:17:01.740 --> 02:17:03.980]   and you're going to get a job in it.
[02:17:03.980 --> 02:17:06.860]   And what we need is also for people
[02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:08.820]   who have lesser economic ability,
[02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:12.140]   we need scholarships for these kinds of programs.
[02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:14.500]   So the $200 a month is not much to me.
[02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:16.700]   But to some people, it would be a hell of a lot of money.
[02:17:16.700 --> 02:17:19.060]   And you want to back up on Kickstarter,
[02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:23.300]   is back sending 100 kids from a poor school
[02:17:23.300 --> 02:17:24.500]   to a Udacity degree.
[02:17:24.500 --> 02:17:25.620]   Well, but there are free.
[02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:27.380]   There's lots of free ways to learn, too.
[02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:28.020]   There's free ways, too.
[02:17:28.020 --> 02:17:29.580]   But I'm just saying, in general, I think
[02:17:29.580 --> 02:17:31.900]   that should be part of the industry's effort
[02:17:31.900 --> 02:17:35.020]   to say that no matter what the program,
[02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:37.260]   we should be trying to create an opportunity.
[02:17:37.260 --> 02:17:39.220]   I think one thing I will say to make it very clear,
[02:17:39.220 --> 02:17:41.580]   you do not have to pay a penny to learn
[02:17:41.580 --> 02:17:44.940]   how to program brilliantly, but you do need a computer.
[02:17:44.940 --> 02:17:46.700]   You need a computer, you need a quiet room.
[02:17:46.700 --> 02:17:48.100]   And maybe internet connection.
[02:17:48.100 --> 02:17:49.900]   And internet connection.
[02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:52.460]   But other than that, I think you don't have to pay money
[02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:54.380]   to a degree program.
[02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:58.220]   There's plenty of ways to learn for free.
[02:17:58.220 --> 02:17:59.860]   Lots of great languages.
[02:17:59.860 --> 02:18:01.900]   And Jeff, you should learn Lisp.
[02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:03.900]   Stop learning Python.
[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:04.780]   All right, I'm just--
[02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:06.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:08.540]   Because that'll get you a job.
[02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:09.060]   All right.
[02:18:09.060 --> 02:18:10.420]   Actually, Hoffman could teach you a Lisp.
[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:12.140]   He wrote Reddit in Lisp at first.
[02:18:12.140 --> 02:18:12.660]   Really?
[02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:15.900]   Yeah, the first version of Reddit was written in Lisp.
[02:18:15.900 --> 02:18:17.380]   Not that that's a good thing.
[02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:18.460]   That doesn't surprise me.
[02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:20.420]   It doesn't surprise me either.
[02:18:20.420 --> 02:18:21.700]   Hey, this is a lot of fun.
[02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:23.740]   I want to thank you, Lindy Johnson, for being here.
[02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:24.780]   You're great.
[02:18:24.780 --> 02:18:25.540]   Great to see you, Lindy.

[02:18:31.180 --> 02:18:34.740]   on the Twitter, Lynne, L-U-V-A-H.
[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:36.540]   Because she's a Lindlava.
[02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:37.220]   Mm-hmm.
[02:18:37.220 --> 02:18:38.900]   Mm-hmm.

[02:18:58.620 --> 02:18:59.780]   didn't get the credit they deserved.
[02:18:59.780 --> 02:19:00.500]   I want to see more.
[02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:02.260]   We want more than the voters and founders.

[02:19:02.460 --> 02:19:04.380]   We want designers and copywriters and users
[02:19:04.380 --> 02:19:05.740]   to support folks.
[02:19:05.740 --> 02:19:08.380]   All your great coworkers, I want to see them in Maker Bay.
[02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:09.300]   It's completely free.

[02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:25.940]   I guess the latest is Geek Sparing Gifts.
[02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:26.500]   But there's a way--
[02:19:26.500 --> 02:19:28.820]   I'm going to say Thursday to record the corrections
[02:19:28.820 --> 02:19:30.540]   in my audio read.
[02:19:30.540 --> 02:19:31.540]   Oh, good.
[02:19:31.540 --> 02:19:32.020]   Oh, correction.
[02:19:32.020 --> 02:19:34.340]   Will that be unaudible or what?
[02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:35.020]   Oh, nice.
[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:36.060]   It's an audible HQ.
[02:19:36.060 --> 02:19:36.860]   Yeah.
