[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.520]   right now, starting with Kevin Marks, who is in the press room
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.560]   at Google I/O, which is going on right now,
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.880]   Google Developer Conference.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.880]   Hello, Kevin.
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.320]   Hi there.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.840]   Good to see you again.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.640]   Congrats on your new job with Salesforce.com.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.120]   That's fantastic.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.320]   I'm very excited about that.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.160]   And that's the original Cloud company.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.960]   So that's very excited to be working there.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.360]   And bringing web standards to Salesforce and Salesforce
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.160]   to web standards.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.480]   That's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.280]   Poor Kevin just can't hold a job.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.080]   I mean, everywhere.
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.080]   He's been everywhere.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.960]   Apple and Google and BT and now Salesforce.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.960]   Oh, I know.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.960]   Nice to have you.
[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.960]   Have you been thinking.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.960]   He's had many lives.
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.960]   And sitting right--
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.960]   Career ADD.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.960]   Career ADD.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960]   No, it's just the way it is these days.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.840]   Sitting right next to him in the press room, I think they can
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.960]   have a lot of time.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.920]   Sitting right next to him in the press room, I think they can
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.960]   actually reach out and touch each other somehow.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.960]   We can.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.960]   Very weird.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   There you go.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.960]   There you go.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.960]   She did your father.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.960]   She did a lot of fun.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.960]   Smartaward.org.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.960]   She's an Android developer, so she, of course, is at Google I/O.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.960]   And with my people.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.160]   And I was there at the keynote yesterday.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.160]   We'll talk about that.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.960]   And of course, there's another keynote that just happened
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.460]   today.
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.360]   And we didn't cover that one live, but there's lots to talk
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.520]   about with that.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.600]   So we'll get to that in a moment.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.480]   But first, let me introduce the guy in square number three
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.480]   in our little Hollywood squares.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.560]   Set up Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.720]   The guy with the dinky little guy.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.360]   The dinky little guy.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.360]   Oh.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.360]   Size doesn't matter, Jeff.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.160]   That's OK.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.360]   Why does it women always say that?
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.960]   And why is it they always kind of laugh maniacally afterwards?
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.660]   I know.
[00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.880]   I'll never understand that.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.280]   Great to have you, Jeff.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.400]   In fact, thanks for covering you and Tom Merritt.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.080]   Did the dirty work yesterday covering--
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.080]   Oh, it's great fun.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.080]   It was great stuff.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.480]   It was so good.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.600]   The great thing was I was going off in the stratosphere
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.720]   about how important this was.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.040]   And then I remembered Wave and Buzz and Google TV and Tom
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.280]   put a prop in my healing.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.640]   Well, so if you watched either our stream or Google's
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.240]   official stream, you saw the keynote yesterday.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.920]   Again, Google did it again today at Google I/O.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.080]   And now there's breakout sessions and seminars and stuff.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.400]   But we thought we'd get together, as always,
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.760]   and talk about some big announcements from Google.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.280]   Where should we start?
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   Let's recap.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.960]   Gina, maybe you and I can recap.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.360]   And anybody wants to chime in what happened yesterday.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.000]   It was all about Android yesterday, right?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.360]   Right.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.200]   Yesterday was Android.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.080]   Today was Chrome.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.960]   So yeah, there's tons of stuff yesterday.
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.520]   And in fact, we recorded a little bit, Leo.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.000]   I don't know if--
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.120]   Oh, I have that video.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.120]   Should I do that?
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.640]   Up to you.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.960]   I wasn't even thinking.
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.240]   Yeah, I have the video of it.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.160]   I'll tell you what.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.280]   Let's play it.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.040]   We will edit it in.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.200]   And I will play it after the show,
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.800]   because I don't want to slow us down.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.640]   So it is about, I think, a five-minute video
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.040]   where I talk to you.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.960]   Lance Olenoff of PC Magazine, Ben Parr from Mashable,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.760]   and the Scobelizer, Robert Scobel,
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.720]   about their thoughts on Android.
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.640]   So let's roll that right now.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.840]   Day one of Google I/O, Leo Laport at Moscone Center
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.760]   in San Francisco that's Android everywhere.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.960]   And Gina Trapani and I both sat in for the keynote of day one.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.840]   There's another one tomorrow.
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.920]   Yeah, there's another one tomorrow.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.440]   I don't know what else there could be tomorrow.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.200]   Today's was pretty great.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.200]   These are the big announcements.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.000]   It seems that way, although I don't know.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.200]   I'm a big fan of the maybe a little extra, maybe a little more
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.720]   tomorrow.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.120]   Well, there's Google's much more than Android.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.560]   And this was all Android.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.060]   That's true.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.120]   I mean, we'll see some Chrome focus tomorrow.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.320]   So tell me what you think.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.480]   As a developer, I mean, this was aimed at you.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.160]   It sure was.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.680]   And I was pretty excited.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.200]   I have to say, the Honeycomb announcements,
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.920]   the hardware, that Arduino based 80K, that thing looks cool.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.200]   I wanted to get my hands on that.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.360]   I'm super excited.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.120]   I mean, watch the demo, the head movement demo.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.600]   There's so many cool things the developer.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.200]   I was like, oh, I'm going to jump in and make my Android app
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.000]   really awesome.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.360]   There was a pretty clear message to developers
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.760]   that we're going to put Android everywhere,
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.400]   including in devices and refrigerators and lights.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.480]   And there's going to be a single unified SDK
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.440]   that will allow developers to develop across the board.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.880]   I mean, we'll see how that works out.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.480]   Definitely.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.120]   I mean, the message today, developers,
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.640]   is like, we're going to make great tools that let you make
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.080]   awesome apps that are going to work on all kinds of devices.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.520]   And they're going to be everywhere.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.240]   And that's really, really exciting developers.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.240]   And I'm really excited to see some of those tools
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.600]   and see some of the neat things you can do with Honeycomb 3.1
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.000]   in the nice-cream sandwich.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.520]   The Google executive who led the keynote, Vikkundotra,
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.280]   he usually does it.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.640]   He did a very nice job.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.200]   Kept saying the word choice.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.840]   This seems like this is-- by the way,
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.480]   there's no mention of Apple this time.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.400]   No slams at anybody else.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.080]   It was--
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.040]   There was that one.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.560]   There were a few.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.360]   Early.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.680]   There was an image of the Android robot eating an Apple.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.800]   OK, I missed that.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.280]   It was about 60 seconds in.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.720]   It was just a visual.
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:10.520]   But that was the only.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.440]   And then there was a little genius mention around music.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.400]   Right.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.360]   But no, not too many.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.880]   No, it's not too many digs at Apple.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.240]   Except that the word choice is directly in contrast
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.040]   to Apple's marketing.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.640]   Absolutely.
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.840]   Big emphasis on how many devices are out there,
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.360]   how many activations there have been,
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.240]   and that great shot of a little Android robot
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.280]   that everyone loves, wearing its jet pack,
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.400]   and just shooting up that infographic.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.520]   So a lot about momentum and a lot about choice.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.280]   Choice was the word.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.000]   And finally, the biggest cheer, of course, at the end.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.280]   When Vikk announced that all 5,000 people were going
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.120]   to receive the new Galaxy Tab 10-inch tablet.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.120]   And that it not only would be starting with Honeycomb,
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.200]   but it'll be running 3.1 within a week or two.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.640]   Next couple of weeks, that was definitely the Oprah moment.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.160]   Everybody loves that.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.040]   You want to get your tablet.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.280]   It's not out for another month.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.680]   And everyone that's here, everyone
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.360]   that's watching the live stream is jealous.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.000]   I got a dozen tweets instantly that's like,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.880]   I enjoy your new tablet.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.160]   So yeah, I did all the Oprah's love that.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.160]   Hey, we're gadget geeks.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.760]   We love getting our hands on stuff early.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.160]   Not only me getting early hardware,
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.760]   we're going to get to the software early as well.
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.840]   That's exciting.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.200]   So we're going to actually talk to a couple of other people,
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.520]   if you don't mind, who are here at the Google I/O.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.120]   I see Ben Parr from Mashable.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.080]   Hey, Ben, how are you?
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.600]   Wonderful.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.120]   How are you?
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.200]   What's your sense from what you saw tonight?
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.880]   They put out a lot of new things here in one hour.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.760]   It is clear that Android is growing
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.600]   and that Google is not stopping with it.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.080]   They announced 400,000 activations a day.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.920]   And they're at 100 million total,
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.880]   which is a huge number if you think about it.
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.480]   Apple, it's interesting because Apple is now starting to say,
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.200]   well, we don't care for number one,
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.080]   or that's the kind of the spin that's going around.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.800]   We never wanted to be number one.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.720]   It's pretty clear the Android is now the number one
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.880]   handset platform.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.400]   In terms of pure numbers, it seems to that way.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.280]   It just seems like two different strategies
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.040]   on how to approach the mobile and the tablet market.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.120]   Obviously, Apple has done very, very well
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.880]   with its approach to tablets and phones.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.320]   And clearly, Google has done a very good job with it.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.080]   I feel like it's just a market that's big enough
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.280]   for two very big players.
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.120]   Mashable Course Covers, Web 2.0,
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.640]   and the big Google Music's announcement was today,
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.640]   the cloud service.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.360]   The service they announced a year ago, they finally released.
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.440]   What do you think of it?
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.360]   It seems like a very, very good service.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.880]   It's interesting that they weren't
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.480]   able to get the deals with the major music players
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.480]   so that you could have the streaming platform.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.160]   But as a product itself, there's a lot of cool things
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.200]   being able to push it to different devices.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.960]   You have all that googly-ness within it.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.560]   Google, it does a great job of saying
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.840]   what they're going to do upfront.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.320]   Delivery is another problem for Google.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.160]   Making it happen.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.200]   Google can be hit or miss.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.280]   You've had some major hits.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.600]   Obviously, Android's a major hit.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.960]   But if you remember a couple years ago, two years ago,
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.280]   here they announced Google Wave.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.440]   That was a big miss.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.080]   Last year, it was Google TV.
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.520]   That's still to be determined.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.680]   So it just kind of depends on which product
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.800]   and any other company you have some hits,
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.560]   and you have some misses.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.280]   Nice to see you, Ben.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.440]   Thanks for stopping by.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.600]   Look who else is here, Lance Olinoff, the editor in chief
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.320]   of PC Magazine.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:14.840]   Hi, Lance.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.000]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.920]   They brought you all the way out from New York.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:20.160]   Yes, I decided it was important enough to come out here.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.680]   I mean, Google's made its mark.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.200]   It seems now in every part of our lives.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.840]   I mean, and apparently they want to--
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.880]   they're going for global domination.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.680]   It's interesting.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.080]   Microsoft for years, their kind of business message
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.560]   was Windows everywhere in everything.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.920]   And it seems like Google's styling a page from that.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:41.360]   I was thinking about this sort of embedded approach.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.160]   It was like Android in everything from an exercise
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.000]   bike to a light bulb.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.680]   So you really just--
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.600]   and when you start giving reference designs for hardware,
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.720]   that they can drop into anything.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   So you're going to be buying stuff in the future.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.680]   You don't even know it as Android in it.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.200]   You don't even know that it works with your Android phone.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.400]   It's a very smart, very savvy move.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.120]   But of course, you've got to get the developers.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.440]   You've got to get the partners in there.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.360]   They announced exactly, I think, one partner on that side.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.640]   There was a light bulb guy.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.840]   Like, OK, that's what nobody ever heard of.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.600]   It wasn't Philip.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.720]   So it wasn't somebody like that.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.600]   But it's a good first step.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.800]   And now we really understand their intentions.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.640]   But I am a little confused.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.280]   They said, one OS for everything.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.840]   What about Chrome?
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.680]   Yeah, well, we'll find out tomorrow, I guess.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.720]   But that's been an interesting schism in Google's strategy.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.120]   They've got two OS's.
[00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.480]   And when they push Android as heavily as they did today,
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.600]   you have to wonder, where's Chrome OS?
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.560]   Yeah, I'm just not getting this.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.800]   I like the Chrome browser a lot.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.840]   I use it all the time.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.400]   But I don't feel like the Chrome OS is truly an OS.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.800]   I usually feel claustrophobic inside of it.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.120]   And I almost really get an experiment that's run its course.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.040]   And now, you've got to first of all,
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.320]   great branding with Android.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.320]   People understand it.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.680]   Look at all these robots.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.160]   And they've just broken it out.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.280]   They've broken it out of the phone in the tablet space.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.680]   They've just said, go free.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.160]   Be free.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.040]   Do all this stuff.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.600]   Be everywhere.
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.200]   Be in our homes.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.880]   Be in our lives.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.400]   I think that's a great strategy.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.920]   You've got to drop Chrome OS.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.560]   They did answer some people's questions about openness.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:11.360]   They didn't say specifics, but they
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.960]   did say several times, open source.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.120]   Yeah, they said that's what they said.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.000]   Is that open open open?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   But you said enough?
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.600]   You know what?
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.840]   What does open really mean?
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.080]   I mean, you can apply any sort of meaning to that.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.760]   And when they have sort of trusted partners,
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.960]   a selected part-- they say, yeah, it's open.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.600]   But it'll be open right after this.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.600]   So first, we give it to the people who are closest partners.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.720]   They do what they need to do.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.080]   Then we open it up to the world.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.040]   So open is a fungible word.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.720]   You can do it with it whatever you want.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.240]   I think that's what Google does here.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.200]   But the intention is mostly good.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.240]   Well, it's also critical.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.280]   I can see how you might not want open in a handset space.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.560]   But if you're going to go out in the light bulbs and refrigerators
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.640]   and speaker systems, open becomes very important.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.400]   Well, by the way, I spoke to a bunch of appliance manufacturers
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.680]   how to CES this year.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.720]   And that was something we talked about quite a bit.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.560]   Because openness also refers to standards.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.720]   When you have openness, you have no standards.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.200]   And appliance manufacturers absolutely want standards
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.560]   that they cannot agree on.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.120]   And there's no good at standard right now.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:08.720]   No, there isn't.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.880]   And this is why we don't really have smart appliances,
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.080]   why they are not, in fact, talking to each other.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.640]   Could Android become that platform?
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.280]   Could it become that subsystem?
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.760]   If they can get to Westinghouse,
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.200]   Slovenia, all of these guys, and convince them
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.160]   to march down the path.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.080]   Lance, it's great to see you.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.520]   PCMag.com.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.080]   Got to come back on Twitch soon.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.120]   Well, take care.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.000]   Hey, look who else is here.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.480]   Robert Scobel, I'm surprised you're not
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.400]   over playing on that giant labyrinth game.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.320]   That's pretty cool.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.640]   Tell them, tell us about that.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.680]   Well, it's their building--
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.480]   Life size.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.720]   But they're building these hardware controllers that
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.600]   are built on Android.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.000]   And so your phone or your tablet can talk to these new hardware
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.640]   controllers and control machines and physical machines.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.400]   I know you and I both last year bought Google TVs.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.960]   Hoping.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.240]   And really, I disconnected mine.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.520]   I know about you.
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.880]   They announced today that they'll be running 3.1,
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.640]   and Honeycomb 3.1.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.840]   And the App Store, the market Google marketplace,
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.800]   would be available on these devices.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:04.720]   Does that make a difference?
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.840]   Not to me anymore.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.760]   You know, I'm an iPad user, and I'm using AirPlay
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.520]   to push the videos from my iPad onto my TV through Apple TV.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.120]   And Apple TV is 99 bucks.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.240]   The Google TV is still 300.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.320]   It's too expensive.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.840]   I can't recommend it to my friends,
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.440]   because it's too expensive, and it doesn't do what the Apple
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.400]   TV does.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.880]   Everybody loves that AirPlay.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.160]   And if they have an answer to that, that's interesting.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.440]   But so far, they haven't really demonstrated
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.560]   that connected system yet.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.760]   It feels like Google's playing catch up to Apple.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.240]   At least on tablets it is.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.000]   Now, on handsets, like you said, there are number one
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.040]   and numbers.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.520]   So if you're a developer--
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.200]   now you're not.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.000]   But put yourself in the mind, and they talk to a lot of developers,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.040]   is the message today compelling enough for a developer to say,
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.520]   I might either abandon iOS or do a dual platform strategy?
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.840]   No.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.720]   Dual platform, absolutely.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.240]   The major you see Angry Birds, it's on every--
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.120]   Yeah, you have to.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.560]   If you're big enough, the problem is not-- most developers
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:07.960]   don't have the resources to do both.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.120]   It's really telling.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.880]   You were at South by Southwest.
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.240]   I got and saw about 30 apps, or new apps, only one of which
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.640]   was shown to me on an Android device.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.560]   I spoke at the Wear 2.0 conference.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.440]   I asked, how many people here have Android's?
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.200]   10%.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:22.720]   That's surprising.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.000]   Since location and Google seem to go hand in hand.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.720]   Because the top apps, the top development tools,
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.960]   are still on Apple.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.360]   And they didn't answer that.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.880]   They also didn't talk about social.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.440]   We're all wondering, what are they
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.440]   going to do with that plus one thing?
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.200]   What are they going to do to keep Facebook from taking
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:41.240]   over search eventually?
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.600]   That might be tomorrow, of course.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.960]   No, I just talked to Rohit.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.640]   He was just standing behind you, and who's
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.960]   heavily involved in the social team.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.760]   And he says, no, cut--
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.480]   Nothing for tomorrow.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.360]   Coming this summer.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.080]   Here's a scoop.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.360]   One other story that broke this morning, Microsoft, just
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.840]   down the road having a press conference
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.760]   announcing that they have bought Skype for $8.5 billion.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.000]   Your thoughts?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.640]   It's funny, because I told Bomber and Sonoski and Gates
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.560]   to buy it in 2004.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.040]   They all wrote me an email that I have.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.600]   I'm trying to get it back on my blog,
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.800]   but it says business value 13 times.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.160]   It says no business value.
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.320]   No, they've changed their two.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.360]   They've changed their two.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.280]   Big business value if it's $8.5 billion.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.720]   How much of this has to do with their ownership
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.520]   of a stake in Facebook?
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.160]   Do you think that this is partly for Facebook?
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.280]   I don't think it has much to do with Facebook.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.800]   I think they're getting attacked by box.net, Salesforce
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.280]   chatter, VMware has something coming out in a week.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:34.120]   They're getting hit in the enterprise,
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.440]   and they need to have other ways to hook you in and keep
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.640]   you on a Microsoft Office platform, an enterprise platform.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.440]   And Skype is a huge piece of that, right?
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.440]   We're all on Skype.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.480]   And that's a big deal.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.280]   Robert Scobell, thanks.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.440]   Rackspace.com and Building 43.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:51.960]   Yep.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.480]   Building 43, the center of the internet.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.840]   That's where Larry Page and Marissa sit.
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.520]   Thank you, Robert.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.800]   Nice to see you.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.600]   Nice to see all the people here, 5,000 developers.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.600]   Day one at Google I/O. The message is Android everywhere
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.040]   and choice for Android users and, of course, the big sell
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.480]   to developers.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.360]   It's a platform you want to develop for.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.320]   We'll find out what they announced tomorrow.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.400]   At day two, I imagine it'll be Chrome OS, Search, and more.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.680]   Back to the studios and this week in Google.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.720]   OK, we rolled it.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.720]   Now.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.240]   Great.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:28.880]   Beautiful.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.800]   Now we're back.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.120]   The magic of editing, we're back.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.400]   And so it was all about Android.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.440]   They did say some things I think they were pretty important,
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.920]   including Kevin and I imagine you were of interest
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.560]   as a developer, a third party developer for Android.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.360]   They reinforced the fact that Honeycomb and all
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.800]   Androids are open.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.160]   Yes.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.560]   And that answered the question I think a lot of people had.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.880]   Well, I missed the Android--
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.160]   first I chat yesterday.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.520]   I think Gina went to that.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.120]   So I didn't get all the details there.
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:10.120]   Because Andy Rubin was actually in the press conference,
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.680]   not in the keynote.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.440]   Right.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.760]   Weirdly, he was never on stage.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.000]   I was surprised about that.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.880]   But he was available to journalists.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.600]   Did he reinforce what they said on stage
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.240]   that they intend to keep Android open
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.920]   and to offer people the source code soon?
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.880]   Well, yes.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.680]   So I didn't make it to the fireside chat,
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.720]   although Eileen tweeted something that it was really
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.000]   fireside because it was like the questions were filled with fire
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.200]   sort of being shot at the Android team, which made me laugh.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.480]   So now Honeycomb isn't going to go open source.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.520]   But Ice Cream Sandwich is going to combine Gingerbread and Honeycomb.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:44.640]   And that will be--
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.840]   That will be their uniform.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.840]   So they were never going to release a source of Honeycomb?
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.920]   From what I hear--
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.400]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:50.920]   No.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.400]   They're not going to release that source,
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.280]   which is kind of interesting.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.800]   So Honeycomb 3.1 is coming out in the next few weeks.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.720]   We're going to get that on our tabs.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.080]   That's got some cool stuff, resizable widgets.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.680]   And it's going to be a USB host.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.880]   You can plug in a bunch of things.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.400]   They had a demo on stage of someone
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.040]   with an Xbox controller plugged into a Honeycomb tablet playing
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:11.480]   Cordy.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.760]   Is that the name of that game?
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:13.680]   That's just kind of cool.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.000]   That was really cool, yeah.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:15.760]   That was really cool.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.840]   But Ice Cream Sandwich, we're looking at Q4.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:24.040]   And yeah, I mean, that's the one OS that's going to run everywhere.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:24.960]   That's what's really cool.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.760]   It's interesting.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.760]   So I think they say, in effect, they're saying,
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:31.480]   Honeycomb was kind of a botch.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.480]   We're not going to release that.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.800]   It's kind of this weird fork of like, oh, we just
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.880]   needed to get a tablet out.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.120]   But Ice Cream Sandwich is really where it's at, man.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.440]   That's really--
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.480]   I should explain a gloss a little bit.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.160]   You said our tablets.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.480]   They handed out to developers, to the 5,000 developers
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.680]   in the keynote, these Samsung 10.1 inch tabs.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.280]   Which aren't out yet.
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.880]   There's special edition they have.
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.160]   On the back, they have little Android guys.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.000]   And these are-- this is a dual processor tablet, kind of--
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.760]   almost a reference design at this point
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.880]   for what the Android tablets look like going forward.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:09.000]   Today, they handed out CR-- well, not CR48s,
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.400]   but Chrome OS laptops.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:11.920]   Chrome books.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.440]   Chrome books.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.680]   They're calling them Chrome books now.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:14.680]   OK.
[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.160]   There's--
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.920]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.320]   No, running the music app.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.880]   They didn't actually hand out the Chromebooks.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.080]   They gave us-- they said, we'll send you one in June.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.560]   They announced that the Chromebooks we--
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:32.000]   Chrome OS will be coming out in June 15th from Acer and from--
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Samsung.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   Samsung.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:34.500]   Samsung.
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.000]   Samsung.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.240]   At a price point of $350 to $450.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.240]   Let's get to that in a second.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:40.840]   I want to finish the--
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.320]   there's so much to say.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.440]   Yeah, there's a lot.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.240]   Lots of stuff.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:44.560]   There is.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:46.320]   I think there's some big implications
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.520]   to what they're doing, too.
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.240]   Well, they basically look to me like Android everywhere.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.600]   In fact, you heard Lance Yulinoff liken it to Microsoft's
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.120]   strategy of some years ago.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.080]   Microsoft Windows everywhere.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.840]   Android everywhere except the desktop.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.960]   They're still reserving that for Chrome OS or Windows or Macintosh.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.600]   But they want to see Android on-- for instance,
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:11.760]   Android at Home on Home appliances on lights.
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.840]   That's what it finally comes like.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.080]   That's the net of things.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.080]   Finally arrives.
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.200]   And what's beautiful about it is it's
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.600]   so much the opposite strategy of what Apple can do.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.640]   Is Apple going to allow something to connect to your refrigerator
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.360]   or stove if it's not Apple branded?
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:28.840]   No.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.320]   And Google's willing to control anything.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.600]   Well, it's been an issue.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.320]   Anybody who's looked at home automation,
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.440]   and we've been all waiting for a standard.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.840]   The problem is there was one called Z-Wave.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:43.320]   But these are all small companies promoting these standards.
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.520]   And there wasn't enough weight behind any one standard
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.400]   for it to get a grip.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.520]   I would have loved it if Google had
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.120]   gotten behind Z-Wave, which is already kind of out there.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.480]   They are in the same frequency.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.520]   They didn't.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.240]   They've created their own standard.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.120]   But I guess because it's Google, it has a shot.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.800]   And it is something that I think we want.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.480]   You need a standard.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.320]   You need a platform.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.080]   You look at what Windows did for computing.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.600]   Google has an opportunity to do that for automation,
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.800]   for network everywhere, for intelligence everywhere.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.760]   That right?
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.200]   Yeah, I mean, it looks that way.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.960]   The demos were-- the two home automation demos were kind of
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.400]   interesting.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.440]   One was the lights in the house would kind of get really
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:34.880]   right when you shot someone in a game, which was kind of cool,
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.720]   but also a little weirdly impractical.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.440]   The other one was they had CDs, like music CDs, with
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.880]   theoretical NFC tags on them.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.600]   And they would tap it to the Android device.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.520]   And it would know what the album was.
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:47.360]   And then you tap it again.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.320]   And it would just start playing a music which sort of means
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:50.720]   you feel--
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.080]   It's never going to happen out.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:52.880]   It's never going to happen.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.840]   I mean, what's the point of having the CD to begin with?
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.360]   I like the idea because if you have a CD collection,
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.240]   you can tap it on the Android and you don't have to download it.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.520]   But that's not going to happen.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.120]   And even with them-- I'm uploading right now my music
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.280]   collection to the music player.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.520]   You have to upload them.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:09.800]   They will not do that.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.920]   They could do it.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.680]   That automatic recognition.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.240]   But Michael Robertson got his pants
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.280]   suit off with mp3.com doing the same thing.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.320]   And I don't think anybody's going to take a chance of doing
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.800]   that again since he did lose that case, or he settled that
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.120]   case.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.400]   He interviewed him a couple of weeks ago.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.720]   And he said, you know what?
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.960]   They would not have won, but we just couldn't afford to
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.760]   fight universal Vivendi.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.920]   But he says, I wish he'd pursued it because we would
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.200]   have a very different world if you could just kind of wave
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.000]   your CDs at something and say, OK, I proved I have it.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.520]   Now, just put it in my cloud.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.720]   Well, but Leo, I think it was a shot across the bow.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.960]   If you look at where they're going here, we were saying
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.720]   yesterday during the presentation, that where's the
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:52.040]   store?
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:52.720]   Where's the store?
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.960]   Well, maybe there's never a store.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.280]   Maybe Google's proper role is you got it.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:56.880]   We'll organize it.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.200]   We'll organize it for you.
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.200]   I mean, I have to say I like this because on an
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.400]   portable device, look, I've got all these--
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.280]   I see these now.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.840]   So in that sense, I think what they're saying is if you
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.880]   bought it anywhere, you should be able to organize it here.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.040]   And I think they'll argue that they're trying to
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.040]   encourage buying.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.160]   One could fight that, but fine.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.760]   And you look at the report today about social, they're
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.360]   looking to do this anything with social.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.280]   What I suggested was that Google's still not connecting
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.640]   people, but the internet is the connection machine.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.360]   And if they can similarly have a layer atop the internet,
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:37.640]   that a new cloud in your space that organizes what you have.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.760]   Well, there is definitely buying in here.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.760]   If you play an artist, you can see more by artist.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:49.960]   In theory, it seems like I saw by this at some point, maybe
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   it points to Amazon.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:54.080]   Why should Google get in the music business?
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.440]   I like the functionality of this, especially since this is
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.360]   first generation.
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.480]   I think that the potential for this is great.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.400]   And I am currently uploading.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:08.560]   I've uploaded 463 of my 6,018 songs.
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.720]   But it does it automatically.
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.680]   I don't have to think about it.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.040]   I mean, it's annoying that it has to do that.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.280]   But I just downloaded the free program.
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.320]   It's running on where my iTunes is.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.400]   It says, you want me to upload the iTunes, all the iTunes
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:20.680]   music?
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.120]   I said, yeah, put it all up on the cloud.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.960]   And it's only for now, right?
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:27.480]   The beta is US only and free for now.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.280]   And invite only.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.120]   And invite only, right.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.120]   So don't all come yelling at me that you don't have it yet.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.520]   What will happen is you'll get a little a headphone.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.520]   The icon changes on the music player from a speaker
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.640]   to a headphone.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.680]   Look at this, though.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   All these artists, they're not on the phone.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:52.680]   They're all on my cloud, which is kind of cool.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.720]   So I mean, there is some real advantage to this.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.560]   I mean, it's on all my Android devices now.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.060]   Right.
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.600]   And it does some smart caching that music
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.360]   that you've listened to.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.760]   It tries to guess what it should cache
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.640]   so that you can keep listening to it offline.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.760]   I haven't had a chance to play with it a whole lot.
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.720]   My internet connection at the hotel was awful.
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.160]   So I wasn't able to upload any of my songs
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.440]   after quite some time.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.920]   I'm excited to go home and do that.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.760]   But you'll be able to try it on the plain home.
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:20.000]   You'll see how it works.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:25.960]   See how well the offline component works.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.920]   This is interesting because it isn't-- you're right.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.840]   It's not a business for Google.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.600]   So Jeff, what's your theory that--
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.520]   That Google, whether it opens a store or not,
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.520]   it wants to be the place to organize your stuff.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:38.520]   Right.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.440]   They're going to organize the world first.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.240]   I'm going to organize you.
[00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:48.240]   And that if only you could waive the CD,
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:48.720]   why shouldn't you be able--
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.640]   Wouldn't that be nuts.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.680]   --that you own it.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.180]   Right.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.800]   And Google probably protected better
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.280]   and say that we verified this person owns this thing.
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.880]   Well, I would love to see them do that.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.120]   That would be absolutely incredible if they did.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:01.960]   So that's just a theory.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.720]   But as I said, I thought Wade was going to be huge too, huh?
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.200]   Oh, man.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:13.040]   I think this is pretty compelling.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.320]   It's different from what Amazon's doing
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.440]   because it's not tied to a store.
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.960]   It does just go-- you just-- basically,
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:23.800]   you run this music player on your desktop
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.760]   and it's going to copy everything over.
[00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:28.280]   I think it's kind of interesting.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.320]   I don't know what they didn't say
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:34.560]   when they're going to make this available by non-inventation.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.280]   But I presume it'd be fairly soon.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.800]   I mean, the whole sell on this, right,
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.240]   was no wires, no painful sinking.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:46.400]   And that's definitely a shot at that iPod iTunes connect sync.
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.360]   Well, by the way, when I go to music player,
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.760]   it launches it in Chrome.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.160]   And of course, this is also something for Chrome OS
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.480]   that you need because you don't have much storage
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.960]   on these Chromebooks.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.280]   Absolutely.
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.840]   And they showed you on that as well, yeah.
[00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.760]   So that makes sense there.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.400]   I don't know.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:03.960]   I like this.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:06.200]   I think this is about what you'd expect from Google.
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:10.760]   It's probably a little more polished than Google TV.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.720]   Some of the other news we got yesterday
[00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.440]   was that Google TV will have ice cream sandwich 3.1.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:17.960]   Am I right?
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:18.880]   Is that 3.1?
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.800]   What is ice cream sandwich?
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.240]   Honeycomb is 3.1, actually.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.080]   Honeycomb.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.160]   There is not a version number for ice cream sandwich yet.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.760]   I'm not sure if that's going to be 4 or what.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.280]   But Google TV is going to get the Android market.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.240]   And I believe it was-- my notes were,
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.320]   it's going to get honeycomb 3.1.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.600]   That's what I thought too.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.080]   3.1.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.800]   So is that going to rescue Google TV?
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.320]   Are you going to bring back--
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.280]   I'll dust it off.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.760]   It's sitting in a closet right now.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:46.160]   $300 right off.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.000]   If I could put Angry Birds on it and play it on my TV,
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.920]   I mean, I've got a keyboard with the Logitech one,
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.560]   with it's got a trackpad, it's like a computer.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.520]   I think that's pretty interesting.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.440]   I'll tell you one thing I noticed immediately, though,
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.720]   on this tablet is there aren't a lot of honeycomb apps.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.440]   And while all the apps run, only a handful of them
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.560]   run and take advantage of the real estate,
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.160]   if you run Angry Birds, it does fill up the screen.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.600]   But you can see some scaling issues a little bit with it.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.840]   Stuff's not vector graphics.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.560]   And look, it's got big buttons in the bottom and stuff like that.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.960]   Gmail's pretty awesome.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:25.040]   Gmail does a nice job, but this is Google writing for--
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:25.960]   Right, of course.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.840]   Although interestingly enough-- and this will come out
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.920]   with 3.1-- this Gmail widget doesn't stretch to--
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.760]   Doesn't resize.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.520]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.640]   If people made a big deal out of that, but look at this--
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.960]   That was on fourth applause.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.720]   Yeah, isn't it funny?
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.520]   I guess people really wanted that.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:45.800]   You know, I thought it was interesting.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.280]   Developers clapped harder at the announcement
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.040]   that the open handset alliance would be enforcing guidelines
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:51.600]   about--
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.160]   That's huge.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:52.800]   --huts it's going out?
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.320]   Yes.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.040]   Much harder at that than Google Music,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.960]   which was a consumer product shipping yesterday.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.120]   That was a really big announcement,
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.200]   I thought, the 18-month guidelines.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.040]   For shipping out the latest version of Android,
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:07.200]   if hardware allows, you know, really trying
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.040]   to address the fact that you're on issue.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.480]   So every phone contract is 24 months,
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.640]   and they're going to guarantee that you're
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.360]   going to get the latest--
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.920]   Right before your contract explained.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.360]   They don't care about you the last six months.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.360]   Boy.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.440]   Right before your contract expires,
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.520]   all right, we'll give you the latest version.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:28.760]   I wonder whether that was what the telcos wanted.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.240]   It's the ultimate in planned obsolescence.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.720]   You know exactly when it's obsolete, 18 months.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.720]   Nice to know.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.920]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.560]   Why give them such a big window?
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:39.480]   It's a long time.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.720]   The truth is, I'm behind now anyway,
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.760]   because I don't get the updates of the damn no-wesses.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.680]   It's really irritating.
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.880]   That's a problem.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:47.880]   I agree.
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:48.880]   That's a problem.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.880]   I agree.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.480]   The open accessory stuff was pretty cool.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.480]   What's that?
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.480]   Tell us about that.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.560]   Android open accessory, like the first of all, the ADK.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.640]   I mean, this entire conference is just filled with NURBATE.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.080]   And my first bit of NURBATE that really got me
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.080]   was this Arduino-based ADK, which
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.440]   is a hardware development kit for being
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:14.120]   able to connect anything to Android via USB initially
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.520]   and then Bluetooth later.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.840]   And being able to just add peripherals and program
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.120]   this board to interact with Android.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.600]   That was really cool.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   Android access.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.680]   That's huge.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.760]   And I don't think that they nearly speculated enough
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.040]   about what that could do.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.960]   It really does become, as I said earlier, the net of things.
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.080]   And you can use that ADK to control a lawnmower
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:42.560]   or a stove or refrigerator or eventually a car.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.080]   Well, they had a giant labyrinths game, actually.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.080]   That was a spot in the giant.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.000]   Oh, I was pissed at that.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.480]   That was a waste of money.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.440]   I wanted to get in it.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.120]   They wouldn't let people in it.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.760]   Oh, you wanted to stand on it?
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.320]   I wanted to stand on it.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:03.000]   The exercise equipment demo was pretty good.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.240]   The stationer bike, you plug in your Android
[00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.000]   and then you play this game where if you pedal faster,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.080]   you keep the little robot above.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.440]   So I mean, that was really neat.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.280]   Like fitness equipment, I thought,
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.720]   was a really good sort of demo.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.720]   You know, I think there's no question in my mind
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.760]   that if Google sets a standard and there's
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.480]   home automation standard, it all works with Android.
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.200]   It all developers can write hardware interfaces
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.280]   for Android devices.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.520]   This is all good.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.360]   The question, it really is, will people adopt?
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:34.280]   You have to get critical mass to make this work.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.680]   And will that happen?
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.280]   Kevin, do you have an opinion on that?
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:39.360]   Well, I think this is the thing I always
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.960]   said about the two halves of Android
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.680]   in that all the little consumer electronic devices
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.240]   are running Android.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.360]   They're starting to see that happen
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.800]   and we're going to see more and more of that
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.920]   because it's easier than writing their own firmware
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.320]   and they can just deploy some release of Android onto that.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.520]   And they don't have to go and do the deal with Google
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.520]   and try and run Gmail and the rest of it.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.200]   They can just run the OS and use that.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.920]   But if that set of developers can then
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.360]   plug to the phone like a tablet like devices
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.520]   that we expect as well, that starts getting very interesting.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.840]   Because it means we've got this--
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.600]   we've got a shared OS which is somewhat interesting.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.440]   But also we've got a whole set of standard communication
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.360]   stacks there that you can pull back and forth with.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.680]   So you've got USB stack, you've got a Bluetooth stack,
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.000]   you've got a Wi-Fi stack so they can all communicate over those
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.120]   and find each other.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.520]   So the challenge is going to be can they make it straightforward?
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.840]   Can they make it as easy to use as buying everything
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:34.120]   from Apple?
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.720]   And that hasn't been really true of DNA and the things
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.680]   that have been deployed previously.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.880]   But there's some potential for that to work there.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.880]   And we're starting to see bits and pieces
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.480]   of that interoperating.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:48.080]   Let me ask you a question, each of you developer types.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.360]   Because the interesting thing too
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.000]   is it brings in a new developer community,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.680]   a hardware developer community.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.160]   If you were going to launch a device tomorrow using Kickstarter
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.440]   and somebody else's manufacturing, using this ADK,
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.160]   what's the craziest thing you could think of?
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:08.560]   That's a good question.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.480]   Well, that's good.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.600]   You've got robots.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.200]   Don't you understand anything?
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.880]   Oh my god, this is a higher floor for robots outside.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.560]   Everything's for robots.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.480]   It's for robots.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.840]   They had a flying car there last night as well here.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.080]   Did they?
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.440]   It didn't actually fly, but it was a car that had previously
[00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:24.720]   flown.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.920]   It could fly if you all clapped your hands
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.760]   and wished hard enough.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.840]   I want to remote control jetpack so I can strap it on.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.920]   Kevin and fly him around this press room.
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.800]   All Android powered.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.640]   Kevin, I know you're sitting right next to Gina.
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.680]   But if she says anything about strapping anything on,
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:43.440]   just a little bit farther away.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:45.600]   Oh, you know what?
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.640]   Why did I go there?
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.440]   There was immediate sex toy discussion amongst the--
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:49.880]   Oh my god.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.560]   --sitting in the--
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:51.840]   OK, that's where Jeff was going.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:52.880]   Maybe I just sat in the perverts.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.360]   I don't know.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.080]   But it was like, yeah, I got it early on that tweet.
[00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:58.480]   Yeah, I was definitely the Android powered driver.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.240]   Well, there is somebody who made a French kissing
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.280]   remote control French kissing machine.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:06.360]   You saw that right in the news?
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:06.840]   I didn't.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.320]   How does that work?
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:14.000]   Well, you kiss the thing, and then the thing transmits
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   what you're doing over the internet to a receiver, which
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.840]   then kisses the other person.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.040]   Oh, it's a bit.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.360]   That's real.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.960]   But OK, so let's not talk about that.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.920]   What else could you do with it?
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:27.840]   I feel weird.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.680]   I feel dirty.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:29.760]   I think it's very weird.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.760]   I'm sorry I brought that up.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.280]   Well, I think you could do--
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:34.080]   you could program a--
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:36.720]   imagine if you didn't just get a recipe.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.160]   But with the recipe, it came a routine for your oven
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.640]   to do this perfect baked turkey.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:44.160]   Ah.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:49.760]   I'm stretching here, but that's what we want to do.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.400]   What all could you do if things were controlled?
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.200]   As somebody said, forget the Mondo remote controls
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.640]   and all that.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.680]   Right.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:34:59.480]   Right.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.000]   But that's been heading toward death anyway.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:03.280]   But that's--
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.280]   The Marguino stuff is cool, but it's all kind of toys.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.000]   So I just think it's smart for Google.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.960]   Now, do this feeders sketch it out and build it.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.840]   You're obviously then going to get it manufactured.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.320]   But the point was you can use the Arduino staff.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:15.640]   Prototype.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.240]   That piece is fully open source as well.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.080]   So you've got open source on both sides.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.800]   Arduino's Dev staff is Java-ish, too.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.560]   So there's a lot of shared knowledge
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.720]   you can go back and forth.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:31.160]   So I think that was like a-- oh, a thousand child hobbyists
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.560]   just got interested.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:34.840]   That's what I'd do if I were Google.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.480]   I'd say that you do a contest that whoever
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.800]   manages to get to a certain level with a device on Kickstarter,
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.440]   Google will invest some huge amount of money
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:47.560]   to license and manufacture.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.800]   You know what we're going to end up having?
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:51.880]   A coffee pot in Cambridge that you could push the pot
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.480]   and it makes coffee.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.880]   It's like 20 years later.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.800]   All we did is we improved it so you could actually
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.400]   make the coffee instead of just watching it.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.920]   Except that we'll be in a espresso machine
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.600]   and you can make a decaf or not.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:08.480]   Maybe Apple has the right idea, which is making products people
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.320]   actually want and can use.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:15.200]   I just want the cool stuff, Leo.
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.160]   Forget what I'm saying.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:16.760]   No, that's what I'm saying.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.000]   Google makes stuff for geeks.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.240]   Yeah, that's a point.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:20.720]   That's a point.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.400]   That's a point.
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:23.960]   I was talking to Dan Gilmour and he said, OK, I've got an Apple
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.400]   TV.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.120]   I've got an Android.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.120]   How do I control one with the other?
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.560]   And you can't at the moment.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.640]   There's like a double twist who has just hacked in sending music
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.440]   from one to the other.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.960]   But they have to reverse engineer Apple's protocol.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.480]   So who knows how long that will last?
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.720]   But truthfully, come on.
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.760]   You've got a choice between an Apple TV and a Google TV.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:42.280]   Let's leave out Roku and some of the other guys.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.520]   But say Apple TV, Google TV, which one do you buy?
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.640]   Well, I bought Apple TV.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.520]   But you can control the Google TV with your Android phone.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.640]   Does that change it?
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.440]   But that's a control.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:53.480]   The Apple TV with my Android phone.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.680]   No, no, you can't.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:56.760]   It comes with a remote.
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.560]   Which I've lost on the back of the sofa.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.960]   So I have to use the--
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.200]   If you had an iPhone, you could control it.
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:02.640]   Yes.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.560]   Or I use the iPod to control it.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.080]   OK.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.160]   That's exactly the problem.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.000]   It's not open.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   I understand.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:08.520]   But--
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.600]   But it could be.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.080]   They could-- but what I've seen from Apple
[00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.720]   is that they're going the other way.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:16.440]   If you plug your Android phone into the Mac,
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.240]   it launches iPhoto, but it hides the photos from you.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.000]   And that used to work.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.800]   There is a USB folder on there that has--
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.600]   it's called DCM and has the photos in there.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.840]   And I'm at the same way that every other
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.240]   fan on the iPhone has.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.480]   But iPhone is deliberately handing out the Android one.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.920]   So that's-- I'm called shenanigans there.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:36.360]   So I think Apple is playing with this to say, OK,
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.720]   can we make this feel a little more awkward for you?
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.840]   As opposed to, can we make R1 feel better?
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.240]   And maybe it's just a bug, but it's a bug they could fix.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.640]   And they're probably de-braritized.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:52.600]   What else did-- what other Android news is there?
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.240]   So ice cream sandwiches coming later this year
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.440]   that will unify the two platforms.
[00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.120]   3.1, which is a fixed honeycomb.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.160]   And after using honeycomb for a little while,
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.920]   I can see why they might want to fix it.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.880]   We'll come out.
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.800]   I mean, honeycomb's-- I don't know.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.720]   What do you think, Gina?
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.280]   I mean, this is the first time I've
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.600]   spent a lot of time playing with honeycomb.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.640]   I had the Zoom for a little while.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:16.120]   It just doesn't--
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.800]   Yeah, I mean, the tab is really cool.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.720]   It's a nice tablet.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.720]   It's a good weight.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.520]   The power button is in a sensible place.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.600]   And it made me really look at honeycomb again
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.440]   and get like, oh, this is something
[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:27.400]   I'm kind of excited about.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.880]   It really felt half baked on the Zoom.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.960]   I think one of the things that I was really excited about yesterday
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.120]   was the OpenGL head tracking demo.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.680]   And I actually think this is ice cream sandwich.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.080]   I don't think that this is honeycomb.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:44.280]   But ice cream sandwich could recognize the head movement
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.520]   and adjust the perspective on screen, which is really cool.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.920]   That was really cool.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.200]   And it could recognize facial features
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.600]   so it could change the eyes and the mouth and the nose.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.680]   And then the video-- and I thought this would be really exciting to you, Leo.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.800]   The video chat with two people are in front of an eyesight
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.720]   and a microphone and one is talking.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.800]   And Android knows who's talking and zooms on that face
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.960]   and gets close.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:09.240]   And the other person starts talking and it knows to shift.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.120]   That was pretty neat.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.960]   As Kevin knows, though, most business video conferencing software
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.720]   does this already.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:17.800]   Well, that's business.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   That's business.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.960]   That's expensive video conferencing.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.160]   The point is they just commoditize something again, right?
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.400]   Yes.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.680]   It's like they did with the mapping stuff.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:28.760]   The mapping stuff is like, oh, there's all these cool things
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.960]   with mapping if you buy this device and subscribe to it.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:33.080]   And Google was like, OK, software, we've done that.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.360]   And so they're doing the same thing with this video stuff.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.320]   And that makes sense.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.280]   Suddenly, you don't have to buy special cameras
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.000]   and fret about it to do a conferencing.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.560]   You can just pick up a couple of these things
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.440]   and wave them to each other and so on.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.360]   Here's a weird question.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.680]   Can you do connect?
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.360]   In two ways.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.040]   One, can you not have a connect device
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.960]   and use this to make your own games like connect?
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.440]   Or second, can you use a connect hardware without anything else
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.920]   and hack it into this?
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:01.120]   So the demos would connect like, but they weren't doing it
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.160]   with the infrared thing.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.000]   They were doing it with the camera.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   So it wasn't as--
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.360]   they weren't doing as smooth as the job as Connect
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.880]   does of representing you on the screen.
[00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.040]   They were just tracking the guy moving his head
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.440]   and moving a 3D thing with that.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.400]   So obviously, they're edging towards that,
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.760]   but they didn't say that we're using the sensors.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.920]   Well, here's where I think--
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.920]   That was the issue then.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.720]   --and it becomes the new UI, right?
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.360]   It's put that there.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:28.920]   Imagine this.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.720]   You're sitting in your couch and all you have to do
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:34.560]   is start swiping your hand and you move things.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.320]   You know, as somebody who has used Connect to play games
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.200]   a lot--
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   No?
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.360]   No good on the swiping?
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.280]   You don't like the swiping?
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.400]   It's too much freaking work.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.400]   It's a lot of cool.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.480]   That's a lot.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.160]   Calorie burn.
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.440]   It's fine if you're dancing and you're already standing up.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:54.760]   I don't know.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.280]   I'm not sure that people really want to do this.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.680]   It's so easy just to do a mouse.
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.680]   I don't know.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.640]   But I'm glad-- look, I'm glad they're trying stuff.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.760]   And you need to try stuff to see what's going to work,
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:10.280]   what's going to stick, and so forth.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.360]   I was doing a presentation at CodeConf last month,
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:16.560]   and I didn't have the clicker for my keynote slideshow.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.440]   And I was like, gosh, I wish I could just--
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.440]   like this.
[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:23.240]   And maybe I'm cynical because I've seen this first.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.360]   I can remember 11 years ago on Tech TV,
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:31.800]   we had demonstrated lamps that you turned on by voice.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.560]   And it's a great demo because I can
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:38.880]   remember Jim Laderback staying there going, tech TV lamp on.
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.880]   Tech TV lamp on.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.080]   Tech TV-- yeah.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.480]   Yeah, the clapper.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.320]   It's just-- you know, the switch works pretty well.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   The keyboard works pretty well.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.880]   The mouse works pretty well.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.960]   It has to be 100%.
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.600]   It has to be-- I mean, look, I'll agree,
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.680]   the touch interface works.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.640]   That's intuitive.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.000]   You grasp it immediately.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.240]   The pinching, the zooming, the swiping does work.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:06.800]   So it is possible to come up with new interfaces that work.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.520]   So I'll tell you a funny story.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.960]   I walked into the Moscone Center the other day early
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.040]   to register.
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.480]   And to register for the conference,
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.040]   they have all the ECR48 laptops laid out with barcodes.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.040]   So you see barcode scanners.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.160]   So you scan your-- you know, to get your ticket.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.120]   And I walk up to one, and it's got this screen
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.320]   with a green button.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.400]   And I touch the screen of the CR48.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.680]   And nothing happened.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.640]   Whoops.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.080]   And then I went, oh.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.440]   And then I grabbed the barcode scanner.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.480]   But it was interesting because it was representative
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:37.600]   of this big general conflict that I have as a developer being
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.400]   here and doing day one Android and day two Chrome is like,
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.920]   what do I develop for?
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.960]   I don't know.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.120]   They're both so cool.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.120]   Android.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.120]   Android.
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:46.640]   Android.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.640]   Android.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.480]   Android.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.040]   I mean, Android was day one.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:50.920]   Yeah, I wouldn't develop.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.560]   But if you develop on the web, it runs on Android.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.200]   That's true.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:54.720]   That's true.
[00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.160]   You may have been having developed for both,
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.880]   or decided which one makes most sense.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.240]   And the other thing we're seeing is that a bunch of people
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:03.440]   are using HTML for the UI and then some app plumbing
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:05.520]   to some other bits and pieces.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.240]   So you still want to use HTML because it's flexible
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.000]   and you can change it quickly to do the sort of broader UI.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.480]   But then you want to-- if you're
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.320]   doing some specific control of something else,
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.880]   then you go to the native thing.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.320]   And the stuff they were showing today
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:23.240]   with accelerated Canvas and accelerated GL
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.840]   was pretty impressive stuff for WebDev.
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:29.240]   It wasn't like, oh, this is clearly creaky Web stuff.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.720]   It looked good and looked like it was working well.
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.560]   And is anybody who watched "Security Now?"
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.840]   Last hour knows WebGL has been hacked and in fact--
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.440]   or maybe has been hacked.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:42.800]   Vupen, the company, has claims to have a hack
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.720]   that allows you to get by all of the sandboxing
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.240]   and own a computer through WebGL.
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.520]   So the more of these technologies they build in,
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:56.680]   the more difficult it's going to be to secure these things also.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.760]   Yeah, that's always been the case, right?
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.000]   Right.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:01.720]   I admire.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:04.200]   I have to say, yeah, play with your tablet.
[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:05.840]   I have to say--
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.160]   This one time, Kevin has just been like with the tablet.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:08.800]   I know.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.160]   I know.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.240]   The maps look great on there.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.680]   I still feel you.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.880]   Yeah, you know where I am.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:15.480]   That's latitude, huh?
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:15.980]   Yeah.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:17.760]   You know where I am.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:20.520]   Kevin and I are the only people who actually use latitude.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.320]   It's true.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.880]   And I think there are three or four others here.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:24.760]   I think they work with Google there.
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.840]   It's kind of a-- it's kind of a-- you know, it's fun.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.600]   I don't need to.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.200]   My iPhone does it for me.
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.720]   Oh, shut up.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.400]   Just shut up.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.040]   So you have to turn on-- let's see.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:37.440]   I'll turn on the latitude layer.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.560]   And then I will see where Kevin is.
[00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.320]   Of course, I know where he is, but--
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:45.440]   Well, it thinks I'm in Las Vegas at the moment, apparently.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.660]   We won't tell the question.
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.900]   And he goes, I got confused.
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.660]   I think I'm using my laptop as Wi-Fi.
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.380]   So it's got very confused about where I am.
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.300]   No, I see where you are.
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.660]   You're not where you are.
[00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:00.100]   You're at home.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:03.940]   You're in Menlo Park, it says--
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.500]   I wonder if I-- like I can update that.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.060]   And it says 16 minutes ago you were there.
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.060]   So I don't know what that's going on.
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:12.060]   Don't have a trip back.
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.420]   It says you're an SRI.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:15.340]   It says 15 minutes ago you were an SRI.
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:16.680]   Oh, you know why, Kevin?
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.920]   You probably have other devices with latitude on them.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.440]   No, I think what it is is--
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.840]   we're on some shared Wi-Fi here.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.280]   It's doing by Wi-Fi rather than by--
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.720]   Ah, that could be.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.280]   A geolocation.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.080]   So that's actually where the Wi-Fi--
[00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:32.800]   This is where the Wi-Fi companies things
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.120]   live when they're not at I/O.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:36.840]   That's cool.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.960]   I like that.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.280]   I can wake it up on this one.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:41.680]   Maybe this will be smarter about it.
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.080]   You probably have to turn on the GPS and all that stuff, too.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.080]   Right.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:51.200]   I think this is very close to being an iPad competitor.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:55.560]   But the software doesn't feel as mature and the lack of apps.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.700]   I mean, I downloaded every app I could find
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.860]   that actually takes advantage of it.
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:02.680]   Interesting, like the Kindle app, while it's not designed for this,
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:02.980]   does a--
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:03.800]   The Kindle was pretty good, yeah.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.760]   It does a very nice job of making it easy to read.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.680]   And it rotates.
[00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.240]   Well, things do scale better on Android
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.320]   than they do on the iPhone.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.320]   If you get a previous--
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:17.200]   That grants you that, yeah.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:18.200]   I'll grant you that.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.160]   Yeah, and in the sessions.
[00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:21.280]   I mean, the sessions are all about developers.
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:24.680]   Make quality apps be aggressively compatible.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.280]   Take advantage of the new capabilities of Honeycomb
[00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.480]   and ice cream sandwich.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.360]   But make your apps compatible for all kinds
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.520]   of different screen sizes.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.680]   And the new development kit will do that kind of more
[00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.600]   automatically, right?
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   Yeah, there are more developer tools
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.200]   that make that easier.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.240]   And they're kind of pushing this agreement
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:47.880]   to update devices a little faster as sort of a motivation
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.000]   for developers to update their apps faster.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:51.520]   Right.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.000]   Are you hearing any buzz from developers there of things
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.960]   that besides the applause meter seem to excite them
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:02.440]   or are they starting to think about what they want to develop to?
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.040]   Everyone that I've talked to has been sort of
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:08.560]   had the same sort of Android versus Chrome conflict
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:09.200]   that I've had.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:12.000]   Honestly, the energy level here has been really high.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.880]   I mean, I feel like people are super excited.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.040]   I mean, this is like-- this is Vegas for geeks.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.040]   I mean, Google gets geeks.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.680]   And they know how to present and give developer stuff
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.120]   that they want.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.560]   So I've just sensed a lot of really, really high excitement
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.240]   about everything.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:29.040]   Or do we know it definitely got great reception.
[00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.800]   And the Chrome keynote today also went really well.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.640]   We should probably maybe talk about that a little bit.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.440]   Let's take a break.
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:34.800]   We will.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.200]   I was saying, yeah.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.520]   I was just playing with this is the Google body, which
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.440]   has been optimized for the tablet.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.960]   And that's really cool.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.680]   I don't know if it's--
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.640]   there's your brain.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.760]   This is Gina's brain.
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.440]   And if I zoom in, oh, there's your vascular system.
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.840]   It's kind of cool.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.760]   It's kind of an interesting--
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.520]   I have enough veins to go around a little three times.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:02.480]   Let's take a break.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:06.320]   From Google I/O in San Francisco at the Moscone West Center,
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.800]   it's Gina Trapani and Kevin Marks joining us.
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.680]   Jeff Jarvis is back home in New York.
[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.200]   I'm in the Twit Cottage.
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.640]   And we will have more news from Google and the Google
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:16.480]   verse in just a bit.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.800]   But before we go much farther, let
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.000]   me talk a little bit about our friends at squarespace.com.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.360]   The secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.800]   We talk about the web.
[00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:28.280]   And just kind of with the assumption
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.120]   that you're there, you're participating.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.080]   And I guess we really shouldn't assume that.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.440]   If you've got a Facebook page or your Twitter account,
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.080]   you're not completely there yet.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.160]   You need your own home page.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.640]   You need a place where you live.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.920]   And the easiest way to do this, the most secure way to do this,
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.960]   is squarespace-- no, not her, not him.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:52.000]   squarespace.com, that's where the secret behind exceptional
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:52.520]   websites.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:55.320]   If you go to squarespace.com/tweeg right now,
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:58.120]   you can get a tour of all the Squarespace features.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.240]   There's social integration.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.960]   There's iPhone and iPad apps.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.640]   There's seamless blog importing from mobile type word
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:04.880]   press type ad.
[00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:06.320]   And blog are great stats.
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.760]   I mean, the stats package is--
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.680]   I think incredibly valuable to anybody who's
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:15.160]   doing a site to understand who sees your site, where
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.920]   they spend time.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.240]   These things let you make a better site.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.640]   Of course, great templates too.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.120]   Just go to squarespace.com/tweeg.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:24.320]   Click the try it free button.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.840]   You'll get a two weeks free complete setup.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.360]   This is a great way to set up a website for a friend or family
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.960]   member who doesn't have a site.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.160]   And then you can just-- because basically, all you do
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:36.800]   is you name the site and you give it a password and an email
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.520]   address.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:38.800]   They don't even do a capture anymore.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:39.320]   Thank you.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.440]   They've got rid of that.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.560]   So this is about as simple as it is.
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:50.000]   And then the beauty of this is you can very easily pass it
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   on to them so that they can do their own site.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   I love that.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.240]   I want you to try it today.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.760]   We use it for our Insight Twit blog.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.160]   And we couldn't be happier.
[00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:01.800]   squarespace.com/tweeg.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.560]   It is just the way to make an exceptional website.
[00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:06.160]   And you need a website.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.200]   And your family and your friends need a website too.
[00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.960]   Gina Trapani, Kevin Marks, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:16.920]   I think we covered Android.
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.720]   Today's keynote was about Chrome and they announced these--
[00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.280]   well, aren't they just really netbooks, Gina?
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:27.560]   I mean, isn't that really what they're saying?
[00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:28.080]   Hate speech.
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:32.440]   Using a line.
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.000]   Is it just really a netbook?
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   It's a netbook that boots up in seconds, that updates itself.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.120]   And that gets everything.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.160]   I like the way they--
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.560]   I think some are referred to regular operating systems
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:49.640]   like Windows or, I guess, OS 10 as well as these legacy
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.960]   decisions that we've got these layers of layers of software
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.000]   on our computers.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.240]   And we don't need them anymore.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.640]   So they built it from the ground up.
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.000]   So it's a machine that boots up instantly,
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.400]   is secure by default, and then updates itself.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:01.900]   Right?
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:04.440]   I mean, that's a pretty good idea.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.120]   It's a good promise.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.560]   And they announced they added a few things.
[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:10.840]   They've got immediate players.
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.240]   You can play music and movies.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:15.000]   They also took one of Android, what I think
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.560]   is one of Android's best features.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.360]   On Android, there's that share menu.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.840]   So as an app developer, you can hook into the share menu.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.760]   So you can be in one app and then hit share.
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.080]   And you send it to another.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.040]   Well, Chrome OS is going to have something really similar.
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.320]   You can build web service like file handlers into Chrome OS.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:31.680]   So you can be-- they've got this new file browsing system
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:32.800]   in Chrome OS now.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.880]   And you can say, hey, for all my dot-dot files,
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:39.240]   add this little button that says send to Dropbox,
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.280]   which is super nice.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.000]   So you can be able to hook into web services, not just
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.640]   Google web services and handle different kind of files.
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.000]   That's huge.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.400]   So I'll be able to use Dropbox for storage then.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:46.900]   Yeah.
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:48.240]   You'll be able to send stuff to Dropbox.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.320]   You'll be able to edit different types of files
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:54.680]   in different web services, which is huge, for sure.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:57.880]   And full jailbreaking built in, they made it clear
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:00.040]   that they were encouraging developers to jailbreak
[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:01.560]   and that their partners wouldn't like that,
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:02.720]   but they were doing that anyway.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.400]   I thought that was a--
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:04.560]   They say it's jailbreak ready.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.080]   I love that.
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:06.200]   Jailbreak ready, yeah.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.120]   Yep, yep, which was, of course, a great reception.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:10.520]   In fact, they showed a video that
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.000]   was really, really, really great about, you know,
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.240]   following your Chrome OS notebook in the river.
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.280]   And then, you know, you'll still-- you don't lose a thing.
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.280]   Everything is just in the cloud.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.440]   But don't throw it in the river.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.840]   But if you do, everything will be OK.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.320]   And then there was this incredible presentation
[00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:29.320]   by the Angry Birds guys, or one particular guy who
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.720]   had a sweatshirt, which I was coveting.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.880]   It was a red sweatshirt with an Angry Bird,
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.600]   the red bird face on it.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.640]   And it announces that Angry Birds in the Chrome Web Store
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.480]   and immediately loses everybody in the room.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.600]   You could play in the browser.
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:42.800]   In the browser.
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:43.840]   Yep.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.840]   Is that HTML5?
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:46.680]   Yes.
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:48.280]   That's awesome.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.040]   Well, it's-- yeah, they said they were using WebGL
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:54.200]   and falling back to Canvas if your browser doesn't have WebGL.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.360]   Oh, I wonder how it works in Canvas.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.640]   Well, it was looking pretty responsive.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:00.720]   I was trying to run it on here.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:05.200]   But this net connection wasn't being happy about it.
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:07.480]   It's free?
[00:53:07.480 --> 00:53:09.240]   Wow.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:12.200]   It's free and they sell you Mighty Eagles.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:15.800]   And I've spent many, many, many dollars on Mighty Eagles.
[00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:18.040]   So it's really not free.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.520]   Far from it.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.160]   The other big announcement developers--
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.320]   I did it without that.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:27.280]   The 95% cut was a big thing for developers as well.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.520]   So the Chrome Store--
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.920]   They'll take 5%?
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:31.200]   That's all?
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:31.720]   That's it.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:32.360]   That's network theory.
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:34.720]   That's how you grow networks to be huge.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.220]   Wow.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.720]   The less you take, the bigger the network,
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:37.880]   the more the network is worth.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.000]   Wow, that's great.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.640]   But that's not really competing with Apple.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.640]   That's competing with PayPal, right?
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.800]   PayPal charges you around 4%.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.920]   It varies because it's a fixed state P passable.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.320]   How is it not competing with Apple?
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:52.040]   Because this is on the web.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:52.680]   It's on Chrome.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:54.520]   So it's basically web development.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.440]   It's a web--
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.840]   The app will doesn't sell--
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.400]   Well, Apple does sell apps.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.600]   Apple has the app store.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:03.240]   But you can't do it with a web app.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.800]   Apple is a physical thing on a physical device.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:06.840]   You're buying that.
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:10.160]   Oh, but covering the wall between apps and the web
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.000]   is going to disappear.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   No.
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:12.920]   Yeah, no, I think so.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:15.320]   I don't think users really know or care about it.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.240]   Yeah, I don't think they do.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:19.440]   Well, if I could put angry viewers in my browser,
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:23.120]   what's the difference to angry birds from the Apple store
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.280]   and angry birds in my browser?
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:25.920]   It's the same thing.
[00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:28.800]   So it's going to be the difference is de minimis.
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:32.240]   I don't understand what the battery power isn't like 24 hours.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.880]   It's less than my MacBook.
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:37.080]   I don't understand why it's not free.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:37.680]   The machine.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:38.880]   The machine.
[00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:39.920]   It seems expensive.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.440]   Well, that was the thing they announced.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.160]   Do you see that they announced for $28 a month?
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:47.960]   They'll rent you it and do a full service business thing.
[00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:49.000]   Ah, booty.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Hardware updates.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000]   That's what's really interesting.
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   How it comes.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.160]   A subscription machine.
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:57.040]   Do I get free internet access to?
[00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:54:59.120]   I think so.
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:00.360]   That wasn't quite a thing.
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:00.880]   Hang on.
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.720]   Maybe you get that 100 megabytes a month.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.800]   That's probably what you get is the kind of minimal internet
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:06.080]   access.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:07.000]   But something--
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.120]   Well, that's a lot of people.
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.120]   --and I think for a lot of people.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.120]   That's what the enterprise sells.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.720]   That's if the company buys, I think, end number,
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.960]   you not only get the machines, you get--
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:16.600]   and the contract to replace the hardware,
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.800]   upgrade the hardware, but you also get other functionality,
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.200]   I think, to manage your network.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.600]   And if you're a student, $20 a month--
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.600]   A month.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.600]   A month.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.600]   $20 a month.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.600]   And students are in the best shape of all to use this
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.800]   because they do have Wi-Fi all over campus.
[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:32.640]   You bet.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.200]   Yes.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.800]   And they lose laptops like fiends.
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:36.800]   Yes.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.360]   So this is a great solution.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.200]   You know, it's funny when Abby arrived at college,
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.040]   they rent you a bike.
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.120]   Same idea.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.600]   Because your bike's going to get stolen anyway.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.160]   So might as well just rent it to you.
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.080]   Right, they're just a community of bikes around campus.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.200]   Even if you buy it, basically.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.960]   When I dropped Jacob, I made them a standard.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:55.400]   If I told the story or not, I was
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:56.680]   moving something around the room.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:56:01.080]   And the bookcase fell and cracked right into his roommate's
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:03.000]   brand new machine.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.480]   Oh, no.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.040]   I was offered just by that night,
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.800]   frantically buying him a new machine.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:08.880]   Oh, my god.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:09.880]   Oh.
[00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:12.680]   Oh, for Chrome, Chrome will look very cheap right now.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:14.960]   No kidding.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:15.960]   So--
[00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.360]   And do these-- are they attractive?
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.680]   Do they look like--
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:20.880]   I mean, the picture I'm looking at,
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.880]   I don't know if this is real--
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.640]   Look, better than Sierra Korea.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.120]   The same--
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:26.600]   He's very black.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:27.120]   Oh, Mac.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.120]   Sierra 48's horrible.
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.440]   They look pretty shiny.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.360]   So you guys don't have yours yet, so you can't hold them up.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:42.440]   I'm looking at the ASIS model, which looks kind of surprisingly
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:45.000]   like a MacBook Air, actually.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.960]   So 20 bucks a month, you get--
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.960]   of course, internet access is free for students,
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:52.840]   because as you say, Jeff, they already have Wi-Fi.
[00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:56.560]   But it doesn't have three-- these have 3G built into it, too?
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:56:57.520]   They can do.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.280]   They're offering options for that.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:04.600]   So Samsung said 429 for Wi-Fi and 499 for 3G.
[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:06.440]   So I think we're going to see-- this will be interesting.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:10.640]   We'll see if a whole ecosystem springs up around these
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:15.440]   with some people providing free stuff in return
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.840]   for a two-year contract, that kind of thing.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:18.960]   Well, I think this is definitely
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.320]   where we give this to your parents' machine.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.280]   Well, it's so secure.
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.120]   I mean, that's the idea.
[00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:25.440]   OK, here's Angry Birds.
[00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:26.040]   Now, what is this?
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:28.800]   I get an SD version or an HD version.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.120]   And a word HD, I think, by default.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:31.600]   Answer.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.560]   But did you know, answer me, then why is it just a parent's
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:35.560]   machine?
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.560]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.440]   Were you saying something?
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.440]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:48.160]   I'm not playing.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.000]   It's the zero tech support machine.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.160]   That's the idea, right?
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:54.040]   But the sender is very big on saying this is secure.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:54.640]   This is secure.
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.040]   This is secure.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:01.760]   I also wonder why it's not-- I mean, I guess I'm confused here.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:05.440]   If you were all cloud livers-- and here we are the--
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.240]   when are we cloud livers?
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.240]   Livers.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:09.240]   Livers.
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.240]   As in people who live in.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.240]   I live in clouds.
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.960]   The clouds are clouded up to last night now.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:15.240]   If my liver could only be in the cloud.
[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:17.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.240]   All right, you're cloud livers.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.240]   I wasn't in my cloud the other night.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.440]   We're cloud livers.
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:22.640]   We're all cloud livers.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.040]   Ooh, isn't that wonderfully awful?
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:25.040]   I like cloud livers.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:30.840]   So if-- here we are at the show about cloud, right?
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:31.840]   Yes.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:35.840]   And shouldn't we be seeing what the advantage is of living fully
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.720]   in the cloud, then versus the advantage of having the machine?
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.680]   Are we just trying to say, I don't
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:42.440]   like this automatic gear shift.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:46.960]   I like to be in control of my car.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:47.960]   What's the--
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:48.720]   No, I agree.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.520]   I already see the advantage of living in the cloud.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:53.760]   That's basically how I've been living the last few years.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:58.120]   All my stuff is now in Google Docs or in Salesforce
[00:58:58.120 --> 00:59:01.760]   or something out there that isn't on the machine.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.440]   I want to have to stick it onto the machine.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.360]   It's a bunch of work.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.960]   Oh, I'm going to go-- it's not on this one.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:07.640]   It's on that one.
[00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:08.640]   What a pain.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:09.840]   How do I stop that happening?
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:10.840]   Is this--
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.000]   Is this going to be-- you know, I'm
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.360]   thinking of two examples right now of how this doesn't work for--
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.960]   like, for instance, Angry Birds.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:19.520]   I don't know what's wrong, but it's not playing.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:21.000]   I got the music.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:21.760]   I don't get a picture.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.880]   Oh, like your Microsoft machine never does that.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:25.360]   Well, I'm just saying.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.320]   And then I try to sign up for the music service on my Android
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.240]   device.
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:34.360]   And I guess Google didn't test their terms of service
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.520]   because it went on so long I couldn't get to the button
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:38.360]   and I couldn't scroll down.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:39.800]   I can't tell you how frustrating this was.
[00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:40.800]   Okey-gram-pop.
[00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:41.400]   We will make it.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:43.600]   We will make every effort to make it so that you cannot accept
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.360]   the terms of service.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:44.840]   I could.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.680]   We want to really make sure that you want it.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.680]   I had to go to a desktop because I couldn't do it
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:53.720]   on either the tablet, the iPad, or the phone.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:55.240]   So it was like--
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:55.760]   These things--
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:56.680]   But spreading.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.200]   You're obfuscating, Grandpa.
[00:59:59.200 --> 00:59:59.760]   I'm too old.
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.760]   I'm too old.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:05.920]   What's the advantage of having a local storage machine
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.920]   with all the software there, all that kind of stuff,
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.040]   versus the cloud?
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:11.160]   What crosses the line?
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.720]   Same thing besides access.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.560]   Same thing's happened.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.280]   I understand.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.080]   And so what I'm confused about is why Google at the event
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:24.400]   would dismiss the machine as a Grandma machine when you think
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.280]   they'd be pushing it as, no, no, no, don't forget
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.040]   about all this other stuff, all these other worries.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.480]   We will take care of you with a great machine that
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.320]   has the full power of the cloud.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.400]   I don't get the positioning.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.880]   I mean, there definitely was that.
[01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.400]   There was definitely the slide that was like,
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.880]   the internet is bigger than any hard drive you will ever have.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:44.480]   So you should just store everything in it.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:45.560]   There was definitely that angle.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.440]   But there was also the like, hey, we know your developers
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.360]   and you like your big, fat IDEs, and you've
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.480]   got your specialized tools.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.440]   So maybe for the nerds you want to,
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:56.400]   you know, more building their own PCs.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.640]   Maybe it's not for you.
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:00.840]   Just keep in mind that this is a great machine to share,
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.640]   to have in a family, to give to your parents.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:03.680]   And when you go home, Thanksgiving,
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.120]   you're not going to have to do tech support.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.160]   So I think they took a couple of things.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.880]   How do you think Samsung and Best Buy will market this?
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:13.840]   What's their pitch going to be, you think?
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.760]   No, they have no.
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.280]   There's no pitch.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:21.680]   They want to say an 8-speed loaded down with a lot of crap.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:26.000]   They'll actually, actually Leo, laptops
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.440]   are lost leaders in all these stores.
[01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:28.360]   Oh, really?
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.200]   They're not profitable.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.520]   They want to sell you what they want to sell you
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.720]   as the bags and the plugs and everything else.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.320]   And the service, which they want to be able to sell you
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.320]   with this.
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.320]   And the service.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.320]   So I think they might actually be pushing this.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.680]   This might be a reason the price might be up there
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.760]   is because it finally gives them margin in the stores.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:47.680]   And you get an ongoing relationship.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.520]   You know, if you sell access with this,
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.920]   that's far more lucrative, right?
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.280]   Because you know, AT&T will pay you--
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.080]   I'm going to make a prediction.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.000]   This is the Google Wave, Google TV of this Google I/O.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.840]   It's not going--
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.360]   Yeah, next Google I/O 2012.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:01.960]   I think this is not going anywhere.
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:02.560]   We will talk in one year.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.440]   Is it in the framework?
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.920]   Chrome OS, Chrome-- what do they call them?
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.240]   Chrome crap books?
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:08.760]   Crap?
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:09.920]   Chrome books?
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:11.120]   Crap books.
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:11.960]   Crap books?
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.600]   I don't want a crap book.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.720]   I don't think anybody does.
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.840]   I don't think this is--
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:18.120]   OK, I don't argue with that.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.080]   So then why the--
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.840]   You know what, grandpa should buy?
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.320]   An iPad.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.240]   Android devices.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.240]   Well, yeah.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.280]   An iPad.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.000]   At some point, maybe Android will be competitive.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.520]   But right now, an iPad.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.800]   Right?
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.200]   And it's about the same price.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:37.720]   It's a little more expensive.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:41.320]   More fun.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:42.320]   Yeah?
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.320]   I'm not saying--
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.240]   I'm rooting for Android.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:50.720]   And I'm rooting for Chrome, but I just don't see it.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.240]   There goes the pin and the balloon.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:57.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.640]   Especially without Netflix.
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:01.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.720]   Well, they showed their own video store as well.
[01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:04.440]   But yeah, it says--
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.240]   Oh, good.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.120]   Oh, that's what I want.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.640]   You have another damn video store, yeah.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.800]   I can't wait to rent movies from YouTube.
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:15.800]   You're the cynic today.
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.280]   I am.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:16.960]   I don't know why.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.040]   Malmiki, because look at this is like the third Google
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:20.800]   I/O in a row that--
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.280]   I know.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.080]   You're right.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:25.800]   You're right floating these ideas that just don't.
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.480]   But I do think the strongest thing that they said at the Google
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.640]   I/O this year was that Android everywhere,
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.640]   I would like to see them develop a platform--
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.120]   Android as a platform for mobile, for portable,
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.480]   for small devices.
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:39.880]   But I just don't see them on the desktop.
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:41.600]   I don't see a desktop play, and I don't see a cloud play
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.080]   for them.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.320]   Well, I think the other thing is the net book just dead.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:46.000]   Yes, of course.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.560]   It died a year ago.
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:48.480]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.400]   I mean--
[01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:50.560]   Sales went down, yeah.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.120]   Sales went down, everybody bought tablets or--
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:54.400]   I'm sorry-- iPads.
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:55.520]   iPads.
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.440]   Not actual tablets.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.400]   Yeah, no, not even tablets, just iPads.
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:02.240]   I was trying to be generic, but there's no point in it.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:03.480]   That's obvious.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:06.240]   And you know that the first accessory for Honeycomb
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.320]   is going to be a keyboard.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.400]   So you're going to have a tablet plugged into a keyboard anyway.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.320]   That cracks me up, though.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.960]   I mean, I see people with their iPad in a case that
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:15.800]   marries a keyboard to it.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:15.800]   What is the point?
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800]   Just get a laptop.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.200]   Get a laptop for crying.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.200]   He's a neck hair.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.320]   If you want a laptop, get a laptop.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.360]   I can hear myself.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:28.280]   Kevin's taking pictures of me with his tablet right now.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.000]   That's another just-- by the way, big disappointment
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.120]   on at least this hardware.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:34.600]   And I don't know if it's the same on the 7-inch.
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.200]   But like my barcode scanner doesn't work, my HDR--
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.960]   a lot of camera programs crash on this device.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.480]   Who is on the tab?
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:43.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.280]   What kind of scan you got there?
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.640]   A stand you have there, Leo.
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:48.520]   No, this is an iPad stand that I'm just adapting.
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:53.200]   It'll hold any extremely expensive thin consumer garbage.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.880]   It will just be perfect.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.000]   What do you show in there, Kevin?
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:56.760]   What do you got?
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.400]   I was showing the Angry Birds and Gina.
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:58.840]   Hang on.
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.280]   Angry Birds and Gina.
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.080]   Two for one.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.600]   I think Honeycomb on Google TV is interesting.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:09.120]   I think they might actually be able to pull that out of the fire.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:09.680]   That's cool.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.560]   I'm more skeptical about that.
[01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.480]   Really?
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.400]   I'm really confused at what I'm seeing.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.640]   It's almost like an augmented reality browser for Angry Birds.
[01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:18.960]   Like, can't quite hit Gina.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.480]   Can't quite figure it out.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:26.040]   All right, there's still tons of other stuff to talk about.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.920]   I mean, it's not all just Google I/O.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.320]   So we will get back to--
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:32.880]   There is?
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:33.400]   There is.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.400]   There is.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.000]   We have got Wi-Fi.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   We don't know.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.080]   Nothing happened.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.040]   Show them what Google is.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.000]   The Wi-Fi here is an awful--
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.640]   Microsoft did not buy Skype.
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:44.800]   Nothing happened.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.280]   Right.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.040]   That's cool.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:46.560]   That's cool.
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.160]   Nothing has happened this week.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.640]   Everything that is of importance in the world
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.680]   is happening right now at Moscone West in San Francisco.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:54.720]   Because--
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720]   Google.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.320]   Kevin Marks, Gina Trapani is there.
[01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.600]   Jeff Jarvis and I are watching from afar.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:02.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.000]   And we will be back just a bit.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.320]   Speaking of Netflix, let me offer you
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.560]   a free month of Netflix, which will run, by the way,
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.000]   on your Google TV.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.240]   So you're not completely left out in the cold.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:17.560]   And I hope that they put the new Netflix interface on Google
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.960]   TV, because I just love how easy it is to use Netflix
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:26.600]   on your Apple TV, on your Roku box, on lots of Blu-ray players,
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.520]   lots of new TVs.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.680]   Of course, you play station 3X, box 360, your Nintendo Wii,
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.000]   Netflix everywhere.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.280]   And why do you want Netflix?
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.640]   Well, of course, you probably know about their DVD
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:38.440]   by mail business.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:41.240]   But what they're really doing great with
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.520]   is streaming stuff.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:44.040]   And it's not rentals.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:47.480]   I hear Google and Amazon saying $3.99 to watch a movie.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.560]   No, $7.99 a month.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.120]   All you can eat.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.880]   And there are tens of thousands of movies on watch instantly.
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:57.600]   I feel no need to rent movies, I have to say.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.160]   Well, OK, the other night, Henry wanted to see Donnie Darko.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.520]   And I had to get the DVD of it.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:04.760]   And I was in a hurry, so I paid $2.99 Amazon.
[01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.000]   So occasionally, what this really does
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.080]   is it conditions you to getting movies the minute
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.840]   you want to watch them.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.280]   So many great flicks on here.
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:17.760]   And you can watch them instantly on your Mac and PC as well.
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:21.360]   And of course, as Gina well knows, all of Glee--
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.200]   - Pleas!
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.080]   - Or on seasons one and two on here.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:27.440]   And I presume season three, it'll be honest as it's done.
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:27.920]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:29.680]   - You don't have to wait for the discs anymore.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.200]   Now, of course, I will put Donnie Darko the Blu-ray on here
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:35.960]   because I will want to see the Blu-ray version of this later.
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.000]   But I'm a huge Netflix fan.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.880]   If you've not tried it, please, go to Netflix.com/twit
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.600]   and maybe tell friends and family too that it's out there.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.760]   Netflix.com/twit.
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.440]   It's great on your iPad, too.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.320]   I would love to see a Netflix app on Android.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.480]   I think that we're getting close.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.240]   I don't know what the deal is on that.
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.600]   But I would just--
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.680]   - Wasn't the deal that it was DRM issues?
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.880]   But if the studios have allowed for you to rent movies on there,
[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.360]   then they must be happy with the DRM.
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.520]   - They must have figured it out away.
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.200]   - That's promising.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:07.720]   - Yeah.
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.040]   - Because the issue is not anything technical.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.560]   On Netflix side, it's them persuading the studios
[01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.200]   that Android is secure enough for them to do it.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.040]   - Yeah.
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.480]   - And for instance, I love this is '69.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:20.880]   I mean, the biggest thing about this is that it's a widescreen
[01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.080]   compared to the iPad.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.880]   So this is just like made for watching
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.880]   Game of Thrones or something.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.440]   Actually, the HBO app is on here.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.960]   So I can't watch Game of Thrones on here.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:31.720]   So that's cool.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.640]   - The HBO app is on Android as well?
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.480]   - Yeah.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:35.240]   - Oh, it is.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:35.840]   Am I wrong?
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:37.440]   I thought it was.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:39.600]   - I need the smart cover.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:39.920]   - Yeah.
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.040]   - I'm sorry to say it.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.120]   I'm really sorry to say it.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:42.880]   - Oh, that's great.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.960]   - That's one of my favorite things about the iPad.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.080]   - It's great.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:48.920]   - Not even any magnets in here.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.280]   You could just duct tape it on.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.320]   - Duct tape it on.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.800]   - Here, I'll just weld the hinge on.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:56.920]   - Floppy.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.200]   - And then it would just go like this.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.840]   - You need a stand, you know?
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:02.880]   Not quite.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.560]   - A little frustrate.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.160]   - Not quite the same effect.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.360]   - Meanwhile, back to Netflix.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:06.480]   I don't know how we got off the subject.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:10.040]   Netflix.com/TwitWatch Instantly.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:10.920]   I love this movie.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.800]   I'm such a romantic.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.920]   The American president, Aaron Sorkin wrote it.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:15.640]   Great movie.
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.000]   NetBending, Michael Douglas.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.080]   You know, it's not, it's fiction.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:23.040]   It's about the widowed US president who falls in love
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.400]   with a Washington lobbyist and their fairy tale courtship.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.080]   Hey, this is a democracy.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:29.480]   Forget Kate and Will's.
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:33.120]   We've got Michael Douglas in a net-bending.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.160]   Netflix.com/TwitEnjoy.
[01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:35.640]   You will.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:36.160]   I know you will.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:39.600]   So what about, actually, you'd be a good person to talk
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:44.600]   with this about this, Kevin, because you are a big voice
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.560]   over internet guy.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.280]   You did "Ribbit" for British Telecom.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:49.200]   - Right.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.560]   - What the hell?
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.280]   $8.5 billion for Skype?
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:54.800]   Does that make any sense?
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:55.800]   - I don't know.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:57.880]   It makes some sense in that they're buying
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.480]   a very large customer base.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:03.240]   And it's a direction thing for them, for their phones, sure.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:08.240]   So, given that, in my head, we should be able to standardize
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:11.240]   this stuff and interoperate on this soon,
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.360]   and that we're starting to see that.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.240]   But Skype is still the biggest install base,
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:18.120]   and in many measures, the biggest telco.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.120]   So Microsoft find that fits in with making
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.560]   their mobile strategy more.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.400]   - Right.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:27.000]   - But the question then comes, is Microsoft going to maintain
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.120]   the non-Microsoft platform versions of Skype?
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.320]   Or are they going to let those rot?
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.480]   And that becomes tricky.
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.000]   - I hope that's not true.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.040]   Because the Skype is succeeded by building clients
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.560]   on lots of different platforms.
[01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:40.440]   Whereas, we're stuck with, on the Mac,
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:41.920]   we're stuck with the vulcanized thing
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.440]   that they promised to open up when they have it.
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.520]   - Face time, yeah, that's not gonna happen.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.320]   It has to be, it has to be cross platform.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.520]   It has to be open, doesn't it?
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.840]   - Right.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.040]   - Well, it doesn't have to be open.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.760]   I guess Skype's cross platform without being open.
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.600]   - Yes.
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.520]   But that's, you know, that's the strength and its weakness.
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.400]   The strength is that it is cross platform
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.360]   and it works reliably on a bunch of different platforms.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:05.440]   And we can use it, you can use it
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:08.680]   without worrying what someone's running.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:11.760]   But that's the challenge for, you know,
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.080]   the rest of us out here saying, okay,
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.840]   for an open alternative, how do we do this?
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.600]   Can we actually, you know, we know that,
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.280]   again, we have the technology,
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.440]   we know how to do voice over IP.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:21.880]   This is not new in magic.
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:23.080]   This is, there's a bunch of protocols
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:24.280]   that are standardized for that.
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:27.320]   The tricky part is discovering accounts
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.720]   and deciding how you call them.
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.080]   And that's the piece that Skype has got down nicely.
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.240]   They've got their own private version of that.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:38.040]   So, the other counterplay is that it's,
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.640]   it is a large social network.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:40.800]   It's a place people go to chat
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.480]   and talk to each other as well as make phone calls
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:43.560]   and video calls.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.880]   There are a lot of people who use Skype chat.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.520]   The way that, you know, us old guys use IOC
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.000]   or lots of people use G-Talk or whatever your favorite chat is.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.920]   There are lots of people who just live in Skype chat
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.720]   because that's their IAM or their business IAM.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.240]   So that piece, coupled with Messenger,
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.920]   would probably make Microsoft a very big chat player.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:04.840]   - Well, that's the thing that surprised me
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:06.480]   because Messenger kind of does everything
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:08.480]   that Skype does, including video calls.
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.480]   But so they're really not--
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.640]   - But they're only some other business users
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:12.480]   and only on Windows.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.640]   - Right, right.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.000]   What about the idea that Microsoft uses Skype
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.400]   in their business, in their enterprise?
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.040]   And of course gets the benefit of this customer base also.
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:25.320]   And then because they are a stakeholder in Facebook,
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.240]   let's license some of it to,
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.040]   you know who could really use this, is Facebook.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.840]   - That's where I think the real benefit is, yes.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.440]   - And I wonder if Microsoft didn't think,
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.000]   yeah, we can make a little money on the side
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   by real licensing it over to Facebook.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   Imagine embedded video chat in Facebook.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.480]   I think it would be huge.
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:47.440]   - You know what it does, it gives you chat roulette
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:48.720]   without the--
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:49.720]   - Without the peanut parts.
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:50.560]   - The peanut.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:53.520]   - Yeah, right, 'cause it's your friends and--
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.360]   - None of my friends have it.
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:55.200]   - They're not gonna do it.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.040]   - So it's okay.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:58.080]   (laughing)
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:12:59.920]   - Probably Italy, I'll probably do.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.280]   (laughing)
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.600]   - I wasn't thinking of you specifically,
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.000]   but now that you mention it.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.280]   No, I think that that's, I think that to me,
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:11.440]   now I know that there were rumors that Google
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.760]   was trying to buy it, Facebook was trying to buy it,
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.080]   Microsoft swoops in offering a huge amount of money,
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.640]   eight and a half billion dollars in.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.240]   - Doesn't eBay feel like a dork?
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.680]   - No, you know what?
[01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:22.760]   eBay made money.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.560]   - 'Cause they still own that.
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:26.280]   - They have a 30% stake.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:29.960]   30% is 2.5 or 6 billion.
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.000]   They made a billion dollars.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.680]   - They made more on this sale than they did in the last sale.
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:36.160]   - Is that amazing?
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.000]   - It is.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.880]   - Well, I mean, when you sell Skype for that much money.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.680]   (laughing)
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:44.040]   - Yeah, they're not feeling like dorks.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:44.880]   - No.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:45.720]   - Okay, I'll take it back.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:46.560]   - Meg Whippens going.
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.640]   - I told you, you should've elected me.
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.760]   - I think the Facebook just didn't have the money,
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.680]   probably, to buy, eight and a half billion dollar Skype.
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:58.920]   Had they had that in the bank,
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.080]   I think it would have been,
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:04.680]   they would be the most likely people to take advantage of Skype.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.600]   And I suspect they may still.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.200]   That's my point, is that Microsoft probably looked and said,
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.440]   "Hey, you know, I bet we could sell Zuck a little bit of this."
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:17.360]   I just, when I say Zuck, I want it.
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:18.720]   - Yeah, I like the impression.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.560]   - Hey, Zuck.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:20.400]   - Hey, hey.
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.400]   - There is other news, but I don't care.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:23.240]   - Thank you.
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:24.240]   - All right, all right, all right.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:26.080]   One more story, and then we'll get to your tip
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.080]   and your tool and your number.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.440]   But one more story.
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:31.640]   And this, I found in an interesting place,
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:33.560]   I found it on Hacker News.
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.280]   It's in the wrong spot, a guy named Aaron Greenspan
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:40.480]   actually posted this as an answer on Quora.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:45.120]   He started a money transfer company called Face Cash.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.080]   And he's very concerned about it.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.400]   They're called Face Cash, and he's very concerned.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.400]   The California State Senate,
[01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.560]   Committee on Banking, Finance, and Insurance.
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:02.960]   There's a law,
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.920]   AB, that they put out, AB 2789, actually it's effective.
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.640]   It was effective January 1st.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.800]   It's called the Money Transmission Act.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.400]   He says this is a ticking time bomb.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:18.880]   And in 50 days, it's gonna kill everybody
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.120]   but the credit card companies.
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.680]   And people who use the credit card companies like PayPal.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:27.720]   Essentially, this was a law that was essentially written
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.780]   by something called the Money Services Roundtable,
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:35.480]   who include Western Union, MoneyGAM, TravelX,
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:40.480]   American Express, the credit card companies.
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:44.200]   They passed this law saying that if you want to be a,
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.200]   if you want to transmit money,
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.520]   you have to buy a license in the state of California
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:50.520]   for half a million dollars.
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.640]   I'm sorry. - So close.
[01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:53.000]   - Yeah, half a million dollars.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.600]   And furthermore, that's just California.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.960]   And many other states apparently have similar laws
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.960]   which the credit card companies have shoved through,
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:04.760]   kind of, you know, surreptitiously.
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.200]   In other words, if you wanted to start
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:08.680]   a money transfer service, a Bitcoin or something,
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:10.640]   that actually allowed people to pay money
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:12.160]   without using a credit card,
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:15.520]   without using Visa or MasterCard or American Express,
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:18.160]   you would have to pay millions of dollars in license fees
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.680]   state by state, 'cause there's no federal law.
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:22.560]   - You state of trade, Jesus.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.080]   - Big time restraint of trade.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.040]   And that's what he's saying.
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:28.400]   He says, this is, what we really need
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.920]   is a federal law that overrides the state law.
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:35.400]   Because essentially, the problem is that if you were,
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.920]   if you wanted, as he wanted to do,
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.760]   start a company like FaceCache,
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.160]   you'd have to go to your investors and say,
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.080]   "The first half a million that you're gonna give me
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.000]   is gonna go to the state of California
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.440]   just so we could do business in California alone."
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.040]   - So if you wanted--
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:50.720]   - Does that follow the interstate commerce clause?
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.840]   - Pardon me?
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.800]   - Doesn't that follow the interstate commerce clause?
[01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:54.640]   That's weird.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.480]   - Well--
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.160]   - So the California says you can't send money out of California
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.880]   or you can't send money into California?
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:16:59.800]   I mean, that's--
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:00.640]   - Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:02.480]   It seems like that's why a federal law
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:04.240]   could easily override this.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.560]   - Right.
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:09.800]   - I think some of this has to do with terrorism.
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.480]   It's such a great, it's such a great--
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:13.320]   - It's a great excuse for--
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.720]   - So many things.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:15.560]   - Tracking, sure.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.400]   - Yeah.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.880]   - Wow.
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:23.280]   - Because if you transmit money illegally without a license,
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.120]   you will go to the Jail Under the Patriot Act.
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.720]   - Yes.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:30.480]   - So this is a very nice little knot they've tied here.
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.720]   I just wanted to bring this up,
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:34.040]   make people aware of it, check in your own state,
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:35.880]   you will probably have something similar.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:38.960]   If you're in California, it's AB 2789,
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:42.080]   passed into law September 2010 effective
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.760]   the first of this year,
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:48.600]   and they have until, I think, July 1st, 2011
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.040]   to get that license.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.040]   - Wow.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:52.880]   - Wow.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:53.720]   - You should get Denise to cover that
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.560]   on this week at the law.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.400]   - I should, 'cause I'll tell you,
[01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:56.720]   if I hadn't been reading headline news
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.680]   and seen this Quora post by Aaron Greenspan,
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:00.240]   I would have known anything about this.
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.440]   It's just stealthed right in under the wire.
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:04.560]   But that's why I wanted to bring it up on Twig,
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.520]   because we have smart listeners
[01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.800]   who understand the implications.
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.000]   - Yeah, essentially it's the credit card
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:09.840]   stuff that companies saying,
[01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.520]   you're not gonna take our business, boyo.
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.560]   - Well, the other self law this week was
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:19.200]   the renewal of the .NET domain contract.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.040]   Do you see that?
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.400]   - No, what happened there?
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:25.960]   - So the RIA and so on are saying,
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:27.440]   the very signs on the order to renew that,
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.240]   if they can do the same, shutting down of .NET,
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.600]   so they've done to .coms.
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:31.440]   So they're trying to extend the--
[01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.600]   - Wow.
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.400]   - That to the .NETs as well.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.240]   - Oh.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:36.480]   - But they took the poker sites offline,
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.960]   the .coms went down the .NET stayed up,
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.680]   because it wasn't under that control.
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.400]   So they're trying to close that loophole
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.800]   by strong arming, very sign.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.440]   And that was, I think there was comments
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.040]   taken on it yesterday.
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.800]   - This is why it is so important
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.560]   that you be literate,
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:56.120]   tech literate and understand these issues,
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.200]   because this stuff is happening all the time.
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.760]   And the people who understand it will manipulate,
[01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.480]   will manipulate everybody else.
[01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:05.520]   This is why it's so important,
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:08.560]   I think for us to do what we do to educate.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.160]   So too very interesting.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:12.480]   We'll continue to follow both those stories.
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:16.320]   But time has come for our tip,
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.320]   our number and our tool of the week.
[01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.880]   Let's start with Gina Trapani,
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.400]   who has been very busy at Google I/O.
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:25.800]   So maybe you don't have a tip of the week this week.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:27.240]   - I do, I do actually.
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:30.040]   One of the kind of smaller, more minor announcements,
[01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:32.400]   but one of the announcements that was totally up my alley,
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.920]   was that the Google Gmail Tasks now has an API,
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:37.760]   which is pretty cool.
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:38.880]   Google Tasks is one of those things,
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:39.840]   it's built into Gmail,
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.960]   you can turn messages into do's
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:45.560]   and like manager to-do list on your phone.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.680]   And so they just released an API,
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:48.520]   it's been a long time.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:52.480]   - Yeah, along with that, a Chrome extension,
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:54.040]   which integrates with Google Tasks.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.400]   So if you search for Google Tasks in the Chrome store,
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.520]   you'll see the extension.
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:58.720]   With the extension installed,
[01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:02.840]   you can key up to the omnibar and type T
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.640]   and the description of your new task,
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.720]   and it goes right to your Gmail Tasks.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:09.200]   Or you can highlight text on a web page
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.680]   and turn it into a to-do.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.360]   It's a pretty cool, pretty neat extension.
[01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:14.760]   So if you're not big to-do,
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.360]   this person will be living Gmail, like a lot of us do.
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.280]   And you've been trying to kind of get organized
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.080]   that Gmail Tasks is actually looking pretty good.
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.000]   - That's exciting.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.280]   - Yeah, now that there's this API,
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.160]   there's gonna be, I think,
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.200]   and there's also integration
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.960]   with a few other productivity web apps
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.200]   like ManyMoon, Productive.
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:33.080]   And I might do something with to-do text too.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.720]   But for now, you can just install the,
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.520]   yeah, you can install the extension in Chrome
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:40.440]   and start getting your stuff all organized.
[01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:42.960]   - Yeah, if it doesn't work with to-do.text,
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:44.120]   I don't wanna use it.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.320]   (laughing)
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:47.520]   - I love that. - Text mail, Leo.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.360]   - No, I love it.
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.160]   That's Gina's great.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.000]   Free, is it free?
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:51.840]   No, it's 99.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:52.680]   How much is it?
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:53.520]   A buck? - It's two bucks.
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:56.320]   - Yeah, it's two bucks in the Android market.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.600]   And T-O-D-O-T-X-T.com,
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.960]   if you wanna find out more about it.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:01.720]   Really, it's great.
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:02.920]   I use it all the time.
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.600]   But I would love that's exactly the kind of thing
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.520]   is it's missing, is it's integration.
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:08.560]   And it was never done anything with their tasks.
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:10.040]   They just sat there.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:10.880]   - It's true.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:13.080]   It's exciting to see movement there, for sure.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:13.920]   - I'm really thrilled.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.120]   That's great.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.960]   A number of the week from you, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.880]   - Well, first I would do a little preamble here, boss,
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:19.880]   to get you scared here,
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:22.360]   because not only did Jay Rockefeller propose,
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:24.800]   a do not track a bit of legislation.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.600]   Also, I don't know if you know about this,
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:27.760]   Kevin, from your homeland,
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:31.400]   but on May 26, basically the same thing,
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.720]   goes with effect in the UK,
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:36.600]   to match with the EU's e-privacy directive,
[01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.680]   that says that businesses and organizations
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:42.240]   running sites in the UK need to get consent from visitors
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.160]   in order to store and retrieve information
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:45.840]   on users' computers,
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.760]   which means they'll have to get an explicit opt-in
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.440]   in order to deploy practically any cookies
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.080]   as wired.co.uk.
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:52.920]   - Wow.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.120]   - Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, alarms.
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:59.240]   - Yeah, now I've talked a little bit more with--
[01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:00.080]   - That's--
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:02.560]   - With Steve Gibson about this do not track.
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:05.640]   And as far as we can figure from the way it works,
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:09.080]   the kind of tracking we do to count podcast downloads
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:10.680]   would probably be okay.
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.680]   - Yeah, but advertising targeting such won't be.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:13.960]   - You can't do that. - It's still bad for media.
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:14.800]   It's still bad for media.
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:17.440]   - Yeah, well, it's bad, 'cause we're ads supported media.
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:20.160]   I mean, if you wanna pay for all your media, okay,
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.840]   but nobody does and nobody will.
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:25.560]   So how are we gonna finance all this stuff?
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:26.400]   - We gotta find out.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:30.000]   Anyway, so now numbers, I'll do number two.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:30.840]   - Two.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.160]   - Last week we talked about the brand value
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.040]   and how Google was on top.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:39.040]   Well, the Millward Brown Brands Survey came out this week.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:41.840]   And for the first time in five years,
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:43.680]   Google is not number one,
[01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:48.580]   Apple is, as the most rich brand on Earth.
[01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:50.880]   - I don't know how they figure this out,
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.480]   but it does make-- - It's utter bull,
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.280]   but fine. - Yeah, it makes sense though.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.920]   - Give us something to talk about, you know.
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.680]   - I think right now if you just think about it
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.200]   in your own head, doesn't the Apple brand
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:01.120]   kind of supersede the Google brand?
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.520]   - What's the story about this thing?
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:03.360]   - No.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.120]   (laughing)
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:06.760]   - Right on, Gina Dravani.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:09.720]   - I say it on my MacBook.
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:12.640]   (laughing)
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.000]   - Well, okay, what other brand, Microsoft?
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:15.840]   Yahoo.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:19.160]   I mean, there aren't, you know, Nike.
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.680]   British Petroleum.
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:22.520]   (buzzing)
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:24.160]   (laughing)
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.360]   - But sales force-- - Sales force.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.480]   - Sales force, very, very hot.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.320]   Very, very hot.
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.320]   - Thank you, that's good.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.000]   (laughing)
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.080]   - Hey, my tool is something actually I discovered
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.960]   because of this Galaxy tab, this 10.1 inch tab.
[01:23:37.960 --> 01:23:42.280]   I was looking, I typed, I googled, you know, honeycomb apps.
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:44.680]   And they're fewer than two dozen or three dozen
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.680]   that were designed specifically for honeycomb.
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:48.600]   But one of them was this kind of interesting app.
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.480]   And here's a good example, Jeff,
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.600]   of an app that steals your privacy
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:55.360]   and I don't care, I'm gonna let it.
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:57.640]   Because it's giving me some value.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:00.280]   It's called Grocery IQ.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.360]   Let me put it up on this screen here
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:03.680]   and you can see what it does.
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:06.480]   I've got the little widget here for Grocery IQ.
[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:08.640]   See, there's my Grocery shopping list.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:12.440]   If I open up the app, it does, I think, very nicely
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:17.200]   use the Google interface, I mean, the tablet interface.
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.120]   I also use, watch this.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.120]   Butter.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:26.120]   It also uses recognition, so there's butter.
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:29.720]   And so I can add to my shopping list using text recognition.
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:32.280]   But what's kind of, now, so this is a free app.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.600]   It is a coupon based.
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.120]   So, and I don't really use coupons,
[01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:40.600]   but if you wanted to, you could take advantage of this.
[01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:43.280]   Here I had whipped cream is on my list, don't ask why.
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:44.480]   I could, I could see.
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:45.680]   - We don't wanna know, Leo.
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.600]   - You don't wanna know.
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:50.240]   - But, no, I happen to like whipped cream.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:53.640]   But I could look and see if there's any coupons available
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.400]   for whipped cream.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:56.040]   And if you were a big coupon user,
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.800]   this would actually be really cool.
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:24:58.880]   But you don't need to.
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:01.640]   You can organize it by store, by aisle, and so forth.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.280]   You can send a list.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.960]   You can email a list out to somebody.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.720]   But what I really love about this is,
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.120]   there's a free account you set up for Grocery IQ.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:12.440]   And this is automatically populated onto my phone.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.040]   So I could keep it on my tablet.
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.560]   It even has a barcode scanner.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.160]   I don't know if that, I guess it would work
[01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.960]   since it's honeycomb enabled.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:20.960]   So I could scan in the barcode of things
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:24.000]   that I needed to buy, populate the list on the tablet.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.080]   Kind of, this is kind of a natural inventory taker.
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.680]   And then when I go to the store,
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:29.720]   I've got it automatically on my iPhone.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:30.920]   It syncs up automatically.
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:34.040]   - But when you buy a store, she can see what's on the list.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:34.880]   You can see what's on the list
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:35.720]   when you're at the store.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:36.560]   - Exactly.
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.280]   And I can even have different, I can add aisles,
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:40.640]   hide aisles, I can really, this is like, I mean.
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:41.480]   - That's cool.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.200]   - It's kind of, I mean, you know, Jennifer's out of town.
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.040]   I've been doing more shopping than I usually do.
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:47.280]   Okay, can you see?
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.480]   You can also enter in.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:50.360]   (laughing)
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:51.840]   - Suddenly I'm very interested.
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:52.720]   - I can see what you like with cream.
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:54.680]   - Next week, next week we'll be talking about
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:58.400]   Darning Socks and putting buttons on jerseys.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:25:59.240]   (laughing)
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.480]   - I like to domestically-o.
[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:02.280]   - Domestically-o, it's the new thing.
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.720]   The new green.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:07.000]   It also, well, you can enter in on your grocery savings cards
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:07.840]   and things like that.
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.240]   But this is, I think it's kind of a need app.
[01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:12.760]   Now, obviously they're tracking exactly what I buy.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:15.560]   They're probably selling it to these coupon guys.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.200]   But do I care?
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:18.120]   No.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:18.960]   What do I care?
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:20.480]   I mean, there's the value out of this,
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.240]   which is I get this great, good looking app.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:23.680]   They're making a little bit money on.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.960]   And by the way, they completely support brand names.
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:28.240]   So if I enter Hot Dog Relish and then it said,
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:31.400]   well, which brand of Hot Dog Relish would you like to buy?
[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:32.560]   And I thought that was interesting.
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:33.920]   Probably they're selling that back too.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:34.760]   But that's fine.
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:37.360]   This is called Grocery IQ.
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:38.800]   And I kind of like it.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.640]   - The kids.
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:41.440]   - The new domestic Leo.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.640]   (laughing)
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:43.960]   - The rocket and the grocery list.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:44.800]   - Hey.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:45.640]   - The supercharged grocery list.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.920]   - It's a honeycomb app, all right?
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:50.400]   I'm just happy to find an app that runs on this thing.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:56.240]   I do like this tablet, but if you really want apps,
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.760]   if you want form and function,
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:00.320]   you're really, you're gonna wanna buy an app.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.560]   But look, I've got the live desktop,
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:03.680]   the live weather desktop.
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:07.640]   And this is the current weather here in Petaluma's fluffy,
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.480]   puffy cards.
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.920]   - But how many apps do you, each of you,
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.200]   actually use in a week?
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:13.720]   - And I'm afraid, how many of you download?
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.920]   How many do you actually open up and use in a week?
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:17.760]   - Not that many, 'cause--
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:18.760]   - That's the point.
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:19.760]   - That's the point.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.200]   - Tim and I just grabbed our phones.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.200]   - Yeah, 'cause if I look at the front page of my phone,
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:24.280]   you know, there's a calendar app,
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:28.520]   there's four square, a camera app, a Twitter app,
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.720]   that's probably about it, right?
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.080]   - See, that's what I'm saying, Leo,
[01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:32.680]   is that when you get down to it,
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:35.120]   the smoke that's been blowing up our rears here
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.760]   is that, you know, the most apps win,
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.000]   and they both fight in that.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.360]   Most apps is actually a disadvantage for each of them.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.680]   - It's a Twitter app called Twitcom,
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:45.920]   it's the first Honeycomb specific Twitter app,
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:46.920]   although--
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:47.800]   - Isn't any good?
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:50.240]   - It's okay, hold, wait for a little while
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:52.680]   because Loique showed me Czismic for Honeycomb.
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:53.960]   - Yeah, that was looking nice.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.720]   - Looks gorgeous, and it will, I think it'll be,
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.600]   but this kind of reminds me a little bit of TweetDeck.
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.360]   I guess now that Twitter owns TweetDeck,
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:03.640]   we can pretty much say goodbye to any updates
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:05.800]   to that program, which is kind of sad.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.560]   But Czismic's good, Czismic's good,
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:09.800]   and I think, why did Czismic show me something else
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:10.640]   that I didn't realize?
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.760]   You know that, you know about widgets,
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:14.440]   everybody knows about widgets,
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.880]   but there's also, you know about bookmarks?
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:20.440]   You guys know about bookmarks in your Android phone?
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.280]   - Yeah.
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:22.640]   - Just putting bookmarks on your home screen, you mean?
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:23.840]   - Yeah, but I never paid attention,
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:26.240]   and Loique said, you know, we have a ton of Czismic,
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.120]   let me throw this out so I can make some room.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:30.880]   We have a ton of Czismic, our shortcuts, I should say.
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:32.960]   Shortcuts on here, and I never played with shortcuts,
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:35.600]   I always go to widgets, but if you look,
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:39.480]   an app can actually create these great shortcuts.
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:43.360]   Czismic has a ton of shortcuts for Twitter lists,
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:46.440]   for search, Facebook page, composer.
[01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:48.120]   So I can have a shortcut on here,
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.280]   that's a Czismic composer shortcut.
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:54.200]   When I tap it, then it just launches a tweet.
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:55.080]   - Okay, yeah.
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:58.520]   - So yeah, this is, I didn't pay any attention
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.920]   to shortcuts before, so that's a free one.
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.760]   - To do text also has one, an ad task.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:04.640]   - I noticed that, ad task.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:07.160]   But I also, I keep that ad task actually
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.640]   in my launcher pro bar right here.
[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:12.400]   - So the other one that's handy is the contact shortcuts.
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.240]   - Right, because you have direct shortcuts to contacts.
[01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:15.880]   - You have to direct buttons for certain people
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:18.240]   that you call a lot, as little buttons on the desktop,
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.560]   which makes sense for something this big.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:22.320]   - I text my son all the time, so all I have to do
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:25.760]   is tap that, and I have too many text apps,
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.560]   so let's use Google Voice, and it will automatically launch,
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:30.040]   oops, let's not show us phone number,
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:33.320]   it'll automatically, okay, let's go home.
[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.680]   - I mean, you just brought Kellequan.
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:37.760]   - Oh, that's it.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.520]   - That's it, Kellequan's here.
[01:29:39.520 --> 01:29:41.600]   - Eileen's awesome.
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:42.760]   - Hi, thanks, I'm ready.
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:44.600]   - Hey, I'm Eileen.
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:45.440]   - Yeah, she's a success.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:46.720]   - There's another freebie, by the way,
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.800]   they gave everybody, Google, I feel, I can no longer go
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:52.320]   as a journalist to these events.
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.920]   Google not only gave this 10.1 inch tablet
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:59.160]   to everybody who went, they gave Verizon LTE
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:02.520]   modem cards out, did you pick yours up yet?
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:05.400]   - Yeah, pick up starts in 45 minutes actually, 330.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.760]   I guess they didn't want everybody turn them on
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:07.960]   at the same time, so they saved them
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:09.280]   for the end of the day, a day too.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:11.360]   - And they gave you those, yeah, there you go,
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.240]   Samsung of Verizon, and then,
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:16.120]   and they gave you those, the crap books,
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:19.320]   so that's great, you're loaded up.
[01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:21.040]   - That's messed up, that's messed up.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.560]   (laughing)
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:24.480]   I mean, I'm not gonna write a book about Chrome OS,
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.600]   but I see, I see the sound.
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:28.880]   (laughing)
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:30.680]   - Gina Travani's the greatest, hey, you know,
[01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.160]   waves back, you should all go out
[01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.480]   and get the complete guide to Google,
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.680]   wave by the car. - But this is why
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.960]   Chrome will work and wave doesn't,
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:38.960]   'cause wave basically ignored the web.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:41.480]   It wasn't, it didn't use HTML as a file format,
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:43.200]   it was like, come into our little world,
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:45.000]   where it was Chrome, it's like, okay,
[01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.320]   what if we make the web the only thing on the computer?
[01:30:47.320 --> 01:30:49.000]   It's a very simple idea.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:49.840]   - That's a good point.
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:52.000]   - And there's some legs in that, I think.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.760]   - Mr. Marks is a web standards guru,
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:57.520]   and that's, there you have it, there's his pitch.
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.800]   He's now at salesforce.com, doing the same web standards
[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:00.960]   thing there, he did at Google,
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.240]   and Apple and many other companies before him.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:04.480]   - He's in the cloud.
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:06.040]   - He's in the cloud. - In the cloud.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:07.680]   - Mr. Cloud, thank you for being here, Kevin.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:08.760]   Thank you, Gina Travani.
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:11.440]   Again, her blog is smarter where.org.
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:14.480]   She also does that great think up app at thinkupapp.com.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.760]   Soon, on a server near you, I hope, 'cause it's really--
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.720]   - And maybe in the Chrome Web Store, who knows?
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:20.560]   - Ooh.
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:24.640]   She's firing it up, quit.
[01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:28.200]   All right. - Man, being at this conference,
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:29.080]   it's like, I don't know what to do
[01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:30.400]   before first when I go. - I know.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:32.120]   - It's challenging, isn't it to be a developer?
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.200]   That's fun.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:34.240]   - It is a lot of fun. - But that's what developers want.
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:35.920]   - It's projects, things to do.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.800]   Lots of interesting things to do.
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:40.600]   Jeff Jarvis is, any minute now,
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.520]   going to be the father of a proud new book
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.000]   called Public Parts?
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.400]   - I just sent it in, right before the show.
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.760]   - Congratulations.
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.840]   - So the final edits are done, right?
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.080]   - There are, yeah, this is the final copy out of there.
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:55.560]   After I have my fit last week that the copy editor
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.720]   made internet and web and net up.
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:00.440]   I changed that hundreds of times.
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:01.840]   That work is done now.
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:06.040]   Internet is again like water and electricity.
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:08.200]   - The web is whatever it is.
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:10.400]   Jeff Jarvis blogs at BuzzMachine.com.
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:11.320]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:13.560]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.440]   at 1 p.m. Civic, or p.m. Eastern.
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:18.720]   At live.twitt.tv, you can get a copy of the show.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:23.400]   If you miss it, of course, at twitt.tv/twig.
[01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:25.840]   And we'll see you next week on This Week in Google.
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.680]   Bye-bye.
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:29.280]   (upbeat music)
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:31.860]   (upbeat music)
[01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:34.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:37.020]   (upbeat music)
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:39.680]   (man has a phone)
