[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.840]   Welcome back feeling better I hope.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.840]   She's back.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.840]   Yeah, feeling much, much better. I missed you guys last week.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840]   I listened to the show and was talking to myself.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.840]   She's talking like this because she has a cold.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.840]   Jeff, you're wrong.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.840]   Is that a feeling better too?
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840]   Yeah, Edda did not catch it.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.840]   I had gotten my prepared myself for the baby to get sick.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.840]   And somehow she did between me and the setter being sick.
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.840]   She didn't catch it.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.840]   So I credit her Superbaby immune system.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.840]   She hasn't been sick yet.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   But I'm feeling much better. I'm glad to be back.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.840]   Knock on wood.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.840]   Also here Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.840]   And off time Howard Stern.
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.840]   You've been on Stern every week now for the last two weeks.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.840]   Well, yeah, two weeks.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.840]   Yes, I called in yesterday.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   Katie Kirk was there.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.840]   Howard starts to explain to Katie and she says, "Oh, I know Jeff.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   It was my ego moment."
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.840]   Oh my God.
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840]   Jeff?
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.840]   Oh my God.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.840]   And I know him.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.840]   One degree of separation from Katie Kirk.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840]   Sweet.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840]   Sweet.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.840]   Yeah, I was pleased.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.840]   I was pleased.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.840]   So you called in to say hi, Katie. Hi, Howard.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.840]   I called in because Howard has been doing phenomenal interviews.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.840]   It was a great interview with Katie too.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.840]   And so my theory, I use this excuse to have Katie give Howard career advice.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.840]   Oh, that's how.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:52.440]   I think, I swear he denies this, but I think what he's doing is doing amazing, really deep
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.840]   hour and a half interviews that go like no other interviews if I ever imagined.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   I'm Jean-Emmetian Louis C. Kato.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.840]   So that's a long list of them.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.840]   And so my theory was he was doing that.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.840]   He wrote to me, he says, "No, I'm not auditioning for anything.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.840]   I had the chance a few years ago they were going to, ABC was going to give me Barbara
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.840]   Walters quarterly interview show.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.840]   And I insisted on being part of the news department and ABC guy would say not, not
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.840]   all of them might have thought about it.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.840]   Yeah, I really know.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.840]   I'm kidding.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.840]   That long hair freak.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.840]   Times have changed a little bit, but I don't think Howard should get involved with mainstream.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840]   Absolutely.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.840]   Well, he's, but he's on America's Got Talent.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.840]   He's proven that he's good on that actually.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   That's true.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.840]   People still hate me, but he's really shorting his mainstream now.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.840]   And you, see, I haven't heard his long form interviews.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.840]   So the Louis interview really kind of blew me away.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.840]   I never really liked Howard.
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.840]   And I think I'm stuck back in the time when he was just the shock jock that made girls
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.840]   kiss one another in his studio, which just, I thought was just like gross.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   Right.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.840]   And it creeped me out.
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.840]   Like he just strikes me as just like this creepy guy.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.840]   But he, but I, but I watched the Louis interview and without intending to watch the entire thing,
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840]   I was like, Oh, I just want to hear Louis.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.840]   And I was amazed by what a great interview.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840]   Absolutely amazing.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.840]   I mean, he asked questions that I was just like, wow, and, and Louis was obviously very
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.840]   comfortable and very forthcoming.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.840]   It was really great.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.840]   It was, I enjoyed it a lot.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.840]   I guess I would guess Louis C K is a, is a good person to interview because he is kind of
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.840]   let it all hang out.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.840]   But even, even what does Howard do that makes him so good?
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.840]   What does he do?
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.840]   Well, I asked, I asked Katie that.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.840]   I asked my, my Gumba Katie that and, and, you know, she said that he asked unusual questions.
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.840]   He doesn't ask you the same questions.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.840]   You could ask all the time.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   And that's actually good.
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.840]   Because a lot of the people, and I, I found this in, when I was in radio, a lot of the
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.840]   people you're interviewing have been coming off 20 straight interviews with the same question.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.840]   And I was like, I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:41.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:13.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.

[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:03.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.840]   I'm going to ask you the same question.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.840]   He's curious about you.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.840]   You're right.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.840]   He's very curious about the people.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.840]   He draws that out.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.840]   He draws out things that everybody's curious about, but not obvious.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   He's quite amazing.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.840]   The thing about Howard, when I first became a fan, I saw the same thing you did, Gina.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.840]   He farmed, that's it.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.840]   One quiet summer, I was going to review his TV show for TV God.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.840]   I said, "I should listen to his radio show for a week."
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.840]   I went on a full week.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.840]   My epiphany was that he's better taken in big doses than small.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.840]   In a small dose, you get the fart joke.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.840]   You get the lesbian kiss, which is fine, is what it is.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.840]   Lesbian kisses are a wonderful thing, right?
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   But when you think of a large dose, you see the kiss for me.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.840]   Kiss for me.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.840]   The people who want to show more problems than that.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.840]   But what you get is a charming guy, intelligent, quick.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   Then you also get this drama of the show.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.840]   It's like Dilbert brought to life.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.840]   It's every screwed up office.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.840]   It was about to use a bad word.
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.840]   I admire Howard because of his realness and authenticity.
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.840]   When he started doing radio, it was not known for that.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.840]   He really was the first, I think, to be very genuine and real and talk about real stuff on the radio.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.840]   It was awfully scatological.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.840]   It felt for me like you're listening to it.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.840]   A kid who still likes fart jokes, who's a teenager.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:44.840]   I wasn't really crazy about his sense of humor, but I did admire his authenticity and the fact that he was willing to talk about real stuff on the radio.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.840]   How do I think you would also admire his skill, his craft?
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.840]   Yeah, well, I have to listen to him as your craft.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.840]   Interviewing is so hard.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.840]   It is actually something I love.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.840]   You do it on triangulation every week.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.840]   I really love doing it.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.840]   I've done more than 5,000 interviews in my career.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.840]   Many more, actually.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.840]   I think it's probably more like 8 or 9,000 now.
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:06.840]   I'm still working at it.
[00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.840]   It's hard.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   So I like to listen to people who are good at it and see what they're doing.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.840]   Hey, let's talk a little bit about, since we're talking about interviews.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   Cara Swisher, Walt Mossberg, last night.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.840]   Interviewed Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:24.840]   I was stunned to see all the gadget blogs live blog this.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.840]   Like, this is going to be breaking news.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.840]   This is not a keynote.
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:34.840]   And as far as I can tell, there wasn't anything particularly revelatory about Tim Cook last
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.840]   night.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.840]   Oh.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.840]   Do you guys hear anything you thought was worth paying attention to?
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.840]   It's a CEO.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.840]   He's not going to say anything on somebody else's stage.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:50.840]   He didn't imply that he said Google Glass is not mainstream.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.840]   But we're very interested in this space.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.840]   Right.
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.840]   In wearable technology.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.840]   There's a lot of opportunity Google Glass isn't it?
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   Nothing interesting there.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.840]   He said that the fuel band is cool.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.840]   He wears one.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   Of course, Apple and Nike have a partnership.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   So that wasn't unexpected.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.840]   He wasn't wearing one as far as I could tell on the stage, but maybe I missed it.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   Yes.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.840]   He just said that he wears one.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.840]   That's a wristwatch, dude.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.840]   I've started wearing a watch again.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.840]   I've started wearing a watch again.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840]   I wear him as we talked about this on Macbreak Weekly yesterday.
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.840]   I wear him as jewelry.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.960]   But I don't know if it's a very good.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.760]   I think frankly, the Google Glass is a better form factor of what you're looking at is wearables
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.840]   much better than a wristwatch.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.840]   For one thing, you can hear it.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.840]   You can talk to it without doing anything.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.840]   A wristwatch.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.240]   What are you going to put it up to your ear?
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.640]   For another thing, you can read it without doing anything.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.160]   I mean, if it's raising my hand, I've got the phone.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.560]   I've got a better screen on the phone.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.800]   I really not sure why a wristwatch would be such a great form factor.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.240]   I'd like to see what Apple has in its--
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:52.240]   What is it buzz?
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.240]   I have a Google Buzz.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:55.880]   Well, I have a Pebble Watch which buzzes.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:56.880]   That's--
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.880]   Right.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.880]   That you can feel versus hearing it.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.480]   Yeah, but so I can feel my phone buzz too.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.560]   The Pebble Watch, you can look and you can see who's calling without taking your phone
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.560]   out.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.320]   You can look at a text message and read it.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.960]   You can't respond to it, but you can at least read it.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.920]   Calendar notifications, things like that.
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.760]   I guess it's nice to be able to do that.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.240]   I think Glass is going to be as good.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   The question is--
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.040]   How many of the notifications do you really want?
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.840]   Well, one of the problems with a Pebble, and it would be a challenge to solve this
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.000]   on any device with a screen that's small is how do you stack notifications?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.640]   On the Pebble, you only see the most recent one.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:33.720]   I think you can roll through all of the Google's room.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.560]   And then they stack on Glass.
[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:39.280]   You can flip through them vertically as well.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.280]   If there's more than one-- if there's more than one New York Times headline, you can
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.280]   flip through them.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.720]   It's got that little corner, that little white corner.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.280]   That's how you know they're stacked.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.840]   And then also, of course, you can flip with a horizontal time.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.080]   Do you wear your glass still?
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.000]   Not as much as I should.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.200]   It's one of those things where I'm like, oh, I should have-- like, I'll be out.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.840]   And I'm like, oh, I should have put on Glass before I did.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.080]   You forget to wear your glass.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.640]   Is it charged?
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.000]   Do I have enough battery on my phone?
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.520]   It's one of those things where I'm just like, I'm lucky if I get the baby's diaper bag
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.520]   packed.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.880]   So for me, it's one of those things where I've been meaning to wear it more.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.800]   I haven't worn it as much, but I think it's just because life has been busy.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.440]   And it does rate my battery on my phone, which has stuck me in places where I don't have
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.600]   any phone battery, which is not a good thing.
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:32.040]   So I think I just need to get an extra battery and just get more into the habit of putting
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.040]   them on.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.040]   I have to remember to put them on.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.040]   I would disagree.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.880]   I wouldn't disagree that Glass isn't mainstream yet, but I would disagree that there are better
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.880]   form factors.
[00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.720]   I think Glass is probably the right form factor, actually.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.560]   So I actually went to my ophthalmologist.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:57.040]   And for the first time in my life, I asked about contacts.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.120]   I can't stand the idea of never done it.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.120]   For Glass?
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.120]   Because of Glass.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.000]   So have you gotten, do you know when you're going to pick yours up, Jeff?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Have you picked yours up?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   No.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   No, as always, what do I have to do?
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Write a kiss, ask book.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   I don't know.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.240]   I think, I don't think that if I had glass, folks have gotten them yet.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.280]   No, I think they're almost done giving out the 2000, right?
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.880]   And then, yeah.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:25.360]   Well, anyway, anything else Tim said that we, I mean, we'll find out on June 10th, that's
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.760]   when the Apple's WWDC hit San Francisco, Tim Cook at, in fact, we're going to cover
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.240]   that live as we usually do at 10 a.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.800]   What's the minimum that's going to come out then?
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.960]   Is it a new iPhone?
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.360]   The minimum is iOS 7.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   Okay.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.840]   The minimum is no hardware at all.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.880]   It's almost certain that they'll have new MacBook Airs based on it until Haswell chips
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:44.880]   set.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.600]   Here's my question about phones.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:52.040]   And I wrote a post this week when I said ignore everything and says it's the death of or the
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.840]   last or the whatever.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.960]   But I wonder how many advances there are in phones, right?
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:02.080]   There'll be more sensors, there'll be better screens, better cameras, this and that.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.720]   But have we arrived?
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   Pretty much what?
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:09.360]   Well, Apple's arrived because Apple's, I think, painted itself into a little bit of a corner
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:14.680]   because of their insistence that they control everything and that it all come through Apple.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.760]   I think that's one of the beauties of Android and one of Google's advantages with open
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:25.600]   source is you've got an infinite number of monkeys typing on it.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   And anything you can have.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.120]   We haven't really seen it except for having note two.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.040]   Pretty much, you know, because I'm having gadget lost right.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:40.440]   I want to buy the next gadget and do I go buy the four, the Samsung Galaxy S4 that's
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.800]   going to be with pure Android.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.840]   And I think, well, no, I pretty much got it here.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.440]   The HSC, you have an X, the here is an XS4, right?
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.520]   XS4, right?
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:54.840]   And so I'm dying to kind of get the next thing and I don't know that there is.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:59.240]   And you know, the truth is this Nexus 4 isn't that much better than the my Galaxy Nexus
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.240]   was.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.800]   So I already did that once.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.920]   I haven't seen anything that really moves the form and I'm not sure that what I would
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.920]   do to move the form.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.360]   I think you would like the HTC One.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.600]   I think there's some things about it that are preferable to the Nexus 4.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.960]   I mean, since you already don't have a removable battery, it won't be a disadvantage.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.800]   It does LTE, which I think you'd like.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.640]   If you could get that with pure Android as is rumored and the Nexus.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.640]   I don't know.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.920]   Now, this is an interesting question because I am not necessarily pure Android fetishist.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.920]   I think that's a fetish.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.640]   Right, but you didn't like the layer on the HTC.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:41.160]   Well, and as a result, I put CM10 on it, the Cyanogen mod, which is essentially 422 pure.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.440]   But the camera is not as good.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.120]   The camera app is designed for this particular camera.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.200]   There's some customizations HTC makes.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.360]   And in fact, I think I'm getting better battery life.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.800]   And so in other words, HTC knows this hardware more intimately than a generic ROM can.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:01.800]   And so I think there's a middle ground where you don't do, A, you don't have all the carrier
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:07.160]   and manufacturer cruft that they, AT&T put so much junk on there.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.520]   And HTC put some cruft on there as well, although much less than some.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.880]   And then somewhere in between with the UI.
[00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.760]   Now, see, I am not a fan of, and we talked about this before, Google's no physical buttons.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.200]   You got to have a menu, all the buttons on the screen UI, I think is a mistake, especially
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:29.880]   since apps don't seem to be consistent where they put that overflow menu.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.080]   And so one thing I don't like about the HTC One is it doesn't have a menu button.
[00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.480]   It has a back and a home button and no menu button.
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:38.880]   The Galaxy S4 has a menu button.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.200]   And I've used that all the time.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.600]   I mean, I know where the menu is because it's always in the same space.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.720]   And I mean, Gina, you're a developer.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:50.760]   I think you like the new, the 4.2 UI, right?
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.760]   You like--
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.640]   The action bar, which is like--
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:56.480]   So you define the number of buttons that you need on the action bar.
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.320]   And then depending on the screen size, the Android layout manager collapses them into
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.960]   that dot, dot, dot, that drop down menu.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.680]   And that's what you're talking about, right?
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.600]   Yeah, I mean, I like that as a developer because it makes me go like it makes me think
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.200]   about one of the most important buttons.
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:16.600]   And I know that the action bar is going to be filled in appropriately given the right
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.000]   screen size or the right orientation of the device.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   So yeah, it appeals to me as a developer, but I do understand as a user, if you're not
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.520]   using standard Android design, not just hollow, but the action bar kind of design.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.240]   I mean, there are lots of apps like games and things which are full screen, for example,
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.200]   that don't necessarily use that action bar where it can be confusing, where you're like,
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.000]   where's the button?
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Right.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   So I get that.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I totally get that.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.880]   I'm a fan of-- and Apple invented-- there's-- or at least it was a first I knew of to do
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.200]   it, what they called it monotonous design.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   There's one way to do it.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.480]   Your brain learns that way.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.480]   It's always that way.
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.320]   You know, buttons don't move around.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.520]   Menu items don't move around.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.680]   And it's still somewhat true on the Macintosh.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.080]   You know, that's one of the reasons they don't attach a menu to the window.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.040]   Big difference in Windows and Macintosh.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.480]   Windows has menus on the window.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.200]   Each window has its own menu, which makes a lot of sense.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:10.440]   But Apple says, no, the menu is always pretty exactly the same spot on the screen.
[00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.440]   And that's because that's where you learn to move that mouse and it's in your-- it becomes
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.800]   part of your, you know, DNA.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.480]   iOS only has that one hard home button and it's up to the developer to build the-- the
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.480]   button UI into it.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.480]   That's right.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.480]   What's your most advantage?
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.520]   I mean, when I went from Android to iOS, I was like, how do you go back?
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.160]   Like, I was lost without a back.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.160]   How do you search?
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.840]   I was also lost without a-- I was used to having a search key everywhere.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.480]   So it's, you know, it-- I mean, you're so constrained.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.360]   And I think that Google is just a lot more likely to iterate very quickly over versions.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.640]   That's why we've got apps that were designed for Gingerbread.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.240]   You know, that can still-- like, like, like, like run on your Jelly Bean device, but that
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:50.120]   seemed completely out of, you know, completely different than the ones that used the new--
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.320]   the new design and the action bar.
[00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:56.800]   So those kind of forced the old school menu button kind of on the bottom with the three
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.800]   dot menu.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:58.800]   So I hear you.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.360]   I definitely hear you, Leo.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.360]   If--
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.600]   Yeah, it's not an easy solution.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.280]   If-- so I'm not like hankering for-- I didn't buy an XS4.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:13.120]   I'm not hankering for the new Google experience Nexus GS4.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.560]   If on the other hand, HTC-- I hope this rumor is true because I really like the hardware
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.560]   on the one.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.840]   And actually, my pick at the end is going to be all the tools I use to finally get battery
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.640]   life to something closer to a day.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.440]   You were unhappy.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:32.320]   Yeah, well, I mean-- and the GS4, by the way, both of them with heavy normal-- in my way,
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.880]   heavy use eight hours, nine hours.
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.080]   But with a removable battery, that's not a problem.
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:40.480]   I just have to-- I have literally three batteries for my Galaxy S4.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.480]   But it is a problem for this.
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.000]   I don't want to have to go home after eight hours.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.760]   But I have tricked this thing out, I've turned off all sorts of crap.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.840]   But if HTC One were to make, let's say, kind of a hybrid where you've got the one with
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.880]   4.2.2, this is only for one two for one thing.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:03.000]   But also with maybe an HTC camera app to bring us always and stuff.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Because that--
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.880]   The ultra-pixel technology, that software, right?
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.760]   So you've lost that when you went to CM10.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.800]   Well, you still get a 4 megapixel camera.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.280]   But you don't get a lot of this.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.560]   They could make an app that does that, right?
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.560]   They could just trip the app and the app store.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.560]   You could put it up there, right?
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.560]   Put it in the app store.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.560]   They could.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.840]   Yeah, whether they will is another matter.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.840]   So it's--
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.400]   Well, wouldn't work on any phone except--
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.400]   The one.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.400]   The one.
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.400]   Right?
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.840]   Yeah, I mean, you could do that, right?
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.840]   But Zowie's are basically what Google+ is doing now, right?
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.840]   With multiple photos that are similar.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.840]   Sort of.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.840]   Sort of.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.840]   So it's interesting now that Zowie works great with this-- what is it?
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.840]   Automatic anywhere?
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.840]   It's great.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.840]   Automatic.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:45.840]   Automatic.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.840]   Auto-wasm, that's it.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:47.840]   Auto-wasm.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.480]   It's great because what is Zowie is is a 3-second movie.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.080]   And then it takes 20 stills out of the 60 stills, or whatever it is, that the 3-second
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.080]   movie has.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.720]   Or, yeah, 60 stills.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.680]   So you get 20 stills plus a 3-second movie.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.280]   And then what's great is Auto-wasm looks at those 20, picks the ones it likes, and makes
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.680]   an animated GIF, which is not as smooth as the movie.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.560]   But you see, again, now you have a 3-second movie.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:14.400]   You have an animated GIF, and you have the stills.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.920]   And that's really kind of nice.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.920]   Works really well.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.480]   Plus, the other problem with the Zowie was that it would put 20 images in, like, Google
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.080]   Plus Photo Bucket.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.840]   And because Google+ didn't know to combine them, the special gallery software and the
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.120]   one says, oh, yeah, that's all one thing.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.680]   But the Google+ didn't know that.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:38.280]   So I was just overflowing now because it takes the best stuff and puts the rest aside.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.480]   What it sees is duplicates is putting in that, you know, see the rest button.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.720]   So actually works quite well with Google+.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.520]   So the Zowie isn't an animated GIF.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.520]   No.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.320]   The Zowie is just-- the gallery on the camera is showing it that way.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:52.320]   It's a movie.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.320]   Oh, OK.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.800]   So you don't see the movie anyplace else that has to be on your phone?
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.840]   No, it's an MP4.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.840]   You can upload the movie.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.840]   Oh, OK.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.840]   I gotcha.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.840]   I gotcha.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.640]   It makes-- I think you're confusing it with this highlights film that it makes.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.840]   So then the next thing it does-- and I would love to see this.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.400]   This is in the gallery app.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.640]   Because it will make a highlight of your day and it puts music behind it.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.640]   Really?
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.640]   Oh, you haven't seen these?
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.640]   These are great.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.640]   No.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.640]   Oh, it's fun.
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.640]   I guess I could show you one.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.640]   Now you're selling them in the HCC software.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.120]   Well, that's why I don't want to go pure vanilla.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.120]   Right?
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.120]   So--
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.360]   Yeah, we were talking about this on all that Android last night.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.360]   Were you?
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:35.160]   Yeah, I mean, we're all kind of, you know, pro kind of Nexus experience, pure Google
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.160]   experience.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.920]   And I mean, for me, that's-- I guess it is a little bit of a fetish.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.400]   We were also talking about how hacking your phone is a little bit of a fetish.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.440]   That is a little bit of an addiction, I should say.
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.240]   Or it is in the word addiction, how.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.240]   Well, yes.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.040]   So we're getting the latest ROM and I get the name from--
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.320]   There's a name for that.
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.040]   What is the-- I just read the name for people who update every day.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.040]   Crack-roaming.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.040]   Rom cracking or something.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.040]   Crack-roaming.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.040]   Crack-cracking.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.040]   And I am that.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.880]   When I have-- once I put clockwork mod--
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.880]   Rom and--
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.880]   Crack-crasher.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.880]   Crack-crasher.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.880]   Thank you, Chad.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.880]   That was from Jason.
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.480]   Well, and it's a real term, apparently.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.880]   But once you put clockwork mod on there, every day you check for the new--
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.000]   CM10, and you put it on there.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.600]   Every day I have a new-- a new firmware.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:20.200]   It's crazy.
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.520]   So here's this is the highlight that Zoe makes.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.800]   And I have it in the French thing.
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.160]   So I put it up here.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:33.960]   So it puts-- it makes a black and white movie automatically out of all the pictures I took
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.280]   that day.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.280]   Some of them moving, some of them pan and scan, you know.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.960]   But let's say-- oh, well, I don't like that.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.640]   Let's change the theme to something a little more jazzy.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.360]   How about-- how about Vega?
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.640]   Same day, same pictures.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:23:01.840]   Much more jazzy.
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.840]   That's automatic.
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   I'm not doing anything.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   Wow.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.080]   I think Jeff, you should look at the HTC one.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.120]   If the battery life-- that's the real key on this.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.280]   The other thing about this is I want to tell one of my students I've mentioned before,
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.880]   as a business to enable people with the beginning of the early stages of dementia to use wearable
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.200]   cameras to kind of recapture parts of their day.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:26.280]   Oh, well, get ready because I bought a memoto.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:27.280]   Well, you did?
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.280]   Oh, you did.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.680]   So remember Gordon Bell, who started--
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.320]   No, he was going to be private around you.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.320]   Nothing private.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.320]   And forget the glass.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.480]   I got something better.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.320]   So Gordon Bell was the first to do this.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:38.680]   He wore a camera, looked much like this.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.160]   He was a-- I don't know if he was a founder of Digital Equipment, but he was certainly
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:46.360]   one of the big honchos there, later founded the Computer History Museum in the Bay Area.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.480]   He wore and wrote a book about this.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.280]   Well, a Swedish company's making them.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.800]   And that's-- I ordered one.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.960]   It's not out yet.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.000]   But every 30 seconds it takes a picture.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.920]   It clicks on your lapel.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.080]   It geotags it, and it uploads it to their server.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.080]   Have you seen the whale hunt, Leo?
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.520]   John on Harris, we talked about this before?
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:06.520]   No.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.520]   Do we--
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.520]   Oh, we did talk about this before.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.760]   This is-- he took a picture every five minutes of a whale hunt.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.720]   And he just did his new project.
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:21.920]   I think it's something like, I'll love your work or whatever, where he was with-- so the
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.400]   whale hunt first is he took a picture at least every five minutes while he was on this trip
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.720]   with a whale hunt.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.080]   And you can see the colors, and you can see the biorethm of the photos.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.840]   When he takes more photos than once every five minutes, something's happening.
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.840]   Guess what?
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.840]   They got a whale.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.280]   So that's one for me, then.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:45.160]   And then he just doesn't-- he has a new one now where he was with lesbian porn makers.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.080]   This is a theme today, an Howard Stern moment.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:55.080]   But making a serious film where every-- I think five minutes, it was 10 seconds of video.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.240]   And sometimes they'd be aware of them and talk to the camera and part of the story.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.920]   Sometimes they were just doing what they're doing, getting makeup or whatever.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.560]   And it becomes a narrative and a story.
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.560]   It's absolutely fascinating.
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.600]   So this idea of these-- this constant flow of photos can be turned into a narrative.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.960]   And Jonathan's proved that.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.960]   You know, I never wanted to bring this up in the show because I don't want to necessarily
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   encourage this.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.080]   But one of the conversations around glass is that it's one of its biggest uses would
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.920]   be in porn.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.920]   But it--
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:22.920]   No.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.920]   Which we talked about a little bit, like first person porn.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.920]   No.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:30.600]   But particularly lesbian porn because you really kind of get a new and most like hard to reach
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.600]   it.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.600]   So I'm--
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.600]   You said it, Gina.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.600]   We didn't.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.600]   I-- look, I forgot.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.600]   I have a bag.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.600]   I had a set up.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.600]   I'm saying it now.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.600]   All right.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.040]   So this is the adult portion of the show.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.040]   Kids turn out.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.040]   Turn out the camera.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.040]   Sorry.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.040]   I-- so no, no.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.040]   We don't have to--
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.040]   But that's what's wrong with porn.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.400]   No, no, porn is not about real sex because you have to have the camera get into these
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.560]   various positions.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.240]   So performers are acting in a very abnormal way.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:01.640]   And I feel bad for my kids because I think a lot of kids of their generation, they think
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:06.440]   sex involves a leg in the air, another leg on a couch.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:12.120]   You know, I mean, because-- but that's the exegesis of getting video of it.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.120]   This is like what it's--
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.560]   But real love making your balled up together.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.560]   There's nothing to see.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.960]   So maybe Google Glass would be good.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.760]   But I think all you would see is like somebody's forehead.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.920]   Squished up against the glass.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.760]   I don't know if that's going to be sexy.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.960]   I just think it's funny that where will computing is like, you know, of course, any sort of
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.760]   new technology to porn, but particularly--
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.280]   There's plenty of ways to make first person porn.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.280]   We don't need glass for that.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   I'm going to take a stand.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:46.160]   Well, there's a story of the rundown today, which is actually kind of silly because it
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.240]   tried to imagine somebody making porn to watch on glass.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.240]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   You've got that all over the world.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.240]   That's really bad.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.240]   Isn't that stupid?
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.240]   Oh.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.240]   No.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.120]   You can really look creepy then.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.560]   But I don't know.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.480]   I'll bet you there will be clever filmmakers who will find a way that makes the point of
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.040]   you interested.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.040]   Right.
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:09.040]   Well, OK.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:14.040]   I'm not a-- I hesitate to speak too much on this subject.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.240]   I don't want to come off as like a porn expert.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.240]   But this is already a kind of porn.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.240]   We're safe.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.320]   There is a kind of porn called point of view porn where one of the performers, usually
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.560]   the male, is holding the camera.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.880]   And it's so it's as if it's you, right?
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:37.240]   And a camera works perfectly well.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.240]   You don't need to have glasses.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.480]   In fact, a camera might work better.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.760]   Not that I want to be expert either, Leo.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.240]   But this is going to be the my girlfriend, motif.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   Oh, maybe.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.240]   Or the tune to be.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.240]   Or the tune to be.
[00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:52.240]   Well, I hope--
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:55.400]   And this is the-- this now raises the whole privacy issue because--
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.400]   Well, I'm sorry.
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.800]   No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.280]   We're stooping.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.720]   And you got the stupid glass on as if I had--
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   Well, OK.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.720]   So--
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.720]   People are going to have to--
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   People are going to have to--
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.960]   People are going to have to stop stooping with glass on.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:09.960]   This is not going to work.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.800]   Who's got a stooped with glass on?
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:12.800]   It's stupid.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.880]   I don't think that's the application for glass.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:16.880]   But I do think the--
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:20.200]   So we just chased the one woman in the audience completely out of the audience.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   She's running as fast as she can.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.960]   Oh, no, there's another one.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.960]   Oh, thank God.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.960]   There's two girls here.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.960]   Holy cow.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.840]   You called them girls, and now she's leaving too.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.120]   Yeah, she's gone too.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.240]   So we're really pretty much--
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.240]   It's a bunch of guys.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.120]   We're just working with the thing.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:40.520]   And so I had to bring it up with glass because it was one of the first stories I got from
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.520]   a friend of mine about glass.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:42.520]   I was like, oh, no.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.520]   We hadn't discussed it, so I felt like--
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.680]   You know, any new technology, you nailed it.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.680]   Pardon me.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.680]   You got it right, Jeff.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.680]   Poor in application.
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.680]   Poor in application.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   It's the first thing.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   Did I mention I'm using a Linux laptop now for the issue?
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.200]   I shouldn't have gone there.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.200]   I apologize, audience.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   No, no, no.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.760]   At least it was you.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.160]   Normally, it would be me.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.560]   I'm thrilled.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.040]   That's what's great about this.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.800]   It does seem to be.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.120]   I blame Howard Stern.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.120]   It's just--
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.640]   Yeah, we've got a fun around foot and it's gone downhill ever since.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.640]   Oh, the brain.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.640]   Let's take a break.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.640]   The foot that's in the air.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.840]   Can we take a break and do an ad?
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.320]   Because I know every advertiser wants to be right next to the porn discussion.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.960]   This is why we didn't like my space.

[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.480]   So a lot of times, I'm sure you'd agree with this, Gino.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:17.440]   People have great coding talent, great ideas, but design is so important nowadays in apps.
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.320]   And you're not normally born with both of those talents.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.320]   Exactly.
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.920]   If you're rare people, but they're rare.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.920]   They're rare.

[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.200]   We thank you so much for supporting this week in Google.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.760]   Look, I finally got my Linux laptop working.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.760]   Can you see that chat?
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.760]   Look at that.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.760]   Isn't that pretty?
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.760]   Nice.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.080]   1920 by 1080p.
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.960]   This is one Dell's pre-configured with Linux.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:28.280]   Ubuntu 12.04 LTS comes with LibreOffice.
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.960]   They have a cheaper one too, right?
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.600]   What was all that that you're just doing?
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.440]   First boot was installing stuff, downloading stuff, updating.
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:39.880]   That kind of thing.
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:45.200]   I slowed it down because I started making a recovery thumb drive and that's what really
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.200]   slowed it down.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.880]   I stopped that and started over.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:48.880]   We did it.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:54.400]   Anyway, yeah, I think it's interesting to see it delves on this before, I think.
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.200]   It is actually the first one came out of Dell idea storm.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   Really?
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.760]   Everyone was a reaction to Dell Hell where people said we want to do these things and
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.920]   then the first idea that came out of that, the customer was saying we've been telling
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.360]   you we just want a Linux machine.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.320]   The discussion came back and Dell said, yeah, but there's so many flavors but we don't
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.320]   know what to do.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.320]   The community said, no, no, we'll tell you what to do.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   This is the one.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   Then Dell came back and said, yeah, but there's just too much support.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.920]   The community said, we don't need your support.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:20.920]   We got support over here.
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.920]   Right.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.200]   And so Dell said, okay, they made one.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.040]   This is an i7, eight gigs of ransom expensive 15 or 1600 bucks.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.640]   19, 20 by 10, a screen SSD.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.640]   It's a ultra book.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.640]   In fact, you could tell it's a reconfigured Dell Windows ultra book because it has a
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.640]   Windows key.
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.880]   Oh, at least giving Dell.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.000]   Could you pry that off plays and put a type, you know, penguin on there or something?
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.640]   It's the only thing I would change.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.200]   I wonder what happens when I press this.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.640]   Oh my God, Windows eight.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.640]   Oh, sorry.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:48.640]   It crashed.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:54.960]   Anyway, this seems to be working nicely.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.600]   So I think I'll keep using this one for a while.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:03.560]   Not a touchscreen, unfortunately, but I don't know if Linux Linux does support touch, but
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.720]   probably don't need it for Linux.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.280]   You're that kind of person.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.640]   All right.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:13.240]   So let me get, let's talk about some new social offers from Google.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:17.080]   Actually, you know what I would like to do instead before we do that?
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.080]   Let's do the change lock.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.080]   What do you think?
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:25.200]   Oh, oh, oh, ladies and gentlemen, we give you trumpets.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:32.000]   The Google change log.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.720]   And now Gina, Japan with the latest from Google.
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:42.400]   Google Drive for Android updates to version 1.2 big, big update, new interface, optical
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:47.600]   character recognition, biggest, coolest new feature, you can scan documents and receipts
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:53.440]   from your Android device, direct to drive, and then you can search for their contents.
[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.360]   So this is a great solution if you're kind of person that needs to scan receipts and
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.880]   do expense reports, really, really great for stuff like that.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.320]   See, see in the screenshot there.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.560]   Yeah, there's a new, there's a new button in the camera when you, when you launch the
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:12.000]   camera or, or sorry, when you tap the add new item, scan is one of the options.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.040]   And so, so you take a picture of your receipt or document and it scans it up to Google
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.040]   Drive.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.720]   Really nice and a bunch of UI improvements, a new grid view, new quick preview, you can
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.800]   download a copy or file, so local device for honeycomb and greater spreadsheet editors
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   better.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.920]   So yeah, really nice Google Drive interface update.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.960]   If you haven't launched it on Android in a while, do so.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.080]   Some more Google Drive updates in Gmail.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:41.560]   Gmail users will now be able to see drive documents and calendar events from their Gmail
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:43.000]   search box.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.600]   So over the past week, this has been rolling out to US English users and unfortunately
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.960]   just not apps users, just vanilla Gmail users.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.360]   If you type in query, yeah, now boo, boo indeed.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.440]   I had to, I had to fire up the old.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.200]   They got to solve this problem.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.680]   And now there's this.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.480]   At IO, I went to a session at Google+, and then everybody in the room just beat them
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.480]   up.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:06.000]   Yeah, but we think, we think this is a lot better to use to me.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.640]   And we said, no, it's a huge problem, you guys, you know, yeah, it's not just you and
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.400]   the people don't food.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.240]   It's everybody who is a power user and you got to fix this.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.680]   Yeah, it's really frustrating.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.320]   It's really frustrating one that the other account.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.600]   And I'm now stuck in the, I had, I had been able to avoid starting a plus account with
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:30.320]   my apps address, but I fat fingered something on my Android phone and hit next or whatever.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:33.160]   And then it made the account and I'm doomed.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.840]   Like I've gotten all these circle requests for this account.
[00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.840]   I'm using the worst and people message source.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.320]   I'm having the same problem with hangouts.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:46.480]   I have people hang out, hang outing me, chatting me on both addresses when I only want.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.040]   So yes, this is a problem.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.840]   This is all only for vanilla Gmail accounts.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:54.400]   But so you'll see when you start searching in Gmail, you'll get calendar events and drive
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:57.680]   documents.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:03.000]   Google rolls out street view imagery for New York into Google Maps, including Central
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.760]   Park and the 9/11 Memorial for images of Hurricane Sandy as well.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:12.800]   If you go to, for the Sandy images, you go to historypin.com/sandy, a Google partner
[00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.960]   with History Pin.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:19.480]   And there's a, it's a community photo and video album call for Hurricane Sandy.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.680]   It's called Hurricane Sandy Record Remember, Rebuild.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:27.760]   You can see images that have been uploaded and you can add images as well.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.920]   You can now tour the 9/11 Memorial in Lower Manhattan Street View.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:38.280]   And you can see images of the north and south pools of the memorial and you can see the
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.200]   victims names engraved on the edges of the pools.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.480]   Haven't been able to look at that myself yet, but it's there if you can't make a trip to
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:45.480]   New York.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.480]   It's tough to go there.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:53.280]   And Central Park, partnership with Central Park and Service Street View crew went around
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:38:00.120]   Central Park, I guess on bikes on 360 degree, you know, 360 photo or cameras, took pictures
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.400]   of imagery of the parks and trails and paths and plazas.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.840]   So really, really cool way to check out Central Park as well.
[00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:08.840]   I love maps.
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:09.840]   I love maps.
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.840]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.520]   Street View isn't really, it's amazing.
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.840]   It's amazing the places that you can see and do and street view.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:21.800]   YouTube gets, the YouTube editor gets a new slow-mo effect, slow-motion effect.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   I thought this was really interesting.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.800]   Yeah, this does look really interesting.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   I'm actually, I'm curious to know of Chad if you played with this at all.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.360]   If you visit the enhancements.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.040]   The iMovie and every editing program does this built in.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.160]   So I'm not, I guess it's if you're uploading directly maybe.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.160]   Look at that.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.160]   Yes, yes.
[00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:40.160]   I'm like.
[00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:45.040]   Does it do Chad a better job than like, you know, Final Cut Wood or?
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.200]   So it's doing, yes.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.720]   It's super slow-mo.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.160]   Then Final Cut 7 would do.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.520]   I haven't played with X, but it is interpolating frames between the frames.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.520]   That's why it's smooth.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.520]   Right.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:59.840]   So this is, you know, in what Final Cut 7 will do is it'll just fade between frames.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.120]   So this is doing a little bit more than that.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:03.120]   You know what they're saying?
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.960]   The whole point of this is to show server-side processing.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:06.960]   Right.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.960]   Right.
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.000]   If you've got a Chromebook, you don't need anymore because we'll do it all on our server.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   Right.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Right.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:21.160]   So, and unfortunately at the moment, the biggest issue is that it's not really, if I'm going
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.000]   to do this, I'm not wanting to do this to my entire video.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.560]   I'd want to take a clip.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.080]   This is a great first step.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.720]   It's a cool, you know, first proof of concept.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.120]   The power of the cloud.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:37.000]   You can't select a part of the timeline of your video.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.920]   It has the whole video or nothing right now.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:41.840]   So far from what I have noticed, let me...
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:47.400]   Because that's normally how the YouTube editor works, is you can enhance an entire video,
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:51.000]   you can replace audio on an entire video.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.240]   So that is what I assume.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.960]   I actually haven't done any slow-mo stuff yet.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:55.960]   It looks pretty smooth.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:56.960]   It looks pretty smooth.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.600]   It does look very smooth.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:01.280]   Makes it look like it filmed with a high-speed camera.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.280]   That was a nice example in Times Square.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:11.520]   Finally, just after the stable version of Chrome 27 came out, Google announced the release
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.960]   of Chrome 28 beta for Windows Mac and Linux.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.160]   And the biggest new feature are these...
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:19.880]   Is this new rich notification center.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.800]   So this isn't Google now.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.960]   These are just browser notifications that are really nice.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.520]   They include images and big text and small text.
[00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.280]   They kind of look like Google now cards.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.800]   Actually, this may be what they're talking about when they say Google now in the browser.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:34.800]   This is only working on Windows.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.320]   I actually haven't seen this working yet.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.280]   I've only seen screenshots.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:41.960]   And it's going to come to Mac and Linux eventually.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:43.760]   But this is really nice.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.680]   I just built browser-based notifications in to think up.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.360]   And it's just a really nice way to know what's going on with the web app.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:54.400]   And the screenshots there on the next web look really nice.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.280]   Do I have to use Chrome beta?
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:01.760]   Yeah, it's a Chrome 28 beta and it's Windows only right now.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:05.760]   Getting my Windows machine out of Windows for a trunk.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.640]   Oh yes, hi, good friend.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.400]   Haven't seen you in 15 minutes.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:18.000]   But you have to go to a site that triggers a rich notification.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Oh, crap.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.600]   Yeah, we need to find a website.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.080]   Do we know sites that will do that?
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.080]   Let's see.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.080]   Let's see.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.280]   I actually have Canary Chrome as well.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:27.280]   Mm-hmm.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.280]   Mm-hmm.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.880]   Did you--
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:32.200]   I'm looking for--
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.400]   Oh yeah, Google has a Notify test app.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:34.880]   Yes.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.080]   Oh, OK.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.080]   Let me just make sure this is the--
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.080]   Or this is the code.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:39.880]   That's a GitHub link.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.480]   That is the code.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.160]   That is not the actual page.
[00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.040]   Oh, the version 28 is coming in now.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.480]   All right, well, we'll play with it later.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.480]   I'll put this--
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.320]   OK, cool.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.600]   That's all I got for the change log.
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.880]   And that's the Google timpani drums, please.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.280]   Change log.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.160]   Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.760]   Thank you, Gina Trappani.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.280]   It's a long segment.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.720]   They-- every week, they got lots of new stuff.
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.880]   There's I cut stuff.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.880]   I cut stuff, too.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.440]   Like, that was the edited version.
[00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.480]   It's amazing.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:08.560]   It's amazing.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.000]   I know.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:09.960]   It's a Gmail thing.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.520]   It's back in the main one.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.880]   That's a new-- we're trying that out.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.320]   Sorry.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.160]   I don't know if you like that sound.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.240]   That was me making sure that Slummo works.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.320]   So I actually have done a little--
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.960]   Oh, is that Slummo music?
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:27.000]   Yeah, so I was playing with a little clip of my own.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.080]   So what you can do is you can slice a clip that you have
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.640]   into multiple clips.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.680]   So you can actually pick a frame.
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.680]   You could also do things like combine videos and stuff like that.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.440]   Oh, so you have like a section of Slummo.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.440]   Right.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.080]   So I have an intro that I was working on, so let me hit Done.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.320]   So if I wanted to slice the clip,
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:48.960]   I can move the playhead to where I want to slice it
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.800]   and then hit the slice button.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.160]   And then there we go.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.560]   And now I have two separate clips.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.160]   And let's say I want this first clip.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.760]   I hit the Enhance button.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.840]   And then I go to Slummo.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.320]   And let's choose 25% I hit Done.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:03.760]   And now that first clip is now a minute long.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.200]   This looks a little like a timeline interface.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.280]   They're moving.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.680]   I got to tell you, if I were Apple,
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:11.760]   I'd start looking back to those pros,
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.200]   because I don't think the low end's
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.080]   going to be available anymore.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:15.640]   Wow.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.800]   And then you can even preview what you're doing.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:19.840]   And that's what you were hearing, unfortunately.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.720]   And even does the audio.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.360]   Oh, the audio is not going to render.
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.360]   Wow.
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.240]   No, no renders.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:27.160]   This is key.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:27.960]   No rendering.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.960]   No thumb twiddling.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:30.960]   No, that was instant.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:31.960]   It's one of the most powerful machines.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.400]   Well, so let's find out.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.520]   I may publish this really weird video.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.040]   Stop.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:36.560]   Stop.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.280]   There may publish this really weird video
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.680]   to my YouTube account.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.680]   But so there's a little bit of processing on their side.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.400]   It's rendering, OK.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.280]   But from what I have--
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.440]   from any time that I've uploaded a video,
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.800]   their processing is way faster than just uploading it.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.640]   Exactly.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.720]   We can try to find out--
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.000]   Let me have a few more computers than you do.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.480]   They have a few more.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:57.960]   Yes.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.400]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:04.400]   So yeah, it's actually more featured than I originally expected.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.640]   That is amazing.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.040]   I really do think that's the first of-- you'll probably
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.760]   see, just as you did with Picasa and then eventually
[00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:13.640]   Google+ more and more smarts on the server side.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.440]   And eventually, who needs a video editing program?
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.840]   You can do it all on a Pixel.
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.280]   Right.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:21.560]   And from this, I can choose multiple videos
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.840]   to merge into one video.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.440]   So if I've taken five different clips on my phone
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.960]   that automatically were uploaded but in a private fashion
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.720]   to YouTube, I can now take those three clips
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.840]   and make them a full video with editing in the cloud.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:36.560]   Oh, darn.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.320]   This content has been flagged as infringing.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.680]   I'm sorry, Chad.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.680]   They just pulled it down.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:43.200]   Darn.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.080]   Very slowly.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.280]   No, that's not slow.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.880]   They do that quite-- no, I'm just kidding.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.000]   That's the only-- we can only--
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:50.840]   It just got pulled.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:51.680]   No, I was joking.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:52.680]   He's kidding.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.680]   Oh, OK.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:54.680]   Whoa.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:59.360]   But you believed that, which is kind of the point.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.120]   It could happen.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.560]   It has many a time.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.120]   Well, that's neat.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.000]   I think that's really, really cool.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.720]   Yeah, that is really cool.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.040]   I could play around with the YouTube editor a little bit.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:14.440]   Like, when I was watching the "All About Android" fan
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:17.680]   who had edited together Ron Richards' reaction to Glass.
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:18.680]   Which was the greatest thing.
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.040]   Like something like that, which was so great.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.760]   But I was like, wow, could you do something like that?
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.160]   Could you do an edit like that?
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.960]   That was a great edit, very quick edit, though,
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.240]   in the YouTube editor.
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.600]   Has it gotten that good?
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.160]   It seems like--
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:31.960]   I don't know.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.320]   It was just clipped to clip to clip to clip.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:33.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:35.120]   It was just clipped to clip to clip to clip to clip.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.480]   So you'd have to just slicing it up and then--
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.800]   Yeah, the hard part is when you're going to start mixing
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.920]   soundtracks and that kind of stuff.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.600]   That's where I could imagine it getting a little more headachey.
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:46.640]   But if all you're doing is slice, slice, slice, slice.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.360]   Yeah, I would imagine YouTube could do that.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.440]   They call it simple A/B editing in the biz.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.640]   Thank you.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:54.240]   It is what most people do, frankly.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.680]   I mean, if you're doing something fancier,
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.160]   you probably do want something fancier.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.720]   But you don't need it.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.720]   And for 90% of editing, you probably--
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.440]   server side is probably the way to go.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:04.920]   What's cool--
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:05.320]   Not yet.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.680]   I mean, they're not doing that much yet.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.560]   But I could see them adding a tool every few weeks
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.000]   to the point where by the end of the year,
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.480]   you got something amazing.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:14.680]   And they even have like Creative Commons music
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:14.960]   that you could do.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:15.600]   Oh, they do?
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.200]   And videos.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.600]   So like right now, I hit the Creative Commons stat tab.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:20.160]   Oh my goodness.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:20.480]   I'm in--
[00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:21.920]   So they have quite a bit of capability.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.600]   Yeah, I'm in stock footage of Alcatraz
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.280]   that I never had that I didn't own.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.560]   I can click Music.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:30.400]   Let's choose Home.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.600]   I don't even know what this is.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.480]   Throw this on.
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:35.320]   Is that it?
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.080]   What is that?
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.280]   That's the Creative Commons music.
[00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.040]   No.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.000]   I'm playing Roll It.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:39.480]   Go ahead.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.400]   Roll It.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:46.000]   So now this is open your eyes with Alcatraz in the background.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.440]   Heck yeah.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:47.960]   That's right.
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.280]   It's the rock.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.320]   Wait a little.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.000]   Mars Ulrich hears that.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.560]   And we won't get pulled off of YouTube
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.920]   because that's Creative Commons.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.320]   All right.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.520]   This is the next YouTube.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.920]   This is the next awesome thing.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.920]   Roll It.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.280]   Have you guys played this?
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:01.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.840]   Hi.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.160]   It crashed for me last night, but I got to work into that.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.440]   This is on Chrome.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.760]   You go to chrome.com/campaign/rollit.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.080]   Download needed.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.640]   And no download needed.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.480]   Open your phone's browser.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:15.840]   All right.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.200]   Let's do that.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.960]   And now I'm going to do this on the air, but guys,
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.400]   please don't steal my code.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:23.200]   OK.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.640]   It's not cool.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:24.920]   OK.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.000]   T-I-T-V-F.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.240]   I've got to do this quickly before somebody else does.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.320]   T-I-T-V-F in my mobile browser.
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:33.720]   And you could show it over.
[00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.560]   I said it out loud.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.640]   You could show it.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.200]   OK.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.040]   So now I don't know how they do this, but somehow match--
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:40.440]   oh, wait a minute.
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.240]   I did it wrong.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.960]   Try again.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.720]   Oh.
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:46.000]   You got to enter it right.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.320]   T-I-T-V-F.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.640]   Where's the music coming from?
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:49.800]   The last time--
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.760]   The roll it game.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:55.000]   We're in the roll it arcade.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:55.520]   OK.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.120]   Now there's synced up.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.640]   Now watch.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.920]   I tilt just like the number of players.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.800]   One, two, or three.
[00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.560]   This works.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.440]   Is that wild?
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.320]   I'm playing it on my phone.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.920]   I don't know how they do this.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.920]   I guess it's all HTML 5, right?
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.280]   I'm going to follow it and send it, right?
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.280]   OK.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.280]   Now watch this.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.280]   So first I aim it.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.840]   I'm going to aim a little bit to the left.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.200]   Now, Chad, you're going to have to see the whole thing,
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.800]   because I'm going to swing it.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.280]   Oh!
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:30.400]   Whoa, you went a little too vigorous there.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.320]   Let's try that again.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.560]   Whoa!
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.200]   Oh, just missed 50 there.
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:37.960]   10 points.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:38.480]   10 points.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.960]   You ever play ski ball?
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.040]   This is an interesting--
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.320]   I don't know what.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.560]   --use of--
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:46.480]   And you're old and a chucky cheese.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.960]   The music too, right?
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.840]   So-- and you do get tickets, by the way,
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.080]   at the end of it.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.200]   I don't know what you can do with it.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.080]   Oh, so close.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.880]   Let's aim it a little bit more to the right here.
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.200]   And just a little left, I mean.
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.640]   Maybe you can get a Bitcoin.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.680]   Yeah, get a Bitcoin.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.720]   So you have to be running Chrome on Android, right?
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:06.880]   This doesn't work in just browser.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.360]   It says any browser, but they prefer Chrome.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.520]   They prefer Chrome, but it doesn't.
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:12.080]   So it's HTML 5.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.040]   So yeah, developer lady, tell us how they do this.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.440]   Yeah, I'm trying to figure that out.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:19.760]   It's obviously not Wi-Fi.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.240]   It's connecting back to the--
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.680]   obviously-- so here's what I think.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.960]   There's an HTML 5 app in my phone
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:29.360]   that can see the accelerometer, something you can't do
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.240]   on an iPhone.
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.600]   So it can see the accelerometer,
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:35.600]   and it's just sending that back to the website.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.800]   And the website's updating based on accelerometer information
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.040]   from my phone.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.320]   Oh, I hit a cat.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.000]   Everyone in the chat room is saying, yeah,
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.480]   device API plus WebSocket.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.760]   Yeah, WebSocket.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.720]   It's no big deal.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:47.240]   Whatever.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.720]   Look at that.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.200]   Isn't that cool?
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.640]   But Google's so smart to do this for several reasons.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:59.120]   Of course, it promotes HTML 5, but it also promotes open access
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.040]   to the hardware, which is something.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.720]   And remember I said Apple's painted itself into a corner.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:06.720]   Well, Leo, if we had three players,
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:08.400]   is that three players in the same place?
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.640]   Or could you and Gina and I play?
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.920]   That's a good question.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:12.920]   I don't know.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.720]   Well, that is a good question.
[00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:14.240]   I don't know.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:17.840]   I've had enough, but isn't that interesting?
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:20.880]   If it's a code, I mean, we could play remotely, right?
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.040]   It's a code that you'd like to write.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:22.920]   I just give you the code.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:23.680]   I don't need to be there.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.000]   Is that wild?
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   That's pretty wild.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.840]   And of course, it's a dumb game, but that's not the point.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:33.160]   The point is the technology involved.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.200]   And I think that's kind of cool.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:38.160]   We used to have to go to Chuck E. Cheese for this, people.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.080]   Just think there's there's be
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.560]   Gina being nostalgic.
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:45.640]   Yeah, like back in my head, we had to touch the gross balls
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.040]   that everybody else touched to play that game.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:50.720]   But I really do think that it underscores.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.760]   And you know, over and over again,
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.080]   you see that that there's stuff that you can do on an Android
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:55.280]   phone.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:58.320]   You will never be able to do on an iPhone because only Apple
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.440]   has the keys to the kingdom.
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:02.920]   Only Apple can look at the, you know, the hardware only
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:04.000]   Apple can do a lot of things.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.160]   And I understand Apple's made that choice,
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.120]   but they've made their bed.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:08.120]   And now they got a lie in it.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.520]   They made the choice for security
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.880]   that we control this very, very tightly.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.640]   And I think it's smart for Google to say, OK,
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.520]   but you can develop for the Android phone.
[00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.280]   Wait a minute, it works on an iPhone?
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.400]   OK, I take it all back.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.160]   Let's see, if these are standard, right?
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.760]   It works on an iPhone?
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.400]   I'm shocked.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:29.080]   Is this the browser?
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:29.680]   Is it a two-month-old phone?
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.360]   Well, yeah, you could say that.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:36.320]   But for Apple to give access to hardware level APIs
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.960]   is unusual.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:38.760]   I'm shocked.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.600]   OK, never mind.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:40.200]   I take it all back.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.120]   Everything I said was wrong.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.680]   Meanwhile, however, somebody from ad week still managed
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.240]   to write the negative story about this.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:47.000]   I don't know.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.560]   It's just-- yeah, can you believe this?
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.000]   The spoil sport?
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.360]   It was Big Bad Google.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:52.200]   I don't know.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.560]   It's big and bad about this.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.360]   It's scuba.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.360]   Nothing.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:00.120]   I'm so sick of media, techno panic at every possible turn.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:00.920]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:06.000]   So Apple gives HTML5's WebSuck its access to the gyroscope.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.440]   Well, an app developer gets access to it
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:10.320]   through making the game app or something, right?
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.160]   Yeah, but that's different because then you can vet the game app.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.880]   Oh, I see.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:21.080]   Yeah, so yeah, I mean the device is giving the gyro access
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:21.800]   to--
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:23.520]   It's an HTML5 API, right?
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.440]   So it's merely supporting HTML5 fully.
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.640]   But I'm just surprised.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:31.120]   Is it Chrome or Safari that's doing it?
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:34.000]   Is anybody playing on Safari on the iPhone?
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:34.640]   Because Chrome--
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.680]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.120]   The iOS folks are saying you have to use an app.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.480]   Oh.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:45.280]   Can you do it with your browser is the question on the iPhone?
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:47.760]   No, Safari, they're saying Safari works.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.240]   And then it asks you--
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.400]   HTML5 accelerant.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.240]   It asks you-- it asks for permission.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.080]   It says, can't maybe access the hardware?
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:55.480]   That would I would expect.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:58.080]   Chrome works on iOS and Safari works on iOS.
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:03.880]   OK, I take it all back.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:04.280]   That makes me happy.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.320]   Thank you, Apple.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.480]   That's the right way to be.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:14.200]   It's just that's the kind of thing Apple normally wouldn't do.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.920]   All right, and I have rebooted my Ubuntu desktop
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:18.320]   after installing Chrome.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:23.600]   Let's move on.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.920]   Something else.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.480]   What should we talk about, kids?
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.280]   Well, I'm trying to get this thing working.
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:28.920]   I apologize.
[00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:31.040]   I'm using a new computer for the first time.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:34.000]   It just came, and I wasn't really prepared to use it.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:34.840]   And I probably shouldn't have that.
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:36.320]   Any way for the new Gmail, the first story?
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.840]   Yes, the new Gmail.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:41.560]   iOS or Android or desktop?
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:42.440]   Both.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.960]   And in fact, that didn't include this in the change-all,
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.280]   because it's coming out in the next few weeks in the coming week.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:50.160]   So I actually haven't used it yet.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.000]   So I try to keep it down to stuff that's coming.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.080]   That's pretty available.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:58.120]   But it's basically-- there's that smart labels lab,
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.960]   which automatically sorted your mail into promotions,
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.440]   and social, and updates, and forums.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:06.440]   And it looks like they are graduating
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:12.000]   that to be native, and that those labels are going to show up
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.600]   in the native apps on Android and iOS that appears--
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.160]   Tabs at the top.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.080]   Uh-huh, yep.
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.480]   Oh.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:20.000]   Is that better?
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.520]   It looks like they're a bunch of ads.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.360]   That's what strikes me.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:24.880]   Oh, great.
[00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:26.200]   Things I'm never going to click on.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:27.280]   I can see more ads.
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:32.880]   One tab for promotions and offers.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.040]   Oh, boy.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:37.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.840]   Is that your Gmail making that sound?
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.760]   Yeah, that's the ad that's making that sound.
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.200]   Oh, Lord above.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:51.160]   Oh, Lordy, Lordy.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.560]   Do you think we're going to get pulled down by the Delphonics?
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:54.240]   I don't know.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:59.360]   This is part of this video.
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:02.160]   I'm so paranoid now.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.080]   Oh, it all makes sense.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.160]   You can see that in the--
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:08.440]   So the Tabs, really, the inbox has gone Google again.
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:10.760]   But the Tabs-- what are they?
[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.520]   It says social.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.320]   It's also promotions.
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.840]   All modes and updates.
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.840]   Updates.
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.560]   Too much.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.200]   Basically, I have things I want to read and the rest.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:20.720]   Right.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:23.680]   But maybe if it moves all the crap into promotions,
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.880]   I wouldn't be unhappy.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.560]   But then it's already in the rest.
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.200]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:35.720]   So is primary priority inbox, or is that just--
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.720]   Thanks for confusing the hell out of us, Google.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:39.240]   What the--
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:43.280]   Yeah, I'm actually worried because I use the Chrome offline
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:46.560]   Gmail app, and they've oversimplified it to the extent
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:49.200]   that it's hard to get to some simple functions.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.280]   And it's dumbed down too much.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:55.760]   Yeah, I mean, it looks like you can disable Tabs
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.200]   if you don't like them.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:57.700]   You can.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:58.680]   It says you can, yes.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:55:59.520]   Yeah, drag drop.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.680]   Maybe temporary.
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:03.120]   That's for now, you stick in the mud, you.
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:04.320]   Is it a form of filtering?
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.200]   No, I mean, what are they?
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.600]   Those are a plus over on the other side
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:08.360]   so you could create another--
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.480]   You can make more Tabs.
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:11.000]   So I can have a genotab.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.160]   Labels.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:14.480]   So that field trial, that's Mark Labels field trial,
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.800]   is basically just labels.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:18.400]   But that-- it's much like priority inbox,
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.960]   except divining.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:21.520]   Is this a mailing list message?
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.080]   Is this a promotional email?
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.480]   Is this an update, a social update,
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.320]   which is somebody circle do on Google+
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.720]   or followed you on Twitter?
[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.800]   So I've had that on for quite some time.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:34.880]   And it's actually pretty good at it.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:37.000]   Yeah, I know of key chimes for--
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.080]   Yeah, it's not so bad.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.720]   But this is a huge--
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:42.360]   I actually had only seen the mobile app screenshots.
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.840]   I hadn't seen the desktop screenshots.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.480]   I'm a little put off, honestly, by the giant tabs
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.480]   across the top.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.400]   I'm sort of--
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.080]   I am too.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:53.800]   I live in the web-based version of Gmail.
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.400]   So I'm a little bit like somebody came into my house
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:56.400]   and--
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.920]   They've rearranged the footage.
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:58.760]   That's a whole place.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:56:59.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.640]   I'm fine for you.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.400]   But you won't get this unless you're
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.840]   part of the field trial?
[00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:06.600]   Or who gets this?
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.960]   Because I don't have it yet.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:09.880]   This is rolling out gradually, they said,
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:11.840]   in the next few weeks.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.200]   Oh, if you'd like to try out the new inbox
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:16.520]   or on desktop sooner, keep an eye on the gear menu
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:18.880]   and select Configure Inbox when it appears in the settings
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:19.400]   option.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.560]   OK, let's see if I have that.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:23.040]   I'm in the settings.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.320]   Let's see.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.320]   I've got it.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.520]   Oh, you do?
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:27.120]   Ew.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:28.880]   So do you want to turn it on?
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:29.840]   Turn it on.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.600]   What do you look for, Gina?
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:36.120]   In the gear menu, there's a Configure Inbox button
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:37.120]   in the drop-down button.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.200]   So I don't have it yet.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.160]   Separate settings.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.000]   I don't have it yet.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   Do I have to go to settings first?
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.800]   No, just the gear menu and then configure in box.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:45.960]   OK, so yeah, I don't have that yet.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:49.880]   So it's display density and it's above settings in mine.
[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:51.400]   Oh, yeah, wow.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:52.840]   Hmm.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.320]   I did just get a notification.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:57.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:00.000]   Popped up triangulation because it's in my calendar.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.200]   So I got a popped up notification on Chrome.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.320]   Are you using your apps address or your Gmail address?
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.880]   Oh, I don't use apps.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:09.240]   I don't want to--
[00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.240]   This is my apps address.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.520]   Oh, Gina's using her apps address.
[00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.240]   Oh, yeah, this is my apps address, which is exciting.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.320]   Let me see if my other address has it.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.760]   Just one minute ago, Gina was saying, I don't like this.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:20.000]   That's-- well, something new.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:20.760]   It doesn't matter.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.280]   She's in before the rest of us.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:23.280]   I'm thinking about it.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:24.600]   Oh, god.
[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.080]   But if you could make tabs of your own,
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:30.760]   get rid of their stupid tabs and use filtering into tabs.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.240]   Now, how is it different from folders?
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:34.920]   It's just a different presentation.
[00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:35.600]   It's just a list.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:37.640]   It's like looking at a label.
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.160]   It's like looking at all the messages in a label.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:44.480]   So-- but Google makes these labels.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.160]   So Google figures out.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:50.800]   So my social tab is packed with Twitter, Facebook, Flickr,
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:56.640]   all these notifications from social apps with promotions
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.560]   is empty for me.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:59.040]   That's interesting.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:01.480]   Well, nothing news come in since you turned it on, probably.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:01.980]   Right?
[00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:03.480]   So it's not backwards.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.480]   Yeah, it did.
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.600]   It auto-sorted my mail.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.800]   So like my forums tab, I'm on a bunch of mailing list
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:10.520]   because I'm an open source.
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:13.960]   So that's all-- those are all listed there.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.120]   Yeah, I'll leave this on and try it out.
[00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:17.800]   I'm a little dubious.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.520]   Too bad they don't have a buzz tab.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.400]   Move all my Google Buzz messages.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.080]   It would be no.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:29.120]   Did you notice that the Buzz email went out like at midnight
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:31.000]   on Friday night before Memorial Day?
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:31.520]   And so--
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:33.720]   I happened to be up online and working
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.000]   because I'm a night owl.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.440]   And I was like, wow, this is very well timed.
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.600]   They're moving it to-- they're moving all your buzzing
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:41.600]   to your Google Drive.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.600]   Drive, yeah.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:43.600]   They're burying it.
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:44.100]   Just nice.
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:45.520]   Yeah, at least they didn't throw it out.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:50.200]   Yeah, it was nicer than the way Yahoo shuts down sites, right?
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:51.200]   That's one thing I'd get Google.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.400]   They always do the takeout and the export takeout option.
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:57.920]   But it'd be a massive XML file that's completely useless, right?
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.480]   I mean, what are we going to get?
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.480]   Pretty much.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:00.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.720]   That won't happen until July 17th.
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:05.040]   I loved Buzz.
[01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.120]   I was an early Buzz adopter, as usual.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:11.840]   What is this Google code download option deprecated?
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.880]   What happened there?
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.480]   Sounds like they had-- so you don't get up to the same thing.
[01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.200]   So this actually isn't a huge news update.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.760]   But Google code, much like GitHub, it would give you the option
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.040]   to upload files that people could download.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:28.080]   So you would do that, say, if you had a compiled version
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.560]   of your code or a zip package, for example.
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.200]   And I think it was just getting abused.
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.040]   I think people were using it to host, I don't know,
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.120]   pirated material, pornography.
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.120]   Oh, of course.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:41.120]   That makes sense.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.240]   It was a drop box kind of thing.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:42.960]   So they disabled it.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.040]   Good to get that download similarly a few months ago as well
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.120]   and saying, hey, there are better solutions out there
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.320]   for hosting downloads.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:50.920]   And they're right.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.120]   It is.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.480]   So yeah, no big deal.
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.600]   When a bridge goes out and you're using old GPS maps,
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.000]   that could actually be very dangerous if the GPS steers
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.840]   you onto the bridge.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.640]   If you're using Google Maps, nothing to worry about.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.680]   When the Washington state I-5 bridge collapse happened
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:14.360]   on Thursday evening by Friday morning, Google Maps was fixed.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.240]   As soon as the local news picked up on the bridge collapse,
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.840]   somebody used the map maker tool to go into Google Maps
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.200]   to edit it and reflect the bridge collapse.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:23.120]   Volunteer is, man.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.640]   That's where crowdsourcing is so great.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.680]   Doesn't Google still pop up a disclaimer, though,
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.480]   with navigation?
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:31.000]   Well, they should.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.080]   I mean, navigation is the first time.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.800]   It says, hey, you should actually pay attention to signs
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.360]   and maybe not check other maps, right?
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.200]   They always kind of have to say that, right?
[01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:43.480]   Well, and part of the reason is that the turn-by-turn
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:45.520]   has to be updated by engineers.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.440]   So the turn-by-turn could still have sent you
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.520]   to that collapsed bridge.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:52.840]   I mean, of course you wouldn't go out to get onto the bridge.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.920]   You would see the signs.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:54.680]   I mean, you know.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.160]   Well, that's why you should pay attention.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:58.160]   I literally wrote.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.400]   It probably is true.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.440]   It is the case.
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.640]   Did you get your new Google Maps?
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:03.600]   When the turn-by-turn, though, Leo,
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:07.000]   I mean, whether it's Google or whether it's Waze,
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.600]   they're rooting you around traffic instantly.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.280]   Waze is great that way.
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.360]   Waze is wonderful.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:13.800]   Waze is wonderful.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.360]   And I think if a bridge goes down on Waze,
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.360]   they will root you around.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.560]   And they do it silently, by the way.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.560]   No, Leo, Leo knows a hazard.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.160]   The old market is a hazard, but way.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.840]   Last night I was going out somewhere,
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.000]   and it was having me go off on a service road,
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   and I thought this is really close to why,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.160]   but I can write back on.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.520]   But it had me miss a half mile of traffic, which is smart.
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.360]   I do love Waze.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:35.520]   Now, Facebook was rumored to be looking at it or talking.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:35.760]   That's--
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.640]   No, Google as well.
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.560]   Well, the Facebook fell through or has been--
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.200]   I don't know what.
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.840]   The latest is, no, they're not going to buy it.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.520]   I don't know if Google needs Waze.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.120]   I think Google--
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.600]   I don't think they really need it.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:50.080]   But I'd rather have had it in Google's hands than Facebook's
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.480]   hands, just because the community that adds up
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:54.600]   to a really useful map.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.400]   Right.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.840]   Right.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.000]   I agree with you on that.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.400]   I wrote a business plan for this 15 years ago,
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:06.000]   where our New York traffic report sucked so badly.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.280]   The rule is, an old colleague of mine
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:11.120]   said that if you hear that there's a crash on a bridge,
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.720]   go to where that-- they say don't go,
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.040]   because by the time they've learned about it,
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.640]   it's already cleared up, and nobody else is going there.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.520]   And you're going to have better traffic than you ever had.
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:20.240]   That's so sad.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:21.280]   It's true.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:23.760]   And so what I wanted to do was this crowdsource notion,
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.600]   but it probably wasn't back in the day, which--
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.880]   There was no way to do it.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.000]   But once everybody's carrying a cell phone--
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.920]   It's a-- you-- I wish-- that's--
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:33.080]   I mean, it's a brilliant idea.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.880]   And anybody who's tried to listen to radio traffic reports
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.640]   to save time realizes it's hopeless.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:39.800]   It's not going to help you at all.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.400]   I gave up on it myself.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.960]   But now with this, I mean, even now Google now will tell you.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.120]   In fact, Google-- that's what I'm saying,
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.120]   is Google may not need ways.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.040]   Google now will say, hey, there's bad traffic.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.040]   Don't-- you know.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.760]   Speaking of Facebook, they've decided not
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:56.080]   to bring the HTC first to the UK.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.360]   That was the phone that came out of the box featuring Facebook
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:00.640]   home.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:03.200]   I guess Facebook home is kind of flopped.
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.840]   I think it's safe to say that now.
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:06.680]   Yep.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.480]   That's what it sounds like.
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:09.640]   Is that a surprise?
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:12.040]   We thought that if you were a heavy Facebook user,
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.120]   it might be desirable.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:15.440]   Maybe not--
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.760]   Yeah, it surprised me.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.320]   It does surprise me.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:19.400]   I did assume that if you were a heavy Facebook user
[01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.120]   and the number of support that most people spend time
[01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:26.440]   on their phone on Facebook, that Facebook home would be--
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.960]   would be a good solution.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.640]   But it sounds like Facebook is kind of pulling back
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:34.840]   and retooling based on customer feedback.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:37.880]   They've decided to add-- to focus on adding new customization
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:38.640]   features.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.680]   So I wonder what that means.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.680]   I wonder if that means-- what I hope that that means is,
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.920]   we're going to open up Facebook home
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:47.520]   so that it's not so entirely Facebook centric.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.200]   It felt like you had to dig deep to do anything but look
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:50.920]   at Facebook.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:51.960]   Other than Facebook.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.560]   I put it on and immediately 15 minutes later took it off.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.720]   And yet, and you were standing there--
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:02.160]   you remember when we ran into Bradley Hurwitz at Google I/O?
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:06.760]   I said, boy, I'd love to see a Google+ kind of a Facebook home.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.160]   And what was it he did?
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.480]   Jeff, he said you'd like to see much more than that,
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:11.040]   and you will.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:12.360]   He'd think something like that, right?
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.120]   He pretty much said, yeah, we're working on it.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.960]   And he probably already knew that Facebook home was not
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:19.960]   a success.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:20.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.120]   Presumably--
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:24.440]   I've heard zero discussion about it either way.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:27.320]   It was so limiting to have to get a limited number of phones
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.160]   to get this thing.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.720]   Yeah, I mean--
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:33.360]   I really like chat heads.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:33.880]   Well--
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.160]   I've used chat heads.
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:36.960]   There's a notification system, the chat head style
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.760]   notification system for Android.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:40.520]   It's I've been playing with.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:41.640]   It's kind of cool.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.840]   Yeah, which one?
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.280]   Which one was it?
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.200]   It's called Pop-Up Bubbles or something.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:47.960]   I can't remember what it is.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:50.080]   But your notifications come up with little chat heads,
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.200]   and you can do all the same things you do with chat heads.
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.840]   But it's all the notifications.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.720]   It was all notifications.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.000]   It's not like your friend's face.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.600]   It's yeah, it's whatever the app is.
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:58.760]   Very cool.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.320]   Very cool.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.880]   Yeah, I don't use Facebook heavily,
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.360]   but a friend of mine just-- I have a few friends who
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.320]   messaged me on Facebook.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.120]   And recently that happened this week.
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.720]   And it showed up on my phone or chat heads.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.720]   And I was like, oh, that's nice.
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.560]   And I'm just running Messenger updated to chat heads.
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.280]   And I actually-- I liked it.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:18.360]   Somebody in the chat room, web3778,
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:19.960]   says he loves the new Gmail inbox.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:23.000]   This new inbox is amazing, he says.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.440]   And another chatter, Jester, is saying,
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:29.800]   CNET is reporting that the HTC One vanilla Google experience
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.200]   phone is a go.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:35.280]   Confirmed and coming in the summer, according to CNET News.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.200]   Ooh.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:36.720]   Really?
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.560]   How much?
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.800]   Well, it's 650 bucks for the Galaxy S4.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.720]   And this is probably in that ballpark, I would guess, as well.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.360]   Staying.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.160]   Yeah, very interesting.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.240]   Yeah, so this inbox was interesting about these tabs
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.680]   and the cheat-- sorry to jump around.
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:56.000]   But if you get a new message under a certain tab,
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.920]   like you get a little notification on that tab,
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.640]   which is kind of cool, saying, oh, hey,
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:01.880]   there's new messages here.
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.800]   Yeah, this is nice.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:07.520]   Now I want it, even though I didn't before, you made me want it.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:08.040]   Aw.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:10.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:14.080]   Google gods, these bestow configure inbox
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.920]   option in the gear menu upon my co-hosts.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.440]   Thank you.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:17.720]   Thank you.
[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:18.640]   This week of June--
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.000]   I'll take a screening invitation to the internship.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   I've been trying to get a screening
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.560]   so I can go see it and talk about it on the show
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.360]   when they can't get one.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.200]   Boy was I wrong.
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.560]   Apparently, all the reviews are positive on this new all-in-will
[01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.560]   soon.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:31.960]   Any film of it yet?
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.840]   Yeah, Vince Vaughn movie, where they play interns,
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.360]   superannuated interns at Google.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.520]   And we saw the trailer, and at least I thought, oh,
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.160]   this looks really bad.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.240]   Yeah, it does look really bad.
[01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.000]   Apparently, it's not.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.880]   The great Eric Schmidt had a cameo that was not
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.240]   for the cutting room floor.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.760]   Aw, that's too bad.
[01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.000]   Serega is in it twice.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   Really?
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   Oh.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.560]   So when is this--
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.400]   June 7.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.800]   All right, everybody.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.000]   Well, who is it does this?
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.280]   Jeff, you are Katie Cork knows who I am.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:10.360]   You-- a friend of Katie's, you're a reviewer from years
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:10.920]   gone by.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:11.680]   I mean, are you--
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:12.600]   Are you a twig?
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.800]   I said this twig has an audience of $6 million.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.160]   You'd bring in your-- that's a lie.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.360]   But OK, you'd bring in your pixel Chrome.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:20.720]   Yeah, a Chromebook.
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.640]   Yeah.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:25.520]   I'll wear a Chrome sticker on my forehead.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.120]   How do I get Jeff into a screening in New York City
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.120]   of the internship?
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.120]   I used to be cool.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.440]   I used to be-- I was on all the lists.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.720]   Now I'm-- nobody.
[01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:37.120]   When I was in San Francisco radio, I was on that list.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.520]   And there's this beautiful screening room
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.720]   down on Market Street.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:40.360]   And it's small.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.760]   It's maybe 20 people.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:44.120]   Each-- everybody gets like a beautiful reclining sheet.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.120]   It's cushy.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.000]   It's cushy.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.360]   And you know you're special because you're
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:49.360]   seeing the movie when work comes out.
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:50.880]   It's going through the days, weren't they?
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.040]   Yeah, Mick LaSalle sitting there in the front row going,
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:53.640]   I hate this.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.200]   I hate this.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:54.800]   I hate this.
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:55.160]   It's great.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.520]   It's so much fun.
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.800]   We needed to do it with glass so you can live stream it.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.040]   So the rest of us didn't watch it.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:02.360]   Yeah, how long before movie theaters being glass?
[01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:03.400]   That's next.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:05.320]   Oh, that'll be such a great way to watch a movie.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:10.960]   Well, when you go to the bathroom,
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:13.200]   you can just leave the glass on the seat.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:14.360]   Won't miss a thing.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.680]   No, you need two glasses for that.
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:18.680]   You could have a hangout.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.000]   Yeah, live hangout, live streaming hangout.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   The internship.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.600]   Speaking of Nexus-style phones, apparently there's
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.360]   a leak that says the Nexus 4 will come out in white.
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:32.520]   Is that excite you?
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.640]   No, no.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.920]   We want the Nexus 5.
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:39.760]   Will we see a Nexus X?
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:42.280]   Remember, we were all excited about that for the long--
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:43.280]   Yeah, but all the--
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:46.440]   I'm still having a hardware loss, man.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.480]   What's it going to do?
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.320]   Derek Pixel didn't quite do it for you
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.040]   because he had it already.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.120]   Oh, no, it does.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:52.640]   It does.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.600]   It most certainly does.
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.120]   Oh, it does.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:54.920]   I'm unsated.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:55.720]   I'm satisfied.
[01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:56.960]   I'm happy.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.040]   I have to say, having played with this just for the last hour,
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:05.400]   this new Linux laptop, because you're using a browser so much,
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:06.320]   it's pretty-- it's fine.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:09.200]   You don't feel like you're using some odd ball operating
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:09.840]   system.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.360]   I'm sitting here in Chrome doing all that same stuff.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:15.640]   What does it take to update Ubuntu?
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.600]   It's just a little update program you run.
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.440]   I already did it while we were talking.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.240]   Let's bring him around again.
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.240]   Right.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.160]   [HONKING]
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.000]   Let's see.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.600]   I'm not going to take Linux lessons.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:32.480]   I feel really bad for these guys who basically
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:40.520]   used a Google search to find a security flaw at Scripts News.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.880]   They discovered personal data for 170,000--
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.160]   no, they were reporters for Scripts News.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.280]   They found a security flaw--
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.160]   Of orders, yes.
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:48.760]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.400]   It didn't mean to imply that Scripts had the problem.
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.280]   TerraCom-- actually, it's kind of relevant,
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.760]   because this is not only a cell phone company,
[01:10:56.760 --> 01:11:00.440]   but it's one that does the free phones.
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:03.280]   Your talent, TerraCom, are owned by VCare,
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.280]   which is an Indian-based service,
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.000]   that verify applicants for the free cell phones,
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.480]   the low-income free cell phone program.
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.200]   And apparently, 170,000 customers, personal information,
[01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:15.800]   including Social Security numbers,
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.920]   was sitting on a publicly accessible server,
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:21.040]   which the reporter has found with a Google search
[01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.880]   and have now been branded hackers.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.440]   They used the hacker program, WGet.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:27.840]   Yeah, they used WGet.
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.560]   That was what got them in real trouble.
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:33.520]   Wow.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.240]   Wait, they literally used WGet?
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.360]   Or they did the search in the browser.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:42.040]   They used WGet to search for and download data
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:46.880]   from this open FTP server, or whatever.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.320]   Yeah, they used HTTP and FTP.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.360]   Bulk downloaded.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.120]   And of course, they didn't hide their access to it,
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.720]   so TerraCom said this came from a scripts IP address.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:01.800]   They identify them as the scripts hackers.
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:06.440]   These hackers.
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:07.640]   That's a moral panic.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:08.280]   They used HTTP requests.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.520]   Yep, moral panic.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:14.000]   Rit large.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   Amazon's launched a login service.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.120]   Allah, Google, and Facebook log in with Amazon.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.280]   Single sign in.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.480]   Works on Android, as well as iOS and through the web.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:27.400]   So sites can then use this.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.000]   When you go to our site, you says login via Google,
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.480]   login via Facebook, login via camera.
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:33.880]   What else?
[01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:37.080]   Is there any AWS advantage that comes with this?
[01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:37.960]   No.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:41.320]   It's just Amazon's another player in the single sign on--
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.560]   Not yet or not one.
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.560]   Yep.
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.920]   Well, Amazon's got the advantage of--
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.480]   you go to Amazon and buy stuff, right?
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.640]   They've got your credit card.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.880]   Makes you use your buy stuff.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:51.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:55.600]   Well, it's kind of like what Google does with Wallet, right?
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:56.600]   Yeah.
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.600]   But I think the user of mine says--
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.120]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.440]   With Amazon is a little bit--
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.760]   when I think Amazon, I'm going to purchase something.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.040]   Like, you know what I mean?
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.680]   I feel like I'm more on that mindset.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.440]   All right, I'll tell you what.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:14.440]   I think-- unless you guys have something else,
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.440]   I'm looking through here that you want to talk about.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.840]   Did you see the Hitler teapot?
[01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:20.400]   Did you see the Hitler teapot?
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:21.040]   Oh my god.
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.920]   Godwin's law, in effect already.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:24.760]   Let me see.
[01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:28.640]   It's a viral sensation for J.C. Penny.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.280]   Is it an actual Hitler teapot?
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.240]   Go open it up and you'll see the picture.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:33.640]   All right.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.240]   It's a social media uproar.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.160]   It's a sensation.
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.640]   It is a teapot that looks a little bit like Hitler.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.240]   Like, Miller.
[01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:41.880]   But only-- you've got to really--
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.600]   you've got to have a good imagination.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.240]   You do.
[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:47.280]   But once you see it, you can't get it--
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:47.840]   Did you see it?
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.080]   You can't stop.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:52.880]   So on the right, the billboard for J.C. Penny,
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.800]   it's just a normal teapot.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:57.480]   Little handle, little knob for the lid.
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.800]   It's got-- you know, I'm a little teapot short and stout.
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:02.360]   I got my arm to pour it out.
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:07.280]   But then if you juxtapose it with a picture of the fur--
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.000]   it does kind of--
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:09.960]   looking-- it does.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.960]   It does.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.280]   That was fantastic.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:15.000]   I mean, the swipe-- the sweep of the hair and the nose.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:15.600]   Exactly.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.680]   It became a huge sensation.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.200]   I don't know if it was sold out or if it was pulled down.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.680]   The teapots are now already selling for higher prices
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.960]   on eBay.
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.640]   On eBay?
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:30.000]   Or J.C. Penny can't catch a break in the name of this.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.600]   So J.C. Penny put out all kinds of treats, trying to say,
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.920]   we were going to design a teapot to look like something.
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.720]   We designed it to look like a snowman.
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.800]   They put up a picture of a snowman teapot.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.680]   This was not designed to look like anything.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.480]   It's kind of-- you can't imagine that they did that on purpose.
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.120]   Of course not.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:45.720]   Of course not.
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:47.560]   However, having seen it--
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.120]   it's hard to see it.
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:50.720]   Hard to unsee it.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:53.600]   I don't know who saw it first, though.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.760]   I don't know either, but it's because I think it's Reddit.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.760]   Yeah, it's probably Reddit.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.320]   Wow.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.320]   And J.C. Penny, of course, trying to--
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.280]   do is damage control.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:02.720]   That's tough.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.600]   People-- because people probably assume, oh, they
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.800]   do it on purpose.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:06.360]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.560]   That's much better.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.240]   That's what J.C. Penny says that they were designed.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.440]   They designed a teapot to look like something.
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:12.720]   Good.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:15.520]   They responded with a little sense of humor anyway.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:16.040]   Yes, they did.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:17.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:17.840]   Oh, that was good.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.840]   I guess it's hard to have a sense of humor, but we--
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.720]   it's pretty-- that's amazing.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.360]   I got to say, I do like that this one
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.800]   got 300 retweets and 57 favorites.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.760]   But J.C. Penny's got five retweets and three--
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:33.760]   Oh.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.280]   Oh.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.240]   Oh, all favorite you, J.C. Penny.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:38.740]   Oh.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:40.920]   Oh.
[01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:41.960]   J.C.P.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:45.160]   Oh, FTC beginning a new inquiry on Google.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:47.000]   We should probably mention that.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.440]   Although these things go on and on.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:50.440]   What is the FTC now that's business practices?
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.400]   It's now display ads.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.120]   Display ads.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.880]   They're specifically wondering whether the company is
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.080]   bundling advertising services in such a way
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:01.880]   that it prohibits rivals from competing for the business
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:02.880]   of advertising.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:07.880]   An investigation doesn't mean anything necessarily.
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.320]   They're just looking into it.
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:13.440]   Did you guys get to talk to Matt about XMPP and Hangouts
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.760]   last week, by any chance?
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.800]   No, we didn't really.
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.120]   Should I ask you about that?
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.360]   At the time, it wasn't clear that they were abandoning it.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.920]   I think he mentioned it a little bit.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.720]   It wasn't clear that they were abandoning it completely.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.680]   But now it feels like they may be they are.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:27.600]   Yeah.
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.680]   It was a weird-- it was a weird, undersun kind of thing.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.000]   Like there was that Verge story that had that one line
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.760]   about how it was a difficult decision,
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:36.960]   but not a whole lot of coverage.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:41.440]   But the EFF posted Google Bandits Open Standards
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:42.360]   for instant messaging.
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:46.440]   I mean, there's-- I have to say that this put me off
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:47.440]   a little bit.
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:47.920]   This is--
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:51.360]   XMPP, extensible messaging and presence protocol,
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.600]   is a really great standard.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.360]   For a long time, ran an XMPP server.
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.600]   It's very flexible.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.000]   It's very interesting.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.800]   And Google did use it because originally,
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.280]   Google talk was Jabber compatible,
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.120]   and Jabber's an XMPP.
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.440]   Jabber is an XMPP, right?
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.720]   So now that Hangouts is taking over Google Talk,
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.600]   so it's possible for--
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:15.720]   so if someone is a Jabber user, an XMPP user,
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:18.200]   and is connected to Google servers, that's fine.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.360]   They can use Hangouts, albeit, I think, in a limited fashion.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:23.520]   Just text IMs come through.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.120]   Chad, we talked about this.
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:26.840]   I forget if it was AA or Twig.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:32.400]   But if you're connected to another XMPP server,
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.920]   that server can't communicate with folks using Hangouts.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:38.640]   And it's not obvious.
[01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.880]   It just looks as if they're not there.
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.120]   So they just decided that XMPP didn't do what they needed for it
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:51.240]   to do, and so it's no longer interoperable with Hangouts.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.880]   It kind of sucks.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.160]   I mean, let's be-- for a company that--
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.600]   for a company who CEO got on stage and talked about how he
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.400]   so disappointed that other companies would support interoperability
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.360]   with them, which is what Larry Page is saying at Google I/O.
[01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.040]   I mean, this feels--
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.000]   I think this is a legitimate hypocrite.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.600]   Well, I want to hear them talk about why they did it.
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.560]   Maybe there's a good reason.
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.040]   Maybe security or something.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.240]   They need to respond to it.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:16.960]   The problem is it's such an obscure thing
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.240]   that there's not a big drumbeat about it
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.320]   that they haven't responded to it.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:24.400]   Somebody needs to step forward and say, look, this is why.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.880]   This is what it is.
[01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:29.440]   We needed to do this because in the absence of that,
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.560]   you're going to assume it's something anti-competitive.
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.880]   Right.
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:34.400]   Right.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.640]   But they don't want interoperability between chat clients.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:40.680]   In fact, that's what Larry was specifically complaining about,
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:42.120]   wasn't he?
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.160]   That who was it?
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.320]   Was it Microsoft didn't allow Google to interoperate?
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.240]   It was-- he was talking about Exchange and Gmail.
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.840]   By ActiveSync, right, with Gmail.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:53.320]   But I thought they were talking a little bit about I/O as well.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.280]   He mentioned I/O as well.
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.920]   He mentioned I/O as well as I/O as well as I/O as well.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:57.960]   Yeah, he brought up the job as a suite with Oracle, right?
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:01.440]   He mentioned Microsoft, although Google had just
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.640]   C&D Microsoft for their YouTube app on Windows.
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:04.640]   Right.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:05.720]   They've worked that out.
[01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:06.720]   They've worked that out, right?
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:10.200]   They're working together on an app for your Windows phone.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:13.360]   All is well, kissing made up.
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.120]   It's a big deal.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.600]   No.
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:20.360]   I would like to hear more about why they dumped XMPP.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.520]   And I'm willing to have an open mind that maybe there's
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.680]   a technical reason why it was something they needed to do.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.760]   Well, I mean, what if the answer is we just needed to move
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:29.400]   forward and XMPP just didn't do what we needed it to do in
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.800]   order to work with Hangouts?
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.880]   I mean, this is kind of the same thing with Blink, right?
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.320]   Well, we've forked WebKit because we have a different vision
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.520]   for what it should be.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:43.760]   And we need to move it forward on our roadmap.
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:46.280]   It feels a little-- with Blink, I'm kind of like, well, OK,
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:49.000]   I guess I can see that with XMPP, that feels a little flimsy.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:49.400]   But you're right.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.760]   I would love to get somebody onto actually to discuss it.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.080]   It hasn't been a really big issue.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.920]   So, I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more coverage.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:00.840]   But the critics have definitely picked it up as a clear evidence
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:03.400]   that Google really isn't about openness.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:06.120]   The implication is that is there an API for Hangouts?
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:09.520]   I mean, is Hangout so open?
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:12.160]   The implication is that only Google could make a Hangout client
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:15.440]   if we're XMPP anybody could make Hangouts in a right way.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.440]   Right.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:17.400]   I don't know.
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:18.560]   I don't think so.
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:19.920]   I don't think so right now.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.920]   I think Google would say that it's early in there,
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.520]   that there will be an API eventually.
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:28.000]   But this is what XMPP is for, right?
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.600]   This is what you would do to chat with someone on another network.
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.240]   You would use XMPP and you'd be able to do that before Google
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.080]   talk.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:37.720]   It's the back slide that's troubling.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.560]   Yeah, it's used to work and now it doesn't.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:41.520]   Google, there actually may be a response.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:42.520]   Here's from Computer World.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:46.280]   Thank you to F. Alex in our chat room.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:50.120]   Google argues it had to use proprietary tech in Hangouts.
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:53.840]   The company's catching flack.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.320]   Let's see if there's a quote.
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:21:01.520]   Google Spokeswoman said via email,
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:03.720]   Google had good reasons to go down the path it
[01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:05.480]   chose for Hangouts.
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:07.520]   Quote, "Over the past several years,
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:09.680]   we've worked to bring the world an open messaging system,
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:14.720]   but no company has been willing to join our efforts."
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:17.040]   After seven years, it's evident that the rest of the industry
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:18.960]   is not moving to embrace this open system.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.600]   If at some point in the future the industry shows interest,
[01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.200]   well, what about open source programmers?
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.280]   What about open source code?
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.760]   What about Pigeon and Trillian and all the other clients
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.040]   that support XMPP?
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:29.720]   What industry?
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.440]   You're talking about Facebook and Apple?
[01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.640]   We would be open to discussions about developing an interface
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.560]   that's designed for modern needs.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:37.080]   You're right.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:38.440]   That's exactly the wrong answer.
[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:42.080]   That's exactly the wrong answer.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:45.320]   They said the openness of Google talk yielded bad user
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:48.160]   experiences, making it vulnerable to spam attacks.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:49.160]   That's true.
[01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.760]   And if using XMPP, you could write a bot that we could use it.
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.920]   It sounded a lot like Apple.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.600]   When XMPP was designed, said the spokeswoman,
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:59.360]   smartphones and social networks didn't exist.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.440]   You both essentially transformed communication,
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.040]   but the standard remains unchanged.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.800]   I think my experience with XMPP is a very flexible standard
[01:22:05.800 --> 01:22:08.760]   that it could be adapted.
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:10.520]   For example, mobile has several requirements
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.560]   around bandwidth and battery that are simply not part
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.400]   of the standard and audio and video integration
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.800]   are not well defined.
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:16.560]   It's XML.
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.320]   It's extensible.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.920]   I don't know if I buy that.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:18.920]   Yeah.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:25.000]   Yeah, I am disappointed.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.480]   No response immediately from Peter St. Andre.
[01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:33.560]   We've interviewed him, by the way, on our Floss Weekly podcast.
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:39.120]   He's the executive director of the XMPP Standards Foundation.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.960]   In Twitter, he said, Google can stop supporting XMPP,
[01:22:41.960 --> 01:22:43.320]   but it's impossible for them to kill it.
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.800]   That's the beauty of distributed technologies.
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:48.600]   And as you said, the EFF is saying, make it public,
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.120]   make it interoperable.
[01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:54.120]   And releasing this says the EFF, releasing the specifications
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:55.960]   for Google Hangouts would be a good first step.
[01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.640]   I agree.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:23:01.120]   I mean, if you made it open and you said, look,
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:01.880]   we got a better way.
[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:03.120]   It's open.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.000]   That would be different.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.920]   If you don't make it open, then what you're really saying
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.720]   is we want to own this space and we don't want Microsoft
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.800]   and others to do it.
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:11.520]   Right.
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:11.880]   OK.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:12.680]   Well, we'll wait and see.
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:20.560]   Uh, Tolly says Facebook chat does support XMPP.
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:24.600]   I'm not aware of that, but that's interesting.
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:27.760]   FXMPP client to server will be supported by Hangouts
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:28.280]   as Winster.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:31.680]   It's about server to server federation, which
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:34.240]   means anyone could link to a Google servers with their users.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.480]   That-- that-- you know, maybe that's-- if that's all it is,
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.520]   then that's maybe not so bad.
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:41.360]   More to read about on that.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:44.840]   Android 4.3, according to ours, Technica slated for June 10.
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:46.680]   Just came out.
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:47.640]   That would be interesting.
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:48.680]   We're waiting.
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.880]   We don't really know what's in it except the new camera UI.
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:54.800]   We just know we won't get it unless we're running in Nexus 4.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:55.960]   Right.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:56.880]   That's all we know.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.160]   Well, I don't know if the Galaxy Nexus gets it.
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:02.680]   Well, the new Galaxy S4 will play vanilla.
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:03.800]   We'll get it.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:04.960]   Bear is in the chat room.
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:07.560]   He's our sysadmin and is actually an expert on XMPP.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.320]   I don't know if we can get him on.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.800]   I don't think we have time, Bear.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.760]   Can you give us a one liner in the chat room
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:21.480]   as to your position on Google talk?
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:25.160]   Or Hangouts abandoning XMPP?
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:25.760]   We'll wait and see.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:31.600]   You say that computer world article is very controversial.
[01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:32.720]   Oh.
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:35.040]   OK.
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:35.840]   All right.
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:36.960]   Let him speak.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:37.160]   Sorry.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:40.640]   That was a little bit of a Hitler teapot buzzkill.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.280]   We were all high from the Hitler teapot.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:44.000]   And then you brought that up.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.520]   And then the chat room said, the chat room said, by the way,
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:50.920]   Google Google Hitler House.
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.480]   Oh, there's a Hitler House?
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:53.480]   A house that looks like Hitler?
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.440]   It's like Hitler House.
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:25:01.640]   You know, Hitler kind of was a graphic meme.
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:03.680]   All right, let me try it.
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:04.680]   Anyway--
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:05.680]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:06.680]   Bear, I figure it out.
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.520]   This is great.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.040]   OK, the house looks a little bit like him,
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:10.680]   but not--
[01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:11.680]   Yeah, it does.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:13.800]   Not exactly like him.
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.160]   Looks like the teapot, actually.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:19.520]   That's really silly.
[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:22.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.160]   You'd really have to have a very good imagination.
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.600]   It's from-- the house is in Wales.
[01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.320]   All right.
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:31.840]   Could you imagine all the geeks who
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:35.360]   go on pilgrimages of that house, the poor people who are in it?
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.200]   Take pictures.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.320]   Look.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.560]   OK.
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:42.600]   Let us get our tip and number and tool of the week starting
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:45.680]   with Gina Trappani, your tip, my dear.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.280]   Oh, tip of the week is that Google
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:51.600]   has incorporated your photos into the regular search box.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:54.480]   So we talked about before how you can search for my flights
[01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.760]   and get your flight information from Gmail.
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:58.040]   You can do this for your photos now.
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.000]   Wow, that's wild.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.120]   And which is cool.
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:03.280]   And Google is-- these are Google+ photos.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.640]   And Google is using computer vision
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.360]   to figure out what is in your photos.
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:09.440]   So for example, if you search for--
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:10.840]   this is the exact search term--
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:10.880]   Look at this.
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:13.240]   My photos of flowers.
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.960]   You will see photos of flowers you take with your phone
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:16.840]   and upload it to Google+.
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:19.800]   If you have instant upload on, you've got lots of them.
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.680]   And you can see all your photos of flowers.
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:22.840]   I didn't have a lot of photos of flowers.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.320]   It's not perfect.
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:27.040]   Well, I had tons of pictures of trees
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:28.840]   because they all fell down around me.
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.960]   They caught like two of 30.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.920]   Well, look at my thick pictures of flowers, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.760]   That's all flowers all the time.
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:36.800]   That is all flowers.
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.640]   I did my photos of food.
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:41.760]   And it did a really good job of figuring out
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.760]   like plates of meals.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.720]   Look at-- I got bacon.
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:50.000]   Yeah, I think about how difficult it is
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:51.240]   to figure out what's food on my tongue.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:53.080]   This is very impressive.
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.160]   It's got people eating.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.800]   It's got my mom and my daughter cooking.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.040]   Wow.
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:01.080]   OK, I'm impressed.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:01.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.640]   I'm impressed.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:06.120]   Does this work with any arbitrary noun?
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:06.920]   I think so.
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.640]   Yeah, I tried baby and it didn't find eta.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:14.120]   So I don't know if I had the facial tag.
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.240]   My photos of animals.
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:17.120]   Yeah, nice.
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:19.080]   Wow.
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:19.880]   Yes.
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.960]   Damn, Google's smart.
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.720]   Yeah, well, if I am--
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:26.720]   Google's really doing object recognition in our photos.
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.600]   And you can get it right from the search box.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:29.120]   Pretty good.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.680]   I'm looking at my photos of cheese.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.840]   This is another case, though, where it's been a problem.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:34.600]   Look at that.
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.240]   You take way too many pictures of cats.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:36.920]   I do.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.400]   I do.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.520]   Yeah, I did flowers.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.600]   And it only got one tree that I apparently--
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:44.840]   Oh, this is interesting.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:50.000]   If I entered my photos of cats, I get a picture of cat Schwartz.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.960]   A woman I used to work with named Cat.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:57.680]   She does have a horse on her shirt.
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:58.400]   No cats.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:59.240]   That's interesting.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:02.200]   So you got to do animals' broad nouns.
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:03.960]   But this is a new game.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:04.640]   Yeah, it is.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:05.960]   Now I'm trying animals.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.280]   My picture of Genas.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.360]   Look.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:12.280]   Oh, wow.
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.040]   Oh, my god.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:14.880]   Wow.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.080]   Yeah, because I'm tagged in that photo.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:17.240]   I think we're on the Facebook--
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.800]   My search of furniture.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.760]   Wow.
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.080]   Yeah, this is ridiculous.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:22.760]   Wow.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.240]   I search for my photos of animals.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:25.720]   I went to this handy go zoo.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:27.280]   And it found--
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:28.280]   Wow.
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:30.600]   This is-- yeah.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:31.600]   So tip of the week.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:32.320]   I guess it was a winner.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.200]   This is pretty awesome.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.960]   Who needs a brain?
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:35.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:35.960]   Wow.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.160]   My photos of furniture.
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:38.360]   They think about that.
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.720]   How it's recognizing furniture.
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:41.600]   There you go.
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:43.920]   What that means, by the way, this has all been done already.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:45.000]   Whoa.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:45.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:46.000]   Uh-oh.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000]   What'd you search for?
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.480]   My photos of hair.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:52.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.280]   Whoa.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:57.120]   Well, only Chad-- that search only works for Chad.
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.560]   That is weird.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.400]   I didn't think it would work.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.240]   But how would it have done?
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.400]   But look, it got photos of people's hair.
[01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:04.360]   It is so funny.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:05.280]   I tried it.
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:06.600]   It's all pictures of--
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:07.440]   Mine too.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.440]   --the whole, long hair.
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:09.480]   Yeah.
[01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.640]   Look at that came up with that picture we were talking about
[01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:14.760]   of me when I was 14.
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:15.440]   Wow.
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.840]   My photos of cars.
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.080]   Oh, this is kind of--
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:19.680]   OK.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:20.200]   This is weird.
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:20.800]   This is weird.
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:21.280]   This is weird.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:23.440]   This is weird.
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.160]   So JBR in the chatroom asked, and this is a good question.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.840]   Do you think that this is less or more exciting
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:31.840]   than Graf's search on Facebook?
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.320]   Well, it's all of a parcel, right?
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:37.200]   I mean, what it means is they're categorizing everything.
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.200]   Now, everything.
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:39.200]   Yeah.
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:41.640]   Wow, that's wild.
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:42.880]   We could just do this all day.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.480]   My photos--
[01:29:44.480 --> 01:29:45.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.480]   You do this.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:46.480]   Hitler.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:49.320]   Google Plus, where do you do this?
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:51.440]   No, you do it in Google Search.
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.400]   Google Search, yeah.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.160]   So it's a photo--
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:54.560]   It's in your search results.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.560]   So I think you can do--
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:56.760]   Oh, this is a plug.
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:59.440]   My search-- my machine is signed in under my apps account.
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:00.440]   Right.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:02.040]   And my-- yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:03.560]   Google Fix it.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:04.240]   You're smart.
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:06.880]   If you can do this, if you can find furniture,
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.800]   you can fix this.
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:12.440]   Look at my photos of sunsets.
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.640]   Oh, nice one, Leo.
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:15.200]   Unbelievable.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.920]   I didn't know you were such a romantic Leo.
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.840]   Oh, look, Paris.
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.640]   It's Paris.
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:20.640]   The sunset.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:25.920]   It's a beautiful night in Paris.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:28.600]   So I don't know if this makes me want to upload more photos
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:29.560]   or fewer photos.
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:30.560]   Like, I'm kind of off.
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:31.560]   Oh, more.
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:32.320]   Oh, more.
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:34.720]   Because now it's going to find your best photos.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:35.960]   It's going to fix your photos.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:38.000]   It's going to understand what your photos are.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.880]   Now, when you start clicking all day long,
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:43.680]   you're going to have access to your photos.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.440]   It's going to have a window into my brain.
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:48.200]   It'll know exactly what I think is valuable enough.
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.200]   Already done.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:50.200]   This map that makes it.
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:51.200]   I should just give up.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.200]   It's got a window in my brain just based on my search.
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:56.200]   I, for one, welcome my new brain.
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:57.200]   I do.
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:00.960]   You know, when you get old, you welcome anything.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.200]   It can help you remember stuff.
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.200]   Geez.
[01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:06.200]   Like, yeah.
[01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:09.200]   That is-- who found the Google announce that?
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.200]   Or did somebody just find it?
[01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.200]   Yeah, this was an announcement I actually-- I cheated,
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:14.600]   and I left this out of the changelog,
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:16.200]   because I wanted to use it as my tip.
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:18.200]   They announced it this week.
[01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:19.200]   That is so neat.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.200]   All right.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.200]   Number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:26.200]   I'm going to skip the Mary Meeker has her annual PowerPoint porn,
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:28.200]   but I'll skip that because it's full numbers.
[01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:30.200]   I'm going to an event tonight, Amazon is holding.
[01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:33.200]   They have sold 5 million Kindle singles.
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.200]   I find that vaguely in a few of them.
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:37.200]   A few of them are yours.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.200]   A few of them are mine.
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:43.200]   And then also Kickstarter just has a new project up called the--
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:49.200]   kid.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:55.200]   One million dollar goal to put up a space telescope with $164,000
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:56.200]   raised already.
[01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:58.200]   Oh, let the government do it.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.200]   What do we need to do that for?
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.200]   I know.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:02.200]   I know.
[01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:04.200]   There's a million enough, really.
[01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:05.200]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:06.200]   There's a scientist.
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:08.200]   He's wearing a lab coat, so it must be true.
[01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:09.200]   He can't hear you.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:11.200]   And apparently protective goggles.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:13.200]   Now a physician.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.200]   That's something they've started with.
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.200]   Same guy.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:19.200]   It's some guy.
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:24.200]   I wish to build a space that-- oh, it's got a Nexus 7.
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:26.200]   Yeah, you get your picture.
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.200]   You can send your picture to it and get a picture back of you
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:30.200]   with your picture in space.
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:31.200]   That's the game.
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.200]   I don't know if this is a good idea.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:36.200]   The idea they're saying is for students.
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:40.200]   This opens this up and opens up the satellite and opens source for students.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:41.200]   Hmm.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.200]   OK.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:50.200]   What's a resolution?
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:51.200]   Do we know?
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:52.200]   Yeah, I'm going to--
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:55.200]   Listen, I thought about backing this than Zach Braff's new movie.
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.200]   Well, that's true.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:59.200]   That's true.
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.200]   I'll go for you in that.
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:03.200]   That's actually the amount pledged actually updates live on Kickstarter.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.200]   I didn't know that.
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:05.200]   Cool.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:07.200]   Oh, yeah, it does.
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:08.200]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.200]   That's new.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.200]   That didn't used to do that.
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:15.200]   So it's going-- it's clicking over like-- here's the staff that will be running the telescope.
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:16.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:17.200]   It looked very infin--
[01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.200]   And she's like eight.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.200]   That's good.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:24.200]   And apparently they couldn't afford monitors on those desks, so they've got a printer strapped to it.
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:26.200]   And nothing at all on Com.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.200]   She's reading a notebook.
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:32.200]   OK.
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:34.200]   This is all little bare bones.
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.200]   I'm just saying.
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:37.200]   A million does seem low.
[01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.200]   I don't know how you can do that for a million.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:43.200]   The gas alone.
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:46.200]   Well, you're probably putting it up on something else.
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:55.200]   So my tip is-- remember, I really want to use this HTC One, but the no replaceable battery means I got to get it through the day.
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:59.200]   Hard to do, especially when something's got a great screen and you want to use it and take pictures all the time.
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:08.200]   XDA developers, a great resource for anybody who uses Android, has a battery savings tip page that actually I found useful for any Android device.
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:20.200]   Things like, for instance, turn off the auto sync on the Facebook apps, set the auto refresh interval to never for massive battery savings, because Facebook's always downloading crap.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:27.200]   A number of settings that you might want to do, disabling apps, a couple of really good apps.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:32.200]   One called Greenify, that lets you force apps to sleep.
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:35.200]   Apps would otherwise be running in the background, downing stuff all the time.
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:37.200]   Greenify is a very cool app.
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:46.200]   I already mentioned Lux, which is a much better than the normal auto brightness settings, really, that you control it in a granular way.
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:49.200]   And here's a really great app that I installed.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:56.200]   Now, my question always with these apps, and I should warn you, you know, if you don't get great results, maybe you should take this app off,
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:00.200]   you know, is that can you monitor battery life without killing battery life?
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:07.200]   Tasks, SwissDRs, for a long time were one of the biggest problems on Android phones, because they were eating all these CPU cycles,
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:10.200]   but this is really an interesting battery monitor.
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:12.200]   It used to be called Badass Battery Monitor.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:16.200]   They changed the name of G-Sam Battery Monitor, so we could say it on the show.
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:22.200]   And it's free, and it installs, there may be a pro version, yeah, there is a $1.99 for the pro version.
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:30.200]   But it really does a great job of monitoring more than the stuff that you get from what I used to think was awesome,
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:33.200]   the settings power information.
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:41.200]   Now I get a very accurate based on previous results, timer, 62% left, that means I'm going to get 13 hours and 45 minutes.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:46.200]   When I did these, by the way, all of these settings, I've now gotten 15 or 16 hours out of this phone.
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:49.200]   It more than doubled the battery life on the phone.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:53.200]   You can drill down, so I now know, because on the HTC One, this information is hidden.
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:36:00.200]   7.6% screen time, but I can even see which brightness levels used how much battery life.
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:08.200]   Screen was on 14 minutes, 18 seconds, and 91% of the brightness was used, of the power was used in light brightness.
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:16.200]   There's all these little granular details, Bluetooth, app usage, I can drill down to see which apps use how much battery life
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:18.200]   and further drill within it.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:23.200]   So you often get information about an app like Colonel.
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:25.200]   Colonel used 23%.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:28.200]   Well, here's the processes that we're running.
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:33.200]   If you're a geek, this is a great little app, G-Sam battery monitor.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.200]   There's a free version, I paid a buck 99 for the pro.
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:40.200]   It also lets you change the battery icon and things like that, but mostly I think the stats are useful,
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:43.200]   particularly if you're trying to optimize your phone for better battery life.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:49.200]   XDA developers had a very good article about the one, but I would imagine many phones with battery problems.
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:51.200]   They'll have similar articles on things you can do.
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.200]   If you're just using an Android phone in general, just read the one about the HTC One,
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:37:00.200]   because most of the tips apply to every kind of Android phone, and it did it more than doubled it, which is amazing.
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:05.200]   You basically take all the fun out of the phone and it works a long time.
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:09.200]   I had to give up a few things, but not a lot.
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:13.200]   So soon they'll make one that you can flip open, which would be really cool.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:18.200]   I want one with an extensible antenna, so they'll always have good reception.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:23.200]   Yeah, I'll carry the battery on my pocket, or maybe over my shoulder, on a strap.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:25.200]   Then we'll be good.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:27.200]   Then we'll be happy.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:32.200]   Alright, everybody, that's about it for this week's, this week in Google.
[01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:36.200]   Thank you, Gina Trapani. It's so nice to have you back. I'm glad you're feeling better.
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:38.200]   Thank you so much. Great to be back.
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:42.200]   And of course, Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com is his blog.
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:45.200]   You can read his book. It's right behind him. It's called Public Parts.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:47.200]   Oh, yeah, I actually spilled water on the desk.
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:48.200]   I'm just trying it out.
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:50.200]   Something's right out of there, yeah.
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:53.200]   Public Parts, it's a little moist right now.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:55.200]   I was like, that's such clevers promotion.
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:56.200]   Brilliant.
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:57.200]   Brilliant.
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:58.200]   Brilliant.
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:03.200]   I really could reach behind me as I spilled this water.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:10.600]   Gina's got two great apps, The ThinkUp app, which is a wonderful app for interpreting your
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:14.200]   Twitter tweets and information at ThinkUp.com.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:22.200]   And of course, Todootex, which is a really good Todoo monitor for iOS and Android and desktop.
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:25.200]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.200]   We appreciate it. Thank you for joining us.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:34.200]   We do this weekend at Google at 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time, 2100 UTC on Wednesdays.
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:39.200]   Please stop by and watch us live. We even had a nice live studio audience, which only one member is
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:42.200]   female after the other two left.
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:49.200]   We also encourage you to watch After the Fact on Demand Available at twits.tv/twig.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.200]   What, Gina?
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:51.200]   Is it my fault?
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:54.200]   No, no. You brought a point of view porn. It's okay.
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:57.200]   It's not your fault. It's not your fault.
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:01.200]   No, they left because they had other engagements.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:06.200]   And there's not many people that could sit here for two hours and listen to this crap.
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.200]   Only you.
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:11.200]   Oh, I feel the can.
[01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:16.200]   Thank you for joining us, and we'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:26.200]   [Music]
