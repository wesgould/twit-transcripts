[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.360]   I'm happy to do so I always enjoy coming on this week in Google and hanging out with my friends here of course first of all
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.280]   I've got Jeff Jarvis, you know Jeff buzz machine calm professor at the CUNY school of journalism. How's it going Jeff?
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.320]   Hey, glad to be here. I was off last week, but I'm delighted to be back. Excellent. You're back now
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.160]   And then I get the pleasure of podcasting with you next week at Google. I will talk all about that here
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.460]   Can't wait for that. I know I'm really looking forward to next week also
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.360]   Joining us here Stacy Higginbotham. How you doing Stacy? I'm doing well. It's great to see you again creator of the IOT podcast at IOT podcast
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.220]   com the Internet of Things newsletter at Stacy on IOT or sometimes when I on IOT.com when I look at that URL
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.480]   I want to say on
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.120]   Union Stacy onion calm, but that that would make no sense whatsoever. It's just like a mind trick my eyes play
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.560]   I have layers. Yes, like an onion layers upon layers of Internet of Things things
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.640]   Good to see you guys. There's been some big news and Stacy
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.840]   I have to imagine the Amazon news from yesterday is probably top of mind for you being the queen bee of
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.880]   Internet of Things. I don't know has anyone ever called you that before
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.780]   Normally they just say that I'm the queen of various things, but I'm okay with being you know a bee
[00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:01.320]   The connected Zareena. I like that Jeff. You're you're now my official like Harold guy who gets to name me
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.320]   I don't know why this was my Harold face
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.800]   That makes sense to me
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.500]   So you so we were just talking prior to the show you are in the Amazon echo
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:20.460]   Eco's the Amazon echo system does that work? Oh, yes, you would we did there? I'm not I'm in the Google home world
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:26.660]   Jeff and this now so in the gooey I to Google home though. I did order I did order you ordered the new
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.400]   What is it the echo show as they announced yesterday the echo show which is a screen a touchscreen device?
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   Built with Amazon powered underneath
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.120]   So it does all the things that your standard
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.160]   Echo device has already been able to do with all the the kind of recipes and stuff like that that work underneath
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.300]   The layer but skills there you go. That's that's the word in this world and that echo system
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.080]   But also the touchscreen which allows you to do things like I don't know video call like in the future
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.160]   What do you think about this Stacy did when I mean we had kind of heard that this was gonna happen at some point is this an answer to a
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   Call that you've had for a while now
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.720]   so
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.660]   We did hear this was gonna happen. It should be about oh and I should tell everyone who's excited about it
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.320]   it's June 28th that this will be out. Yes, I already ordered mine and
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.440]   Actually, I tried out the calling function because to me
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:29.480]   Less so the video calling but being able to call people from my echo is actually a really kind of cool thing
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.880]   From my perspective so just being able to say and I have my echo on my desk
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.400]   And I was trying to think I was gonna call you guys on the air
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.180]   But but you'll learn available. So now I'm gonna see I'm gonna try to
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:51.160]   Is it only echo it is for now only to echo echo now if you have the echo app on your phone
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.660]   I can call you from there, but I may need to already have your phone number in my context for it to work
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.160]   There's a lot of experimentation
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.440]   I haven't done because I only got it this morning because I'm on Android iOS people got it last night
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   So Google will do it in the flash
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.480]   Yes, I would think so they have I mean
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.560]   Basically what you need is they're just piggybacking on my phone. Yeah, they use my phone number
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.520]   So there's no reason Google shouldn't be able to do it
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.240]   Anyway, the show itself has the camera and what it basically
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.880]   I'm very excited about it. I'm a little concerned because the camera can't be like there's no shutter for the camera
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.400]   This is my turning off the camera by flipping down the little shutter privacy shutter
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.280]   So that's gonna always be on I think that's gonna give a lot of people pause
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.720]   But maybe video calling will be significant enough that they're like whoo
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.320]   Did they do it? Did they include a shutter
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.720]   slider cover sort of thing in the
[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.520]   What was it look? Yeah, they did not
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.080]   So Amazon's basically making the bet
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.680]   Well, so it could be that they're just trying to find the right form factor for everyone
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.880]   So you can put an echo in lots of things. I will say that I'm a little there
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.400]   There's a company called nucleus that makes a echo based
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.480]   intercom system that you stick on the wall and
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.640]   basically what Amazon has done here kind of
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.500]   Kills the need for that device. So I'm a little like in
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.040]   How much was the cost of that?
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.680]   200 per or 150 almost
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.160]   Yeah, if you buy if you buy two, it's like 150 each I think
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.280]   But Amazon the Alexa venture fund was the largest investor in the nucleus
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.840]   So I talked to the CEO and he's I he'll be on my show tomorrow
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:55.380]   But he kind of looked at this as a betrayal of I mean he looked at it as it's like yeah great business decision
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.600]   Big betrayal of the platform right there
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.840]   Did you happen to ask him if there was any sort of like non compete clause in their contract at all that that would state that
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.400]   Because Amazon was funding so much of their product that there
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.040]   I don't know that there were any rules built into their contract that would prevent such a
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.240]   Thing because I mean that the products mirror each other so closely
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:24.400]   I did not ask him about that. I imagine he wouldn't have signed that nor would Amazon have signed something like that. Yeah
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.480]   I'm not sure if Amazon who who you think would have signed it that I can't imagine that actually happening in business
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.280]   Yeah, you just buy an equity I I mean, you know, it's could be closet any contract
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:39.320]   Yeah, oh, yeah, I just can't imagine it making it through the right right right
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.240]   Yeah, I mean he I read some interviews with
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:50.560]   Frankel who is the CEO of nucleus and I mean it was it this has been a product for nine months now
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.640]   Right around there five point six million dollars in funding
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.520]   And he he's calling this kind of a wake-up call for Amazon partners to just be like look
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:04.480]   You know this this was this was our big thing that we had a really great thing going here
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.840]   And then suddenly you wake up you hear the rumors, but suddenly you wake up and you realize Amazon's basically just
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.080]   You know taking your great idea and ran with it at the same time
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.920]   It also seems like the obvious next step for a device like the Amazon Echo
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.160]   So I don't know I don't know where to go with that
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.880]   So the the screen
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:35.200]   The screen is an obvious thing because when you have voice it is horribly inefficient to get a list of things like when I ask
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.400]   You know I the other day I was asking for comic book stores near me and
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:46.200]   The echo was like started listing them and I'm like ah too much information. It was it was a stupid request
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   so
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:55.760]   That makes sense it makes sense if you think about video calling once you think about adding voice calling now
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:02.520]   We were always kind of like could it could that be retrofitted apparently it can and you know this is
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:10.760]   It's obvious, but it's still kind of like dang dang Jeff Bezos. You're just merciless, which we knew
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.240]   I should tell people it doesn't do 911
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:21.160]   They actually make you sign that away when you when you log on it's gonna say hey you acknowledge it you can't do
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.440]   911
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.960]   So no help I've fallen and I can't get up feature
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:33.560]   You could call someone who has a landline and they could call 911. I can't even does this Skype do 911 now?
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:39.760]   No, I don't think so even cell phones are really bad at 911 because you know years after we've
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:46.600]   So come to the fact that nobody has a landline. We still don't have good
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.160]   911 capabilities
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:10:00.040]   Actually just last week or maybe the week before the FCC when a Jessica Rosenworsel who was one of the former FCC commissioners
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.560]   She actually shouted shared data that said for the first time ever
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:10.040]   Landlines were there were fewer landlines in homes than mobile phones. So more homes than
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.600]   More homes had mobile phones is their primary phone as opposed to a landline
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.480]   so
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.640]   That's right
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:26.680]   50.8% of households only mobile in the second half the 2016 Wow up from 48.3% a year earlier
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:35.040]   And 6.5% only have landlines me while I'm moving I have an appointment with Sonic to get their internet finally
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:39.080]   I've been on Comcast for quite a few years finally having Sonic install
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.020]   They can only serve my house with fiber to the node not fiber to the home
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.800]   So it's piggybacking on AT&T's network
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.600]   But that's you know Sonic in the mix is better than no Sonic in the mix as far as I'm concerned
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:58.240]   But it comes with it whether I want it to or not as far as I can tell I get a landline again, so I
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:05.280]   Get a phone of some sort so we've been without a landline for years and now suddenly we're getting one again
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.280]   What's the speed of a jack?
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.920]   The speed is 20 megabits oh
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:17.640]   Pretty so so I'm told Verizon is gonna offer near gigabit both ways. Oh wow
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.520]   Yeah
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.360]   Well, I was already had a gigabit both ways
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.440]   Didn't have they announced that
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.120]   Or is that really new?
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:36.360]   Don't know what it's about. Sorry. I'm like wait a second. I thought they already had gigabit
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.360]   I
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.280]   Haven't got it yet
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.800]   Okay, no
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.480]   No, apparently they hadn't look at me. I am wrong
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.800]   So no they had they've announced it. Yep. Nope. No
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:53.420]   Here's in files kiss it's 80 bucks a month for files gigabit. Okay. Oh, that's relatively cheap
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.680]   Have to get it
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.980]   It was really nice though. That is pretty inexpensive. Maybe I'll find it coming okay on the show
[00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.920]   I was gonna say imagine our our lag then
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.640]   Latency will be negative lag at that point
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:14.560]   Your computer can't handle it exactly you're a smoking. It'll be on fire. You don't want that
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.720]   So the echo show you've ordered it Stacey. You've ordered it Jeff. I ordered it
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.280]   What so what is your use case for this Jeff you having not?
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.880]   Already not gonna be in my system
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.800]   It's not gonna be in my closet taking pictures of my clothes. I'll take that for sure all right
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.840]   It'll be in your kitchen taking pictures of your food
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:38.200]   I don't know it's I I want to play with it journalistically. I want to see I want to take it at school and and I think
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:45.320]   You know, it's kind of weird that it's a voice has some real strength as a as a
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:52.560]   Interactivity mechanism and but there's no visual so now if you put voice and visual together
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.560]   I wonder what that's like versus keyboard
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.760]   Yeah, like we're talking together
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.680]   right like
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:03.360]   Actually, yes like what we're doing right now wait a minute
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:10.320]   No, but I mean it is it is a little different like I was thinking about this yesterday when I think about when I was a kid
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:15.960]   Thinking about the future the air quotes future. I definitely thought and the future
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:21.760]   We won't have phones will have video phones which we kind of have right like for the last few years
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:27.960]   Video calling is is no longer this obscure weird thing. We're used to it. However at the same time
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.360]   We don't use it nearly as much as when I was a kid
[00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.520]   I thought we would in the future in air quotes
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:37.240]   But something like this could actually get used a lot if you have a single console
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.000]   Which I mean it has a lot of purposes, but it makes it really easy
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Low friction to just go over to it and bloop. Hey mom. How's it going? Oh, I see you're busy
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.080]   I don't want to bother you right now or whatever the case would be you know versus like I just I don't think of picking up
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.200]   My phone and going I need to call someone I'm gonna make it a video call for some reason
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.000]   You know what I mean? It takes the device out of the equation
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.160]   Yeah, it go you go from thought to action without any friction in between any extra steps
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.000]   So it makes a lot of sense from that point. You're like oh, I should call my mom. Hey
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.600]   That's gonna call mom, right and we just called mom
[00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:18.720]   My my echo is on mute, but I have an echo and I'm like sitting here
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.520]   I could see if Kevin will take my call he might ignore it though
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.240]   And you so you've tried these calls at this point. Yeah, so Kevin and I talked this morning
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.520]   We did a call this morning. Do you want me to see if I can call it? I?
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:34.480]   Think that's what we do here. All right. Given the opportunity we make on the fly calls for sure
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.880]   Call Kevin Tofol
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:45.440]   And this is happening on your dot
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:53.360]   It goes green. I don't know if you can tell us it's ringing. Okay. Yeah, I can see that
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.600]   Is that a new color for that go? It is a new color for that
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.200]   I used to see the green. Oh, I
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:06.800]   Don't think Kevin's answering. He's watching. He's like I'm not picking up. It's like no way
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   I'm not picking up
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.000]   Time since he's been on the show
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.680]   Yeah
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.680]   He's probably like do yeah, I don't think so
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:24.000]   Although here is so this gets into another thing. I couldn't find a way to mute it which means suddenly we've got
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.680]   If you have my phone number basically you can tell us how to call my home now in a way that
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:37.880]   You could do when you have like a landline. Oh, it's ringing. Oh, okay. Oh
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.440]   Kevin Tofol's calling that's how I answer
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.880]   Hey Kevin, I'm on twig and so are you I just wanted to show off the calling
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:53.520]   Okay, was this irritating to you?
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:01.040]   Hi, Kevin. Hey, we can't hear us. Yeah, you can't hear us
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.000]   Okay, thanks Kevin. Bye Kevin. See you next week at Google I/O
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.880]   Hey, up
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:13.760]   All right, well there it works and and I think you know another interesting part
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.000]   And you mentioned this a little bit earlier is is not just these devices. It's in the app
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.480]   So if you just have the app installed that app
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.120]   I mean up until now that app has been all about managing the hardware right for the most part now
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:32.040]   It's like that app is becoming also a messaging service, which is kind of interesting
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.560]   But you're locked into Amazon's messaging service. So it's yet another
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.520]   Yet another trail
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.560]   To venture into if you're if you're getting into messaging
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:47.200]   Indeed and you're not but you're not sending these kind of messages and I'm sorry
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:54.600]   Carsten at the beginning of the show. We should tell everybody in the podcast to turn off their echoes turn the mics off on their
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:59.800]   Echoes if you haven't done that already now might be a good time. I am a bad person
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:06.160]   I will I will oh man. We did you didn't prepare people for that one
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:10.760]   So okay, so speaking of Google so we have Amazon's announcement here
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:16.760]   Nucleus by the way one comment before we move on that that I think he made in that interview
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:23.400]   I can't remember if it was that interviewer a different one is that they believe and obviously Amazon feels this way too that this is
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.600]   The Trojan horse for this category is calling is that?
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:33.920]   We've seen a lot of a lot of pickup in home, you know voice controlled speakers and in that market
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.520]   I think there was a study. What is the study here?
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:45.040]   It's a e-market or forecast says that Amazon will have 70.6% of the voice enabled speaker market in the US this year Google home
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:51.600]   23.8% but that those who buy one don't buy a competing one so there's a lot of lock in there
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.720]   It's not common for one person to buy
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.920]   Devices on on both sides to have both an echo and a Google home. So Jeff you're an outlier
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:06.160]   but and well and there you go see I'm the only one that doesn't apparently so I'm the outlier and
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:12.800]   And that calling is going to be what moves these even further into the mainstream that it that it
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:18.520]   I don't justify the product existing in people's homes. Yeah, exactly. It's it's also
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.120]   Network effect. Oh, it's the network effect
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.560]   Right if I buy one I'm gonna tell presumably my mom and say mom
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.800]   You got to get this because you can just shout call Stacy that would be a terrible idea, but
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:36.800]   Or you could just drop in that's another feature, right? Yes, drop in feature
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.720]   We do not want to forget the drop in feature, which is basically a way for you to
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:50.280]   Select someone to opt in that that person can drop in on your video feed at any time that they choose
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:55.760]   No, I'm just understanding this. No, that's that's I mean this is this is for families
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.880]   I mean, this is like what I would have in my house
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:03.400]   It's the same thing of like people who check in on their family through the nest cam, right? All right. I mean
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:08.040]   That's a good way to think about the sex industry
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:13.280]   This just took a dark turn I didn't see that
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.680]   Okay, I see the family example
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:22.160]   Yeah, well, I mean I guess so because you know like I have I have a ring
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.760]   Outside and it's got a video feed on it. Obviously someone rings the doorbell ring by the way as a sponsor
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.400]   Just a full disclosure, but someone hits hits the bell
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:36.040]   I get a notification on my phone and I have the ability to jump in on the video feed
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:39.080]   And yeah, there have been many times where I get that I look at it
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:43.960]   And I know hey my my kids and my wife they just arrived home. Okay, cool
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.360]   You know, I know that now for whatever valuable reason that is
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.520]   But I guess it's kind of the same thing
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:56.400]   It just happens to be in your kitchen or the kitchen of let's say your elderly parents is one example that I that I saw
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:04.440]   Put about so I guess I kind of see that just and speaking of really weird your ring will be integrated into the echo show
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.080]   The video from your ring. Oh really? Oh, that's so if you're upstairs and
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:14.400]   You know, you've got one upstairs in your phone right now your phone your doorbell rings and your phone somewhere else
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   You can just be like
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:20.680]   What's that video pop up? I also imagine it's an intercom within the house
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.160]   So that's a you know, I did see that
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.920]   I haven't figured out how to do that yet again
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:34.920]   Everyone everyone leaves me during the day. So I can't make my husband and daughter play with me on all these devices
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.760]   So I'm like, ah you have to list your dog obviously
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.440]   You know, she's smart, but she doesn't she's not very obedient
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.960]   I don't know how to how to talk to the Amazon Echo
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.200]   Um, yeah, that would be that would be really cool to be able to talk between devices
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.640]   I suppose if you had a large enough house probably need a house otherwise
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:57.560]   It also I should say they're also talking about working with your arlo cameras
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:03.160]   So if you got the net your arlo cameras, you can actually see like what's going on outside your house or at a camera
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:09.960]   Wherever one of your cameras is so suddenly you've got this security console basically that's on your kitchen, right?
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:15.480]   Accessible at all times and it went to walk up to it tap it and get going nice
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.480]   Um cool. So so then I was gonna say way a little bit earlier
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.640]   Um
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:28.520]   Do we think that google's working on something similar? I mean they have to be right like it's an app to be it's obvious that you need a screen
[00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.520]   Yeah, yeah
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.280]   Stacy's grinning
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.440]   I so I think you need a screen
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.680]   I don't think it actually has to be on the device and that's where I think this gets really interesting
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.200]   like I
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.040]   I was kind of disappointed that
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.920]   Amazon didn't say hey, you need to be really cool
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   Let's turn whatever
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:52.280]   Let's say I asked the echo for something like the list for comic book stores
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:59.160]   Instead of telling me what else you realized that is a really lengthy thing and just send it to my phone screen, right?
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.520]   and
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:06.360]   To be sure today that happens in the app, but let's say the same way when you send a google like when you're on
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.960]   Uh when you're on maps on your browser and your desktop
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.200]   You can actually send directions to your phone and you get like a notification. It just pops up and it's like
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.680]   so imagine you got a notification with the list of comic book stores, right or
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:25.320]   You got it on your television screen if it decided that's where you want if you told it that's where you wanted
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:31.560]   But there are so stacey. I was wondering about that. What's the installed base of chrome cast versus uh, Amazon fire
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.120]   The idea got to think chrome cast is higher. I do it too. I mean it's way higher
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:41.880]   So so so if you look at Amazon versus google on this so if if you're right, Jason if google is building it
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:47.480]   Advantages, um, it was interesting that amazon the video they showed was a youtube video
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:51.560]   Mm-hmm. So they're acknowledging you know the the rest of the world
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.400]   um
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.240]   But uh
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.000]   So google has the advantage of chrome cast so whatever it does can communicate with that
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.920]   It has your photos. It has your email
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.640]   Has your contacts
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:07.640]   Uh, it has a phone service already
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:14.200]   Oh, so you want to get to my crazy idea? What's up? You ready for this you guys? All right
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.400]   Amazon should relaunch their phone
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:27.560]   Boom fire phone 2.0, but don't call a fire phone call it the echo phone. Yeah, right integrate it with the with the echo sphere
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:34.360]   I don't know so so because this is what i've been the i'm like, oh, you know, if you're gonna build an ecosystem go all in
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.440]   um
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.880]   I don't know
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:43.400]   some people really liked the fire phone too and it ties back into all their shopping because
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.520]   and again
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:53.160]   When amazon if you buy this and they have access to a camera looking in in your home, especially in your kitchen
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:57.720]   Think about all the data they can start gathering. They're gonna know what products you eat
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.440]   what products you cook with
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.160]   They're gonna know who's in the kitchen with you and you know, that's
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.360]   Really? I'm in Germany
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:16.120]   Yeah, it's probably not I mean from a privacy standpoint the not the only nice thing about amazon is
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:21.160]   They don't share that data with anyone. They want you they want all that data so they can tell you what to buy
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.240]   They don't want to give it to anyone else
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.080]   So
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:31.640]   Yeah, I mean I could actually really see amazon trying again with the phone if if the fire phone wasn't such a
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:39.160]   Particular failure as it was or at least as it was reported widely and and seen by people
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.400]   I can understand why amazon's hesitant, but I could see one some coming back
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:50.040]   But apple went and made the ipod really useful. I mean, I don't know. Yes. I think it was a spectacular failure, but
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.720]   But it but it is I mean it is an obvious category
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:25:00.920]   When you think about what amazon is doing from a technological perspective around
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.080]   the echo
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.880]   The capabilities of the echo and their fire tablets fire tablets is basically you know
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.920]   Usually you think of tablets going kind of hand-in-hand with you know the smaller form factor phone
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.240]   The only reason amazon doesn't have a phone right now is because the fire phone didn't
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:22.200]   Work so well, but maybe it was because they they hadn't learned certain lessons that they know now
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:26.600]   Maybe they could do it again and they could do it right. I could totally see if they just put out an android
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.640]   I do you know go ahead and put out a full android phone
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:36.120]   But add other features, but you know that again. All right, so Stacy never think about it. Why do they need the hardware?
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.920]   um
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.360]   They would need the hardware to have control like
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.160]   If they can't get their app on a phone basically, so I guess any android phone
[00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:52.440]   Let me ask you this and and i'm not trying to answer your question with the question
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.640]   But why do they have for like all the amazon video stuff?
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.840]   You have to download a separate app store to put that on your phone
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.800]   Is that just drm based or is there some other deeper technical reason?
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:08.920]   I've not known the reason yeah, it is a pain by the way when I when I have to rebuild a phone or a tablet it's
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.600]   Royal pain
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:18.120]   So I don't obviously yeah, so I I actually don't know if they need the hardware they just do that for
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:22.200]   Making my life a little bit more difficult and your life a little
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.400]   but um
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:27.400]   it gives them
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.160]   It gives them more data
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:35.240]   It gives them a place to automatically send stuff in the ecosystem. I guess it gives them better messaging
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:42.760]   Uh, I don't know what else it gives them you on the go so you could talk to I mean you could do that through the app
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:51.400]   I mean what's more personal about a person than how they use their phone particularly if Amazon's goal is to learn more about you and
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:58.920]   Help you buy things through them having a phone on your person is incredibly valuable to gathering that information in the same way that it is from
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:03.080]   You know a device in your kitchen is is informative to them about what you know
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.280]   What items you need when you're in the kitchen that that you might be able to buy from there
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:12.120]   Well, that's I'm like actually what's more personal than that. I would argue that all the data that's coming from my home
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.440]   Because there's a lot of stuff. My phone doesn't see that my house does
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.120]   creepy
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:26.040]   This comes on. So to say see did you did you order the um, uh, the amazon uh, uh, camera thing?
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:32.760]   I put my less myself on the invite for the look which is the style camera. That's right. Thank you
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.400]   Okay, and then the show
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:39.160]   I also I bought that or I ordered it
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:44.360]   In way a lot they allowed you to do that yesterday with the with the look you had to do a pre-order
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.160]   And I just realized there is a camera cover for the look
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.840]   It's the closet that you put it in when you close the doors, which is what they showed in my commercial video
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.000]   I'm like I changed my closet that thing's not going in my closet
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.840]   I I I really honestly so like
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:06.520]   I'm very concerned about the show like as I think about it and
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.960]   I obviously have to try it because this is my job and I will but
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:14.920]   I don't really know if I want and always on camera that's going to be sitting in my house
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.360]   I mean, I do know that I don't want that actually and they haven't so far given me compelling value to be like
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.120]   Hi diggity. Let's leave that sucker in all the time. Right
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.920]   Let's I mean, yeah, it's just
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:33.880]   There's just that disconnect of an internet connected device with an always on camera that resides in your bedroom
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.320]   Which you know one of his main purposes is to
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:41.560]   Allow you to dress in front of it and it can tell you whether you look good or not
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:47.080]   You can think of a million reasons why that sentence does not compute for a lot of people
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.240]   Uh from from a product standpoint
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.560]   I have I have a really hard time thinking that a product like the look could actually gain traction
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:58.360]   But I guess there are people out there that they don't care. It's the benefit outweighs the potential
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.440]   So
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:05.240]   Someone is saying that the amazon the camera is not always on on the echo show
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.400]   and I don't know if that's true or not so
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.040]   So is it a queuing sort of mechanism in the same way?
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:19.080]   The way it listens. Yeah, the way it listens is it just turns on when it hears its wake words
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.720]   So if it's just waiting for the wake word, well, there you go
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:27.000]   But there's still there's still that thought there's still that creeping thought in your mind
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.440]   Which is
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.560]   All of those other things that I said internet connected video camera in your bedroom like that just
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.080]   eh
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.080]   people are people are very
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.680]   wary of security issues and in this day and age and
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.440]   I just I don't know
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.160]   I would be very hesitant to bring that into my bedroom
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.840]   Uh, you know that type of a device just doesn't doesn't compute for me
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:55.240]   But maybe once you have it and you experience the benefit it wipes all those fears away. I don't know
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:03.960]   I don't know so see I don't know how drop-in would work though if it wasn't always on I guess it just turns on when someone requests a drop-in
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.720]   That's my understanding but so
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.120]   Okay
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.880]   I mean it's basically basically I'm given access to just yeah
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:18.920]   To control your camera to control your camera to tap into your camera feed when I want to
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:22.120]   All right. Well, there we go
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.240]   Yeah
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:29.320]   No one's getting that power except for me or my husband while we're awake and maybe and maybe that is what amazon's
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:38.440]   intention with that is is yeah perfect example, right like you you might actually want to be able to drop in in that very specific
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:44.520]   Example, it's easy to stretch it out though and be like then think of a million scenarios why you wouldn't want that
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:48.680]   Uh that capability, but it's opt in so you can choose and I guess that's the power
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.480]   You know, I'm gonna let everyone
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:56.120]   Everyone know that when you have a connected home affairs are not really possible
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.840]   Just putting that out there
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.520]   Uh
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:06.280]   Everything from sleep sensors to always on cameras to your car tracking you it's just it's it's
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:11.640]   Doable divorce rates are going to plummet because people are going to be forced to be good
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.600]   I was going to say our marriage rates will
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.800]   disintegrate and divorces will increase because now people will have
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:27.320]   Because the the influence of those tracking devices isn't enough to keep them from doing it anyways and getting caught
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.520]   Exactly
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.640]   Um and and before we kind of get out of the voice assistant realm
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:42.280]   Uh, we also heard like they're coming at us fast right now harm and carden has the invoke speaker, which is uh cortana
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.000]   powered uh home device
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.480]   So they're getting in on the on this game using cortana underneath
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:55.880]   Uh, and I don't know if that's an official announcement yet. I think we're still still waiting to hear more. They showed it at ces
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.560]   Oh, did they I miss talked it they talked. Maybe they didn't show. Oh, that was the Lenovo one, but they did talk about it at ces
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:09.080]   Oh, okay. So because yeah, everyone was excited about this. I was like, I swear to god. I have seen this before
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.440]   I hadn't even heard of that, but I'm excited to use cortana
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:15.720]   in a home assistant kind of
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.560]   Yeah, I just I've net will just in general. I don't have any
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:24.920]   Any pcs anymore and kevin has told me that cortana is actually really good. So
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.800]   I would like to use it
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:33.320]   If you did have windows 10 pcs, then you could potentially at some point. I think it's this sump this september
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.360]   Microsoft apparently has plans to um
[00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:40.600]   Roll out something called man. What is it? It's uh,
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:48.120]   It's their own control through through windows 10 pcs. So instead of instead of it being
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:52.680]   Uh having an actual voice assistant in different rooms
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.600]   Any windows 10 pcs throughout your house becomes
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:02.600]   The kind of hub that controls your smart home taps into hu nest and sean all those does void
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:08.600]   video and voice calls powered by cortana. So it's basically your windows 10 pc becomes a a uh,
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.680]   Amazon echo or google home, which
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:15.160]   You know kind of saw the i was on the rundown the uh, the raspberry pie
[00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.960]   Google home. Oh, yeah that well
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.400]   That ties into this as well actually that's the very top of the doc
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.480]   um the yeah, that's the uh, ai
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.200]   Aiy ai yourself
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:33.240]   Which this kid is a product of the magpie magazine. It's like a
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:38.600]   It's included with the latest issue of magpie magazine. It includes the cardboard
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.440]   Housing so it's like a box essentially a speaker
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.520]   Uh wiring
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:51.560]   Stereo microphone. There's an arcade style button that goes on the top. So essentially this taps into the assistant sdk
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.400]   That google doesn't it doesn't listen for your voice. You have to hit the button instead. It's like the
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.800]   The cheeko exactly you slam that bike which is probably pretty satisfying actually
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:07.880]   Just go pam and then uh and then give your your voice query and you've got assistant in a cardboard box as google loves to do
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.160]   So I would say that's kind of gimmicky fun
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:16.040]   But anytime you have to touch something that kind of sucks up the magic voice
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:20.120]   Like I said it with the tap. I know that some people use the tap and that's great
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.080]   but
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:23.080]   having to touch it kind of
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.360]   Why?
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.360]   Yeah, it's not always that I love but I will push buttons all day long
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.920]   Well, it's like an arcade style button. So you know, it's got a sad
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.920]   Yeah, click to it. It's like bam
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:39.720]   Uh, I also saw that the the um the ai y kid is being used in a number of different ways
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.200]   Somebody else created a candy dispenser
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:49.240]   Out of it. So it's basically an assistant powered candy dispenser that how was how was this ai?
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:54.360]   Uh, that's that's a really great question. I think it's just using the the assistant sdk to pull it off
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:35:01.000]   I don't know exactly yours. So fair fun. Yeah, um exactly how they're doing that, but they created a housing for it
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.080]   They mounted the hardware in there
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:08.280]   They created a sensor so that it actually you tell it whether you want a little bit of candy or a lot of candy
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:12.120]   And then it detects when the cup is under there and dumps a bunch of candy in a cup
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.520]   You know, we all need this
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.760]   It's important stuff right here
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:22.840]   This is the future of artificial intelligence now what would be even better is if when it was done
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:27.640]   It reordered the candy from amazon through the dash replenishment. Oh, yes
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.560]   I thought you would say if it if it's sort of the colors, I thought that too. I was like it gets rid of all the green
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:38.040]   M&M whatever the color i'm waiting for more candy. I'm like, I don't care what color it is
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:44.040]   And now I want to eat some candy. Uh, how about we take a break and when we come back?
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:49.560]   We'll talk a little bit about google stuff. Um, we have IO coming up next week. Why would we do that?
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.160]   It's talking about google stuff. It's it's in the name
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:59.880]   Down there, right this week in google. We'll uh, we'll spend a segment talking about google stuff
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:04.760]   But we had to start with amazon that was kind of the big news and I think everybody's really interested and excited
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.920]   And I hope that google comes out with its own screen device similar to that. Who knows?
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.480]   Maybe we'll see it at IO. We'll talk about that in a second
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:17.560]   Uh, first let's thank the sponsor of today's episode of this week in google and that is rocket mortgage by quick and loans

[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:21.080]   You just did that to make her feel bad. No, I don't know. I'm doing the live model. Look
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.400]   I not the life model like um, I'm
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.400]   What is it model? No, I don't think the cover notes the coverage of the keynote. Thank you. I'm I'm
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:35.480]   Oh, you're doing the live. Oh good. So I see my touchy all right. So you'll you'll be kind of there
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.720]   Yeah, um, well, no, no, we won't be no, we're gonna. We're not gonna do the live keynote from there
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:45.240]   We'll do the show there. Okay, so you'll bring all your wisdom from having done that to this show
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:50.840]   You'll catch all the things that got wisdom. Yeah, you'll catch all the things that we miss you are sometimes when you're there
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.840]   You miss it. Sorry, no
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.120]   Yes
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.120]   I'll try to be the google's arena that day
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:01.160]   What do you guys think we're gonna see? I I mean, obviously
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.080]   Android oh
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:08.520]   Similar to last year with n we knew about it kind of going into google i.o
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.480]   And there were things that were revealed at the show about
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:14.280]   the android release
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.400]   More or less, you know more than what we already knew going into it
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.800]   So i'm sure we'll see some stuff around that
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:24.360]   Do you guys have any big big predictions or things you hope to see from google out of the saio
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.200]   How about a brain to go on go ahead
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.400]   I was gonna say how about a brain to computer interface?
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.560]   Dun, dun, dun
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:37.000]   That's well facebook was talking that yeah, they could I know
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.960]   That's right. Jeff you have a serious one though. You should well, you know me. I want I want a new chromebook pixel
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.120]   That'll never die. That'll never go away. That'll never go away. I want I want
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:55.480]   Pixel see I want google hardware. Obviously. I like google as a hardware company. Yeah
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.560]   Do you think it was minor?
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:04.200]   But do you think google's gonna undo their their previous decision to not have any hardware giveaways and be like, yeah, we changed
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.200]   Am I here you go. Yeah, I don't think i'll give it any way
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.440]   No, i don't think i'll give it any way
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:14.120]   I think we'll see some really cool stuff on the machine learning side. I don't know if we're gonna appreciate it
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.280]   But we definitely will see it
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:23.160]   And then i'm actually looking for some good cloud case studies just because I know they did their cloud stuff already
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.800]   So maybe they won't do that here, but
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:32.520]   I would like to I feel like google is actually making some good strides in areas that it hasn't talked about yet. So
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:37.320]   Just based on conversations i've had so i'd like to see them tout that a little bit more
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.840]   Um, let's see here. There's gonna be a lot of sunburns will be at the shoreline amphitheater
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.360]   Although I think in the weather is not looking to be quite
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.000]   Oh really?
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.920]   As balmy as it was last year. It's a little bit cooler that might not be a bad thing though
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:41:01.640]   Uh, we're the hoodie. Yeah, yeah, definitely bring layers. It's weird. It's like 65 degrees outside and cool today, which
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:06.440]   I want warmth, but anyways, um bigger room kind of to texas
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.040]   Should there are a lot of places I could probably go and then I and then I'd be like, okay, I have the warmth
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:15.000]   I have too much of the warmth. Maybe I changed my mind and I want to go back to the cool
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.520]   I just can't make up my mind. That's the problem 64 and soon knows wednesday thursday 69 and 75
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.160]   That's not too bad 75
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:28.760]   75 will be about perfect. I think because we are out there wandering around it gets hot really fast
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.720]   Having it a little bit cool is actually probably gonna be pretty nice
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:36.280]   Um, they say they have bigger rooms more people to facilitate for the rooms
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.360]   By the way, they updated their google.io
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.880]   Um
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.640]   2017 app
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:46.920]   So if you run that app you can reserve seats now this year. They're doing things a little different you can actually
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:51.800]   Receipts wow, that's nice. So I would recommend definitely jeff
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.080]   I would recommend taking a look at the the talks that you want to go to
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:00.360]   Log into the app and it'll give you the option to um under your id to reserve a seat
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.320]   I'm curious to know how they how they'll track that when you're there
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:05.560]   So what you do so pardon me for what i'm about to say
[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.200]   um, you're pardoned
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.840]   when you have one of
[00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.640]   These at Davos
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:20.840]   Okay, these are the greatest name tags on earth because notice it's not a very long thing it fits around it never goes
[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.440]   The opposite way
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:26.440]   And then you you're registered for the session and you just hold this up and have seen
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:31.560]   To a thing and it that it tells the minder green light let him in
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:37.480]   That makes a whole lot of sense and then those who didn't get in there's always some who don't show up
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.880]   But then they start letting people in right by that
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.840]   Yeah, they did and google did mention that they were going to leave
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:46.520]   um a certain number of seats in in all of the talks for um
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:51.160]   You know open for droppings and stuff like that. They weren't giving them all away to reservations
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:55.080]   Uh, I didn't have any problems reserving for any of the docs
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.400]   Now that you've said this on the air now i'm never gonna get
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:02.840]   I think you're probably okay. Jeff a moment. He's like, I think you're probably okay right now
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:07.800]   I have a feeling beginning of next week is when things are gonna start going crazy where people are like, oh, I never actually reserved
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.960]   I better do that now
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:15.240]   So anyways do check that out though, Jeff because I would hate for you to not get into things that you're that you're looking forward to
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.640]   um
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:22.200]   Wearables is wearables a passing fad at this point and it's like in who cares
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.640]   out of google i/o
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.880]   Yeah, I think so I think so
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.720]   What about
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:35.960]   What about um, I think answering facebook's a r craze with
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:40.520]   google air will google stick with 360 or will it start to also
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:44.520]   Considering its strength in a and ai go to ar
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.680]   Yeah, there was um
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.080]   There was a rumor last year
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:52.680]   Uh
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.520]   That google was working on its own actual standalone hardware
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.280]   For this stuff, but I don't know if that was for ar or vr
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:07.160]   But I wonder if that ends up materializing in in some sort of way, but again vr like I wonder I also
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:11.720]   Have to wonder how how that's working for google. They did daydream
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.920]   Daydreams are very limited as far as what devices
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:21.000]   You know are compatible with it and vr just as a trend right now seems to be cooling off
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.320]   And trends don't last very long in technology. It's like two years and they're done
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:29.160]   Um, so I wonder how much of an emphasis they'll actually place on that
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:32.760]   I know facebook's all in facebook continues to to beat that drum. Yep
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.880]   Um, so maybe google's there as well because you know their biggest competitor is
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.560]   I would love to see what what google would do around ar
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.320]   Um
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:49.240]   Ooh, maybe they'll tell us what they're doing. They they showed off the jacard coat with levi's oh right at south by
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.600]   Maybe they'll I don't know show something cool there
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:58.280]   A tap so we have wearables from a tap which would be way cooler than like a new
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:03.160]   Android wear watch is a new watch. It's triangular this time
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:07.000]   So by the way, just so the keynote is not till 1 p.m
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   No, that's that's not correct. It's I think it's 10
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.080]   Uh 10 a.m. I believe oh so it's doing one thing
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:19.240]   It's adjusting the damn time. Oh man. I google I hate that
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:25.160]   I do too. This gives me I can no longer make I can't make appointments when I'm on the road because I'm like
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.120]   I just don't know what time zone anything's in
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:31.400]   And I know it's just google smarter than me, but jibis
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:35.080]   It's it's okay. And I cannot find the option to say don't do that
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:39.160]   It doesn't ask you it asks me every time I switch time zones
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.920]   Oh
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:45.960]   Ask me and I don't know how to take it. I'm and I'm unhappy. I'm just unhappy. Oh man
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:48.600]   I don't think it's only that chef
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:51.480]   No
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:55.000]   I don't do enough traveling. I have I have ran it. I'll tell you what's gonna make me
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:01.560]   Well later. We'll play what's gonna make me really unhappy. Oh boy. Oh, I'll look for that setting in the meantime
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.680]   Uh
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.680]   Tablets convertibles
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.760]   Feel like there's you know, there's still that looming
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.920]   I could announce a convertible Chromebook. Yeah
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.800]   Yeah, I think they could do it
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.120]   Like a google the one that ran it the sam song is
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.520]   Yeah
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:24.360]   I know I'm waiting. I mean, I love my my Chromebook pixel. It's the first generation one
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.720]   I'm still using it
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.080]   Not today and we'll talk about that here in a few what I'm using but
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.480]   Um, I'm still a big fan of chrome OS. I use it every day here at work
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:40.680]   I would love to get another Chromebook and kind of that I could actually run android apps on because this first version doesn't do that
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.920]   I just haven't seen one that I'm like, okay. That's gotta be that's the one that I had to get
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.760]   Uh, so I'm right there with you jeff. I hope google finally gives us
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.360]   a uh, a googly option for that. Yeah
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:55.160]   I would love to see that
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:47:01.160]   What else google home, you know, they're probably going to talk about google home to some degree because that's such been such a
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.440]   Of that categories on fire right now
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:10.440]   Uh, splaygo. Yeah, I wish so you know a lot of people have been talking badly about
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:13.160]   Google Wi-Fi
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.160]   I love google Wi-Fi
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.400]   Okay
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:19.400]   I'd love to see like, you know
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:27.240]   Their whole home strategy if they could talk about that but I doubt that's gonna happen like oh, I want to see an update on brillow
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:31.080]   Hello, which is their iot kind of um
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.120]   operating system for devices. I'm like
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:39.720]   Sophie what's out? I know i'm like our next ad read i'm gonna let her out
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:48.120]   Right with his boring podcast. I tried to offer her out beforehand
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:52.360]   I told her she was not gonna enjoy it, but she would not go for her for a warning. Sophie
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.160]   We're starting a podcast. You might be a little bored
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:57.880]   Okay, last forever
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:05.320]   Free so fee free so fee free so fee okay here. I'm gonna go let her out now. Yeah, see it
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:09.160]   Oh, look how happy she is
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.840]   Thanks
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:15.480]   If Sophie knew how to control the the Amazon Echo in the house, maybe the echo
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.120]   I gotta go. Oh
[00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:20.520]   Really sister should go. Oh, I actually didn't want to go
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:32.440]   You I think Sophie's disappointed that you were like going going with her. Oh totally. Yeah, she's like, well wait
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.080]   You're still doing this
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:39.640]   Yeah, this podcast thing it's relentless. God you going forever
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.640]   Oh
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:45.160]   I was
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:50.840]   I was thinking about having I was like oh what I need is an automatic door kind of functionality
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.920]   But I am sitting here trying to imagine how you would think that wouldn't you that's well, of course
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.640]   I would I have an echo dot right next to me
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.680]   I know that's what I was thinking that's what I was just saying when you ran over there
[00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:02.920]   If only Sophie knew how to talk to your Amazon Echo
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:09.560]   Uh, so if he could you know do some sort of a bark or or something and the that would be a cool hack wouldn't it?
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:15.480]   That would be pretty awesome. I mean, it's it's doable. I just have to get the lever down and there are things for that
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.480]   Mm-hmm. What about a bark as a as a as a as a prompt
[00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:22.360]   Um
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.360]   That might be a little harder
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:25.560]   I'm like
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:29.800]   Is there a way to record it and then have that be the prompt? I'll have to go look at that
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:33.240]   If anyone knows in the chat room feel free to share although
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:37.160]   Oh, she's I don't know if you can see her shadow moving out there. She was
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.160]   I
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.880]   Oh, she let her back in now soon. You're gonna get the scratches on the door
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:49.400]   No, she won't scratch the door. She'll just lay there and when I pop out at whatever time we're done. She'll be like
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:51.880]   Can we play down?
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.520]   Dang it now. I want to dog
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.800]   Uh
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.800]   Some day soon some days you want mine?
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:02.920]   I would never take sofi away from you. Sophie is adorable though. I will say
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.360]   Uh
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.800]   We will be getting a dog here shortly. We have dog fever in our house
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:09.640]   Uh
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:17.320]   So, okay, so transitioning away from google.io. How about this because this was kind of uh in the news a decent amount a couple of days ago fuchsia
[00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:19.480]   Which is this?
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.920]   Strange
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:27.320]   I don't know. I don't know really how to explain fuchsia other than it's this open source o s that google is developing
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:31.640]   It's open source, which means they're developing open source. Oh, I didn't know that
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.080]   They're they're developing it out in the open the code is out there
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:41.480]   So you can actually check in on it and see where it's going google really isn't talking about exactly what it is
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:46.600]   Uh, they've given little clues here and there that it's you know powerful enough for
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:52.040]   uh modern phones personal computers with fast processors lots of ram and peripherals
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:54.520]   Which kind of covers the gamut as far as that's concerned
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:51:00.680]   Uh, but they I guess they've been working on this project for more than a year last august we heard about it
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:07.320]   Um, you know, we started to see kind of code popping up here and there it appeared in the the open source repository
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.960]   And if you put it together, you got a command line. Well a gentleman by the name of kyle brad shot
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:16.920]   We actually had him on uh tech news today yesterday and interviewed him on the show yesterday
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:21.640]   Uh, I guess he's been really kind of interested in what fuchsia actually is
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:26.200]   And so he's been checking in on it every once in a while and he spent a little bit of time
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:30.600]   Getting pieces of it working on an android device. Meanwhile
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:34.360]   fuchsia is not it's not based on linux, but
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:40.040]   it's uh, it's written with the flutter sdk, which is a cross platform
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:45.480]   um, which is cross platform and so he could take pieces of this and
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:52.200]   simulate essentially the user interface of fuchsia at least at the point that it's developed to right now
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:56.440]   System ui apparently is called armadillo lots of weird little words there
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.760]   Uh weird little names for things, but
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:04.760]   Um fuchsia itself is based on its own micro kernel called magenta like I said not linux
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:09.160]   Uh, but he was able to kind of thumb through there and put it together and put a video out and
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:14.840]   People are just asking themselves like is this the next android? What exactly are we looking at here?
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:19.240]   Do you guys have any theories on why fuchsia exists so openly yet?
[00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:22.120]   We are so completely in the dark as far as what it actually is
[00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:27.720]   I was really hoping you guys would tell me because I was I was I brought this to the i'm like, oh
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:30.040]   I'm gonna finally learn what this is about all right
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.480]   Let's get to the bottom. I'm sorry. Is it is it a way to get rid of fragmentation?
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:36.040]   Is it a way to restart but it's open source? I guess
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.640]   Hello
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:43.560]   Yeah, well, I think there's that could be part of it. Um, I mean it's such a tall order to think about
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.920]   Where google has brought andra what like what?
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:52.360]   Andraid is in the marketplace is so it's so dominant. It's on so many devices
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:58.280]   Yet google needs to do something right the update problem is continually an issue
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.840]   um, there are
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:05.640]   regularly emerging issues around the fact that there you know, there are pieces of the linux
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:11.160]   Code that you know, there's licensing issues around certain parts of that that google wants to get away from
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:15.080]   Um, so you can see why they might want to do something like this
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:19.640]   Uh, but it just seems like such a such a big task to pull it off
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:22.920]   Well, that's what google does. I suppose so big
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:29.400]   I'm like they have not shied away from a big task even even failed at it. Um, I wonder
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.160]   if
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:37.000]   Because there's always been rumors for years and these are just rumors and they're not even credible enough that like I would write a
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.720]   Story about them that google is looking at doing its own chips
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:47.720]   For phones much like apple has done and that would help with security and solving some of the fragmentation issues or give them more control over security
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:49.880]   um
[00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:52.520]   What I don't know is if you
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:54:00.440]   If there's anything built here that might signal something along those lines because it would make sense if you were going to optimize your hardware
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:04.840]   Then you would build a new os to optimize around that too. Oh wow. Yeah, that's right
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:09.160]   But that's a pretty big that's like one of those leaps where you're just like
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:14.280]   And here I am. We're all smoking weed together and we'll come up with this, you know, so
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.720]   That's not even april 20th
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.640]   um
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:24.280]   Yeah, I that's I was like, but it is 420, but it's not it's 430 high-tech
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:27.800]   Your time's up
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:33.320]   Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think it's all it's all guessing right now what you see from the ui
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:39.160]   Or what you see from the demonstration that kyle put together is really just the user interface touches
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:45.480]   Kind of falls in the material design realm things will look very cards-based and it
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:51.160]   Has a focus on multitasking. There's parts of the demo where I saw where it's really easy to take
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:58.920]   This window and smash it together with this window and everything just kind of grows and instantly splits into into two sides of the screen
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:04.600]   You can throw a third one in there and it just it all morphs together in a way that makes it look like it would be good for
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:10.600]   Kind of like on the fly multitasking, which might be good for a desktop environment. Let's say just as one example. So
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.320]   man, I
[00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:20.440]   I hope at some point google kind of comes out with some sort of an explanation as far as why this exists out in the open
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:25.560]   But at this point, it's really just this thing that everybody's watching with curiosity going. I don't know
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:30.040]   Uh, it's cool though. What does it mean?
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:35.160]   And maybe that's all it is. Maybe this is just google like
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:40.120]   They're throwing this code over the wall. Let's see how long people speculate about what we're gonna do with this
[00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:43.560]   Wow, no, maybe people can tell us why we're making this
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:48.840]   Maybe the people out there can give us a hint as far as what we should do with this
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:56.520]   Uh, yeah, so we'll we'll see what happens ron ronamario did a really nice deep dive on what he saw and his takeaways
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:59.080]   So if you want to check that out go to ours technical.com and you can
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.880]   Find that walkthrough ron's always really good at
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:04.840]   Add-out. It's reading the tea leaves
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:08.920]   Yeah, I was hoping he was gonna be here to not know knows
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.920]   Displained
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:16.440]   Say yes call him on your on your amazon. There you go. I bet he has what I bet I don't have his phone number
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.240]   I can't just randomly cold call him nuts
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:24.680]   We can ask him next week. Oh, this means phone numbers aren't going away. Okay
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:32.520]   Oh nuts, okay, what other google stuff i'm looking through the dock here
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.400]   Okay
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:43.960]   There's like little little pieces wamo wamo wamo. Yeah, uh, they have uh apparently
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:51.320]   Their efforts in autonomous vehicles have skyrocketed. They've clocked more than three million public road miles
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:59.000]   Uh, they have added a million miles in the last seven months partially because they added a hundred new mini vans to their fleet
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:05.160]   Uh, just back in december back in december a hundred new ones on the road. Uh, so they're just
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:10.760]   They're the I mean they're blasting off this this whole self-driving thing's gonna be here before you know it
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.480]   Do you do you welcome or do you do you worry?
[00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:16.680]   What do you hope it is? I owe we got a car under every seat
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:23.000]   Over like every seat is a car you walk into the exactly you instantly know you're going away with a car
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:29.320]   Like it'd be it'd be even more awesome if they had little jetpacks underneath that you could just fly around with them
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.360]   like
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.360]   It's like who dove over your head and
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:35.240]   that's that's uh
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:40.920]   Alphabet 2050 that's that's the way is away. I feel like 2035. Okay, I mean
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:46.680]   2050 i'm not sure if we're all gonna even be here. So we might as well get our flying cars before that's true
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:49.640]   Uh, that's true. That's true
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:56.680]   Um, yeah, I'm always oh, sorry. I was gonna say I'm pro self-driving cars. I'm like bring it. I can't wait. Yeah
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.400]   Yeah, I'm looking forward to it too
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.360]   Um
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:04.280]   I keep I keep hoping that at google.io. I know it's probably a long shot
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:08.280]   Well, and definitely now because I think google or alphabet is distancing itself
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:14.520]   Uh publicly from from its boston dynamics investment. I keep hoping that one day at google.io. We're gonna
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:18.360]   Have the chance to interact with a boston dynamics robot
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:20.280]   Oh
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:25.000]   What were they? Oh, they have sold or haven't sold. I don't think they've sold yet. They've they have not
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.600]   They've said that they wanted to apparently there are no buyers
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:34.280]   Cause they're evil wait at google or the robots the robots
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:37.480]   Those robots
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:43.480]   I know I have I have seen big dog in person. Oh seriously? Oh, yeah big dog is scary is
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.880]   Yeah, he's scary
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:49.880]   Like he was not moving but like it's a big robot and it
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:56.600]   Can you imagine that walking out on stage? Oh, that'd be the best thing on earth. Oh, can you imagine?
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.960]   chasing
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:06.840]   Or maybe larry or syruga instead of like sky diving into the event they ride in on big dog
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:11.960]   Oh, there you go saying though last year larry and segory didn't weren't there, right?
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:18.760]   I don't recall that makes even more exciting. Come on. It was just sundar. I think yeah, it was it was just sundar
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:24.280]   They're busy. No, not not that not that's not that's just sundar. Don't mean to say that it was sundar alone
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.920]   Right, right exactly. Yeah
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:29.560]   Uh, yeah, they're they're too busy working on their flying cars
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:34.280]   Basically and running from robots. That's apparently like comic relief
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:40.280]   Apparently so uh any any other google news in here. I'm looking I think youtube
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:43.160]   Oh, yeah, youtube. Yes
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:47.960]   Every tech company has decided they must be an entertainment company. So I thought
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:54.920]   Where's microsoft though? Cause in facebook what's I guess facebook? Well, they went in on vr, but that didn't work out. So
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:59.640]   No facebook has something to so first so yes, so first of all youtube
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:03.240]   Uh bloomberg had said the alphabet is going to announce
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.080]   an investment in
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:10.440]   They say hundreds of millions of dollars more than 40 original movies and tv shows starring
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:16.840]   Well-known stars like ellen de generous katie perry in different shows. These aren't youtube red
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:24.280]   Style like this isn't youtube red content. Although they are still planning to support youtube red youtube red of course is the paid
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.400]   Service and they have exclusives to just youtube red. This isn't a part of that. This is free
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:32.040]   ad supported content with big name
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.080]   Part of the reason for that part of the benefit for that part that way
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:39.880]   Is that with uh havas and the guardian and the bbc having walked away from youtube?
[01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.440]   Some advertisers are coming back now, but uh youtube meet needs more
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:47.480]   Uh safe content on which what it's ads
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:49.800]   Oh
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.800]   Oh, that's smart jeff. Okay
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:56.760]   I believe you so I think it's a motive so so you know we've leo where he here
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.840]   uh
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:03.800]   You know he would argue that google is in the content business and I said no no no they don't own any content
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.040]   They're not doing any content on youtube. They're just platform. Well
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:14.120]   So I think this is going to be this also raises a few interesting difficult things where google does really start to become a content company
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:20.600]   Right like if i'm searching for ellen do I get the most newsworthy item or do I get her show on youtube?
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:26.840]   Right, right. Well, and they're all venturing into this space like touching on what you were talking about a few minutes ago stacey
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.760]   Facebook
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.120]   Also has their own kind of slate of premium
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:37.560]   Shows that they're working on uh, sources told business insider facebook
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:47.160]   Is working to launch its own original content offering sometime next month even two tiers of content mark key tier for like longer big budget
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:55.320]   Shows and then a lower tier that's for shorter inexpensive shows five to ten minutes refresh every 24 hours that sort of thing
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:00.680]   Uh, so they're all kind of walking this weird line of going moving from platform
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:05.560]   You know into kind of the content business there there just must be
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:09.960]   I don't know there must be a lot of money to be made from advertisers
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:15.400]   willing to advertise on content that they can control I hadn't even considered that aspect jeff as far as
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.880]   Making sure that they have high profile content that advertisers feel safe
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:23.880]   Uh putting their ads on because that's a big issue right now, especially on youtube
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:30.200]   But I guess also on facebook and the money will go straight to youtube rather than to outside
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:33.560]   The problem is i'll be a vidcon in in june
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:38.120]   And i'm gonna imagine there's gonna be a lot of youtube creators there who are really nervous now because
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:42.920]   If they're a little bit edgy or if they're not big enough to be kind of guaranteed safe
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.560]   uh advertisers
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:47.560]   Google acting on behalf advertisers
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.920]   behalf
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:55.240]   Will not place ads or replace fewer ads on their stuff and and and so that's uh the problem with that of course is that it uh,
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:03:02.120]   Depresses the uh innovation and creation of fresh new voices and content and diversity of voices
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.480]   So this is what fake news hath rot
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:12.120]   Oh fake news did you see that google is planning a
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.120]   12 acre high-tech city and I think it's moron
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.720]   Interonto
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:26.360]   I saw I saw the headline and I did not I want to move now. I know this is this is larry's island
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:33.400]   Remember river bio a few years ago when larry was gonna. Why don't you write? Okay now. I remember yes
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.160]   Yes, so it's actually on lake ontario. So maybe it is larry's island
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:42.040]   I know so yeah, it's sidewalks labs effort to build a smart city
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.280]   It's a really cool city to be a pilot platform?
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:51.560]   I mean this is kind of cool, but it it it's also kind of it's cool because it's so googly and they're like, yeah
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:55.480]   I see nothing wrong with developing a little tiny city, right?
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:04:03.400]   But it's also imminently impractical unless like we have giant earthquakes or fires that take down our city infrastructure. So maybe they should do
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:10.840]   Work and focus on different technology. I don't know or maybe they're thinking about places like to buy in china, which are like screw it
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.840]   I don't know where I don't know
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:19.480]   Details of the proposal. Let's see here 12 acres strip in downtown toronto
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.600]   and
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:29.640]   Yeah, I mean this is absolutely it ties into kind of what what they were talking about a few years ago making this high
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:35.800]   Highly technological city. I mean, okay. So link NYC. That's that's through new york
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.480]   New York City. That's that's the Wi-Fi kiosks, right? That would be part of this plan, right? What what else?
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:45.000]   What else would happen in the in google? Oh, I think smart buildings
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.040]   I've been smart buses
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.760]   Okay
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.760]   Well or self-driving
[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.760]   right people movers
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:05:00.680]   In that 12-acre space, right? Well, so not just for transport but also as information gathering devices
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.280]   so
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:06.120]   both to understand real-time traffic patterns or even
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.680]   pedestrian patterns weather
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:15.880]   State of the streets all of that can be garnered gathered through buses running around actually
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.560]   Robotic food delivery
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:25.080]   So and so crazy and of course smart streetlights
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:30.680]   Because you can't be a smart city without smart streetlights. How are they smart?
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:39.000]   Uh, just smart about these streetlights an LED with a bunch of sensors in and then you've got software that grabs the data and does stuff with it like
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:47.800]   Hey, there's a lot of people around we should make the LEDs brighter. So we can light the crowd. It's called dynamic street lighting. Oh
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:52.760]   Oh, yeah, it exists in like cool. I've not heard of that
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:55.480]   Oh, yeah, that's a good idea
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:59.080]   Well, there you go. That's that's something they do to Toronto
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:04.040]   Well, I don't know if they do it in Toronto, but they they do it in like Europe and I think
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:10.600]   San Diego may have a pilot project for dynamic streetlight if you google dynamic street lighting you're gonna find lots of places
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.160]   nice
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.160]   Uh, that is cool
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.200]   Um
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.880]   Okay
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.640]   I have something very fancy here. So I so we've been doing the show about an hour now
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:25.400]   Which means I have lived an hour of my life using
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.280]   the samsung decks
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:32.600]   Which I have right here. It's this little hockey puck looking thing with all sorts of cables
[01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:34.200]   Oh
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:35.800]   a lot of wires
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:40.840]   This is uh, so so I have the samsung galaxy s8 plus which is a very big phone by the way
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.560]   I've been using it for the last couple of weeks very nice
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:46.040]   I have my issues with it, but for the most part I like it
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:53.000]   But the new samsung devices are compatible with this hardware hockey puck down here called the samsung decks
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.840]   I think it's $150. I believe if you want to buy one
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:02.440]   And basically the whole idea here is that it turns the phone you already have
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.720]   Into a desktop computing environment
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:12.920]   Uh, you know, it's coming hdmi out to the monitor. I've got my keyboard my old school keyboard here on the desk
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:15.800]   Uh, my mouse my my wired mouse
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:21.400]   Ethernet can plug into here. Although I'm using you know the the wireless internet through my phone
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:25.400]   Already I plug it in here and then karson. I think you have the video feed
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:30.200]   And I'm I've been running the show so far off of samsung decks
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:34.120]   So you can see here's my dock with with all my little fancy notes and everything
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:38.200]   I'll go ahead minimize this and you can see the uh, the desktop
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:43.080]   Environment that and this is all being run off of the samsung galaxy s8 plus
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:50.520]   So the idea here is that you have a computer with you at all time. Maybe this is perfect for the uh, you know, the road warrior
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:57.880]   Um, I don't I don't know if it's perfect for me necessarily, but I think a lot of people want to see this sort of category
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:03.960]   Work where you know, maybe it's the future that you that we just use our phones as our computer
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:06.840]   And I got a safe in an hour's worth of using it
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:12.200]   I'm pretty impressed like they've done samsung has done a pretty pretty decent job
[01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:18.520]   Of jumping into a desktop environment and having things move pretty fluidly as you saw with the browser
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:23.880]   This is samsung's internet browser. I mean it pulls up the desktop version
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:28.040]   Of of google docs if I was to pull this up on my mobile device
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.800]   The mobile version would normally appear and it would be a lot different
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:36.440]   Uh, then what you see here. This is what I would get on my chrome book pixel if I was to pull up the site
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:41.480]   Some things don't necessarily work like normally I should be able to hover over this field that has a node in it
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:44.040]   And have that node appear and a little pop-up window
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:47.480]   Which is how I like to do things with it with the shows and everything
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:52.280]   The only way I can figure out how to do that is to insert node and there's my notes for that particular story
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:59.640]   Um, so I'm sure there are little things like that's considering especially that decks only launched a couple of days ago and reviews hit yesterday
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:05.240]   Uh, but it's an interesting piece of kit nonetheless and we've seen a lot of
[01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:11.160]   A lot of uh, I don't know a lot of oem's or at least a decent amount of them including microsoft
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:16.840]   Try and pull this off the verge had a had a review of the samsung decks and they basically say
[01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:22.600]   That uh, this is you know, not that not that continuum is amazing
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:28.520]   But this is better than continuum for the most part. This is definitely ahead of microsoft's continuum
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.080]   Uh in in a lot of ways
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:36.600]   Uh saying it's the best version of this that we've seen yet a good a good proof of concept
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:42.920]   Jeff, I'm curious to ask you because I know you I consider at least in my brain. I consider you a road warrior of sorts
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.280]   you have
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.120]   you you have
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:53.000]   Reasons why you prefer the chrome book pixel over other here's my here's my million mile certificate. I just got
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.880]   Oh, congratulations
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.160]   Then yeah
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:00.200]   Then I think my road warrior probably applies. Yes
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:08.440]   Um, is this does this fill avoid in in your life? Like is this is this a solution to a problem that you've ever had the decks? Yeah
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.400]   well, okay, so
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:17.720]   I ordered that other thing we talked about a couple weeks ago, which you put your android phone on and it has a little kind of laptop
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.720]   But it makes the laptop work. Oh
[01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:25.080]   What is that? Oh, you know, oh, yeah, I thought I tried to cancel it and
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:29.880]   That's what I do and they said I couldn't uh, it's called the
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:37.480]   Uh sentio. Oh, I did not hear about this. Uh, oh mr. Android. You look at this
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:42.280]   I'm not was it a kick. It was a kickstarter or an indigo go. I think so. Yeah. Yeah, so
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:46.360]   Little warned me. Okay. So you you you hook up right you hook up your
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:49.240]   phone and
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:54.600]   The device is dumb except that it it so it's it's decks but mobile
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:11:05.480]   So okay, so instead of instead of decks like decks is firmly entrenched in the idea that it is to be a desktop
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.120]   Environment, yeah, I have a monitor
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:14.280]   Monitoring after all that so it's decks is not really mobile to me at all. Right. I know the office and use my phone
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.520]   Whereas this thing is mobile
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:18.520]   So
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.920]   I thought okay when I travel uh now I carry the pixel c
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.440]   What if I carry this and my phone is everything everything
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:31.080]   So I thought oh, it's not a bad idea except today in today's news
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:36.120]   This is what I'm mad about. This is what I'm angry about. This is what i'm disgusted about
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:41.400]   This is what I'm having to fit about beyond the fact that our democracy is falling department. We'll leave that aside
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:45.800]   So reports are that us officials are going to ban
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.880]   laptops
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:50.760]   Tablets and such on European flights now
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:53.640]   Wow, really
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.640]   Yeah, it's on the rundown
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:00.600]   Under other and this is extremely upsetting. So I wouldn't even be able to carry on the centium
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:08.040]   I hadn't even heard about that. You know, or you'd have to check the centium to check your laptop. You can't check your laptop
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:12.200]   That's awful. They're gonna get broken exactly exactly Stacy
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:17.800]   Exactly they tell you not to check your laptop when they make you check your bag if you have to gate check it
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.360]   Exactly
[01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.720]   Oh
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:27.160]   This is bad. This is really bad. My my real theory of this is this is american isolationism
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:32.680]   This is this is putting this is sort of putting up a wall of mexico. This is a laptop wall with the world
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:38.760]   Uh the amount of money that's going to be lost in travel both ways europeans coming here
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.840]   Middle East people coming here and us going there is going to be huge
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:47.400]   It makes imagine trying to go. I'm supposed to go to australia 24 hours flying
[01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:51.160]   Australia isn't in euro
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:55.000]   Well, I think they're gonna do it the rest of the world. I'm saying. Oh, okay. I'm like like jeff
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.800]   I have good news
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.640]   It's further
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.760]   Yeah
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:06.680]   The good news is you might be okay on that trip to australia the next trip in australia might not be so lucky
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:09.960]   So so my plan was I thought the centiio if it worked. Yeah
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:16.280]   Was that my phone carries everything? So right now I have you know, I have movies on my
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.760]   pixel c
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.800]   Or shows actually and then I have all my stuff on my phone
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.720]   So I thought okay, I'll just carry the phone. It'll be everything like he's a centiio
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.080]   But not now hmm
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:31.000]   Um
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.120]   So the pixel c is a convertible. How does that factor into this laptop rule? I'm
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:42.920]   I'm sure I don't think you can take tablets either. Okay. All right. Well, you can have a phone which I you know, I saw you
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.920]   I watched movies on the phone
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:49.000]   Yeah, man
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   And then I was gonna think okay, I can carry a
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:55.400]   Keyboard no, I'm told somebody's the batteries and keyboards were kicked off
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.360]   a middle-ish from flight
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:02.040]   Problem is we're no way you could work to it on airplanes. There's no way you can work
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.360]   So you think you saw angry people on planes before
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.760]   Oh
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.480]   Angry board and bitter people on planes
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:12.840]   What did we do before laptops and tablets on planes?
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.560]   We got angry
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:21.880]   We shopped we got drunk is what we did. Yes, that's true. We drank ourselves to sleep basically
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:26.040]   I'll wake up on the other side. That's how I get and we used to smoke
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:30.520]   I remember traveling as a very young child on planes where people would smoke so you know
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.040]   Actually, it sounds very
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:40.920]   British Airways had the stupidest system. I remember there was rather than being uh forward, you know, smoking back non-smoking whatever after
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:44.760]   It was right hand side was smoking left hand side was non-smoke
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:46.920]   I
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:52.040]   That makes a lot of sense. There was no no long curtain that split the no now. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.680]   I spit in your eye. Wow, that it's awesome
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:15:03.480]   So so the so the watchful call there that your your your device would make sense to me
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:07.880]   if you had wrote if you had a hotel in offices
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:11.720]   and
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.280]   You could just put your thing in right in an office that makes sense
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:20.360]   I don't see a huge need for that. The city was more interesting to me
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:29.080]   Yeah, you you touch on kind of my thoughts around the decks before having played with it
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:34.920]   Particularly now that I played with it. I like I get it a little bit more. I still don't understand why I would need it
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.680]   but I think
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.960]   Picking is bro
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:44.120]   Pagging it in the in the realm of this is good for people who travel a lot and they want to bring their desktop environment with them
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:48.360]   That never worked for me in my in my way of thinking because
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:55.560]   There's so many components to make that possible and just the idea of bringing a monitor with you or securing a monitor
[01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:59.400]   Wherever you happen to go seems like a challenge in and of itself let alone
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:03.160]   I mean you can make a keyboard portable and obviously a mouse isn't really that big
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:09.080]   I mean, it's more portable than putting a Mac Pro in my bag. I guess but
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:14.680]   Yeah, or like a big a full full-size windows pc in my bag
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:17.400]   But but I don't know how that fixes anything
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:21.960]   It still seems like a lot of inconvenient steps and I don't know what the payoff is necessarily
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.240]   So
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.880]   How much does it cost? I think it's 150 dollars
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:34.840]   $150 only for the galaxy s8 and s8 plus if i'm not mistaken
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.640]   um
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.120]   So, you know, you've got to really want this
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.880]   Style of a device and i'm sure there are people out there that this is
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:49.640]   Answering their back they're answering their with their biggest wishes, you know, and they're like finally a limited number
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.040]   Uh, but I don't think it's a lot
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:56.200]   No, I don't like to say either because you've got to plug in your keyboard. You've got up. Yeah
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:00.680]   Plug in your mouse it because presumably
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:06.520]   Did you guys ever use docs back in the day lap laptop docs? I had a doc once
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:12.280]   Then what was yeah once yeah once very briefly
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:18.440]   I don't know laptop doc doc for what you still you're so young
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:24.840]   Back of the day my son we carried these big eight pound laptops
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.840]   Yeah, we got the office you would
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:33.480]   Oh, you would plug it in the whole thing would plug it at once to your monitor and the keyboard and everything else yes
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:35.640]   Okay, I know what you're talking about
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:38.120]   I was like, what are you what are you docking into your laptop?
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.000]   But it's the other way around your laptop is docking into something else
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.080]   Um
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:46.360]   Yes, I've definitely seen those before I never had one and never used one
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.880]   But but I don't think I ever had those old school laptops either
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:52.360]   So that that is definitely back in the day
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:57.800]   My first laptop was one of those and holy cow as a journalism student
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:04.520]   I was like carton that thing all over the place. It was so expensive so cumbersome, but darn it
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:10.200]   I was mobile if yeah, it came with you. It was portable in their quotes
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:14.200]   Yeah more portable than the off the other options
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.880]   It's not the divots in my shoulders from my backpack
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:26.600]   All right, uh, let's take a break. Thank uh, thank the sponsor and then we'll come back and we'll do tips and tricks and
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.880]   Unless there's anything that we tricks tricks. I like that. No, no, okay. Okay, right? Right? Right?
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.600]   Sophie has to come back. Yes, and we have tips
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.080]   and tricks
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.960]   I don't have treats up here. I can't really stay

[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:59.480]   She's not gonna perform. Don't worry. She just won't perform. All right. All right. All right
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:02.600]   Okay, well
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.000]   While Stacy goes and gets her

[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.600]   Five five
[01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.520]   Not quite a pup but pretty young touch oh here touch
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:37.240]   good girl
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:39.240]   All right, such
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:44.840]   Good girl. She's like this is this is why I lasted so long through this podcast says Sophie
[01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:48.840]   So she will not as a dog person. I'm a dog person my wife's a cat person
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:54.840]   We had the debate my wife would wake up the kids on a cold rainy miserable morning and say if you had a dog
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.480]   You'd have to walk it now and pick up his poop
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:01.560]   And she yeah, she won
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:07.400]   I love the cats. I love the cat. I can't do a cat. I'm really allergic to cats. Oh
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:10.680]   So I'm kind of locked into a dog
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.080]   there there
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:16.040]   Mostly good. She barks a lot. Yeah
[01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:19.400]   When she gets going you'll be like oh
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.200]   I grew up with it. I grew up with dogs
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:26.680]   And as a kid so it's very fond of dogs, you know all through my childhood
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:29.880]   We had at least one if not two or three dogs run around the house
[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:33.320]   So it's been a long time come and I've really wanted to get a dog again
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:36.760]   I would I would get a cat if I didn't sneeze every single time I was near them
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:43.640]   And I think my one of my daughters is also has inherited my allergy to cats. So I don't think that's gonna work
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:46.120]   Unfortunately
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:49.720]   Thank you, Sophie. Thank you for the tricks and the and the treats
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:54.440]   I'm sure she thanks you for the treats. That was one of my better ideas in the entirety of the history of twigs
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:59.480]   mistake. I'm happy. I don't know about the audio listeners, but I'm happy
[01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:04.440]   Jason your best idea was losing your identity. That was your best idea you've ever had that
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:07.480]   Learned a lot of lessons
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.000]   Throughout that
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.240]   There was even a story today about two factor about how the SMS two factor was uh
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:19.160]   Was manipulated let's say to allow someone to steal a bunch of money from a German bank
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:21.960]   Whoa, there's that
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:27.560]   To which I I wish that all you know sites and banks and whatever would move to the app
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:30.680]   Method instead of relying on SMS, but I realize
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:35.720]   That perfect security you know good security is is better than no security also
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:43.480]   but yes the sss7 flaw and uh it actually requires a lot of manipulation in order to have pulled this off
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.880]   This is a this was a flaw for a very long time
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:52.600]   It was known that it was a potential flaw that could be uh manipulated by someone who could get access and
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:57.960]   Intercept the two factor authentication codes in order to get in and apparently that's what happened
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.520]   They were able to intercept it via SMS
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:08.440]   Uh, no, I guess a bank makes for a good target. Yeah. Yeah, I mean you wouldn't maybe work really hard for something lame
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:12.200]   But getting into a bank. No, I mean it required the hacker to
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:18.280]   lure their victims with malware, of course capture the account number id password and then
[01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:20.840]   Work their way into the actual
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:25.640]   Network the sss7 network, which I think requires
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.240]   um
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:33.160]   Them to have access to the just a deeper level access to the cell network from from the inside potentially
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:38.120]   Uh in order to intercept those codes so you'd have to go through a lot of work as as they did
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.240]   But they proved that it was possible and people have been warning about this for years
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:46.680]   So there you go, but I guess the flip side of that is they've been warning about it for years
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:53.320]   And it's never happened because it's so difficult so two factor authentication with SMS codes is better than no two factor authentication
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.560]   so
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:04.520]   Anywho, uh, so jeff you have a number or uh, yeah, I actually have two of them. So um
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:08.120]   Snap snap as it's now known
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:12.840]   uh, released its first or earnings as a public company
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:15.240]   it's uh
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:16.600]   In a disappointing
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:22.920]   166 million daily users versus versus more than a billion for example for what's app and um
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:29.160]   a growth rate of 5 percent and uh
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:38.120]   You're over your growth rate continue to slip falling to 36 percent year over year from 48 percent in q4 shares fell more than a quarter
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.440]   Or almost a quarter 24 percent
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:43.480]   Meanwhile so that good. Who does that get blamed on?
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:49.240]   Instagram Facebook. Yeah. Yeah, so then uh Yelp
[01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:55.080]   Also announced disastrous results as CNBC and lost one fifth of its value
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:58.280]   And and so who gets blamed for that?
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:02.040]   Facebook google google
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:09.160]   Yelp's founder always say you failed the quiz. She's they say no treat for us. They see no treat for you
[01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:12.200]   But
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:17.400]   You're gonna have to uh roll over to get a treat now
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:19.080]   um
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:20.680]   so uh
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:23.720]   I yeah, I could just see so so Yelp constantly complains about google
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:29.880]   They they go after google in europe all the time as kind of an ally of google of european saying google is big bad and awful
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:36.440]   And uh snap is not happy. So it's it's the giants are having you know demonstrable impact
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:41.480]   On these competitors and I suspect there'll be some more whining about that
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:44.920]   And some more numbers and some more effects
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:48.440]   Um for other companies as a result. Yeah, the snap
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:54.360]   snap especially because I mean man even a year ago the the hype train was moving
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:58.200]   Very rapidly around snap and I feel like in the last couple of months
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:02.920]   There have been there's been a lot of silence around it just in the fact that instagram has
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:08.040]   I don't know they rolled out a lot of features and and regain recaptured people's
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:15.000]   Uh, imaginations and as a result, you know, I've I've actually talked to a lot of people just outside of the tech sphere
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.160]   But that that you snapchat that have been lured back into the into instagram
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:22.120]   uh because of those features and
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:25.080]   I don't know at one point. It really seemed like snapchat
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.720]   just as a service
[01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:31.080]   Had had captured magic and and really understood
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:37.640]   The market that it was appealing to and then instagram all instagram had to do was copy a few of the features
[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:44.920]   And that was enough to pull people back over that doesn't that doesn't bode well for snap, but so instagram has 700 million
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:48.440]   Uh users twitter has already users
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.960]   30. Yeah, it's like
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.120]   300. Yeah
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:58.040]   Twitter's 328 so yeah, I thought snapchat was was bigger by now
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:03.480]   What are they? They're still innovative. They're still doing neat stuff. They still have loyalty what they do
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:07.880]   They're still different for now, but 166 daily users
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:14.200]   Yeah, and it's slowing right. That's what you're saying. Well the growth is slowing right? Right?
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.920]   Um
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:22.600]   So that was the you know, they went public now and came out with a kind of a call like that
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000]   Rare or mmm
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.360]   Volatile and the early goans. Yeah, yeah
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.840]   Uh
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:38.200]   Stacey was was the the treat yours or do you have something else? I I actually have a thing if you guys want to see it that is not a dog
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.720]   Heck yeah
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.720]   Okay
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:44.840]   Like it won't be as cool, but you know speak stasis
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:50.760]   This is the notify doorbell cam from he Seneca
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:55.400]   And this is interesting to people because you don't have to wire it
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.520]   So this is the doorbell part that goes wherever your doorbell is right
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.840]   in this part
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:01.960]   as I
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.480]   unbox this
[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:05.000]   Is the camera?
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.280]   Pop this guy out
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:11.160]   So you screw this into your light bulb a light fixture. Usually you have a porch light by your doorbell
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:16.120]   And then you mount the camera up and the the light bulb powers the camera
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:24.360]   So your doorbell just sticks on there, right? And then it talks to or starry sticks where you want it to stick in this talks to everything
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.840]   So this is
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:28.840]   I'm being dense here stacey being dense
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:30.840]   the thing in your
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:32.840]   Right hand is that the camera?
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:36.200]   This is the camera. Yes. So the bulb is really just a bulb
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:41.000]   The bulb is a bulb. There's also a microphone in it. I don't know if you can see the the speaker
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:45.640]   Perforations right there, but there's a speaker right there. So what if it's inside one of those things?
[01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:49.320]   Most most things were in a fixture. They're not light bulbs on their own
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:56.280]   You mount the camera outside the fixture, but the microphone is inside the fixture. It is
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:02.440]   I'm going to install this today and I will report back. So this is something I haven't installed yet. I just
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:05.080]   Go ahead and do it. No
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:11.080]   I'm like, I am so glad I wore pants today because I've been running up and down
[01:32:11.080 --> 01:32:14.760]   And then here is the
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.800]   Is the doorbell chime?
[01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:21.400]   You'll plug this in and it'll it'll ring the doorbell
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:26.520]   Okay, so that is my
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:29.000]   She's just gonna do that eventually
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:33.720]   Someone's gonna come home and she's gonna go crazy and you guys are really gonna regret that she came back in
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:36.440]   I love heavens. You gotta have so few all the time
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:39.800]   So she doesn't have much longer. She's she's doing good
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:45.720]   So so the idea here is that you can turn any light bulb for the most part into a security device
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:48.200]   Outside of the front of your door
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:53.960]   With the doorbell, okay. Yes. It's a video doorbell that doesn't require you to wire in the doorbell stuff
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.120]   So if if wires scare you
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:33:00.840]   On the doorbell wires are not scary, you know, that's I've I have renewed
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:08.920]   Respect for this type of product category where it where it allows you to not worry about wires and in one of my dot in
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:12.600]   My daughter's bedroom. She has a light switch on her wall
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:17.640]   And it switches a very, you know, it switches one of the switches in the room
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:22.840]   But that's not the right switch for it to to actually toggle and we keep
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:28.840]   Meaning to you know bring out an electrician or whatever to to do whatever their magic is to do that
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:33.320]   But a you know that cost money and be it's inconvenient and see we it's just low priority
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:36.520]   But we have um we have the hue system at home
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:38.840]   And I realized that the hue switch
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:42.760]   Which has like an on off and then it has little dimmer buttons in between
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:48.520]   Like that allows you to go wireless. So I I got one of those kits with a hue bulb put it in her room
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:55.560]   Mounted that on the wall next to their other switch and it's like I didn't have to bring an electrician in and it only costs like
[01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:58.120]   $45 and done
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:03.240]   It's like the best thing in the world. It was like why didn't I think to do this sooner? This is awesome
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:09.080]   That is a fugly light switch, but yes, it is. It's not the it's not the most attractive light switch in the world
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:15.320]   But it's better because I mean she's she's four and she could never reach the light to turn it on or off
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:18.520]   Oh, that's a great use cane and so we're like well
[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:24.440]   This actually now she has the the power to do it herself if you tap it once it's full brightness if you tap it again
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:28.520]   It's like it's half brightness and the third time it's a nightlight. You gotta treat
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:31.400]   Right. So it pours out candy
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.360]   I
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.440]   That's the color she wants
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:39.880]   I would I would never put a candy dispenser my four-year-old daughter's prone
[01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:43.080]   That is that is basically clear here parent suicide
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:51.720]   Anyways, so I have new respect for for going around the electrical requirements of the home and just going wireless instead
[01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:54.200]   That's really there you go. I love it
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:57.400]   Mine is actually an announcement that google
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:01.480]   Showed off this morning. It's not revolutionary
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:08.360]   Necessarily, but it's it's an expansion of kind of what google's doing around its search as relates to events
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:11.080]   uh google basically says that they are
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.440]   um
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:17.880]   Now going to have a new part of of the site both in the app as well as on the google search
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:20.280]   Uh in in a browser
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:25.480]   That when it detects that you're searching for an event or if you put in a search query like events near me
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:33.320]   As a new kind of way of presenting to you thanks to you know, it's it's tied into like event bright ticket master meetup
[01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:36.520]   Vivid seats live nation a bunch of these other a stub hub
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:42.680]   As a new way to present to you in a very nice kind of graphical way a calendar of events
[01:35:42.680 --> 01:35:45.800]   So that you can that you know can easily find
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:46.920]   uh
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:53.480]   Events that are happening around you be it you know live performances or or or plays or whatever the case may be
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:59.800]   Google says, uh, it's there's you know, they're not taking any commissions on ticket sales or anything like that
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:02.120]   They're just putting a new kind of
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:07.160]   UI around what you get when you're searching for events so that because I mean if you do it right now
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:11.160]   It's actually pretty ugly what you get back you get a bunch of random broken kind of results
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:15.400]   This organizes things really neatly and then directs you through to the site
[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:19.960]   Uh to make your purchase through the site if you choose to do that so um
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:26.360]   You know anything that makes finding things to do a little bit easier. I saw that and I thought that that looks pretty great
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.360]   Facebook's been doing this for a while
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:30.360]   um been really involved in
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:36.920]   kind of managing events through pages and stuff so this is google kind of getting in on that a little bit more
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:40.040]   I kind of wish
[01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.960]   I don't often search for events
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:48.840]   But I love that like when spotify because it knows who i'm listening to it will let me know when those artists are performing in my neighborhood
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:56.760]   And that feels a little bit less a little bit more useful because it's so tied to what I like already
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:00.920]   So i'm kind of i'm trying to think of how often I guess as a parent
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:03.960]   Especially when I had really like when my daughter was four
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:06.840]   God, all I wanted to do was get out of the house. So
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:12.200]   Events near me anything. Yes. Yes, please show me something to do
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:13.720]   Please help me
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:18.360]   Affirmally that doesn't cost very much money. Oh, yeah at a certain point. I just gave up
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.160]   I'll link money at it whatever
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.760]   um
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:24.920]   But I wonder like
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:27.400]   I guess I'm curious how useful that would be
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:30.360]   Is is I guess or how?
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:33.080]   How often I would use something like that. I'm just kind of thinking
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:35.560]   Yeah, I mean, yeah
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:38.920]   Knowing that it exists. I suppose I would use use it with intent
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:45.400]   But really like I I think of you know my history of searching for oh, I heard this this band's coming to town or whatever
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:48.520]   I put it into google and the results that I've gotten
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:52.920]   Sometimes you have to go three four five deep before you finally refined the ticket master link
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:56.280]   Which is where you actually buy tickets or whatever and I don't know
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:59.400]   It's just a I don't know if I necessarily would intentionally go
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:03.080]   Google does events really well, so I'm going there right now to do this search
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:07.720]   I would do that search there anyways. It's just now i'm getting a better a better format
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:15.000]   Um of results that hit me back so that I find quicker, you know, so that it's easier for my I don't know easier for me to discern
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.400]   What I'm actually looking at because sometimes those results can be kind of confusing filled
[01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:23.800]   Filled with a bunch of things that are like resellers as opposed to yeah the actual event
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:29.240]   Venue selling the ticket so sweet Stacy when I when I was on newspaper online sites
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:34.120]   Working on those everybody would come with a bright idea and say I know what people want
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:37.160]   they want to know listings of entertainment stuff and
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:40.920]   So we dutifully built those things and then hardly ever gotten the usage
[01:38:41.640 --> 01:38:45.560]   Because you don't use it every night you only use it when you're going out, right?
[01:38:45.560 --> 01:38:48.040]   So you're right. I'm the usage is not
[01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:52.040]   Frequent so it's hard to imagine somebody gets in the habit of using it then
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:57.480]   You know when it is an occasional thing unless you are really young and really hip which
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:00.360]   Which is all of us. Oh
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:08.440]   Okay, I'm sorry Jason. No, I I figured we're all in the young and hip category. Come on. Just live it
[01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:12.120]   Just allow it to happen live in my dream. Yes
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:18.920]   Oh, hey reminder to everybody. Yeah, mother's day is this weekend. So if you have a
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:24.840]   mother figures special lady in your life random other person that you think is awesome and helped raise you
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:33.000]   Send my card or a text or probably a car or flowers a card and text
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.480]   I who take gadgets
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:41.480]   Give them a device that allows them to peer into your home at at any time
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:44.280]   Via
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:47.640]   Okay
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:49.800]   Someone just put in a google thing for mother's day
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:54.280]   What's that google photos get some other day movie features? Here's how to make one
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:57.560]   Oh
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:00.040]   I haven't looked at
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:04.200]   I'm sure i'm sure because you can go into google photos and assign a face to
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:07.960]   A person i'm sure it's the kind of thing where you tell it. Oh, right?
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:12.840]   This is me and the amazing, you know when you get down to it. Yeah, that is really cool that they can do stuff like that
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:18.520]   I don't know if I do my mom would be freaked out. She'd be like, oh, you told google who I am
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:21.880]   I'd be like, oh, sorry
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:24.840]   I'm gonna delete the video file and it'll all go away
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:27.800]   Google won't know who I am anymore
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:29.880]   I'm sorry jeff you were saying something and I
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.200]   No, I'm I know i'm
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:34.600]   Obsessing on sofi because I want a dog
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.680]   um
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:39.960]   Have you ever wired sofi up with any internet of things things?
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:42.600]   Uh-huh she had a whistle for a while
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.760]   Uh, it's an activity tracker
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:50.200]   But it was only it was only useful in that it told us that she sleeps under the bed for 20 hours a day, which we knew
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:59.160]   But it told you what 20 hours of the day, right? There's got to be something useful around that information
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:06.040]   Well, so my my default because sofi used to be an escape artist because she is I don't know what she is
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:08.040]   She's a mutt. We got her from her rescue
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:10.040]   um and she
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:12.200]   would creep through our back fence like
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:18.040]   Just we our back fence used to look like a war zone with like chicken wire up and just everything
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:23.240]   We were trying we spent thousands of dollars reinforcing and Donald Trump should learn things from you about how to build walls you're saying
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:26.040]   Exactly or offense fence wall
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:30.760]   So I would she has a dog door downstairs
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:35.160]   So I would put a motion sensor in any outdoor camera. I was testing I would face
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:40.120]   To the fence line. So when she went out the dog door it would trigger
[01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:42.760]   the camera and then
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:48.280]   We could record and see how she was getting out because then we could reinforce that area of the fence
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:54.840]   So there you go scooter accent chat says that sofi needs a fit bark
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:57.880]   A fit bark that's like the whistle isn't it?
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:41:59.800]   It must be it must be
[01:41:59.800 --> 01:42:04.040]   I think this one has a I know this guy. It used to have a subscription
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:07.480]   Oh the deep actual insights
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:13.320]   I don't think you're getting any audio from this because the audio is playing through my phone
[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:16.760]   So that's interesting about decks. It doesn't pass the audio through, but I guess it's just
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:19.960]   Yeah, oh that's interesting
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:22.200]   Uh, okay
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:24.200]   Well, oh look at how cute those dogs are
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:26.760]   huge
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:30.680]   And they're very fit apparently they've reached seven of seven goals
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:33.400]   You can set goals for your dog
[01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:36.040]   Oh boy
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:42.280]   Just world we live in where we're tracking all the the minutia of our of our daily lives. It's craziness
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:49.560]   My my dog does not she she's not a fan like I put a tracker on her. Yeah, and she um tried to chew it off. So
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:52.200]   She's not yeah
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:54.200]   Not a fan of being tracked
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:55.480]   24 hours a day
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:59.320]   She's she's not she she knows that I'm trying to thwart her escape. She always comes back
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:05.480]   So, you know, it's just I worry because we've got you know animals that live out here. So yeah, yeah, gotta be worried
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:06.920]   Yeah
