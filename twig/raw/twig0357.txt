[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.700]   Stacey Higginbotham is here as she has been now for the last few weeks and I was checking in with you Stacey you still like doing the show
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.700]   I do I realized I need to get on your IRC channel I need to get a name I am on chat but oh that's good
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.700]   As soon as you have a name register it and then tell the mods and then that way you will be the only whatever Stacey on IOT is always good
[00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.700]   You could do that that's what you're there we go. I am the only Stacey on IOT. Yeah, it always looks like on riot like you're rioting
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.700]   Well, that's better than idiot, which is what other people have told me so I'll take it. No, she's rioting
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.700]   Hey, look who else is here from e3 of all things Mike Elgin is back in the country
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.700]   That's right the United States of America. Do you have to come back like a certain number of days a year or something?
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:48.700]   Not really. I have to leave other countries because of various requirements one of the which is shingen in Europe where three months in any of those countries
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.700]   You have to leave all of those countries that's okay. U.S. doesn't really care about that stuff
[00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.700]   You can go abroad for two years and they don't know. Yeah, cuz as long as they get your taxes they don't care about that
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.700]   That's right. That's exactly right. There's no issue on residency. Just keep paying us taxes. That's all we can do right?
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:12.700]   That's right. Anyway, welcome. Welcome back. You first time in e3. I'm not a big gamer guy, but I was in LA. I've already planned to be in LA and I thought I'd
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.700]   Check out the show is a lot of fun. And of course
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.700]   Virtual reality is just the hottest thing they're just about for the attendees. I think some of the games of the
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.700]   You know the hotly anticipated games are important, but for me, it's all the VR
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.700]   It's you know, you always hear that VR is not going to be just a gamer thing
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.700]   Well, don't tell the e3 people because they're doing some really amazing things with VR there. I think in some ways
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.700]   Really VR is where gaming is where VR shines the best. We haven't yet
[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.700]   Got the technology to do augmented reality, which would be the more useful for business and for user interface
[00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.700]   And you know, I don't know if immersive is that interesting unless you're in interactively engaged as in a game
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.700]   So I think it's really is for gaming. It's okay
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.700]   Yeah simulations in education, but yeah, have you seen anybody do that yet?
[00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.700]   Simulations? Yeah, Air Force? No. Um, well the Air Force you're right. Actually good point. Okay. I take it back.
[00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.700]   I read about a medical
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.700]   Service, but I can't I'll look for it and see if I can find it doing like doctor training in VR
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.420]   Yeah, I was just gonna say that one big application that people aren't prepared for in VR is
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.420]   Social socializing, but that would require connection and if Skype's in any
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.660]   Any indication of how good the connections are going to be then never mind
[00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.260]   I have the people who have tried because you can't really do it right now, but I
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:49.520]   Want to say that Oculus has a social network where you it this is coming someday where you could be in the same
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.220]   Space with another Oculus Rift user and the people have tried that say it's really cool like throwing a ball even throwing a ball back and forth
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.780]   Right. Well, you know one thing I do definitely want to say about the general realm of VR
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.020]   augmented reality and so on and I was heavily persuaded by Kevin on this point
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:15.180]   Which is that up until now from the dawn of the computing revolution until now computing and then later the internet has all
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.740]   information and
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.380]   We're entering into this new long era era where computers and the internet are all about
[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.340]   Experiences instead of information. It's a subtle difference, but it's a big one and VR is gonna have a huge
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.520]   Impact on that for example, we're always talking about you know
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.380]   Do you have to travel for business? Do you travel to go to a trade show or whatever?
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:43.140]   Well, you you often do and because you want the experience of meeting face to face the experience of being there in in real life and
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:49.380]   Increasingly the internet and VR and augmented reality will be delivering experiences of all kinds not just games
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.660]   Not just business meetings
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:56.500]   But any kind of experience you want to have and it will get to the point where information is less important and experiences are far more
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   And I thought that was a really interesting point by Kevin Kelly
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.460]   He's usually got a pretty good hand on all this stuff
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.340]   I don't know I'm flashing back to second life and
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.460]   The excitement we had about telecommuting yet. We still haven't changed our way as very much. So I
[00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.660]   I
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.900]   Think there are definitely benefits for this, but I don't know if we're gonna suddenly stop meeting people face to face
[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.060]   For professionals purposes or to sell things yeah
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.100]   I
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.780]   I'm put I'll be honest with you while I got really excited when we got our oculus rift and played with a lot and
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.100]   Then the vibe and played with a lot I
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.700]   noticed that
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:42.180]   The same thing has happening to me with VR that has happened with many other technologies that seemed cool and didn't end up being
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:47.180]   Didn't end up getting traction and I'd include Google Glass in this
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:53.660]   It I'm not convinced that VR is gonna be as big as everybody seems to think I think
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:59.380]   For one thing you spend a lot of time in it like more than half an hour you really get some negative
[00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.060]   effects not just nauseous
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.300]   nausea, but
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:10.300]   disorientation afterwards and things weird things happen you feel weird it isn't you know
[00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:16.620]   I think it's not fun for the long hauls kind of like 3d movies that it's cool at first and then but doesn't
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.660]   After two hours you kind of wish you hadn't well a couple of things on that Leo
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.620]   I think one of them is those are the problems that remain to be solved from a technology perspective
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:32.420]   There are many potential ways to increase the comfort level decrease the disorientation decrease nausea and all that kind of stuff
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.060]   And of course companies are working on it. The other one is that there's a whole world of more casual
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.500]   easier to swallow kinds of
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:46.980]   realities especially augmented reality of the kind that Magic Leap and HoloLens and others are working on and this is a I think this has a
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.900]   huge place and
[00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.540]   We're already seeing it kind of sort of with Google's Project Tango
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.460]   Which just released a series of videos demonstrating a very
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:03.900]   Palatable form of augmented reality of course which is where you're looking at a phone smartphone screen in the case of Tango potentially eventually a tablet
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.180]   but that's a very
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.100]   friendly form of
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:14.260]   Readjusted reality where you see things in the camera lens that you don't actually see in real life
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.860]   This and you can do that for hours without any disorientation tang. Yeah because it's
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.500]   Okay, you both you and Stacy if you believe in Tango, you're gonna have to convince me on there
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.500]   Here's the here's some of the video. This is a tango new kind of phone. This is the new Lenovo
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:36.420]   Phone it looks to me very much like augmented reality. We had augmented reality browsers on Android years ago
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:43.680]   Yeah, and they never went much anywhere. This is obviously it's an advertisement as your singer kids a kids got
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.820]   What I think is cool. He has set up
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.140]   Domino's you know one of those big domino
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:56.180]   Rube Goldberg machines and it's all it's so cool and now there's a kid going to a museum
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.500]   But for some reason during this all is he's not in the light. There's he's carrying a flashlight with him
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:05.900]   But I'm not trying videos are not very good. Okay. Thank you now. He's a school
[00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:10.220]   I don't really show and he's in the gym and he's shining a flashlight on
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:16.200]   So science project and I guess the idea okay, let me get out of this one because this is just this doesn't sell you
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.540]   All right, finally he's using tango. So now instead of
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:27.020]   Looking at a dinosaur he's looking at the dinosaur through a phone that he's holding up
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.100]   Or he's looking at his domino's through a phone
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:34.420]   Oh, I didn't even have to build it isn't that great. He could just walk down the stairs and pretend he builds it
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.900]   It feels like not an improved no
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.740]   It's a terrible video and I think you know the the benefit of tango
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:46.260]   We realize when artificial intelligence is applied
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:51.060]   Meaning that the imagery will identify the objects that it's scanning as they're scanning
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:56.660]   So instead of a surface that drops off at the edge. Oh, that's a that's a table right kind of like the hollows table
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:03.100]   There's an under the exactly. Yeah, so the augmented reality apps that we had so far will project something that appears to be there
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.260]   But it doesn't know what it's projecting upon so with
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.900]   Project tango something can only sit on the table, but go behind the table
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.940]   I mean stay to the wind you prefer your kid builds the domino's or looks at it
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.220]   I would although so a are I
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.180]   Think it has certain applications
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.620]   I hate holding up a phone in front of me like the less I need to phone to mediate my world the better
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.540]   But you know again, I've seen stuff for like you think about it industrial
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:36.820]   Where you're like looking at like a complex part and you're showing this and saying oh hey
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.180]   This is this is what these are. This is the problem
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.740]   And you can see how to fix it. Well, here's an example. This is another one of the ads
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.220]   This is a mom and daughter planning her new bedroom. Oh
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:51.860]   Yeah, and that was yeah design is always a fun one. So here's yeah
[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:56.420]   I mean it's fun and I guess if you're planning a bedroom to be able to see the bed
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.380]   See the wall color see the paint. I
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:06.660]   Think it's a really cool commercial kind of application building Ikea furniture. Yeah, landing your bedroom
[00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.580]   I really don't want to see kids doing this with their domino's though
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.500]   I mean this is like and this dad by the way this dad is annoying. This is like
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:24.060]   Creepy dad dad get off your phone. Do your kids do this to you Stacy or your husband get off the phone and pay attention
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.060]   We're in the real world
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:33.580]   No, no, although you know what this is like I like it's it. No my kids used to do that all the time get off your blackberry dad
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:40.940]   Did you ever play any of those games that came with the sphero? Yeah free again? This is exactly like that. Yeah
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.580]   For about a minute right well, no, I'm not saying again this I'm
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:51.980]   The place where this is most useful is industrial where you could send someone who's not well trained in something
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.340]   to like fix something
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:00.020]   Well, I mean the other thing is that everything that's happening on a smart phone screen
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:07.900]   I mean you're you're perceiving them, you know follow more is law into the future five years and this is going to be and not Google Glass type of clunky dorky
[00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:14.540]   Glasses but in glasses that look like regular glasses. I think that within within five years
[00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:21.100]   It'll be simply an option when you go to the optometrist office or go to sunglasses hot to get the smart version and they can
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:26.700]   They can drip into your eyeballs whatever it is you want to see and once you can wear glasses that look like
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:31.460]   socially acceptable glasses normal glasses and into those glasses you can beam
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:38.940]   Something like hollow lens where you see things that aren't there another another word for that is insanity, but anyway
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:44.900]   That's that's gonna be amazing because you'll be you know, it'll be super sci-fi-ish, you know
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:50.260]   it'll be like, you know, I'll be one your only hope and you'll see it nobody else will see or hear it and
[00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.220]   I think that will be very powerful. It's a visual form of
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:13:00.380]   Information that is not just words and not just static pictures
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:05.580]   But objects that appear in the in the 3d space that you're inhabiting you were joking about insanity Mike
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:10.820]   But actually that's one of the theories about why people are nauseated when they use VR is
[00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:19.580]   Because of a difference between the focal length and the and where your eyes are converging in other words your focus muscles are
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:26.380]   Saying your focusing muscles are saying something six feet away your eyes are converging at something just a few inches away
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.500]   Yeah, that disconnect tells our
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:37.100]   primitive mind something seriously wrong probably you ate some bad mushrooms and throw up now and
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.100]   That's a theory of course, but that's that's the theory behind
[00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:47.060]   VR nausea is that that you're there is a kind of insanity your mind says this is not right
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:53.860]   Something's not seriously wrong here and we'd have and that overcoming that is not a matter of improving frame rate
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:14:00.140]   Or reducing latency. It's it's kind of biological. So that's the other thing
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:05.980]   I still the jury's still out on that one as well. Yeah, right? I think Mike you might be living in the matrix in five years
[00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.820]   And I'm not sure I want to join you. Um, see now that I would do see if you said you said
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:16.180]   Second life if if you could jack in and be in that yeah
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.820]   Then I might do that wouldn't you want to do that Stacey?
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:22.940]   Um, no anything involving actual literal jacking it. I'm a little
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:30.300]   Drowned okay. Well the good news is that Elon Musk says we're already there. Well, I know that's a simulation
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:35.420]   So this would be a simulation inside the simulation the Elon ate some of those mushrooms. Yeah
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:41.140]   So Stacey this doesn't appeal to you particularly or it does I don't think it
[00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:45.260]   I think it's kind of crazy talk from a tech perspective because I mean if you
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:52.540]   Yes, things will get smaller, but the type of thing you're talking about we have to do much more to I mean
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:59.940]   Radios and antennas because this has to be connected to something right? So we have to get those smaller. We have to make them biologically
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.860]   Compatible with possibly our eyeballs
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:11.260]   We're talking about screens. So we've got to figure out like screen size and how to do that and I'm not saying we won't ever get there but
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.180]   I feel like Mike you're being really optimistic
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.140]   Thank you
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:26.460]   All I'm really doing is just if you you know the way that William Gibson always predicted so accurately the future back in the 80s
[00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:31.820]   Was he would he would read these obscure trade journals and find out where everything was going and we would see where all those things
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.620]   If you combine the future of everything you get a pretty accurate future and I think that
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:42.940]   The fact is that people love I I've been wearing bluetooth headphones a lot these days
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.940]   And I've been trying to channel my
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:51.820]   My sort of notifications and things like that to audio so I can hear it and just walking around having this
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:57.040]   World the world of the internet and the computer in the communication all that kind of stuff privately
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.540]   Whispering in my ear all the time. I think people are going to want that visually and if you follow Moore's law
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.160]   We're certainly going to have the the hardware and the software
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.700]   Moore's law hit a wall
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.300]   Maybe no by the way, there's a story that they're getting better all with everything
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:16.620]   about or gallium arse and i doping we may be able to crack that wall yet again
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.660]   So if we want to talk about doping I can go there
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:26.140]   I have an old chip reporter, but I don't think we really I'm gonna have to push that on the stack because there's about three different things coming up here
[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:31.100]   For me now that I do want to talk about what so let me say this that it's
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.700]   It is one thing for William Gibson. He's a storyteller
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:39.020]   So it's a wonderful thing for him to be able to tell stories that are credible futuristic stories
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:45.260]   But as a journalist, I always felt like my my job was to try these as a tech journalist or tech pundit
[00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:52.620]   My job was to try these new technologies and really try to suss out which ones were worth paying more attention to and which ones
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:17:00.620]   Were just gimmicks and and and I mean let's be honest the the odds are that most of them are gimmicks a lot of this stuff
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:06.060]   Just doesn't stick and I feel like while i'd love to be a cheerleader
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.100]   That's not exactly my job my job is to kind of
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:16.460]   Be a little brutal and say, you know, this isn't something that's going anywhere or this is something that's going and I and I admit
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.140]   I I'm torn on VR. I was very excited when I first started using it
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:25.260]   Yeah, but I'm concerned that there are some indicators. It may not be all that
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.580]   I think augmented reality is pretty cool
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:32.860]   And that's what you're describing Mike when you go and you get special glasses or even augmented reality doesn't have to be visual
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.020]   It's what you're talking about when you're using your bluetooth that's it
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.260]   Or when you have the mushrooms or the
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.900]   And i'm not that there's anything wrong with mushrooms
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.460]   Just wouldn't want to wear them all day
[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:49.340]   And the other thing that is interesting about virtual reality when you talk about multimedia where the nobody has said for 20 years
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.940]   Uh is the is the coming uh world of
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:57.980]   Earbuds that let you fine tune exactly what you hear and exactly what you don't hear
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:04.380]   And those will be not only piping in music and podcasts and so on but they'll also be filtering out this crying baby
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:09.340]   And and turning up the you know the information do you want to hear and that's going to be really really cool
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:15.900]   To some extent i'm already doing that with my hearing aids, you know, I got yes those starchy halo hearing aids and it does some really
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:19.180]   uh nowadays hearing aids are not just amplifiers
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:25.340]   That's why you don't hear the grandpa's ringing hearing aid anymore because really what they are is dsp's
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.820]   And they do a lot of processing including
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:33.980]   Trying to figure out where the sounds coming from and using the stereo earphones to give you more directional
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:39.580]   Information to know where you're looking and to make that guy talk louder than the guy over here
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.620]   Lots of really interesting stuff. I just got a
[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.780]   Upgrade notice uh from my audiologist. He says we've got new cones
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.340]   We're going to put in that make music sound better
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:54.780]   And by the way, one of the things I do with my hearing aids is I stealthily walk down the street and listen to my book
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.700]   Because you can't tell that i'm listening to a book and my hearing aids
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.500]   And getting notifications and all that stuff, right?
[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:06.620]   That's why hearing aids are going to be obsolete because everyone will already have them by the time they're old enough to wear hearing
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.620]   They're going to be in ear
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.180]   Devices of some kind. Yeah
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:15.740]   Near connections to the internet. Yeah, well, and I think that that is by the way is one solution
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:20.300]   Uh to to the nausea problem and other things is that you doesn't have to be visual
[00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:26.540]   It can be auditory and I think you made a great point Mike in fact really a lot of what google glass was was auditory as much as visual
[00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.780]   Yes, yeah, yeah
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:34.940]   There's also a hybrid of virtual and augment a reality that would require a project tango type of technology
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.580]   And that is that you know, everything you see is fake
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:44.220]   It's monsters and alien landscapes and so on but that it it matches the surfaces of the actual place where you are
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.980]   So when you're looking around and you're walking around or you're not walking around or whatever
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:54.780]   It makes sense with exactly what you're doing and and uh and so on and and that's something that of course they've demonstrated
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.940]   With the hollow lens one of the first uh demonstrations was the this landscape of mars well that was really a ground there
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.340]   It just wasn't a martian landscape. Right?
[00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:08.940]   I think it could be uh hole lens really could be very interesting, but it's also I believe several years off
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:15.180]   Yes, yes. Yeah, because hollow lens the whole pc in the battery and everything are in the band
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.420]   So you are truly untethered
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:24.060]   Yeah, you saw the yeah, I don't know. Did you see it e3 any of these goofy backpack pc's designed for using with the oculus rips?
[00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:30.540]   So you could walk around I didn't but they you know, they were there was a lot of very controlled environments for the vr
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:37.100]   Partly because they didn't want people wandering into right another, you know cosplayer user with a sword or whatever, but it was it was
[00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.420]   You know very controlled environments. I thought well, you know
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:47.100]   We're not you can't just strap people into these things yet and uh have it be a seamless experience
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.020]   So, honey. I'm going into my vr pod. Yes
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.300]   I mean this gives a new meaning to the man cave
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.100]   Yeah, right or it could be an actual cave
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.140]   The lady well, I'm not gonna say do you have a lady?
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:05.260]   Okay rewind
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.540]   I stopped before I said it
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:15.260]   From a culture perspective, what's interesting to me is that you know people like us have been talking about the
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:19.660]   Problems and pitfalls and potential virtual reality for a long time
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:25.980]   But ready player one is gonna come out as a movie. It's a steven super it is and in fact the guy from you know
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:31.420]   A bachman from silicon valley has already signed on to play a troll in that movie
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.780]   Um, it's it's probably going to be a fantastic movie
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:41.260]   It'll probably be a blockbuster and it'll get everybody talking about what happens when people abandon the real world for the virtual one
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.060]   And and it's it's a it's a you know
[00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.660]   I'm super concerned about this because it clearly you know
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:53.020]   I'm concerned about people who live in horrible places that want to live in wonderful places and they're just vanishing to virtual reality
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.180]   I think that'll happen for some minority of people kind of already happens with video games, but
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:04.460]   in ready player one it's a dystopian future where because everybody's in virtual reality the real world goes to hell and the more the world
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:11.340]   Real world goes to hell the more people want to vanish into virtual reality sounds like the presidential election of 26 exactly
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:15.660]   Well imagine if we could just tune it all out and live in a world where some of these candidates didn't exist
[00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:20.460]   You know, it's interesting our 13 year old when I was 13. I was very it was uh, uh, it was
[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:24.780]   1968 nixon versus uh hump-free
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:30.140]   Yeah, that was uh, yeah fraud with uh optimism and I was but I was fascinated
[00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:35.660]   And really engaged I remember sitting through the contested election the contest a democratic election
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.940]   And literally writing down delegate votes
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:45.020]   To keep track of this I was fascinated then I fast forward to our 13 year old who puts his fingers in the years
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:49.100]   If we if there's any politics, it's like and I don't blame him. It's like it's
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:55.340]   I think we at this point people want to put a hood over their heads and not even talk about it or think about it
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.580]   We're partly because we're overloaded right we have media overload
[00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:05.980]   Right, um, but also partly because the reality is so real. It's a little too real
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:10.140]   Yeah at this point. Yeah, you have a nine year old almost 10
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.980]   Stacy. Yes. Yes, and she actually understands
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:19.100]   Of course she understands the election, but she has thoughts and opinions. Oh good. Oh good
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.340]   She her entire school. She goes to a
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.020]   It's a school modeled after the international school in mexico city neat
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.340]   So they they are pretty anti-Trump is a school
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.180]   Just
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.220]   She were pro-Trump would she feel uh, would she be ostracized?
[00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:39.180]   She has a friend who's pro-Trump and um, she doesn't- because you are in texas after all
[00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:42.940]   I am i'm in austin though. Um, the people's are public of austin
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:47.420]   They have a they have a trump anti-Trump dance and her friend doesn't do the dance
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.220]   But that's about the extent of the ostrac
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.700]   It'd be hard. It'd be hard, you know, especially at that age when you really want to your peer group is everything
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.700]   You really want to be accepted
[00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:01.740]   Oh, they're they're one of those warm and fuzzy schools. Everyone's still accepted. It's all okay. Yeah, yeah
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:07.820]   Uh, let's take a break. We're gonna come back. I we are talking about technologies, uh, that you know
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.100]   The mainstream media goes oh, this is the next big thing and then
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:18.620]   Those of us who have been covering tech for a while might have other thoughts larry pages secret flying car factories
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:26.620]   Next coming up next but first a word from our sponsor at lassian.com we use it lassian now
[00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:33.580]   This is reality lassian gives you a window into exactly how your team is doing what they're working on how far along
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:39.580]   They are in every different part of a project at lassian is a series of tools a number of tools that let you
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:46.220]   Work better together or as they say team up to create what's next we'll start with jira
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:52.780]   Which many people have first experienced kind of as an agile canban board a way of keeping track of all the different projects
[00:24:52.780 --> 00:25:00.620]   Managing all the different tasks. We use jira when we were designing our website the company at adaustin for kitchens that did it
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:06.780]   Uh use jira for us to keep track with what they're doing for us to create our user story so that they can work on the projects
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:13.180]   And it really was fantastic. I mean I just and now we continue to use it for our maintenance contract
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:23.260]   So we can say here's something we want you to work on. This is next. This is next jira is the number one software development tool used by agile teams to assign track and manage tasks for any project
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:29.980]   And no matter how complex and if if you've been on a development team and you've not used jira, you've got to try it because I think you'll see how
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:35.260]   Incredible it is for getting things done. There's also confluence
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:40.700]   Uh, which we use I didn't know this but we use confluence in uh in the twit
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:49.500]   Our engineering team uses it to document equipment and work processes to keep track of uh where things are in the process confluence
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:54.700]   Will let you create and share content organize results bring team members up to speed
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:26:00.140]   We also use hip chat and I you know, I don't know if I want to show you our hip check because it's so active
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:05.180]   And we use hip chat for everything to book guests to plan shows
[00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:09.740]   Oops, I don't have to create an account. I have an account. Um, for the new studio
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:15.420]   We're keeping track of it and Russell and our cis admins use hip chat because they've integrated into hip chat
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:20.780]   All of the tools like panopt it that they use to keep an eye on servers and uptime and all of this stuff
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:24.060]   The integrations are incredible in hip chat
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.700]   Everything bitbucket github as sauna google hangouts zen does 150
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:33.500]   integrations with more coming all the time so you can keep track of
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:38.460]   What's going on in what looks like an instant messenger, but also allows you
[00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:44.380]   video and uh chat and uh and just everything you'd ever want, uh, I it's incredible
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:50.140]   Of course hip chat works right with jira and confluence and bitbucket, which is their testing
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:52.860]   And review and managing code in real-time tool
[00:26:52.860 --> 00:27:00.300]   Lots of great stuff. Here's the deal go to at lassian.com and find out more about all the great tools that it'll help your team
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:06.620]   Work together helping teams everywhere team up to create what's next at lassian
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:09.900]   Dot com we use it and we love it
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:15.980]   Stacy hagan botham is here from stacey on iot.com. That's her website and of course the great podcast she does
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.380]   with uh friend kevin toful
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.300]   Uh the iot podcast. She's the king or queen of iot
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:28.220]   It's always nice to have you and you said your door your doorbell may ring at any time and you will leap up
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.740]   And and go to the ups guy because what are you waiting for something from underwear?
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.940]   Under armor under armor. Okay
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.780]   It's their fitness. It's their health box is it?
[00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.060]   Has it smoke and deal on it?
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:45.180]   Oh, is it like can you wear like under armor and it will tell you how your heart rate is and all that stuff kind of thing
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:51.340]   It's three things. It's a scale. It's a connected heart rate monitor the strap kind and a fitness band
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:58.140]   And if you want they also have shoes that work with this and the shoes you just run in that's it
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.860]   That's nice. So it is you don't have to charge on my HTC works with them on that
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.900]   Yes, yes, they do really really um
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:11.260]   You know, it's it's just everywhere now. You can't you can't exercise alone anymore
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:15.660]   They bought they bought all my favorite apps. They bought my fitness pal. They use that
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:19.740]   I love I will say I love their apps map my or
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:24.540]   The map my run map my run. Yeah, they did that ride
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.140]   Yeah, my fitness pal with all the food tracking
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:35.820]   So Alexa. Oh, I said her name. Sorry. The echo has a food tracking. Yeah. Have you tried that? I'm really excited about that
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:41.260]   I I have too, but I have not tried it because I didn't want to set up an account and then I forgot about it for like
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:43.660]   Two days. Okay. I'm gonna try it tonight
[00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:50.540]   Because food logging is the single most for me the best way for me to lose weight to be more healthy
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.580]   I'm already exercising a lot and I do keep track of it
[00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:56.140]   I am my apple watch on today, but I use a Fitbit and other things
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.180]   But it's food tracking and it's such a pan up
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:05.340]   But if I could get that to work with the echo I would be like because I'm usually sitting next to the echo when I'm eating
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:10.700]   I'm waiting for like there's an app called meal snap. I don't know why I showed my phone
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:16.380]   Because you could take a picture of your food, right? Yeah, and it would estimate how many calories were in it
[00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:17.500]   um
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.500]   and that kind of what I
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:26.140]   Arrived but with AI where it is and the ability to visualize food. I'm like, why do we not have yeah
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.460]   that
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:33.420]   It wouldn't be as accurate, but I'm okay with that. I just need a general like echo. I know I'm eating something
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:38.540]   It's about the size of my fist is blue green and it smells like prunes
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:44.060]   Oh, you're eating. I don't know what I'm like. Wow. I don't think I would eat
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:49.340]   Yeah, that guy would say stop eating that whatever it is
[00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:53.980]   I will dial 911 for you if you don't stop
[00:29:53.980 --> 00:30:00.060]   Uh, mike elkhan is also here. He is a digital nomad. That's the name of his website
[00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:06.300]   He's traveling the world and right now his travels have brought him to the exotic destination of
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.940]   los angles california
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:14.540]   That's right and uh, yep, and then i'll be in the u.s for about a month and then we're taking off again
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:21.900]   But yeah, it's uh, it's very exciting to be in la, you know, it's you know, i'm a big foodie leo and ur2 and la is such a big
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.580]   Food town now. It's just amazing
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:29.740]   We went to a restaurant last night called beastia bestia something like that. What the heck is that?
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.300]   It's a great restaurant
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.820]   In downtown. It's in a really bad neighborhood that it's worth worth risking it
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:43.580]   Uh, so the website what is the website for it is coming nomad right becoming nomad.com
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:50.140]   Yeah, and there's a newsletter you can sign up for if you like it's free and i also have a twitter account becoming no man
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.500]   i'm always so jealous because this is something i've always wanted to do
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:58.220]   Uh, is to you know kick off the traces and uh and go see the world
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:04.140]   Oh, man. Look at this body surfing at taloon. You've got a life. I'm so jones
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:10.300]   Great. I love the lifestyle in fact that you know most of it many of us many of us who have people who can work for home
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.260]   Uh, if you can work from home
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:18.860]   You can work from roam. So you know with mobile technology enables you to live anywhere
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:23.740]   And uh, I would like to see more people doing it if they can and if they want to neat
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:28.780]   And uh if you follow mike on instagram, you'll be tortured with his food pictures
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.100]   Facebook wherever is a facebook or instagram. I know I see your pictures all the time
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:39.980]   Um, it's probably most I do both, but it's probably mostly facebook. I post a lot more on facebook and people can follow you without friending you
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:44.060]   They can't yes, you know what i'm saying. Yeah, I say that
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:49.900]   I do note. I do note a very strange picture of you on your facebook, uh announcing your appearance
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:56.460]   Uh, it's apparently you and larry page wearing your google glasses. There's some reason your face is painted with the american flag
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:59.740]   Yeah, I was looking for an arresting image for facebook
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.300]   That was a that was actually a selfie that larry
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:07.100]   Page himself took using my camera. He held i was trying to take a selfie with my gigantic
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.380]   S dslr and he said no here's how you do it. He grabbed the camera
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:15.500]   He's great all that upside down and that that american flag was for some google plus thing from like
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:21.820]   Four years ago. It was a filter. Yeah. Oh good. So that's a relief. I'm not actually a page
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:25.020]   I was I was like wow you met larry page with your face
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.380]   So humiliating
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:34.780]   Or maybe not I don't know can we we we've actually dropped mike's video and it's the audio is working perfectly
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:39.580]   So that's fine and that's really uh all we really need but I think we should use this image of mike
[00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:45.180]   Uh, absolutely. We're gonna talk about the flying cars. We got both people. That's right. That's right. So, uh,
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:50.940]   Lisa my wife came to me a couple of days ago and said this is so exciting larry page
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:56.380]   Is gonna build flying cars and I said exciting that's a terrifying thought
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:02.620]   Do you really want p everybody and their brother flying around? So what's the story with flying cars?
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.460]   Um, stacey if you don't mind I wrote a column on this and I'd love
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:12.380]   My my frame of reference is the jetson's and yeah, yeah, so
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:18.460]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah and also the flying bollorian in in back to the future too and we've got a million of them, you know
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.500]   Uh
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.700]   And so limit first for for people who are listening to this show
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:28.460]   Let me describe the vehicle because we've known about the vehicle and the company for a little while sketchy information
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:31.980]   But we've just learned that it's in fact larry page is the sole owner of this
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.980]   Oh, it's not just he's invested in the competitor, right?
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:40.540]   Yeah, right. There's kitty hawk is a is another company that's invested in and that company
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:46.060]   Uh, the president of that company is uh, is the guy who launched the self-driving car initiative
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.380]   Sebastian thron at google
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:53.820]   But the the uh, the one that larry page owns outright is really fascinating the zero airplane
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:59.900]   So imagine an airplane fuselage just the part where you sit where the motor is and where the wheels are
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:04.460]   And then on that on the very back and top there's a a wing that curves down on the back
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:11.660]   And in the very very front there's another wing that's on the bottom and then there's a sort of two upside down pontoons
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:16.380]   on either side and there are four propellers on each side
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:21.420]   Uh that are slightly at different angles and two propellers in the back providing forward thrust
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:28.700]   This looks like something you would see in a tom swift novel from 1936. Yes. Yes, it's the future
[00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:33.260]   But this but larry page and i've i've done it i did a lot of research on this
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:39.500]   And and i hate to say it because i always come up often come across as a google fanboy, but larry page has the best
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:42.220]   So-called flying car
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.700]   Out there and then here's why yeah, he's got a g6
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:48.460]   That's the best flying car a private jet
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:49.660]   Right
[00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:54.700]   These little propellers are part of what makes this possible and the other part is self-flying
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:58.540]   So the start of the propeller i think that's key by the way the self-flying technologies
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.060]   Otherwise you've got people flying into each other above your head
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:07.260]   They will never let you yeah control an airplane in your neighborhood
[00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.020]   It's that it's never going to happen
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:15.740]   But so these these propellers each of it's like a it's like an electric car each other let's test like each of these propellers has its own
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.300]   Motor and its own controller
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:24.860]   So if one of them gets hit by a bird or one of them goes out for some reason the plane will keep flying if two or three of them go out
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:29.660]   The plane will keep flying it's not depending on one engine or one that's good
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.780]   Very reliable would be a very high priority for something like this if there's hundreds above me
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:40.940]   Exactly and one of the most wonderful things about this is he's shooting for the for the mass market
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:45.340]   So he's really shooting for an affordable airplane that will essentially be
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:53.500]   It'll cost as much as a pretty high-end car like a ten so like 130 150 something like that
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:59.500]   Yeah, I mean I think it could even so here's the thing that a lot of engineers are saying a lot of people who really know what they're talking about
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:05.660]   Are saying it's actually easier to do a self-flying airplane than it is to do a self-driving car
[00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.540]   There are less things to crash into you don't have to stay on the road
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:12.620]   You don't have to identify bicyclists. You don't have to do all this you need to avoid you know
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:17.580]   Stay on the air space avoid the telephone poles, you know, it's it's a much simpler problem
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:23.020]   Biggest part of the problem as is often the case with almost any technology is the battery situation
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.380]   And they're heavy it's particularly problematic in an airplane
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:33.980]   But I have a I have a personal problem with the concept of the flying car people think that their car will fly the thing that they drive around will fly
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.500]   That will never happen. This is an airplane. You can't drive this like a car
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:43.580]   The title of your own. Yeah, it does look like a drone doesn't exactly and of course there's some other you know
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:47.500]   There are a bunch of companies that have tried to do flying cars. They already exist
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:51.340]   There's there's the pal V the sky car the aero mobile 3.0
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.700]   The Maverick ls say the icon a5 switchblade the lithium jet the velocicopter
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:03.260]   Pegasus skyrunner volante I mean there are a bunch of these one of the coolest ones the terra fugia or for terra fujira
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:07.020]   I don't know how to say tfx, which is a really cool device
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:07.900]   but
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:13.100]   The ones that will matter are going to be self-driving and and the other thing is just like self-driving cars
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.180]   I don't think we'll care about owning them
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.980]   We may be in 10 or 15 years be able to summon one
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:21.260]   So land on our lawn and take us to dinner or whatever but
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:27.340]   We won't necessarily want to own them and they will definitely be self-driving
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.380]   So Mike help me out here. Yeah, if
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:36.780]   Is this for like a family? Is this for one person? How do you see this being used and wouldn't we just
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:42.220]   It's kind of like building new highways or new roads where they just get clogged because there's more avenues
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:46.220]   I mean, I know that we feel like the air above us is infinite, but it's not so
[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:49.980]   I'm just trying to think about why I would I mean it's cool
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:54.300]   But why do I need or want this where the what are you crazy?
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:59.340]   No, I'm not I'm practical remember how to do this traffic jams
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:02.140]   Are you insane who wouldn't want this?
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:06.300]   Again totally cool, but realistically how is this going to be used?
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.460]   Like sticking ahead
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.260]   It'll be an uber it'll I think for most the most
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:16.700]   Common usage will be that you will use your app to say I need I need a I need to get to this place
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.940]   That's 30 miles away and I want to get there in five minutes
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:22.860]   Well, that's okay. So number one it would be it would be a lot faster than driving, right?
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.220]   Yes, yes
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:30.540]   So those rotors are really that much I'm just thinking about like the engines on these things because they're electric, right?
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:34.060]   so and they're battery powered and
[00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.660]   I think they'd be much more reliable frankly
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.340]   Yeah
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:43.500]   It sounds safer unless you actually fall because then you're probably dead but um
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.620]   Like do we know any of the speeds on these things?
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:52.460]   No, no the the actual information and by the way, they're already flying prototypes
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:55.100]   This airplane the zero airplane's been spotted
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:59.340]   Really at a silicon at an airplane or near Silicon Valley
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.380]   There's some spy shots out there and they're testing a lot of these concepts
[00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:07.500]   This is this is years and years away, but you know, let's say 15 years into the future
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.500]   I think it's perfectly reasonable to to just have
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:19.340]   Flying cars or these these self-driving airplanes to be landing take you someplace and come back and it won't cost a fortune
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:22.140]   It might cost 50 bucks or 100 bucks or something like that
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.620]   But I think it'll be like, you know, like you say leo like Teslas
[00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:32.940]   You might see a Tesla somewhere in the us in Silicon Valley every 10th car is a Tesla and um
[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.580]   And they're you know, they're for wealthier people
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:38.140]   They're a luxury item
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:42.620]   Eventually electric cars that go pretty fast and are pretty great will be pretty commonplace
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:45.980]   Um, you know trickle down. I guess is the way to look at it
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.020]   But this is your z-arrow project leery pages is
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:53.420]   really aggressively driving for an affordable everyday
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:40:00.940]   Family airplane and if you don't have to own it, you know, something over six figures isn't necessarily a game
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:06.780]   Breaker, although I think the first ones just like the Teslas will be for for affluent very affluent
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:12.620]   uh people these are by the way vertical take off and landing right so you don't have to have a runway
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:16.540]   And I think that's one of the necessary components it has to be vertical
[00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:19.660]   Otherwise, you know, who's gonna have their own runway? You're not gonna land on the street
[00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.500]   That would be super dangerous, but if you have a you know reasonable space and of course
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.700]   You know, we're talking about anything anytime you talk about the future five years in the future and more
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:33.580]   You're talking about a world in which artificial intelligence is just like electricity
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:39.660]   It's just right and every and that's another thing kevin kelly said we I just did a triangulation with them
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:45.660]   That's exactly his point. Yeah, it's just going to be applied to everything and um that changes everything
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:51.500]   These are the by the way the drawings i'm showing are from the z-arrow patent, which is of course publicly available
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.140]   They even show it parking in between two cars
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.020]   With it's uh, I guess with its wings folded up
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.660]   Oh man now I have to check my roof for dense
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.100]   It's gonna be a big room to my roof
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.060]   Can you imagine somebody hovering in over you and saying pardon me? Do you have any gray poop all?
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:13.740]   I want I can't believe stacey. This is just so typical of the golf
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:22.380]   Between boys and girls you say why would anyone want one and I say why would you why someone would want one?
[00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:27.820]   I'm just trying to visualize how we would use it. Oh, I always I mean it doesn't look like it's super fast
[00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:31.660]   It's gonna be faster because you don't have to you don't have to deal with traffic
[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:36.220]   It's even if it only goes 80 miles an hour. It has if everyone has one of these things
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:39.900]   Will there not be traffic eventually? Oh because of autonomy
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:47.260]   By the way autonomy is absolutely key and we've even seen this on regular highways autonomous vehicles don't have the number of traffic jams
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:51.340]   That's true, um, but I think and I don't think you're gonna see so many of them in the air
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:59.980]   The it's easier to visualize the world of of these of these flying self-driving airplane things
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:07.500]   When you and when you imagine the obvious it's obvious that drones will be everywhere right five years
[00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:13.340]   Everywhere and it's obvious that self-driving cars will be everywhere in five to ten years
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.380]   And so let's go forward in the future ten years
[00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:22.940]   Drones everywhere big ones carrying cargo and stuff like that safely self-driving cars driving everyone safely
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:27.660]   The idea of a self-driving drone that a person gets in will be just so obvious maybe
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:33.500]   Dark drones pretty noisy now as it stands imagine it. I mean they're little imagine
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:40.380]   I think again speed and size, but I mean I'm all for it. I would totally ride. I mean
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:44.940]   I have a Tesla. I would totally buy one of these. Yeah, see you're the you're the market for this
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:48.140]   I have a rooftop deck that I could totally lean perfect
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:54.540]   We're going to stasis has to go in our for a ride in our zero zero zero zero
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:58.780]   I don't think I'm going to live long enough to see this in widespread use
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:03.900]   But I and I have to admit that when when I read about this I thought this is never going to happen
[00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:09.340]   But that those are the answers to the kind of the critical questions is you know the issues of safety
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:16.860]   Of driving and flying a bunch of people flying at you know will in the sky autonomy will fix it of course
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:24.700]   And of course this is twig so it we'd be remiss if we didn't regale listeners and viewers with
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:29.980]   The details of this secret company that has been kept really secret
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:35.020]   So one of the things that was really amazing is initially they bought it's two story building right next door to the google plaques
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:40.140]   And the the only need of the bottom floor so Larry page personally took over the top floor
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.380]   And nobody really knew what he was doing there
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:47.340]   They were never supposed to mention the words Larry or page and so they referred to him as Gus
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:51.100]   Gus is an acronym that stands for guy upstairs
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:59.180]   So Gus is this Gus is making a lot of noise and they the employees of z-hero didn't know what was he was doing up there until
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:03.020]   They finally needed the second floor and they moved his stuff out and they're moving out these
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:04.700]   massive
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:10.300]   Masters paintings and exotic exercise equipment and a climbing wall and all this other stuff
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.900]   And people are watching all this stuff going by and saying what is this guy been doing up there
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:20.780]   And apparently he used the entire top floor his own personal playground and playpan and all of that
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:27.740]   Even imagine what it would be like to be somebody like Larry page or circle ran or elon musk or bill gates or
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.220]   I mean to have that kind of
[00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:34.540]   Infinite wealth bill gates at one point said effectively. I have an infinite amount of money
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:40.140]   I can't yeah, there's no way I could spend it fast enough to run out right and that must be a very interesting
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:45.500]   Place to be it's fun to watch all these these these tech billionaires
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:52.940]   Like jeff Bezos and and elon musk and so on essentially what they're doing is they're taking the things that they used to play with when they were
[00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:56.220]   Uh seven-year-old boys and they're making it real
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:00.940]   And again that could be good or that could be bad
[00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.580]   I think that um
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:09.980]   We could spend it a little bit more practically, but hey, that's just me apparently in my weird feminine viewpoint. Yes, that's exactly right
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.500]   You see again mommy doesn't want us to play around
[00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:17.100]   She says be serious get a job
[00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:25.260]   That you know you can't predict the future. It's good that you have all these uh crazy billionaires wasting their own personal fortunes on what?
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.500]   Yeah, better than us
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:33.500]   And of course this coming from a guy whose face is painted like the american flag. Yeah, I
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.900]   Okay, we can now stop using this that's mics
[00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:40.300]   picture
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.300]   Although I have enjoyed it
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:50.540]   Imagine it looks like basically an absolutely insane person is telling us about flying cars and that's exactly what the show is all about
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:59.260]   It's the type of thing the insane person would be talking about so I think that's cool. Yeah. Yeah someday flying cars
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.900]   And and yet now you've convinced me
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:08.060]   That this is maybe a little bit more viable than I had uh, I'd said can they get the question is what can they get the price down?
[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:12.220]   Uh to low answer your question. Yeah. That's my question
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:17.100]   How soon and when can I buy one is actually my my real question
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.140]   Um
[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:23.260]   I don't wouldn't you I mean so you don't have a commute stacy
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:26.940]   That's I do it's like down the hall for the better
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:31.100]   Yeah, I don't know the why but I live in austin which has
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.740]   wretched traffic, right it could be
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:35.420]   and
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:39.660]   again, I see the value actually a guy who's building this crazy house like
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:45.180]   Not that far away for me as the crow flies but far in terms of atmosphere
[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.900]   he wanted to put in like a helipad to
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:55.740]   To go for you know for his commute that he decided we all as neighbors like were against it because it was going to be crazy loud
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.180]   Yeah, because apparently we're like hating on the 1%
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:06.860]   Uh, so yeah, I would love it, but I'm also like dad. You know how fast do they go how heavy right?
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.700]   Battery technology
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.700]   There might be loud
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.660]   Also, it would be it would be like a hundred leaf blowers
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:14.700]   Right
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.820]   Blowing in every direction that's a big problem that has yet to be resolved
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:21.980]   But you know the thing is that if anybody's concerned about the traffic in the sky
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:29.260]   Uh, all you need to do to to resolve that fear is to go on youtube and look at the the drone swarm
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:37.660]   Technology the you know these these universities and mit and elsewhere have gotten you know 20 drones flying in perfect formation in this tight spaces indoors
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.140]   Without any problem
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:45.020]   What about going outside and just like enjoying yourself? I mean this thing could have a glass roof
[00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:47.740]   Stacy that there's nature in a glass floor
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:50.540]   Exactly
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:57.100]   Like I when I picture our dystopian future it does feature flying cars. Yeah, I I picture the fifth element
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.580]   So, you know, yeah, the fifth elm was a good example
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:03.340]   You know and in the fifth elm and bruce willis is trying to fly that cab
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:08.140]   In what is clearly an insane environment, but of course if the cab is autonomous
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:15.420]   Follow-up like that. I don't know what I don't know why I'm watching this. Oh, this is youtube drones
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:23.820]   Oh, I was like is that a swarm. That's a swarm. These are drone swarms. Yeah, it's it'll be a trivial problem to make sure that that
[00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:29.820]   Self-flying cars will never crash into each other that they'll all be in these like highways in the sky
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.860]   you'll sort of like pull in and get in line behind the other ones and
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:38.300]   It won't that that won't be the hardest part like you said Stacy. It'll be batteries and things like that
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:44.060]   All of which are problems we have to sell for other things as well. So yeah, um and of course, you know test
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:49.820]   You know elan musk says that really what tesla isn't primarily as a battery company not a car company
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.940]   Right. They're building that giga factor is gonna be online soon
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:56.460]   Yeah, dropping the price of batteries considerably by the way
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:03.260]   Of course elons the guy who said there's uh the the chance that we are not in a game simulation is one in a billion
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:07.580]   Uh, and I think we've talked about that. He said this at recode a couple of weeks ago
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:11.020]   I realized it's easy for him to think that because when you are that rich
[00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:14.940]   Um, you can immediately see oh, I'm bored by life
[00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:19.180]   What you know, I need to do something really really something to keep me interested
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:22.540]   That's when you start thinking about what we need is a perfect simulation
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:27.980]   Uh and have some and I could have a life that has some struggle in it. I need to build a simulator
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:32.060]   so that bad things can happen to me and
[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:35.100]   Bingo bobs your uncle you're we're all living in the simulation
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:41.980]   I wonder whether his belief that it's all a simulation is part of the secret to his success because I mean you
[00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:46.860]   What what is risk-taking if you think it's all fake anyway, I'm sure it is
[00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:54.460]   Wow, we're so meta. I don't know. I feel like we've gone off the rails here. Well, welcome to twig
[00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:56.700]   Stacy Higgins
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.700]   We don't need rails where we're
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:07.660]   Google by the way, uh, trolled a bunch of people I haven't I have to look at I have to get my s6p
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:12.460]   There's an easter egg in the android end developer preview of version four
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:20.300]   They still haven't named in but they have but when you do the thing that pops up the the version the name of the uh of the uh,
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.700]   Android and it says namey mcm face
[00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.420]   But i'm thinking that's a joke
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:31.580]   The I am pushing for a dark horse, which is nerds candy because I i figure
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:37.020]   Is an opportunity for for android fans to name android after themselves?
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.980]   They said it's going to be in the next couple of weeks. We'll find out
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.300]   Yeah, talk about taking something completely inconsequential
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.460]   Uh and getting some mileage some you know pr mileage
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:53.180]   Out of it. They've really drawn this thing out ridiculously. Yeah
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.180]   Yeah
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:51:00.460]   And of course haroshi lokheimer the vp in charge keeps dropping the new tele hints
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:08.220]   Yeah, and you know that whoever it is that makes natella is like pulling for it because it's you can't buy that kind of publicity
[00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:12.220]   Yeah, here's a here's a tweet on june six from haroshi
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:16.460]   There's one specific dish on this menu. I'm keenly interested in
[00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:21.020]   Uh, I hope it's not new telepizzetta because that sounds terrible
[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:28.460]   Um and then uh his search window where he's testing some stuff out in the search window in the back
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.180]   You probably have to really zoom in to see this
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:35.020]   Says new tele google search for new tele
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:38.060]   He's been tweeting this stuff out like crazy
[00:51:38.060 --> 00:51:41.660]   So maybe it's new tele
[00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:48.140]   I hope not because the statue that they're going to put at the google plex is just going to be a jar of natella right
[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:50.540]   What else are nerds?
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:53.500]   Are we going to do a pile of nerds?
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:55.980]   Oh, you got to have a pile
[00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:59.100]   Okay, no, I'm like a pilot nerds of you, but you gotta get a robot in there
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:04.060]   Maybe a robot emerging from a pile of nerds. Yeah stacking the pile of nerds or popping them in their mouth
[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.660]   Okay, I yeah
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:14.300]   I did spend like the last time we talked about it. I spent like two hours trying to think of other in desserts and it was
[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:19.340]   There's not a lot of choices. I was hungry afterwards. Yeah, but I went with ice cream
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:24.620]   Did you go over to whole foods and get that hazelnut chocolate chip thing I talked about? I did not
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.420]   I believe you
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:34.060]   All right, let's take a break more to come stacey higginbotham is here from stacey on iot mr
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:39.100]   Mike elgin his triumphant return to the united states all charges have been dropped
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:44.540]   And he is back baby unless i'm just kidding he's in less in most in most in most states
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:48.460]   I hear amira cooking something
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:51.740]   That's actually my sister. Oh
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:58.300]   Yes, okay, cuz amira is your wife is an amazing she truly is she truly is you are a lucky man
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.380]   And I don't know how mike stays so slender
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:07.020]   He does not apparently need a an Alexa skill as a columnist. I'm always jumping to conclusions
[00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:09.740]   lots of exercise
[00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:15.980]   I showed it they brought you by our ring video doorbell. We love the ring if mike if you weren't so parapetetic
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:19.180]   You could have a ring video. I do have a ring leo
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:22.060]   You're not going to believe this and people think that i'm completely nuts
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:26.060]   But I bring my ring video doorbell with me when I live in other countries because
[00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:29.020]   It's so easy to set up. I when we were in mexico
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:31.820]   I duct taped it to to the front door
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:35.900]   And you really want you know when you come back when you're a third
[00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:37.660]   Mexico is in a third world country
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:40.860]   But if you're if you are in a third world country where there might be crime and stuff
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:45.740]   I get to know whether for sure whether anybody's in the house when we go in wow
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:51.180]   It's even more useful than I thought or useful and it's really fun to see all the videos it creates
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:54.700]   When i'm packing and repacking you can see all the stuff in my luggage
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:59.180]   The cool the cool thing about the ring is it does you can do it as mike's doing it
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.020]   I mean it's designed for a wired doorbell
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:06.460]   But and you see that you would pass the take your old doorbell off take the wires connected to the terminals on it
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:10.540]   But inside here is a is a pretty hefty lithium-ion battery. They say it'll last a year
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:13.660]   They even include the usb cable that you can charge it with
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:18.300]   Plus a level a screwdriver drill bit all the tools you need to set this up
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:23.420]   It replaces your existing doorbell wired or not with an hd camera
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:29.180]   A speaker and a microphone and then when you're not home and somebody rings the doorbell
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:33.900]   You can answer it from anywhere via the internet. They have ring apps for the android and ios
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:38.620]   And so that's really cool. We've put together something really neat the ring of security
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:44.460]   Kit so now you get the ring video doorbell for the front door you get the ring stick up cam
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.060]   That's a relatively new
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:51.580]   A product of theirs is a wireless weatherproof high def camera that you can use just like the ring video doorbell
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:57.580]   But in other parts maybe get the backyard with the stick up cam and the and the front with the doorbell
[00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:04.380]   And we're also including a solar panel so you never have to have that power to just take its power from the sun
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:07.100]   And the chime which i really like
[00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:10.860]   Even if you've got a built-in doorbell with that rings and everything
[00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:13.660]   The chime is nice because you could put it anywhere there's a plug socket
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:16.940]   And it will ring as well when the ring video doorbell rings
[00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.380]   So it's a great way
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:26.940]   To increase the reach of your doorbell and all of this we're going to give you a special deal on $50 off the ring of security kit
[00:55:26.940 --> 00:55:31.180]   When you go to ring.com/twig
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:36.700]   ring rng.com/twig take a look at the ring the ring pro now
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:37.900]   It's just out
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:39.980]   There's a home burglar every 13 seconds
[00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:43.340]   They they really skyrocket in the summer and people are away on vacation
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:46.860]   Now when you're on vacation, you will be able to monitor your front door
[00:55:46.860 --> 00:55:50.060]   It's got motion detection as well as ring detection
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:55.100]   So if anybody comes up the the law up the you know path to your front door
[00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:57.500]   You'll know whether they ring the doorbell or not
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.180]   You'll get alerts on your phone
[00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:03.740]   And the fact that you can come on even if you're at work or in timbuk too and say hey
[00:56:03.740 --> 00:56:05.260]   Yeah, I'm here. What do you want?
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:07.020]   That's enough to scare away any burglar
[00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:10.300]   And if they don't if it doesn't scare away, you got a crystal clear video of them
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:12.300]   Which makes it a lot easier to catch them
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:13.820]   And they have a great new feature leo
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:17.020]   Which I absolutely love because I I was wishing for this and they implemented it
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:22.620]   Which is that in in addition to getting the video and the alert when somebody presses the button or when there's motion
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:26.300]   Now assuming you're plugged into the home's electricity
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.700]   You can just say I wonder what's going on in the front yard
[00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:32.940]   Oh, you can just go and look and you don't have to wait for motion or oh that's nice
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.540]   Anytime you want from the app. Oh, they have added that that's
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:39.580]   That's a live view. Yeah. Oh, yeah
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:44.540]   I didn't even know that I wonder if do I does it just update the firmware or do I have to do anything
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:48.140]   No, when you updated it should be an option, but you do have to have it wired
[00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:52.300]   Yeah, obviously because you that it would kill the battery pretty quickly if you do that
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:55.020]   Yeah, but but wired it could sit and watch
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:58.780]   So let me see here's my front door. I must have to turn that on here
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:01.820]   Oh, that is so cool. I'm learning about my ring
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:08.700]   Yeah, I love that feature and and and get but you know, and I can't use that because I'm using the battery because I'm duck
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:10.700]   Right. I can't believe you're doing that
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:15.340]   You should get double-sided tape because dutch, I've got duct tape doorbells to my house and uh
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.900]   Double-sided is way better. Yeah, I
[00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:20.140]   So here's a look at that
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:27.020]   Gurali tape greatest tape ever anyway, so yeah, and so it's what I'm amazed by is the battery
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.580]   I've only charged this thing once I've owned it for like
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:33.500]   For a honey. Are you there? I see this is current front
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:36.300]   Hey, honey. Can you hear me?
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:37.660]   Assers by
[00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:42.460]   You can punk people. Yeah, I see you. I see you. What are you doing?
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:47.420]   I don't want to crack up. I don't want to crack her. I probably should stop doing that right now
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:52.220]   That is really this is the live view. I didn't even know they had that I could just turn that on
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:54.140]   such a great
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:55.740]   ring
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:59.500]   Dot com slash twig get on the ring train right now, baby
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:02.380]   Right now rings the thing
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:06.300]   Uh, let's see
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:09.180]   Google's springboard a search engine builder. I don't care about that
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:11.340]   You want to talk about net neutrality or apple?
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:12.460]   Oh, now it's okay
[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:17.180]   So I have an opinion on the net neutrality and then we'll talk about apple right because you cover home automation
[00:58:17.180 --> 00:58:21.340]   So the new home kit that I've also covered net neutrality for years. So I'm errant ago
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:23.980]   So the uh, a court of appeals
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:26.860]   Has upheld the fcc's decision
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:31.740]   To call telecon to call broadband providers telecom providers using title two
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:36.140]   Now this was a little controversial when the fcc voted for this because of course
[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.500]   Title
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:41.100]   Classifying something as title two does allow the fcc to do things like set price
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:46.940]   But they said no, no, no, we're only going to do some of the things and the most important one is protect net neutrality
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:49.020]   Make sure that there are no deals
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:51.900]   For better access
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:57.260]   Uh, now of course immediately at and t and others say no and appeal and sue
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:58.300]   and whatever
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:03.740]   The court of appeals has now upheld the fc and by the way, they've turned down a lot of these things in the past
[00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:06.460]   But the fcc's using a government a power
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:11.660]   Given to it by congress and that's the key congress said no no the fcc can classify
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.580]   providers as
[00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.820]   Telecommunication providers that's part of and it can regulate telecommunications providers to the court said yep
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:23.660]   This is well within your purview now atnt said immediately well we're taking this to the supreme court
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:26.540]   Um, but my I guess my point would be
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:34.380]   Even if they lose in the supreme court, you know right now lobbyists are working really hard on congress
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:39.340]   Uh because ultimately it's congress that decides what the fcc can do
[00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:45.580]   And con what congress give it that can take off the way and congress could easily pass a law that says no
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:49.660]   No, no, no, no these guys are not these these broadband providers not telecommunications providers
[00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:55.100]   So I feel like there's no it's not a time to ring the bell and celebrates stay see your opinion
[00:59:55.100 --> 01:00:00.700]   Wow, I think it is time to celebrate. I mean, yes, it could go to the supreme court right now
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:02.940]   It will go to the supreme court if they agree
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:06.540]   Yeah, unless yes if they agree to hear it it will it will end up there
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:11.580]   And we're kind of in this weird space with the supreme court, but aside from all that
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.820]   Mm
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:18.380]   I'm excited because this gives the fcc not not only does it stop
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:25.020]   Kind of the net neutrality shenanigans from like 2008 and 2009. Yeah, which is kind of the way
[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:31.580]   Rules get written. It takes a while. Right. This is this is the fcc second try actually at net neutrality
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:39.020]   Um, but what it also does and this is kind of one of the things that the fcc is allowed to enforce as part of title two
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:44.300]   Is some privacy rules? So they can start looking at
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:50.860]   Like the data that your broadband carrier has what they're doing with it. They can also like rules
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.700]   things like
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.700]   AT&T's gigabit service
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:59.420]   When you buy that you have two options you can buy a version that gives
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:03.180]   AT&T permission to market to you based on your web history
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:09.420]   And that's much cheaper than buying the version that doesn't right so it's kind of like the kindle with ads
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.980]   Or not except it's your broadband service
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.100]   um
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:19.740]   So the fcc people in the fcc have told me and this was about a year ago that they were looking at using
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:22.300]   some of those rules
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:29.020]   To kind of stop some of these practices which they felt was a little bit shifty making your broadband privacy kind of a luxury
[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.740]   I'm so I'm excited about that
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.340]   um
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:34.620]   and
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:39.580]   I don't see how it can help data caps necessarily, but i'm sure someone who is way smarter
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:44.300]   Maybe looking for that because that's another thing that I think we should be paying a little bit more attention to
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:50.220]   So I agree with you, but on the other hand, this is a risky game. I think the fcc
[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:53.820]   If it wants to avoid congressional interference
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:02:00.300]   Would be it would behoove them to be cautious in how they take advantage of these title two powers
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:04.220]   I mean if you really care about net neutrality, maybe just start there
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:09.820]   Because if they get too overreaching that it's more and more likely that congress is going to say no no wait a minute
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.900]   That's not what we intended
[01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:17.820]   So the 1996 telecommunication act is 20 years old no 30 years old 20 20
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:20.220]   Beth it's so easy
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:21.820]   Long time it's old
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:28.060]   It's ancient and there's always talk of revisiting this law like last year the year before
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:31.740]   This isn't going to happen this year. It's not going to I mean we're about to go to election
[01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:34.380]   They got an election to worry about so you're really right. Yeah
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.780]   next year maybe
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:42.540]   Depending on who's elected president the fcc may decide not to enforce some of these things. It's all at their discretion
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.780]   uh, so
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:47.340]   I look at this and I'm like god. Thank you for like
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:50.460]   giving us some definitive
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:55.260]   language around net neutrality which we have really been fighting since 2007
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.780]   uh
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:58.940]   The initial idea was in 2005 in
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:06.220]   11 years later, we finally have some clarity the other thing we should note is this enforces the same rules for
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:09.660]   our net neutrality on wireless networks too, which wow
[01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:13.820]   Even googles didn't you think that was a good idea? Yeah, well
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:18.700]   Okay, i'm i'm willing to celebrate
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:22.220]   I mean, I would i'm always willing to celebrate so
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:25.500]   Present last this is a good move for today
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:33.660]   I mean it is clear that we you know that this isn't the final say on this and you never get the final say because ultimately all the court ruled on is
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:38.540]   Is this in your congressional mandate? Does the telecommact say you can do this?
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:39.660]   Yes, it does
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:44.780]   But but congress can always change the rules the fcc only can do what the congress says it can do
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:49.100]   That's the man. I have very little faith in um congress to actually change anything
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:53.260]   I also have very little faith in congress not to look at mallebius money and say
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:04:01.580]   So I think it could go either way, it's you know, I look i'm i'm not a i'm not a political analyst
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.660]   I don't know what the election does to this
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:05.660]   um, maybe
[01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:11.180]   We'd have to wait till after the election where a member of congress would have a couple of years to get over any negative
[01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:14.220]   splashback from its
[01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:16.220]   Contiss constituent
[01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:19.260]   You know what's interesting was a great article on ours technica
[01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:21.580]   About john rachan
[01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:26.700]   uh, i'm thinking of nate annerson's article that goes oh, okay, this goes back away to um
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:31.340]   Really interesting notion something i've been pushing for years
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:35.180]   Which is that really uh, the whole idea of data caps
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:42.140]   Uh, the whole idea of isp's to charge more for more data is actually not economically
[01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:44.460]   justified
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:49.100]   Right. Oh my gosh. I could say this forever the bits are essentially free
[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:54.780]   there's an incremental cost to providing switches and and you know cabling but once you install that
[01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:59.980]   um the bits because of peering arrangements don't cost you much if anything at all
[01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:04.620]   And so really this is another case of isp's broadband providers
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:07.420]   Gorging at the trough
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:11.820]   Without any economic justification of course they say oh no no no, you know bandwith hogs
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:15.500]   Or cost us a lot of money. Well, you know, we can't afford to foot the bill
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:18.860]   And i don't actually they don't say that as much
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:23.180]   They're actually pretty subtle about it. They when they make these arguments they argue that
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:27.820]   You're paying for fairness. So there fairness well
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:32.620]   So it's not that it's a cause I mean the the insinuation is that it costs them a lot of money
[01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:35.500]   But you know in engineers from Comcast have said, you know
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:42.780]   No, it doesn't and they're to be fair. There are like costs for sending somebody out to like split the node at your cable network
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:46.620]   I'm not saying that right. It isn't you're right and
[01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.620]   this is
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:51.260]   It doesn't automatically go up when you use more bandwidth
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:52.940]   Right
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:55.740]   And yes, don't don't get me started leo
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:06:01.820]   It's it's a new york times actually a year ago run an article saying that the marginal cost of bandwidth
[01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:04.460]   Is is almost nothing
[01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:09.020]   Uh, the profit margins on bandwidth are 95 percent. Yeah, that's from kraib moffet
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:13.980]   Yeah, who is an analyst who covers this industry. It is very yeah really pro telecom. Yeah
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.780]   so
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:22.300]   I you know you get all these protests from the isp's because they're getting a good deal and as a result
[01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:29.020]   We're getting the among about the worst internet connection mike elkiness testimony. Yes. Yes
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:33.020]   In uh of any developed nation. I mean, it's just it's just here
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:39.260]   Looking at the really big picture. Uh, what frustrates me is the fact that if let's say for example
[01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:46.380]   Uh, the us government rewrote the entire deal with providing internet connectivity and said, okay
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:47.820]   We're gonna invest
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:49.820]   Oh, just throw out a huge number
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:53.180]   50 billion dollars or a hundred billion dollars in
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:07:00.780]   Laying fiber everywhere and allowing private companies to offer only service from the government's fiber to the last mile
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:05.420]   and if that kind of a scenario resulted in
[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:08.700]   every single person in the us having
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:11.900]   vastly higher bandwidth connectivity
[01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:17.340]   Uh to the internet the economy of the us would probably pay for all this in like two weeks
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:22.940]   I kind of agree with you. Yeah, and it's like why are we farting around with all this nicke timing and all this stuff when
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:29.020]   This is the whole technique for us to just be a superpower for another hundred years instead of declining and becoming a third rate
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.340]   You know two bit second, you know
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:33.820]   Second to north korea and and uh
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:37.020]   Transylvania and so on in terms of internet connectivity
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:42.540]   All right. So we actually looked at this the us government did some surveys. I think it was in 2009
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:45.660]   maybe a national broadband effort and they
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:52.620]   To lay fiber everywhere like to almost everyone was like a hundred and eleven billion dollars
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:54.780]   Which is a crazy
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:56.780]   Okay, okay. Hold on. What?
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:02.460]   But we made a decision as a country our politicians made a decision to
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:05.260]   Not force not let the government
[01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:08.300]   Invest in the infrastructure hell. We can't even do our roads
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.740]   so
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:13.900]   What they did is they set it up you have cable and dsl providers or now the
[01:08:14.620 --> 01:08:18.540]   AT&T and Verizon so the universe the copper based companies and
[01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:24.700]   Those guys they were like that'll be competitive enough and what happened was it wasn't so none of us are surprised right?
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:31.740]   But what's happening not only is google laying fiber and pushing them. We're also getting some really interesting innovations with uh
[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:34.300]   gigabit wireless which
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.340]   Facebook google
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:42.780]   AT&T Verizon they're even looking at like deploying this which actually takes the cost of deploying broadband
[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:49.020]   Down so much so then it becomes realistic, but we're never going to go back to like
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:54.620]   We don't have the option to make that decision again. It's just it's impossible
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:58.380]   Sorry
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:03.260]   Well, we need to google balloons to come out here to uh southern california because I need a faster connection
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:05.660]   I think you made us such the way of your flying cars
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:11.500]   You made such a good point though, Mike that the benefit to society to our economy would easily
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:19.260]   Cover the costs of of anything that could improve this exact whatever it takes just and why do we lack the political will to
[01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:27.820]   Spend money on infrastructure. What the what else wrong with that because the people in control of the bandwidth benefit financially from scarcity or a sense of scarcity
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:35.820]   Which is why i'm hesitant to celebrate our court victories stacey because those guys with black bags filled with money are still
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:39.340]   prowling the halls of congress and i think a lot of
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:46.140]   This is a lost fight. They they play the long game like you could see them back in like 2011
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.860]   getting ahead of all this so
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:51.020]   I
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.780]   They may attack this and that's fine
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:59.180]   But they're already coming up with new ways to get revenue and you're looking at things like the zero rating
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:07.020]   On the wireless side on the wire line side, which is another form by the way of violating net neutrality zero ratings exactly the same problem
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:12.700]   So in you know the privacy stuff that I was mentioning that at and t's doing data caps all of those are
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:22.300]   Those are basically ways to keep their revenue the same their average revenue per user the same even as the triple play goes all over the top
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.460]   I mean that's that's their game and it
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:29.980]   From a stockholder or shareholder perspective. I totally see why they're doing it. I wish they
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:32.940]   Wouldn't but you know, that's
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.940]   our
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.380]   our
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:39.260]   Well, at least the president now has a galaxy s4
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:42.780]   Instead of a blackberry. Thank god for that
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:49.020]   He's only using a three-year-old phone now apparently of course in order to give the president a phone
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:52.780]   You've got to be able to secure it like crazy and that means it takes a few years
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:59.740]   President obama has been using a blackberry. There's a picture of him waving from his limousine with his blackberry
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.900]   That's that's six years ago. That's in
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:08.700]   2010 he really wanted to do kind of what Hillary Clinton did which has to have a set you have a private phone
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:18.140]   Um, but they just they just said no you can't do it. But now he's told Jimmy Fallon. He has a galaxy s4
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:26.060]   It's hardened it's hardened. I kind of feel sorry for the guy. Can we get can we get the president an iPhone?
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:30.380]   once yeah, how about an American phone instead of
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:38.140]   Yeah, an 80 and a Korean one. Yeah, I don't you know the thing that's interesting about the hardening of this of course there are android based
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:41.820]   You know secure phones out there the black phone and so on
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:49.740]   But this is hardened in ways that nobody knows exactly what it is. It's an nsa approved
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.940]   security system that
[01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:57.580]   The details of which are are not available to the public and I I'd be really curious to see
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:01.180]   how they're enabling the president to communicate and
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:05.980]   To move around presumably use the gps system
[01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:09.100]   without
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:14.540]   You know really any risk of compromising is secure. You could turn off the radio. You could turn off the location
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:16.780]   But I you know I think there are two there are two
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:21.180]   Goals with any government communications device one of course security
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:26.700]   But secondarily you've got to keep track of everything that goes on and there's a transparency rules
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:31.100]   All the communications all the texts all the emails all belong to
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:36.380]   People of the United States, so you got to keep those also and that's another just so there's two issues
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:39.500]   It's probably easier for them almost to build their own phone
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:46.780]   From scratch and I suspect that it may say galaxy s4 on the on the on the lid, but inside is probably a lot of nsa
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:52.380]   Circa tree it's very very do the president's text do those become part of the
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:58.700]   Okay, that's one of the reasons the president was reluctant to use a texting because he said I don't want
[01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:02.060]   Text to my daughters to become part of the public record
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:08.060]   Um, so yeah, it's you don't have a lot of privacy. I'm sure he's looking forward to January
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:11.100]   A little bit right
[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:15.420]   Apple had a big event this week announced a lot of interesting things
[01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:20.220]   Which I think are appropriate for us to talk about let's start with the apple tv
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:25.260]   You know when google came out with its on hub router. There was a lot of speculation. Oh, this is a stealth
[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:30.620]   Trojan horse to get into the house so that google can set up its home automation play
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:35.020]   And nothing in fact, it's pretty clear now that the on hub isn't going anywhere
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:40.940]   Same speculation about the new apple tv except the difference here is apple says yes as a matter of fact
[01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:47.100]   This is the hub for home kit. So when you're away from home, you'll be connecting to your apple tv
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:51.740]   Which will open the garage doors change the heat turn on the watering system and all of that
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:53.900]   Stacy you must be keeping track of this
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:56.460]   Yes, I'm super excited
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:14:00.620]   Um, well, okay, not super excited. I'm I'm cautiously optimistic
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:05.660]   You know what that's kind of this kind of the bottom line for this whole damn show
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:10.540]   Cost is the optimistic about the cars
[01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:18.060]   Just cautious just cautious. So apple's got a new app called home
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:24.060]   Uh apple home kit does have quite a few uh, right there quite a few companies that use home kit, right?
[01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:26.700]   there there are
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:31.420]   Yes, there. I mean, it's not the whole ecosystem. Obviously, um, it's a limited number
[01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:36.860]   Like there's only the august lock. There's a lot of expected devices that haven't gotten out yet
[01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:41.420]   Um, some of my favorite companies like lutron. I love those guys
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.580]   They they're home kit certified
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:48.300]   But first alert ecobie connect sense algato higher
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:50.700]   Honeywell
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:55.340]   I devices I home insipio insti on insti on of course is a big hub
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:15:00.940]   So if you so if you could con can connect to the insti on hub then it connects to other things, right?
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:05.900]   Right. So we've seen the lutron lights you mentioned those and phillips you
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.460]   Schlage
[01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.140]   Yeah, those are
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:17.260]   Schlage now works with home kit. So okay. Yay. Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah, and that's one of the big smart smart locks, right?
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:24.380]   Well, that's that's just a big lock company. Right. Um, but there's there's since smart deadbolt is now home kit enabled
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:31.580]   I oh I've played with the sense that's that's actually an okay lock. Um, it's actually higher quality than my current quickset locks. I thought
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:34.220]   um, okay, so
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:41.020]   The thing they did was announce a unifying well one of the things they did in addition to the tv was announce a unifying app for
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:46.060]   Uh, all of these things to work together because beforehand you
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:51.100]   They had third parties do it and it was awkward. So
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:57.340]   Initially the big problem that home kit solved was around getting your devices online and security
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:03.420]   Right. Um, and that was that was why everything had to have the my fight ship. So people who bought the initial ecobie
[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:09.900]   For example, they didn't actually get a home kit certified one. So right people were upset about that
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:14.060]   Uh, same with the phillips hub, you know, I didn't upgrade to the home kit
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:17.180]   hub, but I will
[01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:19.020]   Um, so I can test it out
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:20.460]   anyway, so
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:25.340]   The new unified app looks really good and I think it was totally necessary because people were like
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:30.780]   Yay, I can turn my lights on with my voice if I have the right phone
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:32.860]   but
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:39.900]   I can't go in and set up other things to happen. So if I unlock my door, I can't set up for my lights to turn on unless i'm using like a third party app
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:46.940]   And so now apples created that sort of thing that ecosystem on its or that will come out with
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:52.860]   It's it's 10 right is that what we're on. I always 10 the next generation of iOS will have the home app
[01:16:52.860 --> 01:16:57.180]   It'll center center all this stuff, uh, so that you can use it
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:01.500]   Um, and you yeah, you got to think apple's gonna do a great job with security
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:07.580]   Um, of course the issue is all these competing standards, uh zigby and z wave and
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:14.700]   Nobody like I live in a mixed use household. So I got you know a mixed phone relationship as most people do
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:20.460]   Yeah, and I also don't think you want your devices that are going to be stuck like your locks are going to be on your door
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:25.580]   Hopefully for like a decade and you don't want to be stuck in the apple ecosystem and apple doesn't
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:29.980]   It doesn't play well with others people. I've talked to who are developing for a home kit
[01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:35.260]   Say they can only use home kit for their device at some wait a minute
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:39.340]   So I couldn't make something that worked with both home kit and smart things
[01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:41.820]   You can if you use a bridge
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:47.020]   So there's that's what the bridge is about so like a lutron bridge or some of these other things
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:50.140]   Uh, and it's it's different. It's not
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:55.500]   Because the ecobee three works with home kit and smart things. So it is possible
[01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:59.420]   It is possible. It's um, what's the code? Oh, god
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:01.500]   I
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:07.500]   Can't remember what it is that they're limiting. I'm sorry. Um, I think it's I think it's the device communication protocol
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:12.460]   I kind of would expect apple to say oh and by the way if you want to work with us
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:18.620]   You better not work with those other guys. I mean I just that to hear you say that doesn't surprise me and yet
[01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:23.500]   Uh, that's not gonna be the yeah the details of how they how they kind of enforce that
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:27.900]   Yeah, it's not going to be a good solution for people if you can't use it because not because well
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:33.580]   Is apple big enough? I guess is the question to get everybody to get all the all these guys
[01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:36.140]   in in the in the game
[01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:38.380]   Maybe not
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:45.820]   Some people refuse to work with home kit because they don't they don't like how closed off it is now apple spin open and up a little though
[01:18:45.820 --> 01:18:47.020]   I mean
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:51.580]   We saw the SDK for serie. We've seen some other kind of indications that maybe it's
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:56.940]   Well, that's the chief thing apple brings to the table. Besides of course market cloud is serie
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.900]   And the ability to talk to your home
[01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:05.980]   My echo does that but that's the problem is if you have smart things in echo you already have experienced that
[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:14.380]   Right. Do you think that apple will ever come out with a uh dedicated appliance or do you think they'll just use apple tv as their
[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:17.100]   Amazon echo or some other
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:23.580]   I think apple t make sense. I really do. I mean I thought initially they could do it with the um
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:26.860]   What's it called use bonjour and the the the
[01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:30.780]   airport express is that the Wi-Fi extenders? Yeah, I put express
[01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:36.220]   Yeah, I thought you know, you could stick a zigby or z-wave radio in there and it'd be like well bam smart home
[01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:41.980]   But the uh the air apple tv's microphone is in the remote. It's the only and it's not always listening
[01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.740]   Right
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:49.500]   So it wouldn't be as effect. I mean I that's maybe amazon and google if this hello when this hello things come out
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:52.780]   Maybe they have a leg up on apple just because of that
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:55.100]   Yeah, and I also see
[01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:59.500]   Oh, your iPhone's always listening. I was listening. That's typical of apple right?
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:05.260]   Oh, but if you wanted to use this you have to have an apple watch an iphone and a macotosh and an apple tv and then it'll all work great
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:10.540]   Typical right they're just selling more product. Go ahead. Go ahead. Uh mike
[01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:16.540]   Yeah, I was just gonna say if even if a future apple tv had the mic built in and you were supposed to just talk at the tv
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:19.180]   That wouldn't help you in the bedroom in the bathroom in the kitchen, etc
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:27.340]   And so you know, I think I'm I'm a little shocked that amazon clobbered everyone in this and get got such a head start
[01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:30.460]   It's comparable to the head start apple got with the ipad
[01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:32.940]   Which you know, they just owned it for two years
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:39.100]   And and and I think that if apple isn't seriously working on something like the amazon echo and the echo dot and so on
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:42.060]   They're they're really in trouble because I think that's going to be a huge
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:45.900]   uh market and a huge way for people to interact with their devices
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:49.180]   I always thought like I think apple should buy sonos
[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:54.780]   Uh, I know sonos has gone astray, but I think it's an it's a natural relationship
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:59.340]   But we'll see I will say so because someone asked it in the chat
[01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:04.300]   I'm currently using the wink hub as my smart home hub
[01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:07.180]   But I think most normal people are not going to want to hub
[01:21:07.180 --> 01:21:09.180]   Which is why I like that apple put it in the tv
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:14.860]   Because you know, most people are not gonna really love programming their smart home
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:18.860]   Imagine apple releasing some always listening device
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:22.620]   The hub it just means that you have to have one thing that's on your network
[01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:26.140]   That's going to manage all this stuff, but it doesn't have to be the thing that's listening
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:29.420]   So I can imagine apple making little listening devices or well
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:32.700]   I mean your watch listens and your phone listens. I guess that's the way to do it
[01:21:32.700 --> 01:21:35.420]   You need something
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:39.980]   To have just something needs to have radios. So you've got to have whatever radios you're going to want to support
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:42.060]   Right and that's that's an open thing
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:45.420]   How you want to do that? And then you need some
[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:50.220]   Computing power to remember like to execute commands when you're offline
[01:21:50.220 --> 01:21:54.220]   So if your internet goes down your life still turn off. That's actually a good point
[01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:57.100]   We've seen problems with home security systems
[01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:59.980]   Uh that don't work if you're not online
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:02.540]   So bad guy just cuts the card and you're done
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:06.140]   Some of them they use radio don't work when you jam the radio too
[01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:09.580]   So if you're going to rely on these things they have to be a little more robust
[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:13.020]   And of course apple is the kind of company that would actually
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:17.180]   Advertise the fact that they're not uploading any recordings or processing remotely
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:22.540]   It's a great opportunity for the chip companies because they're going to need a lot of processing power in order to provide
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:27.180]   You know, theory and artificial intelligence without a connection or without uploading. Yeah, exactly
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:35.180]   Apple is making a big deal about its differential privacy and this is one where
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:36.620]   um
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:42.620]   It sounds good in theory and well the devil is in the details great op-post from matthew green
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:47.100]   Uh who is one of our favorite crypto guys. He's at john's hopkins
[01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:54.060]   University his blog is a must read in the crypto community. He talks a little bit about differential privacy explains
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.540]   Uh what it has been around for a long time
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:05.020]   He said i'm gonna have to temper my initial reaction to this which is oh, it's so cool that apple's using uh our latest greatest
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:07.500]   technology he says
[01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:14.140]   On the one hand is a researcher i understand how exciting it is to see research technology actually deployed in the field and apple has a big field
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:17.900]   On the flip side of security professionals is our job to be skeptical
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:22.060]   To add a minimum demand people release their security critical code
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.820]   Or at least
[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:29.260]   To be straightforward about what it is they're deploying if apple is going to collect a significant new amount of data from the devices
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:32.060]   We depend on so much which effectively apple saying it is
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:35.820]   We should really make sure they're doing it right rather than cheering them
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:41.580]   For using such cool ideas, but if you want to find out what differential privacy is he's got a really
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:44.220]   A good explainer
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:51.820]   Here wired kind of borrowed the explainer for their article about this google uses a similar system
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:55.020]   To collect usage statistics in the chrome browser
[01:23:55.660 --> 01:24:01.340]   The example a wire gave is if you want to find out information about a group of people
[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:03.900]   Let's say if they have a criminal record
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:08.700]   But you don't want any individual to be associated with that criminal record
[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:12.940]   What you do is you ask two questions first question is flip a coin
[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:18.220]   If it's head heads lie on the next question if it's tails
[01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:24.060]   Tell the truth and don't tell us what the coin flip was next question. Do you have a criminal record
[01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:25.820]   and
[01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:32.540]   Then you can defuzz it because you know how many heads and tails they'll be and so you can get an accurate number about how many people have a criminal record without
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:35.420]   Attaching it to any individual
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:42.140]   So that's the theory behind differential privacy which apple announced but he says it really depends a lot on implementation
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:46.460]   There's kind of this curve where it's more anonymous, but less useful
[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:54.620]   Versus more useful, but really not very anonymous and how you how you twist those dials makes a very big difference in there
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:57.980]   Results here. So if you want to know more about this
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:01.100]   I encourage you to read Matthew green's post
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:10.140]   I think was today. No yesterday on his blog, which is blog. Our cryptography engineering.com and then
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:15.580]   Uh, you know apple's been very of course as usual like apple not very forthcoming about what they're doing just saying
[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:17.180]   Hey, it works and it's great
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:20.940]   So we got to put the screws to apple in a security white paper or something to explain what they're doing
[01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:25.180]   I think i'm going to bring it to iOS 10 keyboard the spotlight searches and
[01:25:25.180 --> 01:25:27.900]   and it's not an apple's interest really
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:29.180]   uh
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:33.100]   Look if apple's going to compete with google and facebook they need to mine your data
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:35.180]   and
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:39.020]   They can make a lot of noise about differential privacy, but it's not very useful in knowing about you
[01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:42.700]   You can't use it to know about you only about a group in aggregate
[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:49.500]   And so I think apple's going to wave do a lot of hand waving about differential privacy and then meanwhile start mining your data
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.500]   Just like everybody else does
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:57.420]   So what's possibly a good thing about this is that we now have with such a big company
[01:25:57.420 --> 01:26:01.900]   That is so friendly to the mainstream consumer admitting that they're going to be
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:06.940]   Sucking in more data. It's possible that you know people in congress
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:14.220]   And normal people start worrying about this a little bit more and we actually get some sort of conversation about
[01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:20.860]   How our data is being used who's got access to it. What do we know how long do the key bit etc etc
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:25.100]   I just think people are much more aware of this. I mean apple doesn't bring this up because nobody cares
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:30.060]   Right. Well that and that's that's good and they're also educating the rest of the people
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:35.660]   I don't know. I used to sit in congressional hearings and watch them and sometimes i'm amazed at it
[01:26:35.660 --> 01:26:39.180]   What they don't seem to know that congress
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:42.220]   You're amazed
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:48.700]   Well, what you're saying is they don't know stuff that we on the street normal people know
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:53.660]   Right that we kind of take for granted about how our tech works because they're a bunch of really old
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:56.300]   white men for the most part so
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:27:00.540]   And I think that it's a certainty that our next president won't know anything
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:04.460]   Much about technology Clinton admits she doesn't
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:10.220]   Yeah, and and and trump has demonstrated. Trump doesn't want to know anything about technology. So you're right
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:17.420]   Yeah, it's gonna be interesting. This is the last gasp of a generation that doesn't didn't grow up with technology though
[01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:18.620]   I mean, right
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:24.060]   Right, but in the meantime we are really given lots of people lots of data that's really useful
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:27.420]   And we're not 100 percent sure how it can be used how it can be subpoenaed
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:31.660]   How it can be our metadata can be mined to actually deliver
[01:27:31.660 --> 01:27:34.700]   personal and identifiable information
[01:27:34.700 --> 01:27:39.500]   Here's how you know if apple is doing it right or not if apple really starts to become good
[01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:44.940]   As good as for instance google now in knowing stuff about you like here's your airplane ticket
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:49.260]   I see you at the airport here's if they really start getting good at that then you pretty much know
[01:27:49.260 --> 01:27:54.380]   They're doing the same data mining that google's doing and if they remain not so good at it then they're not
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:28:02.140]   Well, not necessarily because you the reading your email and knowing your location and all that stuff can all happen entirely on the phone
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:04.220]   That's what they're saying. It's all on device
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:08.940]   Whereas google just is up and and and amazon by the way is uploading everything in fact
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:14.940]   The the actual recording of your voice is uploaded and stored and they make no bones about it
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:20.140]   Go google.com/dashboard you can see all your voice searches listen to all your voice searches
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:26.300]   You're right. I think if apple and that was the other side of this equation apple said on device a lot
[01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:31.100]   Uh, and and if if it really is true they can do this stuff effectively on device
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:35.740]   Um, then yeah, you're right. Maybe this is the right way to do it and uh
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:41.820]   Maybe google will sit up and take notice and maybe follow along because this is clearly the right way to do it
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:28:44.220]   We want to my concerns with all the privacy
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:52.300]   Conversations that people have is that everyone's complaining about the the personal data that's being sent to who knows where
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:57.660]   And i'm i'm always wondering what is the benefit exactly is the benefit really that great?
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:02.460]   I mean google now is pretty good, but it's not back right. No, I mean, it's you know, they're kind of reading your you know
[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:07.020]   You have a flight. Well, that's cool. You know, but it's like the amount of
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:13.820]   Personal information that companies like facebook or google have harvested about me. I just don't see the payoff
[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:16.780]   Not with advertising
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:20.380]   I made the mistake of not the other day of of look going and looking at a backpack
[01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:23.100]   And now every ad is a backpack and i'm not really sure
[01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:30.860]   That that's the future of of of personalize advertising. Oh, I agree all of that harm is trivial. I mean, that's not
[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:36.940]   The harm is trivial, but the benefit isn't like where's the benefit? I just don't see the benefit
[01:29:36.940 --> 01:29:39.500]   I gave them that information. This is what the best they can do with it
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:42.220]   I think you're I think that's why people are kind of aware of it now
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:45.580]   Is just merely that the recommendation engine sucks so badly
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:48.300]   That we're getting look at look at what facebook
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:54.540]   I think there's a list in our there's something our list about facebook anticipating suicide people who are contemplating suicide
[01:29:54.540 --> 01:30:00.860]   That's actually ai in data in action. It's not defined most of the stuff did it like
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:04.220]   Triggered solely at you is marketing based but
[01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:10.460]   That sort of service is also built on the backs of all the data from the post they've collected
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:13.740]   So are things like you know, don't but now okay
[01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.900]   I'm against suicide
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:19.020]   And I think anybody who's about to commit suicide is great if you can intervene
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:22.380]   But this is the kind of the ultimate in snooping
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:27.100]   It is we talked about it a couple of shows ago. I think how facebook was kind of leery about
[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:33.340]   Doing this, but I think they must have made a decision that the good outweighs the harm. I mean
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:36.700]   But who are they to make that decision?
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:41.580]   This is a this is a for-profit company
[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:44.060]   This signing. Oh, it's okay
[01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:49.180]   They're only the most important and powerful organization in the history of mankind. That's who yeah, I mean
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:51.980]   I know we've talked about this
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:55.100]   We you guys have talked about this a lot about that
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:58.140]   Town hall where somebody said hey should we prevent
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:31:03.180]   Donald Trump from winning we could just throw a switch and he would never do it and have a chance and they thought
[01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:07.820]   Let's not do we don't you know, it's like it's almost like they
[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:14.860]   The power and control that the fact that they can even ask that question. Yeah, yeah, and it's remarkable
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:20.220]   We're relying on them not feeling like it right. I mean, that's not great
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:25.820]   Yeah, they they have a larger news audience than any news or their whim history of
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:27.340]   the world
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:33.740]   Today, let's not be evil today. Maybe tomorrow. They're more powerful than almost every other government on earth
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:39.020]   I mean there there that is facebook is just true of google too though or not
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:42.940]   Yeah
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.380]   Yeah, I guess so yeah
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:49.500]   I mean google could could really mess with us if they decided to start monkey monkey when our searches
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:53.100]   There was that video that said that hilary clinton was getting a free pass
[01:31:55.260 --> 01:32:01.660]   Free pass from google's autocomplete because if you type hilary clinton cri you're not going to get crimes
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:03.500]   um
[01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:10.620]   Matt cuts weight in immediately saying absolutely false. We do that for everyone. We try not to in autocomplete
[01:32:10.620 --> 01:32:13.260]   surface
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:17.820]   Offensive stuff offensive stuff. So if you type hilary couldn't see ri you get crime reform
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:20.300]   crisis and crime bill 1994
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:23.020]   I have to point out if you type
[01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:27.900]   First of all, nobody relies on that and if you type hilary cri
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:32.220]   You get hilary criticism hilary cries hilary criminal email
[01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:39.980]   So it's clearly a filter and it would work the same way with everybody that they don't want to surface crimes in the autocomplete
[01:32:39.980 --> 01:32:45.900]   Interestingly though matt cuts pointed out that you know people who are very anti a given candidate tend to use
[01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:48.300]   Their own first name basis with their nemesis
[01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:56.140]   So that's why because because people who are who are who have a biased against hilary clinton don't say hilary clinton
[01:32:56.140 --> 01:33:02.140]   I say hilary oh interest even even trump, you know says crooked hilary right he doesn't say crooked hilary clinton
[01:33:02.140 --> 01:33:09.100]   He you know, I don't think he ever says that but you know the big story here is the is the and jeff jeff d'harvis isn't here
[01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:12.620]   So i'll be the the the inappropriately anti-trump person
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:13.660]   But
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:19.100]   Donald trump is is demonstrated contempt for silken valley and technology that's this pretty scary
[01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:26.620]   Um, for example doesn't like his coverage in the washington post and starts talking about who he's gonna go after jeff bayzos and amazon for
[01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:32.140]   Anti-trust issues, and this is another one where he's essentially pandering to the ignorance of the public
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:35.740]   Video come from him or no, it just came from a youtuber
[01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:38.380]   But didn't he didn't he uh
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:40.780]   Was thrilled to see
[01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:43.260]   We're talking about it. He might have tweeted it. Yeah, right
[01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:47.740]   And so that that's a that's a real source of concern to just be completely
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:53.660]   You know matt cuts is trying to use logic reason and facts to counter what is just a political
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:55.340]   um
[01:33:55.340 --> 01:34:03.340]   Opportunism. Yeah, and so that's a that's a little that's a little scary. Here's an interesting now and more cheerful news. Here's an
[01:34:03.340 --> 01:34:12.540]   Artificial intelligence produces realistic sounds that could fool humans. This is just wild example of machine
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:19.660]   uh learning what they did is they taught essentially machine learning to understand
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:22.700]   What kind of sounds physical
[01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:30.380]   Things in the world made by just feeding it a lot of information sounds can tell us and just to be clear
[01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:33.100]   It's not generating the sounds that recorded sounds
[01:34:33.100 --> 01:34:34.380]   It's matching
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:40.060]   Sounds with what it should sound like based on what it knows about the materials and the services that are being
[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:44.380]   Supposedly producing noises and it fooled
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:47.180]   Real people they so
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:50.460]   Soundtrack to go along with it to reform this task
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:55.100]   Well, the algorithm has to recognize the materials that are being hit and the actions that are being performed
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:57.180]   But we don't explicitly tell it about these things
[01:34:57.180 --> 01:35:01.900]   Instead it has to learn about them by recognizing patterns in the raw audio visual signal
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:03.980]   This is the video
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:08.460]   Artificial intelligence and it predicts the corresponding sequence of sound features
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:11.580]   After a network predicts sound features is a neural network
[01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:16.780]   synthesize a waveform by matching these features to a database of impact sounds and transferring the best matches
[01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:22.140]   Here are some soundtracks that are algorithm produced. This is listen leaves
[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:25.020]   It's good
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:27.020]   And then it's a stick
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:29.580]   This is computer generated sound
[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:33.980]   Oh, the sound is real, but it's matching the sounds to help understand what our models doing
[01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:37.500]   We can look at the video clips in our database that it's transferring audio from
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:41.980]   These are the audio clips whose sound features are most similar to those predicted by our model
[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:47.740]   It's kind of amazing
[01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:55.180]   You know, suddenly hollywood sound engineer. Yeah, this is the automated Foley, right? This is from mit.edu
[01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:59.180]   It's uh, it's actually doing a pretty good job fooled me
[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:03.180]   Well, what it's I mean, it's actually from a computer perspective
[01:36:03.180 --> 01:36:05.660]   if you think about
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:06.780]   matching
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:08.540]   an image to
[01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:09.260]   a
[01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:13.180]   Name of what that image is. It's kind of doing the same thing. It's matching
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:16.300]   So, I mean it is cool. No, it's just the beginning
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:20.540]   I mean, this is exactly the point is that we think of computer image image recognition
[01:36:20.540 --> 01:36:25.980]   But there's also but but we've got to get all the whole sensorium. I mean, I'm sure there's smell recognition coming any day now
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:31.740]   The big picture is that slowly but surely we're creating human cognition
[01:36:31.740 --> 01:36:35.260]   You're essentially saying okay, we're teaching this particular
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:40.620]   Machine learning AI that you know, okay, so you identify the object. That's a stick
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:45.580]   That's a bush. What do sticks sound like? What a big stick sound like what a little stick sound like what do plastic stick?
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:48.060]   You know and we're teaching them all these properties
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:51.340]   Not only recognizing what's there, but then having
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:57.260]   Teaching them using a neural network the computer is teaching itself. Yeah, just feeding it data
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:36:59.580]   Yeah
[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:04.060]   You know, we've been through several AI winners, but I think we're in an AI spring
[01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:06.700]   Yeah, yeah, very interesting
[01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:15.420]   US Air Force little plug for carbonite. You might want to think about it apparently actually you can't blame the Air Force because
[01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:22.460]   uh the automated case tracking system or acts is run for the Air Force
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:25.900]   uh by a commercial entity and
[01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:29.980]   apparently the database crashed
[01:37:30.780 --> 01:37:37.260]   And they've done everything they can to recover it and they have lost records of 100,000
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:41.660]   Investigations and everything from workplace disputes to
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:44.220]   fraud
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:46.220]   Lockheed Martin, of course the defense
[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:51.420]   Company that that manages this database for the Air Force apparently there's no backup
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:54.140]   And so these invas- unbelievable
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:59.420]   I would be insecure. We've kind of exhausted this is uh, this is a Air Force spokesperson
[01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:03.100]   We've kind of exhausted everything we can to recover within the Air Force now
[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:05.980]   We're going to outside experts to see if they can help
[01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:10.540]   I'm speaking to the trainees government has a copy of all that stuff. Yeah, maybe ask them
[01:38:10.540 --> 01:38:13.100]   uh
[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:15.100]   You might ask well
[01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:20.940]   Was this just accidental or there's some investigations ongoing investigations in there that somebody didn't want you
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:27.820]   Uh, that was my first thought to know about the database goes back to 2004, but yes, there are current investigations in there
[01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:31.020]   so, um
[01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:32.220]   Wow
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:34.220]   Talk about it. Apt
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:37.020]   I mean you had one job
[01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:39.020]   That's just bizarre. We don't win
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:43.740]   Uh, all right. Let's uh, let's wrap this up with some final thoughts
[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:44.460]   Maybe
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:47.820]   Stacy said the most stressful part about doing this is the pick of the week
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:53.580]   But i've told you stacey you may do anything you want it does not have to be anything having to do with
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:55.340]   Technology
[01:38:55.340 --> 01:38:59.500]   So I think she's like like nine out of ten times or maybe eight out of ten. It should be
[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:04.220]   Okay, I've got mine is completely weird. So okay. I'm just telling you
[01:39:04.220 --> 01:39:09.180]   Uh, but first let me tell you about this. This is my pick for never losing your keys
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:12.220]   Again, it's the tracker
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:17.900]   I love this idea. This was a kickstarter and then it's gotten better and better. This is the latest anodized aluminum
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:20.380]   Aluminum very lightweight
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:23.740]   It attaches to remotes keys even animals in fact
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:29.100]   They've got a waterproof case if you want to put it on your pet's collar and because it's so lightweight. It's really really
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:32.940]   Uh, non-unintrusive now you see I have it attached to my keys
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:37.500]   Well, the key is you you pair this to the app in your phone via bluetooth
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:40.300]   And the separation alerts go both ways
[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:45.900]   So if you lose your phone you could press the button on the tracker and the phone rings even if it's on silent
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:49.340]   And of course if you lose your keys the tracker has a map on your phone that says
[01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:52.300]   Here's where they are even inside your house. They've got a really
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:58.540]   A cool way of kind of met finding stuff even inside the house like narrowing it down. Oh, yeah
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:04.060]   It's under that seat cushion now the other thing that's cool is because there are so many tracker devices out there
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:06.460]   One and a half million devices in the wild
[01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:09.980]   They have the largest crowd GPS network in the world
[01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:12.700]   So that means if I lose my keys on the beach
[01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:14.700]   I leave the beach
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:21.020]   If somebody walks by with a tracker app running their app will see my keys and notify me
[01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:26.780]   Through the tracker network where my keys are so you can see the last time your keys were seen
[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:30.380]   Even if it's not through your own phone
[01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:35.660]   They've also partnered with companies like hp allowing companies to build trackable products
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:41.660]   And utilize utilize the scale of this tracker gps network in your your next hp device
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:47.260]   This bluetooth le so the battery lasts over a year. It is replaceable. So you just pop it out
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:50.140]   It's one of those, uh, you know dime like elithium batteries
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:55.500]   You can also purchase the water resistant case which makes it great for pet collars or you know, it
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:41:03.340]   Challenging environments you'll never lose a thing again with tracker, but you got to get a tracker for everything that you lose

[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:16.620]   I'm so feel so bad about you being nervous about this
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:22.780]   I want to start with you. So you just get this off your plate off my plate this week. I actually have something really cool
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:24.300]   um
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:25.980]   Okay
[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:30.060]   This this requires a setup. All right. Here's what i'm showing you guys. This is the
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:35.740]   Alumi who outdoor led floodlight. I l u m I
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:42.540]   Yes, the reason this is cool is because it's the only color changing outdoor rated light bulb. Oh
[01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:44.780]   I have I have found this a b r
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:47.180]   um whatever
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:48.620]   30 b r 30
[01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:52.540]   Um, it is i'm looking at ip 64 rated in uv coded
[01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:57.020]   So i've had this outside in the rain for like two weeks now two and a half weeks
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:01.580]   And it's rained a lot here in austin. It's on my roof. So it's super hot super
[01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:04.540]   intense and
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:06.540]   That is that
[01:43:06.540 --> 01:43:09.260]   So here's here's what it does. Oh, that's blue. Oh
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:12.700]   So it's like a hue, but it's the one that you can put outside
[01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:15.340]   Yes, and
[01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:17.820]   So it's also hue doesn't have a good um
[01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:19.420]   kind of
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:23.660]   Green color, but this one does not that I really recommend that but you know
[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:29.100]   So here's the other cool thing that it does you guys you don't need a hub for this either
[01:43:29.100 --> 01:43:34.780]   Which is nice. No, the hue requires a light. Yeah, now, okay. I will tell you these are on my roof
[01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:38.300]   Well, right now it's on my desk next to me, but if we're on my roof
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:43.980]   Because my office is out of range. All right, I couldn't actually control it. You have to go upstairs to do your lights
[01:43:43.980 --> 01:43:46.620]   Yes, okay. So here's the party
[01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.620]   fun thing
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:50.620]   Let's see if it
[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:51.500]   It's gonna
[01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.540]   Oh
[01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:54.140]   It's a disco
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:56.140]   in Stacy's
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:56.940]   House
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:44:01.340]   So the lights if you're not watching are going in different colors to the music
[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:06.140]   So and there's there's actually different themes you could that's actually really fun
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:09.260]   Isn't that fun? And so the downside is
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:14.620]   It's through spotify. Okay. So I'm an android. It's through spotify and google play. Okay
[01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:19.100]   Um, that's why I can't run it over my sonos, but if you turn the volume down on this
[01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:24.540]   And then you play the same thing over like your extra justice. You still get that kind of fun flashiness, right?
[01:44:24.540 --> 01:44:29.980]   Oh, this is now. Here's a question because I see it has power on default
[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:33.900]   One of the things and I got somebody calling the radio show this weekend about it
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:35.180]   And I had to agree with them
[01:44:35.180 --> 01:44:40.060]   The default and the hue lights is if the power goes out they come on fully bright
[01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:45.260]   And which means I don't want this in my bedroom because it happened to me about three in the morning
[01:44:45.260 --> 01:44:47.260]   All my lights come on all the way up
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:51.020]   And I'm going what the what the what and I'm scrambling around
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:53.820]   Fortunately, said the presence of mine to go flip the switch
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:56.300]   I'm trying to find my phone to turn off the
[01:44:56.300 --> 01:44:57.820]   You didn't tell your echo to turn them off
[01:44:57.820 --> 01:45:03.580]   No, I didn't had this is before I had an echo and I was actually one of the reasons I haven't since reinstalled the hues
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:09.340]   Can you say to the power on default is off? It looks like you can on this. I don't know
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:13.500]   This has never happened to me says power on defaults. That's implies that you can
[01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:16.540]   That does also says it can detect your presence
[01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:21.260]   Oh, I think through bluetooth so it knows when my smart house there
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:22.460]   So when you get
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:28.140]   I know but I like that if you walk in the room it can see that you're home and it will turn on the lights. I like that
[01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:31.820]   That clap on you don't even have to clap anymore
[01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:39.100]   No clapping. Yep music sync rising. That's that's my thing because you know, it's all right. It'll do me
[01:45:39.100 --> 01:45:42.220]   I l-u-m-i
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:44.700]   And there's more though
[01:45:44.700 --> 01:45:46.700]   But wait, she's not done. Oh
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:51.580]   Do you want to do your austin die apart? I'm fine with it. It's a super it's a super
[01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:58.780]   Uh, well-known dive bar in austin. So it's not like this is going to be secret for anyone. I already have one bar. I love in austin
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:00.540]   That's the alamo
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:03.180]   Draft house because it's a movie theater bar
[01:46:03.180 --> 01:46:11.260]   They have free movies during the summertime for kids. They're all kids movies, but like I've actually considered moving to austin just because of alamo
[01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:15.340]   Yeah, it's a good place. Um, so they asked me for a dive bar
[01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:22.620]   So I did provide them with a little Longhorn saloon because at 4 p.m. On sundays you can play a game called chicken
[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:26.860]   poop bingo. They don't like that because we're in texas
[01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:33.340]   Um, so what it the game basically is they feed this chicken. They let it run around on a bingo
[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:35.500]   but
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:39.660]   You put bets on where it's gonna poop and poop everywhere
[01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:42.620]   Mmm
[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:46.140]   And there's video
[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:48.380]   Of course there's video
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:50.540]   I mean, this is basically an excuse to get
[01:46:50.540 --> 01:46:54.140]   Genny's little long lorn saloon good music. I bet right
[01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:59.100]   And the tourist magnet i like the sats by south west
[01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:03.340]   Oh, it's tiny
[01:47:03.340 --> 01:47:09.020]   Yes, it's out and burn it. Do you go if I lived in austin i would go out for music every night
[01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:11.580]   Do you go out at least once a week?
[01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:13.820]   Um, I've got a kid so i'm waiting for her to grow up
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:18.460]   But I do go out like at least probably two times a month such great music in austin it is
[01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:23.580]   And I have a feeling you know my only experience is during south by I have a feeling i really
[01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:29.500]   I should go there when the tourists are not in town. I'm normal. Yeah, you should come with like in the october
[01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:34.540]   November it's beautiful weather. Okay people will play outside deal
[01:47:35.180 --> 01:47:38.860]   And then I can go play a chicken poop bingo at jenny's little long horn
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:42.460]   Yeah, and if you're there you'll be a near my neck of the wood so you can stop on by
[01:47:42.460 --> 01:47:45.100]   Really? That's your neighborhood bar?
[01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:47.180]   It's not my neighborhood
[01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:53.180]   Hey, it's okay. There's no shame in that mary jofoli our host on windows weekly has a neighborhood bar rattling home
[01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:55.180]   Of course, she lives in manhattan
[01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:56.620]   But uh
[01:47:56.620 --> 01:48:01.900]   My neighborhood bar would be the dry creek saloon which is uh, bun i like that i like that
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:07.340]   When you lived in petaloma, what was your neighborhood bar mike elk?
[01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:14.940]   Uh, it was my kitchen actually you had some good stuff there. I remember that. Yes. Yeah, no, there's actually a new place
[01:48:14.940 --> 01:48:18.060]   Um after petaluma, I moved to kotate which is
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:24.140]   And even smaller town north of petaloma and I used to go there's a burger place. They don't recall
[01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:30.380]   Uh recall what it was oh, I know what you're talking about. Yeah, yeah, they'd have outdoor like fire and you sit around the fire
[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:34.860]   One of those kind of places that was a great place to hang out and drink well good
[01:48:34.860 --> 01:48:38.540]   Come back. We've always got a spot for you just come back any old time you want
[01:48:38.540 --> 01:48:42.860]   I will do you're on the road are you gonna stay in la for a while? What's your what are your plans?
[01:48:42.860 --> 01:48:48.300]   No, i'm gonna be back and forth between la and the bay area over the next couple of weeks
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:52.700]   And then we're going to new york and then we are going to france we're gonna look at this out of france
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:55.180]   God, I hate you. Oh wow
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:59.180]   And it's worth all the contempt that people feel for me
[01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:03.420]   God, that's my dream right there. Lisa and I talk about that all the time
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:07.980]   Yeah, it's it's really awesome. And you're the south of france either one or both
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:12.060]   We live there last we live in tuscany before as well. That's I must do
[01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:15.100]   Hey, so if you don't mind leo, I've got a couple of things
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:17.980]   I've got a I've got a tool and also a tip and the tool
[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:20.780]   I don't know how much you've talked about motion stills
[01:49:20.780 --> 01:49:22.940]   Uh
[01:49:22.940 --> 01:49:28.140]   No, go ahead. Okay. So one of my favorite things to do is to is to explore the ultimate
[01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:31.980]   Mobile computing experience by combining google stuff and apple stuff
[01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:36.860]   And I really think that oftentimes you get the best of both worlds with these and this is a perfect example
[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:39.900]   Motion stills is a is an app created by google
[01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:42.220]   That uses
[01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:47.260]   The iphones live photos feature so live photos of course if you leave the default on and have live photos
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:49.740]   Go you just take a picture but it actually takes a little video
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:55.980]   Which you can you know very short that you can see in here by pressing and holding or in certain circumstances where you can
[01:49:55.980 --> 01:49:58.700]   Actually use this live but even use it for the wallpaper and stuff
[01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:03.580]   So motion stills actually adds googly goodness to the
[01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:10.780]   The live photos it will stabilize them so that if they're you know tend to be very unstable
[01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:13.660]   It'll stabilize them and also allow you to very instantly
[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:18.380]   Create a gif and use that as a gift anywhere else
[01:50:18.380 --> 01:50:21.420]   So weird that apple didn't do this is their own format
[01:50:21.420 --> 01:50:26.540]   Exactly i'm sure they'll come out later with these features, but what's great about it
[01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:32.060]   What I love so first of all if you're using this you do have an iphone and you do use live photos
[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:36.220]   Make sure you go in and the default is medium quality which I never get
[01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:40.140]   Throw it on high quality and give it and there's also an option to get rid of the watermark
[01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:45.340]   It'll put its own motion stills logo. Oh, oh, it's weird. I want to get rid of that. Yeah, yeah, it's ugly
[01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:50.300]   And so make sure you do those two things and then and then what you do is
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:54.300]   You know just go what what I love about it is the fact that it creates these
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:57.340]   These videos or gifts by default
[01:50:57.340 --> 01:51:02.060]   So you just take pictures and forget all about motion stills and then you're like, oh, yeah, motion stills and you go into the app and
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:03.900]   They're all there already
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:06.620]   And you and they they're created instantly on the fly
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:10.140]   So you can just go through and say I don't that didn't work. Oh, look at that one
[01:51:10.140 --> 01:51:14.220]   That was really cool that really worked and then you can just post it and share it on facebook or wherever
[01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:17.820]   Really highly recommended for anybody who uses an iPhone
[01:51:17.820 --> 01:51:21.340]   Okay, so that's my pick of the week now. I also like to
[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:23.260]   to
[01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:29.500]   Do a kind of a thing that we need to be reminded of once in a while which is that there are fantastic full-length movies
[01:51:29.500 --> 01:51:34.380]   Available for free easily accessible on in various places
[01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:41.340]   Especially youtube so for for people who are younger and hear cultural references that refer to movies
[01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:44.380]   And you may not have ever seen the movie and where do you see the movie?
[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:47.500]   You know the video places don't really have it because it's too old or whatever
[01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:50.860]   So you might have heard people refer to russia moan. It's his japan
[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:58.060]   Amazing movie. Yeah or night of the living dead the original zombie movie or sex lives in videotape or any of these the man with the movie camera
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:04.140]   Fantastic very old russian movie for anybody who's into cameras and movies and cinematography
[01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:06.620]   You got to see the man with the movie camera. Okay, but these are all
[01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:14.940]   All these that I just told you are available full-length in good definition on youtube and we'll put the links in the show page
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:17.820]   on twit.tv/twig and
[01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:22.940]   You can see you can just click over and watch these full-length movies fantastic idea
[01:52:22.940 --> 01:52:26.860]   But it's more of the the whole idea you can also subscribe to channels on youtube like
[01:52:26.860 --> 01:52:29.420]   timeless classic movie and there are
[01:52:29.420 --> 01:52:36.060]   A bunch of others that just have full-length movies and you can always go and see what people are talking about when they make these cultural references
[01:52:36.380 --> 01:52:44.940]   Related to that we've probably all heard about a documentary very long documentary multiple hours long called oj made in america about oj simpson
[01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:48.700]   And this is critics are just loving this documentary
[01:52:48.700 --> 01:52:53.660]   So about oj simpson's childhood in san francisco and gonguisee and all that stuff
[01:52:53.660 --> 01:52:58.460]   And a lot of interest has been regenerated by the the oj simpson trial
[01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:05.980]   Series that came out recently. Yeah, but but esp yeah is the is the filmmaker behind it's one of the 30 on 30s, right?
[01:53:06.380 --> 01:53:09.020]   Yeah, yeah, so you can watch the whole thing
[01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:14.380]   All seven nine hours, whatever it is on the esp n site as of today
[01:53:14.380 --> 01:53:21.500]   And simply go to esp n dot go dot com and then watch it watch spn and then that's it
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:27.500]   And that on that on the right you'll see all of the episodes of this oj made in america series and again
[01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:32.700]   I haven't seen it personally. I'm going to go see it over the next few days, but critics say this is the most
[01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:35.820]   amazing documentary in all in a long time
[01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:41.900]   Yeah, well good you gave me something to watch tonight. Yeah, thank you all night all
[01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:46.700]   Seven hour document. I didn't realize it was that long. Yeah, I thought it might be 30 minutes given the name
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:48.380]   Oh
[01:53:48.380 --> 01:53:49.420]   Oh, well
[01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:53.660]   Thank you, uh, mike elgin. It's really great to have you what at some point. I would love to talk
[01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:55.740]   We didn't even really talk about it
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:54:00.940]   About apples ketchup attempts with the photos apple photos to catch up with google photos
[01:54:01.420 --> 01:54:03.420]   If if they can do it on
[01:54:03.420 --> 01:54:09.820]   Device and without revealing stuff that might be an interesting alternative to google photos seems like they're doing a lot of the same things
[01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:16.380]   It might be but you know, I got to say regardless of what personal information is collected or whatever google photos is the most
[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:18.620]   Under-appreciated fantastic
[01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:24.140]   Site and service out there. It's I get so much out of it. You know what if you have an iPhone you can use both
[01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:26.300]   That's the beauty part. Yep. Yep
[01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:33.180]   Couple of tips for me one, uh, you can now use your facebook messenger as your sms program on android facebook has
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:37.980]   Restored that feature and you know it makes a pretty good text messaging
[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:40.860]   Service. So one of the nice things about android
[01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:44.540]   Uh is that you can choose what uh, you know
[01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:49.980]   Launcher you want to use you could choose what your default email program is and you could choose your default
[01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:55.580]   Text message program you can of course use google hangouts or the messages program that came with your android phone
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:55:03.260]   But you might want to think about using facebook messages all of those rich messages features that apple showed and they still work with sms
[01:55:03.260 --> 01:55:05.740]   and you could send messages to
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:14.780]   Phone numbers as well as to other facebook users and internet users. So, um, i've replaced my little hangouts icon in the in the bottom of the
[01:55:14.780 --> 01:55:20.300]   Screen with the facebook messenger icon. It works quite well. And then finally for you, uh,
[01:55:20.300 --> 01:55:23.020]   This is an interesting intersection of sets
[01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:30.460]   If you are in the set of harry potter fans and the set of command line bash shell users
[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:37.500]   That's probably pretty narrow slice. You will be interested in these harry potter aliases from now on
[01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.900]   Instead of typing w get you can use
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:44.380]   Oxio if you'd like to remove all file files ava cadavra
[01:55:44.380 --> 01:55:51.020]   Empyrio is pseudo prior in cantato will give you the history stupefai will sleep your machine
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:57.740]   When guardian leviosa will move files around turn the sound off with sennoris turn it back on with quietus
[01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:01.180]   Yes, many of the best harry potter spells
[01:56:01.180 --> 01:56:05.740]   Now usable on the bash command line whether you're using windows 10
[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:08.300]   Uh makantash or a linux box
[01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:11.900]   Uh, okay. I want that as an echo sdk
[01:56:11.900 --> 01:56:15.100]   So you can actually control your blinds. Oh
[01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:21.020]   See like this is when I got back from harry potter world. I wanted to use my wine my wand to like control that
[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:26.380]   My house you could do that with the echo you totally could get there and be like I'll work on that just for you
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:29.660]   I've been wanting an echo skill would want an excuse to write an echo skill
[01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:30.940]   That would be a good one
[01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:37.180]   And the best of all the neighbors kids can uh can shout commands at your echo from outside and open and close the blinds
[01:56:37.180 --> 01:56:41.980]   Expecto patronum and you hear cow sounds or you know
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:47.420]   It'll be awesome. I will work on that just I don't have that automation. I gotta say
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:52.620]   What is your what is your spirit animal? You'll I have some questions for you so that we can customize it just for

[01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:43.580]   If you want to find out about refunds if you paid for the service, I loved the service
[01:58:43.580 --> 01:58:49.980]   It was a great service for getting insights into your social accounts including facebook instagram and twitter
[01:58:49.980 --> 01:58:57.020]   But unfortunately according to anneal changes to the api and requirements on fenced facebook instagram and twitter
[01:58:57.020 --> 01:59:01.340]   Made it just impossible for them to stay in business and to continue so they're
[01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:07.100]   Shutting, uh, think up down and we really uh, we'll miss it because it was a very useful tool
