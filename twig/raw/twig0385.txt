[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.840]   episode 385 for Wednesday, December 28, 2016.
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.400]   The year's best.

[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.720]   Hello, everybody, and welcome to a very special Twig.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.440]   For the last show, 2016, I decided
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.760]   to give the staff off a week off.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.120]   Stacy's off with her daughter and her husband
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.080]   having a lovely Christmas.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.080]   Jeff Jarvis is off lighting fires around Republican headquarters
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.080]   nationwide.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.560]   But no, I'm kidding.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.120]   Getting, it's a joke.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.400]   But we do have some of the best moments from 2016.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.000]   And we had a lot of fun in a lot of different ways.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.600]   Twig I always think of is our most intellectual show
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.680]   because of its hosts.
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.480]   Let's go way back to the beginning of the year.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.680]   Before Stacy Higginbotham joined us as a regular,
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.040]   Jeff Jarvis is here, of course, our great friend,
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.120]   Gina Trapani and Lindy Johnson.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.760]   And as fitting, I had just come back from vacation aboard
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.480]   one of the largest cruise ships in the world.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.240]   And we were playing with the Theta 360 Cam, the 360 degree
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.080]   camera.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.000]   And there's a little bit here from the boat watch.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.800]   Well, you saw that I did bring a good camera on my cruise.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.520]   And I took a lot of iPhone pictures.
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.920]   But ultimately, most of my pictures
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.520]   were that Ricoh Theta as the 360 degree camera.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.560]   I'm really excited about that.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.400]   Can you see using that just in general life?
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.120]   Well, I think I did.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.480]   You did.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.840]   That's what we did.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.340]   Yeah.
[00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.840]   This is general life.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.140]   Yeah.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.080]   I'm using it quite a bit.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.140]   And I posted it on YouTube.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.220]   If you go to my Leoloport YouTube channel,
[00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.500]   you can see all the videos.
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:36.020]   But it's still not very good.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.020]   Now I'm going to friend envy your life.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.860]   Will you please?
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.760]   Will you please just envy my life?
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.800]   Definitely.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.340]   The quality is not great.
[00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.460]   What's great is, though, that you
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.460]   could put this on Facebook or Google,
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.780]   people were-- I was loving the reactions in the comments.
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.940]   People would say, wait a minute.
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.740]   I turned my phone and the picture turns.
[00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.020]   Because if you have an up-to-date phone with up-to-date
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.420]   Facebook, your picture will follow your phone's angle.
[00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.900]   And you can look around.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.140]   It's very easy to shoot these.
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.300]   You don't have to pan or anything.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.540]   You're just holding this stick and you're just taking pictures
[00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.780]   as you walk or whatever.
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.980]   And I wish the quality were better.
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.460]   I wish it had an external microphone.
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.540]   But you know the next-- this is the third generation.
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.660]   The next one will get-- this guy bumps me over here.
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.620]   I'll get-- it gets better.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.980]   But this is the robot bar where the-- we're robotic arms.
[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.380]   The same arms that are stealing the jobs of American workers
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.900]   everywhere.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.740]   Stila--
[00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.700]   I'm Chris's job.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.380]   --stila bartender's job.
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.580]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.500]   Nice.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.860]   Yeah.
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.620]   Two bartenders.
[00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.260]   How do I work like that?
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.780]   Although I'm thinking somebody's got to fill those bottles that
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.380]   are hanging from the ceiling.
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.980]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.480]   So--
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.980]   So those arms are reaching out for those bottles
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.420]   and pouring drinks?
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.420]   So watch.
[00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.900]   We're going to-- you order a drink.
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.580]   This is-- I loved this.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.420]   It looks like an iPad.
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.020]   It's an Android device.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.860]   It's running a dedicated app.
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.820]   We'll turn it here.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:59.620]   I'll jump ahead a little bit.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.980]   We'll turn it around and I'll show you.
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.580]   So you can order--
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.740]   you tap it-- by the way, you're wearing an RF-enabled bracelet
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.900]   called a wow band.
[00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.820]   Wow!
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.140]   It's like, jam!
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.660]   It's a wow band.
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.740]   And you tap the wow band to the--
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.220]   which I did about a bunch of times.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.220]   And then you can enter in your drink.
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.860]   And that will be sent to the robot bartender.
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.300]   So there's the drink that I--
[00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.660]   non-alcoholic, of course.
[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.620]   By the way, adding insult to injury is a $4 drink.
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.980]   And then he added an 18% tip for the robot.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.500]   No.
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.340]   No.
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.700]   What the hell?
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.420]   Listen, robot rights.
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.620]   Robot rights!
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.140]   So watch.
[00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.340]   The robot now has a cup in its hand.
[00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.700]   And it puts it down.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.820]   This is going to be Y Cup.
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.580]   And then it has a container.
[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.460]   And it goes around and it fills it up.
[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.460]   There's a soda in the back.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.900]   And it's going to get some juice from those hanging bottles
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.220]   or booze bottles.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.500]   And the woman is showing me that my name is up here
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.940]   and what drink and what stage the robot is in with the drink
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.980]   is over there.
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.020]   Who buses your drink if you don't tip them well?
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.540]   Who buses the tables humans have the menial jobs, of course.
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.940]   Because they don't allow the robots to roam freely.
[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.580]   That would be dangerous.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.780]   You gave me 18%.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.100]   This is just a record.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.580]   In the now?
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.060]   Yeah.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.660]   Regular Royal Caribbean cruise.
[00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.060]   Leo, this is top drawer stuff.
[00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.620]   Well, the reason I went on this boat-- because I had to go to New Jersey
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.660]   to be on this boat, which is crazy.
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.860]   Because I went to New Jersey to sail to the Caribbean.
[00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.140]   But the reason I went on this boat
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.700]   is because this is a brand new boat.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.500]   This is their state of the art technology.
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.300]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.260]   And it's very exclusive.
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.420]   There are only 5,000 other people on this boat with me.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.180]   But the robot bar, you know, it's not too crowded.
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.580]   You know, it's not jammed with people.
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.020]   I love it that you can look around.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.020]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.260]   Yeah, that's amazing.
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.660]   And then you tap your well band on the bar when the robot's done
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.180]   and the drink comes sliding out to you.
[00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.740]   That way, nobody can steal your drink.
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.500]   Oh.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.700]   Is that clever?
[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.780]   Oh, very nice.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.580]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.860]   I enjoyed it.
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.900]   He's faking, faking, faking, phone companies.
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.940]   All right, let's get to it.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.180]   We've been holding off.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.460]   I've been putting it off Jeff and Verizon.
[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.580]   Never a love story.
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.580]   No.
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.580]   Never.
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.060]   Never.
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.420]   Never.
[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.900]   And people who asked me, do they ever hook up your Nexus 7?
[00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.700]   No, they never did.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.140]   So I had my wife's iPad on it.
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.860]   And I had my own Pixel still on it.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.060]   Stupidly, I hadn't canceled it.
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.660]   I was using the LTE on that.
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.420]   But I had two things on it.
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.060]   And I was paying $50 a month for those two things.
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.540]   30 buck data plus 10 bucks per line.
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:52.340]   And suddenly, it was Christmas time,
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.820]   so we weren't using either.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.260]   There was some girl that were at home.
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.660]   And suddenly, I get data warnings.
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.380]   You're going over data.
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.220]   You're going over data.
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.220]   You went over data.
[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.220]   Oh, you're way over data.
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.300]   What the hell?
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.820]   So go on.
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.420]   And somebody had hacked the account and added or switched
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.580]   the two lines to two iPhone 6s.
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.220]   Brought a gig of data immediately
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.460]   used 2.6 gigs of data.
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.980]   Si, hour and a half on the phone,
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.620]   dealing with five different people with Verizon.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.780]   Stupid sandwich.
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.620]   Just amazing.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.180]   They have no good process for this.
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.340]   It's their problem.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.620]   So they changed my password.
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.180]   This is not going to happen again, Mr. Jarvis.
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.500]   We're all fixed up.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:30.980]   All right.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.420]   Number one, they didn't change the password.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.740]   They came back and did it again.
[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.100]   Number two, they didn't fix it up.
[00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.020]   Third time, I tried to kill the Chromebook.
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.860]   I can't kill that.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.100]   It's back again.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.340]   I finally said enough.
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.140]   I wanted a divorce.
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.620]   I went to the store and I said, just kill everything.
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.220]   I put my wife's iPad onto our AT&T account.
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.900]   I saved a net of $60 a month by doing this.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.300]   And I waved goodbye to Verizon.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.580]   Well, two points for this.
[00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:00.100]   So at one point in this, I had to go on my online Verizon.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.180]   They can set up the account.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.420]   And I had to come up with a friggin password.
[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:08.620]   So the password I wanted was F spelled out Verizon.
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.060]   And honest to God, I swear to truth
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.260]   said bad password too easy to guess.
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.420]   That's too obvious.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.140]   Too easy to guess that our customers would feel this way
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.860]   at the point in which they're setting up their password.
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.700]   And by the way, screw Verizon, the same answer.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.780]   Really?
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.300]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.180]   How hard was the pushback when you said,
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.060]   I wanted to cancel everything.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.820]   How hard did they push back?
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.460]   Oh, they didn't cry or they just didn't do it.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.140]   So then they got to cry because I never
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.500]   think so.
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.620]   They don't have to push back.
[00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.060]   They just ignore you.
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.580]   For a very nice lady, right?
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.100]   There's one nice lady who works in Verizon HQ.
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.620]   And when you're big trouble on social media, don't we know?
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.740]   Like, Lynn, don't you advise your people?
[00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:56.740]   She calls you.
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.700]   It says, but Jarvis, what could we do to help you?
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.700]   And I said, what you can do to help me?
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.060]   I said, you're very nice.
[00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.380]   But your company is the spawn of Satan.
[00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:05.780]   I wanted a horse.
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.620]   I never want to see you again.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.940]   The count hasn't died.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.180]   I want you to kill the account forever.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.740]   And she was very nice at accommodating and did it.
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.460]   Why is it so hard to have that be the standard for customer
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:17.660]   service?
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:19.420]   Well, and why do you have to have half a million Twitter
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.740]   followers to get it done?
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:22.540]   Exactly.
[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.860]   So by Verizon, bye-bye, the by Verizon mobile.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.060]   Bye-bye.
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.660]   Bye-bye.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.460]   Oh, they took up the nice lady big guns.
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.100]   Yeah.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.860]   I got the nice lady from Comcast a couple of years ago
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.140]   because I was tweeting and really unhappy with the customer
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.180]   service, as you know.
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.540]   And the funny thing is, I thought the nice lady was going
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:44.220]   to take care of me.
[00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.220]   Mostly she just basically said, could you stop tweeting?
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.180]   Just stop, please stop tweeting about this.
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.740]   Stop tweeting.
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.140]   And I thought, well, this is really changed.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.140]   We're from Frank Elias and in Comcast Cares,
[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.740]   when they really didn't-- like they said, OK,
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.260]   let's see if we can fix this.
[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.460]   They've really come full circle now to just--
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.860]   all we really want you to do is to stop talking about it.
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.460]   What do we have to do to get you to stop tweeting?
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.620]   We're not going to fix anything.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.780]   We just want you to stop tweeting, please.
[00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.460]   Nice ladies don't get paid enough.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.420]   They need to pay them more.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.860]   No, no, no.
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.340]   She's very nice.
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.500]   No, they actually hire people who sound nice.
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.940]   Oh, and I didn't want it.
[00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.460]   With no one in this, I went cyclo with no one.
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.380]   But I did say, I'm at my edge, folks.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:24.740]   Yeah.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:25.740]   This is obvious.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.260]   This is obvious.
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.580]   This is easy.
[00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:30.300]   So you went to AT&T?
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.260]   I was already on AT&T.
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.260]   It's all my unlimited account.
[00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.300]   Oh, OK.
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.940]   And I had shared stuff there, so I just added it there.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.340]   And I reduced a gig, and I saved money, and it's wonderful.
[00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.700]   I'm happy.
[00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.100]   But I share Verizon Fios, and I'm happy with that all and all.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.060]   But Verizon Mobile is just spod of Satan.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.060]   I think they all suck.
[00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:52.460]   Come on, can we just admit this?
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.460]   They all know.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:54.540]   It's not--
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.500]   People in the AT&T story, there's one friend of mine named Hugo
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.860]   who's been very helpful through Twit.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.020]   Hey, friend of AT&T.
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.940]   I just found them-- yes, they're all problems, the companies.
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.260]   But all and all the AT&T people I've dealt with
[00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.380]   have all and all been nicer and more competent.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.700]   There's a different culture there.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.580]   The Verizon culture is, we're number one.
[00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.100]   Right.
[00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.700]   [YAWN]
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.580]   If you are not yet a subscriber to our Twit newsletter,
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.300]   Good News, you can be a charter subscriber.
[00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.780]   You can get the very first newsletter that goes out Sunday.
[00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.540]   If you go to Twit.tv/newsletter and subscribe,
[00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.500]   it's double opt-in.
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.300]   So we're not going to opt you in.
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:35.820]   You've got to send an email and click a link.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.700]   It will send you an email.
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.700]   You click a link.
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.340]   What is that?
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.300]   Something just-- some words just flew in.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.620]   Were those left off the newsletter?
[00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.820]   Now they flew right off the lower third.
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.620]   I've never seen that happen.
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:48.820]   They escaped.
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:52.460]   Twit.tv/newsletter is the place if you'd
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.220]   like to get our newsletter.
[00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.620]   And I will be writing little blurbs in there and others.
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:58.260]   It'll be mostly a look at what's ahead in the week
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:59.300]   on the network.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:05.140]   Twit.tv/newsletter.
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.060]   So we tie those letters down.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.740]   We've had so many great guests on this week in Google.
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.140]   I think of ours Technica's Rana Modio.
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.580]   Man, he knows everything there is to know about Android.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.020]   And every once in a while, we get a visit.
[00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.580]   We haven't had one lately because Matt's
[00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.460]   gone to work for the federal government.
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.220]   Maybe he'll be back soon, in a couple of weeks.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.140]   But one of my favorites is one of the earliest Googlers.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:30.620]   Matt is, I think, employee 11, something like that.
[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.820]   Matt cuts for many years was in charge
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.740]   of keeping spammy links out of Google search results.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.380]   He's on the sabbatical from Google.
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.780]   And as I mentioned, I think he's
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.660]   working for Code for America or something like that.
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.140]   But he was on the show back in March
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.700]   when we started talking about how Twitch works.
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:53.220]   As usual, I'm completely befuddled.
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.300]   Well, that's a perfect segue to the next story down the row.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.540]   A little bit is Twitch is now giving Julia's child--
[00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.020]   This is just weird.
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.140]   Julie's child channel on Twitch.
[00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.220]   OK, as well, we take a chicken and cut it into the water.
[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:08.780]   Right.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.500]   Take it back to the water.
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.580]   Yeah, this is definitely before my time.
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.060]   The thing they did before this was Bob Ross.
[00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.580]   And that was pretty cool because he's a chill guy in pain.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.500]   And it's interesting.
[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.020]   That was really neat.
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.260]   That was really neat.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.900]   It's just cool to see him paint.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:23.740]   But this is like, I don't know, you don't get to eat the food
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.820]   afterwards, so.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.260]   I grew up watching this show, "The French Chef."
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:33.180]   It was really the first cooking show on PBS.
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.180]   And she was a very unlikely superstar.
[00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:37.700]   I met her.
[00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:41.140]   She's very tall, was very tall.
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.540]   And every bit is kind of kooky as she kind of came across.
[00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:45.580]   This is awesome.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:47.220]   What's great is it's very, very live.
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:47.980]   There's no--
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.660]   I mean, things happen.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.820]   She stuck a mixer.
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.660]   I mean, she stuck a spoon in a mixer last night.
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.180]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.260]   Anyone flying across the set.
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:56.900]   You've been watching it all day, huh?
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.740]   I was watching it last night.
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.340]   Yeah.
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.900]   She was making some sort of orange butter.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.620]   No, it's totally not a--
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.340]   because nobody knew about cooking shows.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.340]   She invented it.
[00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.980]   I'm purposely hiding the comment section
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.260]   because there's a lot of stuff coming up.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.140]   It's weird, but it's interesting to watch.
[00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:16.300]   A lot of the younger audience are like, whoa, this is so cool.
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.740]   What is that?
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.620]   Why is the video black and white?
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.020]   This with Twitch chat has got to be like the best thing ever.
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.500]   Come on.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.420]   Yeah, I'm not showing it.
[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:27.100]   We don't really want to.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.060]   What kind of a filter is that?
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.100]   And the thing everybody uses now on Twitch
[00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.340]   is these avatars that are people's heads,
[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.820]   like there's a Bob Ross head.
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.860]   And I imagine there'll be a Julian Shylehead eventually.
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:42.700]   I don't get that.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.460]   So do you see all the heads going by?
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.660]   Do you understand that?
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.340]   Jason, you're a young person.
[00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:52.820]   Not at all.
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.180]   Young person on set would be this person right here.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:57.460]   Actually, it's a culture.
[00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.300]   It's a subculture that's--
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.980]   And this is the thing, like they announced YouTube gaming.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:07.300]   And Twitch has all of this culture stuff
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.740]   that YouTube gaming is not going to have.
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.020]   That's where the community is.
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.820]   But yeah, all of those emotes--
[00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.860]   They're emotes and they mean something.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.140]   They mean something.
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.140]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.900]   They all mean some kind of emotion.
[00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:24.740]   The one everybody does is Kappa, which is some guy's head.
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.900]   He's like a Twitch developer.
[00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.100]   And he's making kind of a sarcastic face.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.220]   So that's for sarcasm.
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.020]   And there's a million other ones.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.060]   Yeah, I think if you really want to get into it,
[00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.460]   you can mouse over it probably.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.860]   And you'll get--
[00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.500]   you should get maybe a tool tip.
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.580]   That's the what face.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.740]   You can look it up.
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.300]   And then there's baby rage.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.220]   But that one's the what face.
[00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.620]   It's just its own set of--
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.540]   The Kramer one.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.980]   The Kramer one, they call that the POG champ.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.260]   Right.
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.940]   I know what Pogs are.
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.540]   POG champ is--
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.020]   it's a guy and there's a video somewhere.
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:04.060]   There was like a YouTube video of a guy making that expression.
[00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.100]   And Twitch staff thought it was funny.
[00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.980]   So they just cut his head out and stuck it in there.
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.380]   I feel so old.
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.260]   But yeah, you can--
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.620]   Well, it's not your meme.
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.740]   Go look it up.
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.900]   Yeah, but it's what happened in the Appalachia.
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:20.020]   When you cut people off from the rest of the world for 100 years,
[00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.820]   they develop their own language.
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.180]   And that's what's happened in Twitch.
[00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:26.340]   These are people who never get outside anymore.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.740]   I don't know what you mean home out there.
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.740]   [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.100]   That's so wrong.
[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.060]   That's so wrong.
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:37.580]   Let's say the Appalachia of the internet is what it is.
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.300]   This is one I wasn't here for.
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.380]   I've seen it many times.
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.500]   And I kick myself that I wasn't here.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.540]   I was taking some time off in June.
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.780]   And Jason Howell filled in for me.
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.740]   Jeff and Gina and Ron Richards are on the show.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:57.180]   And Jason was trying to do a little public service announcement,
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.340]   encouraging everybody to turn on two-factor authentication
[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.500]   when things went horribly wrong.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.940]   I think I did something I should not have done, you guys.
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:08.780]   Uh-oh.
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.280]   Uh-oh.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.060]   I was like, I'm going to go ahead and do this two-factor
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:11.560]   thing.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.060]   Oh, no.
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:13.560]   Oh, no.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.060]   Oh, no.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.060]   I won't be here, man.
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.060]   I won't do it on the show.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:18.700]   Sometimes the best things happen live, though.
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.740]   Like, when I finally did it and hit OK,
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.980]   suddenly my Chrome OS said I needed to re-authenticate,
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.260]   right?
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.060]   Because now I'm protected by two-factor.
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.740]   I click the button to do it, it powered off.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.180]   So then I powered it back on.
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.500]   And now I'm stuck at the sign and waiting to receive the code.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.620]   Here's where I messed up.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.140]   Because the number I gave it was my Google Voice number.
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.140]   No.
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.060]   My Google Voice number is on the other side of the authentication.
[00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.540]   Oh, Jason.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.340]   Yeah, but isn't your Google Voice number,
[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.540]   isn't your phone receiving Google Voice number?
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.140]   It's not anymore.
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.460]   What about the flip?
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.980]   Can you go to Google Voice and the flip?
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.500]   Oh, boy.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.420]   Probably not.
[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.420]   Oh, my god.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.060]   It's really honestly--
[00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.780]   I'm happy this happened live.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:11.220]   Because if anything, I could at least tell you not to do that.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.340]   Let's watch Jason lock himself out of every single one
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.900]   of his devices live.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.140]   Let's see.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.220]   I just need to get the voice.
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.500]   That's all I need to do.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.380]   Come on, Google.
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.780]   This one time mess up and let me in.
[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.620]   Let's see here.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.020]   It says sign out, sign back in.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.340]   Yeah, so this is synced now.
[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.980]   You guys, I can't believe I did this for the show.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:33.900]   You're not your Google account.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.900]   I mean--
[00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.020]   Sign out, sign back in.
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.140]   It powered down.
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.860]   Yeah, no, it's going to be the same issue.
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.100]   I'm not going to be able to--
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:44.140]   Why did I give it my Google Voice number?
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:44.420]   Why?
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.180]   Because that's what I give everything.
[00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.620]   It's my Google Voice number.
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:50.820]   But yeah, but I can't get the Google Voice number code that
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.540]   was sent via SMS.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:54.700]   So then, great explainer.
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.860]   What are alternatives?
[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.060]   So wait, OK.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.500]   Let's think this through you guys.
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.180]   That's a good thing.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:07.700]   So the ways in which you could access your Google Voice
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:11.780]   SMS messages isn't there in Gmail, a chat label?
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.780]   Is that still true?
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.260]   Your Google Voice messages?
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.340]   Well--
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:21.260]   A lot of things have changed with Google Voice, but--
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.980]   Well, I mean, the problem is in any way
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.460]   that I would get access to that.
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:29.500]   I'm going to need the two-factor to log in, right?
[00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:30.500]   And--
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.180]   Are you logged in on your phone?
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.580]   No, it said it needed to re-authenticate there as well.
[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.580]   No, no, no.
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.540]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.020]   It just went away.
[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:44.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.020]   You kidding me?
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.780]   It said it, and then it went away.
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.860]   Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.820]   I know I can do this.
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.060]   It won't-- OK.
[00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.300]   Because-- ooh, I think I got it.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.220]   I think I got it.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.380]   Hold on.
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.540]   Hold on.
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.260]   I hope this works.
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.500]   You can vamp if you like.
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.140]   I've got to pace this.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.300]   I think I might have it.
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.580]   I think I might have it.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:08.060]   The danger of two-factor right here.
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.620]   No, you know, and part of it is my misunderstanding,
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.300]   but I can understand why I didn't see it.
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.340]   Did you ask for the printout of the 10 codes?
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.700]   Sorry, there's two--
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.260]   That's pretty much what I got was 10 codes,
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.020]   because I've requested them from everywhere.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.780]   OK, so I'm going to sign in again.
[00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.020]   I think I can do this.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.780]   Do, do, do, do, do.
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:32.740]   This is a cautionary tale entering my password.
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.740]   That's about a three-hour dream.
[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.220]   The Game of Voice Wrinkle is definitely a wrinkle.
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.980]   I use my Google Voice number primarily,
[00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:45.220]   but when I set up my backup phone number,
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.780]   I have to use my native phone number,
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.220]   because my Google Voice number is attached to my Google account,
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.780]   but I'm always so worried that I'm going to forget that,
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.660]   and just get myself locked out.
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.180]   But you're going to resolve this, Jason.
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.700]   We're going to figure this out together.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.660]   We're with you.
[00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:06.820]   OK, so the verification code that you are sent,
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:09.260]   that is the thing that you paced over there, right?
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.180]   So I got that right.
[00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:13.700]   Why didn't you accept it?
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.380]   I don't know.
[00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:15.980]   Yeah, it's weird.
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.540]   It's not accepting it when I put it in.
[00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.900]   All right, I'll continue work.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.340]   Actually, I can't even move the show along.
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.180]   I can't even see our doc anymore.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.180]   Oh, no.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.140]   Oh, you guys.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.500]   It seemed like a good idea at the time.
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:34.460]   Let me try again.
[00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:40.620]   Audio listeners are like, wow, you suck.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.980]   Yeah, no, it's just not working.
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:46.140]   Tell me this is something that Leo would do, right?
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.220]   Well, Jason, hold on.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:51.540]   When you sign up for two-factor, the option
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.980]   to get 10 permanent codes that you can put in your wallet and use--
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:55.500]   I should.
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.900]   --should you ever need a code.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:58.340]   I should have done that.
[00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:58.900]   You didn't do that.
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.300]   Oh, my god.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:00.780]   No.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:03.020]   So you can't even get to your account dashboard now
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.140]   to do that, though, right?
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:05.540]   No.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.620]   It says, try another way to sign in when I do that.
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.660]   The only thing there is send a text message to your phone,
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.380]   because that's the only thing I have set up.
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:17.100]   So Jason, you never got to the code that went to Google Voice.
[00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:17.860]   That's what you need.
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.500]   Do you need to get the code that went to Google Voice?
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.500]   Is your voice going to fall in?
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.500]   Is it going to get right now?
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.500]   It's going to get right now.
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.300]   Is there any device that it forwarded to,
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:27.100]   or might still be in the shade?
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:27.820]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.180]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.100]   Do you have the Google Voice app on your phone?
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:31.980]   But there's no way the Google Voice app is
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.220]   updated to support two-factor authentication yet.
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.220]   That's true.
[00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.900]   That's not true.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:39.660]   That's true.
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.940]   But oh, boy.
[00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.620]   That app hasn't been updated for years.
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.140]   I do have it on here, but I don't think I was signed in,
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.780]   because-- oh, boy.
[00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.820]   It's not going to work again.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.700]   Yeah, it's going to do the whole changes thing.
[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.740]   Is there a story you guys want to talk about?
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.980]   Will I figure this out?
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:00.900]   So let me just tell you this.
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.740]   Two-factor authentication is really effective.
[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:09.540]   By the way, goggles is still around.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.420]   I apologize.
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.060]   It is.
[00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:11.500]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.100]   And it does--
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:12.580]   Oh, wow.
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.740]   Yeah, it does the same thing.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.780]   It has search from camera.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.020]   Get goggles results for pictures you take.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:21.980]   If you've enabled location in the Settings app,
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.180]   as well as in Google Settings, they will send location data.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.100]   OK.
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.620]   So now it does.
[00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:30.900]   You take a picture of something, and it'll figure out where--
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.260]   Will it recognize your logo?
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.500]   That's a good question.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:41.140]   That's exciting.
[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.780]   Oh, that's good TV.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.500]   Good TV.
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.860]   Yeah, it's not even doing anything.
[00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.180]   Oh, maybe it's really gone.
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.380]   Maybe it doesn't work.
[00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.380]   It just pretended to work.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:56.380]   Oh, analyzing, activate camera light.
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.100]   Oh, my God, it worked.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:58.860]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:02.740]   It says, this week in tech, MP3 edition, Petaluma Landmark.
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.300]   Oh, you're a landmark.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:08.220]   OMG.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.140]   Thank you, goggles.
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:10.900]   Welcome to the landmark.
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.340]   Mark, I'm going to use Stacy's face.
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.140]   OK, now we're going to do Stacy's face,
[00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.540]   because she's a landmark in Austin.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.540]   Oh, yes.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.820]   What a cute smile.
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.100]   All right, let's see.
[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:23.620]   We have it.
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:24.460]   Now what happened there?
[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:25.500]   OK.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.740]   Activate camera light.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:28.020]   Oh, I'm going to do it again.
[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:33.220]   What's going on?
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.780]   It's kind of slow.
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.580]   It's rejecting my face.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.940]   It's-- wait a minute.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:40.700]   You're not going to like this at all.
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.700]   I now know why Google thinks you're a boy.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:45.860]   Oh, dear.
[00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:47.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.180]   Oh, that's so mean.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.580]   I apologize.
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.540]   Oh, god.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.740]   I apologize for Google.
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.100]   Oh, that's so sad.
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.780]   That is so mean.
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.700]   You know, it's the short hair, I think.
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.500]   It's the short-- I'm not wearing lipstick.
[00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.500]   I mean, there's a lot of things wrong here
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.900]   from a Google perspective.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:07.700]   Although, did it put me in glasses?
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.900]   It did put you in glasses, which is really weird.
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:11.900]   It's really weird.
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:12.900]   It's really weird.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.740]   It's weird on face.
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.100]   I'm installing it now.
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.780]   OK, I'll do my own face.
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.060]   You put me in your soul.
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.580]   We are such idiots, god.
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.900]   People turn in the show to learn something instead.
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.940]   We're going, hey, here's this fun five-year-old program
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.700]   we've just rediscovered.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.700]   Liquidity will do.
[00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.620]   Yeah, Leo.
[00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.180]   It did that five years ago.
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:34.660]   You knit with it.
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:35.500]   Yeah.
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.100]   Next show, we'll stick hats and funny filters over our faces.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:39.420]   Done.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:39.860]   Been there.
[00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.860]   Done that.
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.460]   I should do it to you, Jeff, because it probably--
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.300]   Did you do it to me?
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.620]   Would you think it would think you're a woman?
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:47.700]   Probably.
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.540]   I know it'll think I'm dead.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:51.100]   I was like, not with that beard, I hope.
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:56.500]   He used to be on the side of an examiner.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.500]   Oh, no.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:06.180]   It thinks you're a terrorist, apparently.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:06.820]   Yeah.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:07.740]   Yeah.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.580]   I have only an art at a Caprio.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.500]   That's good.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.180]   George Clooney.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:12.740]   Hey.
[00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.220]   Oh, what's his name?
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:16.020]   Jilling Hall.
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.140]   What is the label above that?
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:17.780]   What does it say?
[00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.940]   It says, no objects recognize brows similar images.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:21.420]   This is--
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:24.740]   There you go.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.300]   We found you, Jeff.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.980]   Oh, that's impressive facial hair right there.
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.460]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:30.460]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.460]   Yeah.
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.420]   Yeah.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.620]   I think that would be a good look for you.
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:36.180]   Yeah.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:36.700]   I like that.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.420]   Amish, Jeff.
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:42.740]   Amish, this is very odd.
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.260]   Wait a minute.
[00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.580]   I'm going to do you a good stage.
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.300]   I don't think we did-- I don't think we did you justice.
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.780]   I think I'm about to be humiliated again.
[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:53.860]   I just feel we could do better.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.300]   I don't know.
[00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.300]   Maybe if I just took it straight on instead.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:02.980]   I like how it does this analyzing.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:04.300]   Analyzing?
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.940]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.740]   Oh, I'm still a boy.
[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:09.220]   Worse.
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:10.900]   Oh, am I an animal?
[00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:13.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:16.540]   That's going to be my new Google profile.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.340]   I don't-- it's just really decided that you are a freak,
[00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.260]   apparently.
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.980]   It's the blue in the hair.
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.500]   That's got to be what it is.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:24.940]   What?
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:25.420]   What?
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.100]   Google?
[00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:26.940]   What?
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.700]   What?
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:29.180]   It doesn't-- not at all.
[00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:32.300]   Not at all.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.340]   What the hell?
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.700]   This is just not-- this is mean.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.460]   I was worried about this being creepy built into something,
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.220]   but I'm not worried.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.740]   That's just weird.
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.580]   There's-- yeah, are you worried about Google search results?
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.660]   I don't think so.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.620]   Can I do a picture of me?
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:50.900]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.900]   Let me--
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.100]   That's hard to do.
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.620]   OK.
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:56.980]   Do you have to use the rear camera?
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:57.340]   Can you not?
[00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:59.500]   Yeah, it doesn't seem like I could turn it around.
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.060]   It's not made for selfies.
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.140]   Oh, that's good.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.740]   Oh, that's really good.
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.980]   I think we're going to retire this application.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.820]   OK.
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:15.740]   Yeah, that's me.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:17.500]   That's me right there in a nutshell.
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:24.220]   Yeah, that's me.
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.100]   All right.
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:27.180]   So Google goggles, not so great.
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:27.740]   That's so great.
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:28.260]   That's so great.
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.220]   Or we're just not landmarks.
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.140]   That's the best.
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:32.940]   What's weird is it worked with the Twit logo?
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.020]   Yeah, I think you have to be a landmark.
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:38.460]   Or maybe I wonder, I should take a picture of a famous person
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.660]   with this and see if they're recognized.
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.100]   Well, George Clooney, and it will put up me.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.660]   That would be pretty impressive.
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.380]   I don't know how George would feel about that.
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:50.300]   I'm like, screenshot that and give it to Jeff who'd make his day.
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:54.020]   Something happened in July that changed the world.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.100]   Really, one of the most dramatic events in technology
[00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:02.540]   history, the release of Pokemon Go.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.780]   We couldn't stop talking about it.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.420]   For weeks, of course, we have now.
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.020]   There were some people who couldn't even
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.420]   stop playing it.
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.020]   Watch.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.500]   So both of you, I thought for sure,
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.260]   this would be the first show I've done all week that
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.980]   doesn't mention Pokemon Go.
[00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.940]   I thought there's no way Jeff and Kevin--
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.740]   Yeah, there's no-- no, not old, just serious.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.940]   I thought there's no way these guys.
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:27.420]   These are serious guys.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.580]   They're playing this dumb game.
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.300]   How can you not?
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.980]   You were saying, Jeff, that you see people playing in Manhattan
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:33.460]   everywhere?
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.580]   Yes, it's really amazing because I walked on the street
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.020]   and now it's just somebody standing there.
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.020]   Number one, you can tell if they're doing the motion.
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.540]   You really can tell because if somebody's
[00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.500]   playing Pokemon Go's screens, they keep their phone out.
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.180]   Yeah?
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.260]   Because they're waiting for the buzz that says a Pokemon
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:48.780]   is nearby.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:52.020]   So if you're like me and you're surreptitious,
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.540]   you're walking, but your phone is there.
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.860]   And when you feel the buzz, then--
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.180]   and then you start seeing this as they play the game.
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:58.540]   Oh, why women?
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.860]   I just got a buzz.
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.940]   And seriously.
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.140]   So and then you start-- and I'll show you all demonstrate
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.900]   the motion because I'm actually going to fight a wild Zubat.
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.820]   And then you see this kind of finger up motion
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:15.020]   as they shoot the pokey balls at the Zubat
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.420]   and try to take it home for their collection.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:22.020]   So this game came out a week ago, on today--
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:24.740]   a week ago today, on Wednesday afternoon,
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:27.020]   took everybody by surprise, except I guess people
[00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:28.740]   were really paying close attention.
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:31.260]   [WHISTLE BLOWING]
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.220]   Somebody just got something.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.500]   Something appeared, yeah.
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.020]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:39.380]   That's the cry of the wild something.
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.300]   Yeah, so you hear their cry, and then your Kevin's
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.780]   playing the game for the first time, I think.
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.020]   I'm a lousy show.
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.100]   Yeah, it's hard.
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:50.860]   So you notice I turned off the augmented reality, which was--
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:51.660]   Yeah, I was going to ask why.
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:52.980]   I think that's one of the fun of it, isn't it?
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.100]   It's the fun of it, but it also saps battery life.
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:56.860]   Oh boy, does it?
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:57.620]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:58.940]   Because your camera's on all the time.
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.860]   So you could turn that off, and that will help.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.700]   And then it also-- it makes it a little bit harder.
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.260]   I find it's easier, at least for me,
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.780]   without the augmented reality.
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.900]   There you go, you caught it, Kevin.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.220]   Nice.
[00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.420]   So that's added to your Poke collection.
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.500]   You can now turn this down.
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:16.340]   I was in Facebook's New York headquarters yesterday.
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.300]   Oh, goodness.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.660]   You got an E-Nax?
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.660]   Snake spelled backwards?
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.140]   I didn't hear.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:23.660]   Yeah.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.980]   Oh, that's a really good one.
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:25.580]   E cans.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.100]   E cans.
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:26.780]   And I give it one.
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.220]   To keep the E cans, yeah.
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.700]   So your idea is you're going to get these.
[00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:33.100]   These are baby Pokemon that you evolve to stronger and stronger,
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.260]   sometimes once or twice.
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:35.620]   And then--
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:40.260]   Ta-da.
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.420]   You caught another one?
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.420]   There's a bunch of them around your house.
[00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:47.700]   That's because I just signed up, so they were easy ones, right?
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.900]   Yeah, not necessarily.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.380]   Usually you have to walk.
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.620]   That's the virtue of this game.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:53.220]   I mean, there's--
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.580]   Yeah, another version for Brits.
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:59.020]   It's not-- it's only US, Australia, Canada.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.940]   Carson Tellmey's rolls out today in Germany, which
[00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:06.060]   is surprising because, frankly, the servers
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.660]   have been very unreliable because so many people are signing up
[00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.380]   in those three countries.
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.460]   And Niantic, the company that made this, which
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:14.420]   is a former Google company, has said,
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.580]   we're not going to roll it out as fast as we thought globally.
[00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.460]   However, the thing people can do--
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:20.820]   and I don't recommend this.
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.620]   You can download on Android, sideload, and APK from one of you.
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.620]   Can you turn that down?
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:28.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:29.820]   I never thought I'd say that.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:30.820]   I'd say Kevin.
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:31.820]   I'd say Kevin.
[00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.780]   He joined the game a little too much.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:38.660]   One of the biggest events for me this year,
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.940]   and this for this week in Google, was the addition
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:45.500]   of the amazing, the wonderful Stacey Higginbotham to our team.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:50.220]   Stacey-- I became aware of Stacey when she was an editor
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:55.180]   at Gigalm and was one of the most astute writers and editors
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:57.340]   I'd ever written or read.
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:32:58.740]   She was writing I was reading.
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.140]   I'd ever read.
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.220]   Really, really good.
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.700]   She left when Gigalm folded, went to Fortune.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.740]   And to our great good Fortune, left Fortune,
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:08.780]   has done her own thing.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:10.300]   She's doing an IoT podcast.
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.060]   She's writing about the internet of things.
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:15.940]   And she appears most weeks on this week in Google.
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:17.820]   We are really thrilled to have her.
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:21.220]   Here's Stacey, emitting what has now
[00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.900]   become her trademark exclamation.
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:26.060]   You'll know what I mean in a sec.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:27.140]   Well, it's like me.
[00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:31.140]   I have probably $4,000 or $5,000 for the Sonos equipment.
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:31.700]   Yeah, me too.
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:33.340]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.140]   Did you guys-- that was me being excited.
[00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:36.340]   That was so exciting.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.580]   Yes, I like that.
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.260]   So this is a--
[00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:40.300]   Can I make that a ringtone?
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:43.540]   Please, I want that ringtone.
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.940]   Please.
[00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.140]   This is such a common question.
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.780]   I have to tell people about it.
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.140]   So a company called--
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.140]   You're just the greatest.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:51.660]   Jay Star.
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:51.660]   Jay Star.
[00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:52.660]   Jay Star.
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:53.660]   Thank you, Stacey.
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.020]   I love you.
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.060]   OK.
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:01.500]   They showed a video for an echo skill that is not yet approved
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.780]   that will show control your Sonos from your Amazon Echo.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.580]   So if you Google, it's a YouTube video from--
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.620]   it's the company that does Josh AI.
[00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:11.300]   Josh.io.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.580]   Oh, so it's not an official interference?
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.540]   It's not a proofjet.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:15.660]   They've made the skill.
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:17.780]   But it's not from Sonos.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:18.740]   It's not from Sonos.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.020]   Why not?
[00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:23.900]   Because Sonos doesn't have their API put together yet.
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.580]   Anyway, there it is.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:29.580]   Third party app Josh will bring a few new skills
[00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:31.140]   and different voices to echo.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.500]   That's interesting.
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:34.340]   And the Sonos thing is kind of at the end.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:35.620]   So the first part of--
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.620]   So is Josh like an--
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.700]   is it in the echo?
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.340]   Is it in my echo?
[00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:44.660]   Josh is actually home control with voice.
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.340]   So it's not in my echo?
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.220]   No, it's a skill that they've developed.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:49.500]   And they're just waiting for approval.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.340]   But it's an echo skill.
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.660]   They've designed it to be, but Amazon has to approve it.
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:59.580]   So I'm saying things like ask Josh to play Beyonce Lemonade
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.740]   on my Sonos.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:02.580]   On my Tesla.
[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.220]   So I can control that.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.300]   Yeah, and that's the part of the Amazon echo that doesn't work.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.380]   We need artificial intelligence, and we need Alexa
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.540]   choosing the skill.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.540]   If I have to remember--
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:13.340]   He does stop saying her name like--
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.100]   Yeah, echo.
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.100]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.100]   I would just say, "Echo"--
[00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:19.620]   Virtual Assistant that shall not be named.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:21.420]   That should be picking the skill.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.260]   Not me.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.940]   I can't remember all of these commands.
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.700]   Well, you can agree with you.
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.140]   And that's what Google and Apple are about to do,
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.700]   where they disintermediate.
[00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:32.900]   They are actually vice versa.
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.100]   They intermediate.
[00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:40.380]   They become your ombudsman and go out and get what you need.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.500]   And they know what apps you have, and they know what skills
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.500]   you need, and you just ask her.
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:48.260]   Well, that's how echo should be, too, right?
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.140]   Yeah, and Viv will be like that, too, which is--
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:51.540]   Right.
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.940]   Viv.ai.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:57.500]   Thanks to Nigel Town in our chat room,
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.460]   the Stacey Higginbotham Ringtone.
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.060]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.060]   Hey.
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.660]   Turn on my audio.
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:04.540]   Turn on my audio.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.460]   You got it?
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.060]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.540]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:13.100]   Audience, you are the best.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.100]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.300]   Put that on your daughter's--
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:17.300]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:19.700]   Nexus 5X.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.700]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.700]   Oh, Lord.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.700]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:28.100]   Nigel Town.
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.580]   I think I love you, man.
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.380]   You have to put it on your own phone.
[00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:34.020]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.780]   I think I'll give that to my husband.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.420]   He'll just be like, what just happened here?
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.700]   He can onto his phone tonight.
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.700]   Yeah, it's really--
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.620]   Yeah, it's like Stacey's eating something again.
[00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:45.620]   She must be--
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.100]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:50.900]   That is so endearing.
[00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.500]   All right, well, it is endearing,
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.340]   is a good word for it.
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.340]   I only have a minute or two.
[00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:54.940]   You showed title, too.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:55.940]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:56.940]   It is the show title.
[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:57.940]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:58.460]   Sorry.
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:02.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:06.180]   You saw the story of the guy who's maybe
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.220]   had saved his life after we had the talent.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:09.300]   That's such BS.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.780]   That's such BS.
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:13.340]   I think Elon planted that story.
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:16.460]   It said the Tesla drove him to the emergency room.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:19.300]   No, no, no, it drove him to the exit.
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.460]   He had to take over then.
[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:21.780]   It couldn't go all the way.
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.020]   But he just decided--
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.900]   But you understand that the nav system on a Tesla
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.460]   is not in any way connected to the autopilot, right?
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:28.900]   Right.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.140]   So it didn't drive him anywhere.
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.260]   It just kept him from--
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.580]   He just stopped having to drive.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:34.780]   --kipping him into something.
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:35.140]   Yes.
[00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:37.380]   And he, at some point, had to sit up and go, oh, there's
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.580]   the exit to the emergency room and drive themselves
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.660]   the rest of the way.
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.220]   If he didn't have that aid, if he had
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:43.980]   had drive the whole way, he couldn't have done it.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.460]   He would have had to stop and get an ambulance.
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.220]   We're taking too long, he wouldn't have conked.
[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:47.700]   Right.
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.340]   So the argument is, this got closer to the hospital.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.980]   I think it sounds like an attempt to count her.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:53.740]   Yes, I think so.
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:56.460]   The negative publicity myself.
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:02.460]   My mom, she actually had a crazy thing happen to her
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:03.740]   that caused internal bleeding.
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:05.900]   She passed out, ran her car into a guardrail.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:06.780]   She survived.
[00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.100]   I wouldn't have happened with a Tesla.
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.260]   But with a Tesla, that wouldn't have happened.
[00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.620]   If she had autopilot auto-steer it.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:14.340]   But what I wonder is, Stacy--
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.060]   So if God forbid your mom had lost consciousness,
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:20.300]   would the Tesla have kept going?
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.300]   Yes.
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:23.020]   At some point in time, it stops.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:23.700]   Doesn't it stop?
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:27.780]   Well, if she loses the causes, then her hands aren't in the wheel.
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.580]   Eventually, it will slow down and stop.
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.220]   Or it will at first alert you.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:38.420]   And I think also if the road gets more curvy, it alerts you.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.100]   I've gone long distances without it telling me to put my hands
[00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:43.060]   on the wheel, so I don't know.
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.300]   They say it's supposed to.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.700]   But yeah, I've heard from people who are like--
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:46.620]   Doesn't seem--
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.540]   You don't have autopilot in yours, right?
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.100]   I don't.
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.100]   Yeah.
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:51.940]   Which is a shame, because I pass out a lot.
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:56.020]   So it could be handy.
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.100]   I think those are called the vapas.
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:58.380]   You just--
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.060]   I'm a swooner.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:01.500]   I'm a swoon.
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.180]   Oh my goodness.
[00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:06.620]   What do you want to--
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:07.780]   What?
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.260]   Something exciting just happened, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.300]   For the latest, we go--
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:12.180]   We love it.
[00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:16.300]   To Stacy Higginbotham on a street somewhere in Austin, Texas.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.820]   Stacy?
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.340]   Oh, this is from Scooter X in the chat room.
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.460]   And I was not caring about Aloe as much.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.300]   And he sent me-- or he sent a thing about Harry Potter
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.460]   magic coming to Google from 9 to 5 Mac.
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:32.820]   And we are going to be able to say Loomos and our lash
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:33.500]   lights going to come on.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.220]   So we're going to say, OK, Google, Loomos.
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.620]   And then you're going to do Celinecio.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:39.540]   And you're a renewal termo?
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:45.780]   Now, this was an Amazon Echo task some time ago.
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:46.980]   I think I mentioned that on this show,
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.660]   all the different spells you could add.
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:51.940]   But this is going to be now part of inside the--
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:56.380]   so I could do that in my phone by just saying, OK, Google.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.300]   And then--
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:58.860]   Celinecio.
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:00.220]   Celinecio.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:03.900]   My messenger icon just changed too.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:04.940]   So something changed there.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.420]   So I did it on my--
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.860]   I did it on my pixel and it just said, right-o.
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:10.700]   Oh, maybe you see.
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.420]   Maybe it's giving you--
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.260]   Loomos.
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.940]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:16.140]   It is--
[00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.220]   It knocks, turns it off.
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.180]   It knocks it off.
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.580]   Look, you can show it now.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.180]   If you do that now, or where?
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.580]   Over the shoulder.
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.700]   OK, Google, right?
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:24.300]   Oh, sorry.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:25.060]   Sorry, Google.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:25.580]   Yeah.
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:25.900]   Sorry.
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.900]   So I said, Loomos.
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:29.780]   OK, Google.
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.620]   And it shows the flashlight.
[00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.260]   And then--
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.260]   Oh, you should point out that it's on.
[00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.260]   And then I go--
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:37.940]   We should--
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:38.260]   Nox.
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.740]   It turned out--
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:43.300]   No, OK, Google, Google.
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.300]   I'm so excited.
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:45.900]   Sorry, Carston.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.540]   Avada, Kadavra.
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.220]   Loomos.
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.740]   Oh.
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.660]   It won't kill anybody for you, unfortunately.
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.140]   By the way, I don't know where we're
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.220]   going to use this article.
[00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.520]   But I think I'm going to use it right now.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:03.100]   I bookmarked it and I think we should-- this is the--
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.380]   I think we should start it to find it.
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:11.060]   This is the unknown danger of surgical lasers.
[00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:13.260]   Air-doring surgery after the patient farted
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.940]   in the middle of the operation.
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:17.180]   While the doctors operated on the woman's cervix,
[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.420]   she apparently passed gas and then ended up being burned
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:22.460]   after the laser ignited the fart,
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.780]   resulting in a fiery explosion.
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:25.540]   But the many of us--
[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.420]   This is not a joke.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.860]   I cannot believe that's not a joke.
[00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:31.940]   Oh, yes, inside.
[00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:33.060]   It's happened.
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.220]   No, at the Tokyo Medical University Hospital.
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:41.340]   The patient's intestinal gas leaked
[00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:42.900]   into the space of the operation, ignited
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.300]   with the irradiation of the laser,
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:46.700]   the burning spread, eventually reaching the surgical drape
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:47.660]   and causing a fire.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:51.620]   There you have it, folks.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:56.740]   Patient burned by a mix.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:00.100]   They must have been doing like ablations and stuff inside
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.820]   people's like abdominal cavities.
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:03.820]   Ryan, what you're saying is it's shocking
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.580]   this hasn't happened sooner.
[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:09.380]   Well, I feel like people would--
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.140]   We should know about this.
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:13.420]   I smell snopes.
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:16.820]   It does come from the New York Daily News.
[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.300]   How trustworthy is the New York Daily News?
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:24.420]   What do you think, Jeff?
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.860]   GQ Magazine against Moto.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.300]   Metal floss.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.300]   Who else run on this?
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:30.100]   Well, everybody's probably--
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.100]   Yeah, the snopes.
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.100]   Let's see snopes.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:32.900]   All right, what does snopes say?
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.860]   Two days ago, snopes.
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.180]   Let's scroll down, snopes.
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.700]   Come on, now it's hanging up on me.
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:41.300]   Spirts charged with investigating the incident
[00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.100]   ruled that there were no other flammable materials present
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.220]   at the time of surgery and the equipment that was used
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:49.780]   did not malfunction, leading them to believe
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.900]   the woman's flatulence was the culprit.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.380]   God, this poor woman.
[00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:59.220]   This is what makes Howard Stern so successful,
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.580]   as farts are just fun.
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.180]   You can't help but laugh.
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.740]   Well, this is a new segment on the show
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.420]   when technology strikes.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:08.340]   What does snopes say?
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.260]   I think just crashed.
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.060]   Can you just crash?
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:10.860]   Can you look it up?
[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:16.660]   Look up fart laser fire and you'll see snopes down about five.
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.220]   I just crashed by from--
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.180]   What do they say?
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.700]   They just reported it.
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.380]   They didn't--
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.420]   Look, it's from the Asahi Shimbun.
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:33.500]   This is from the Asahi Shimbun, which is a very--
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.220]   I mean, this is the New York Times of Japan.
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:41.340]   If snopes is repeating the rumor--
[00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.220]   Yes, snopes is repeating it.
[00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:46.940]   I think that's not-- let's get political fact on it.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:50.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:55.500]   I really didn't want to do that story.
[00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:00.020]   You notice I held it to the very end of the show.
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:00.940]   Oh my.
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.940]   Oh my.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.940]   That could well be an early appearance of fake news.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:09.420]   I don't know, but it's a great story.
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:14.860]   As we continue on, I hope you're enjoying our best of 2016
[00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:17.100]   for this week in Google.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:19.500]   Our show-- coming up, Jonathan Abrams,
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.820]   the founder of Friendster is going to talk about Google AMP.
[00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:24.700]   Actually, we had to debate all year long about Google's AMP
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:25.340]   technology.
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.820]   We'll take a look at Facebook Live.
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:31.660]   We've got some Google I/O stuff.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:33.860]   But before we do that, I want to mention our sponsor.
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:35.940]   And I'm really thrilled that they're here with us
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.020]   during this holiday week.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.260]   It's typically a very slow time.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.100]   And a lot of times, my experience
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.300]   has been in radio and TV.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:46.540]   You don't have many advertisers the week after Christmas.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.740]   They figure everybody's all shopped out.
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.300]   But Blue Apron is with us.
[00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:52.300]   And I'm really glad.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.140]   And I think it makes sense because--
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.220]   as we've all, I hope, had a chance
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.940]   to get together with loved ones, family, and friends,
[00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.740]   and shared this holiday season.
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:05.700]   I'm sure you're still doing that.
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.860]   One of the things that comes to mind is you kind of get
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.020]   reminded, we should do this more often.
[00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:12.420]   This is great.
[00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:15.380]   We should eat together more often.
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.260]   That's what Blue Apron is all about.
[00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.700]   Its mission is to make incredible home-cooking accessible
[00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:25.100]   to everybody while supporting a more sustainable food system
[00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.820]   with the highest standard for ingredients
[00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:29.620]   and building a community of home chefs.
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:32.300]   Michael Pollan has said this in his book.
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.660]   I think it was called Cooking.
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.340]   One of the few things humans do that no other animal,
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:41.220]   no other beast does, is cook.
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:47.140]   And sitting down around a meal is such a significant event
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:51.460]   in a family, in a relationship, breaking bread.
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.940]   We even have a term for breaking bread together.
[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:57.100]   Blue Apron adds that one little piece,
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.380]   because you can do it at a restaurant,
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:01.220]   you can get together at a restaurant, that's fine.
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.300]   But trust me, I love doing this.
[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:03.980]   I love to cook.
[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:06.300]   When you make a meal for your loved ones,
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:10.940]   you put all that love and caring into it, and they enjoy it.
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:12.860]   It just is so satisfying.
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.100]   Blue Apron makes that easy by delivering you
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:17.980]   every ingredient you need to make an amazing meal,
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.060]   either for two or for a family.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.860]   They have two different plans.
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.620]   With ingredients that are fresh, never frozen,
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.180]   even the meats and fish, because it's a refrigerated box,
[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:29.860]   they come to your door, no waste,
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.580]   you get exactly what you need, no more, no less.
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.500]   They give you a beautiful eight by 10 recipe card,
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:37.460]   eight and a half by 11, I guess, recipe card.
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:41.060]   It's laminated with all the recipe, the instructions,
[00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:43.300]   pictures, they even have additional videos
[00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.900]   if you need more help on the website.
[00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:47.460]   It really is fun.
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.220]   It's like a kit.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.660]   Like a kit that you get in the mail
[00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:55.340]   that you put it together and you add one ingredient
[00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:56.580]   you add your love.
[00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.660]   And then it's so wonderful to share with family and friends.
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.540]   And man, these menus,
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:05.100]   whoo, potato and artichoke quiche with romaine
[00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:08.780]   and orange salad, cod en papillote.
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:11.380]   That is a technique you will use again and again
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:14.460]   with frica and spinach, steak and green peppercorn sauce
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.740]   with kale and roasted potato.
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.020]   I can go on and on, actually you can find out for yourself.
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.380]   If you go to blueapering.com/twit,
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.500]   take a look at the menu, pick your next meals.
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:25.260]   Your first three meals are free.
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.820]   You always pick the meals you want.
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.220]   Yes, they have vegetarian options,
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.620]   options for dietary restrictions.
[00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.700]   Go to blueapering.com, pick your meals,
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.660]   get your first three meals free with free shipping
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:37.300]   and blueapering does ship to 99%
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.540]   of the continental United States.
[00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:40.660]   You know, there's some limitations
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:43.260]   'cause that's, you know, a refrigerated box.
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:47.140]   But get it if you can, it's so great.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:51.260]   Free shipping for three meals free, blueapering.com/twit.
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:54.020]   Blueapering.com/twit.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.300]   I think they're smart because you've,
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:59.620]   we've all kind of experienced now being with the family.
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.580]   And now you wanna do that some more.
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:03.180]   Blueapering families cook three times,
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.600]   on average three times more often together.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.940]   Right?
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:09.420]   Blueapering.com/twit.
[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:12.100]   We thank you so much for the support of this week.
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:15.780]   In Google, now where were we?
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:16.620]   Let's see.
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:18.860]   (laughing)
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:21.460]   We can start with this one.
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.980]   This is from earlier this year,
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.220]   right at the beginning of the year.
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.780]   You know, Google's business is advertising.
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.340]   Apple wanted to get into that business.
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:31.060]   Turns out, didn't work out so well for him.
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.380]   Watch.
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:34.460]   Let's go back to Apple for one second if we could.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.740]   I think we might've missed this story.
[00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:38.420]   I think it's critical.
[00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:41.900]   Apple killed its ad service, fired its ad staff.
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:43.780]   And this, what's key about this is,
[00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.180]   and I've said this for some time,
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.180]   Apple failed at advertising.
[00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:50.180]   And thus, Apple is now motivated to pull the rug out
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:52.460]   from everyone else who depends on advertising.
[00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:54.700]   So watch for Apple to get more and more hostile
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.540]   to advertising on mobile,
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.420]   which is where everything is gonna go.
[00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:02.100]   And it's gonna be more,
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.820]   I bet they're gonna make ad blockers defaulted.
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:14.900]   And they're just gonna say, "Yeah, the publishers."
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:18.180]   And they're making a virtue out of an necessity,
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.620]   'cause I think the truth is I had failed.
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:24.340]   And they were putting too many restrictions on advertisers.
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.700]   It was too much work. There were a lot of reasons.
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:30.340]   It was the little banner ads you see in apps and things like that.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:33.020]   Oftentimes, a full page takeover in apps.
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.620]   So they're shutting it down.
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:36.380]   They're all for user privacy.
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.460]   And obviously running an ad network
[00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:41.020]   is kind of counter to that notion.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:41.860]   So I think you're right.
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.420]   - And it's the sum up the notes of,
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:45.340]   or other bodily orifice of Google.
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.180]   - Yeah.
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:47.260]   - It's the way Apple can fight Google.
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.100]   - But I don't think it's,
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.060]   you need not say a thumb up the nose.
[00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.700]   It merely a way to position themselves
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.460]   as the privacy company.
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.660]   - I know, I think they can actively hurt Google.
[00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.300]   - I'd be very careful about thumbing Google's nose
[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:04.460]   as Microsoft has learned to its detriment, I think.
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:05.300]   - Ooh, ooh.
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.020]   - Now after the Gmail, after the Gmail man ads.
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:09.340]   (laughs)
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.180]   - Put them in an awkward position.
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:12.020]   (laughs)
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.860]   - It was interesting to me that Microsoft
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:15.580]   for a while in Internet Explorer
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:19.220]   was proposing blocking any third party thing
[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:20.940]   that was included for more than like three sites,
[00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:22.340]   which would have the net effect of blocking
[00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.500]   like all analytics and a ton of different ad things.
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.540]   And so Microsoft pulled back from that
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:30.220]   based on what a lot of people said.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:32.220]   But it seems like Apple to Jeff's point
[00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:34.500]   has kind of at least enabled that
[00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.460]   or a couple steps of interaction enabled that.
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:40.020]   And what's also interesting to me is people love Patreon,
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.620]   which takes I think 5% cut.
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:45.260]   And people sort of chafe at maybe Apple
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:47.220]   taking a 30% cut of purchases.
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:50.100]   And so it's interesting to think about that spectrum of like,
[00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:51.860]   where does the love start?
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:52.700]   - Right.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.380]   - And where does it become a business transaction?
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.220]   - Yeah.
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.940]   - Yeah, people love CD Baby and those kinds of businesses.
[00:50:57.940 --> 00:51:00.180]   And maybe it's just that it's a small percentage.
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:01.020]   I'm not sure.
[00:51:01.020 --> 00:51:03.900]   - Kevin.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:04.740]   - Well, I think that's right.
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:08.140]   I think there is a transition here
[00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:10.860]   from what you can support with what?
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:12.900]   'Cause part of what we've learned from Patreon
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.020]   and Kickstarter and other systems like that
[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:19.140]   is that actually people are willing to pay for things,
[00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.460]   but they're willing to pay different amounts of money
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.300]   for different things.
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.300]   And that depends on how much they like the thing
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.020]   and how much disposable income they have.
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:27.860]   Whereas--
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:29.500]   - And Kevin, they're not absolutely paying.
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:30.580]   Sorry.
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:31.420]   - So can I fish?
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:32.260]   - Right.
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:36.060]   - So whereas advertising assumes that nobody wants to pay
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:37.980]   very much and commoditizes them all down
[00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:41.180]   to a uniform amount per person
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.340]   and spreads it out over that.
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.460]   So in effect, it only actually does work
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.220]   if you have millions of people watching.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:50.060]   Whereas Patreon, Kickstarter and other things of that,
[00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:54.220]   Elk, can work if you have thousands of people watching
[00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:55.380]   if they care enough.
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.500]   And I think that's an interesting transformation
[00:51:58.500 --> 00:51:59.340]   of the media scene.
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:00.540]   One that hasn't fully sunk in yet.
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:04.660]   - All I was gonna say, sorry for the lag here.
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:07.900]   Paying for is a critical phrase here
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.060]   because they're not paying for access on Patreon, really.
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:13.220]   They're paying to support.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.620]   - Yeah, because if you don't contribute,
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:17.980]   you get the podcast or the music or whatever it's--
[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:18.980]   - Right, right.
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.140]   - Yes, so that's a key approach to supporting
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:23.580]   versus paying to get.
[00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:24.980]   - And by the way, that's,
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:27.660]   it's very limited what you can do with that.
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:28.500]   I'll be honest with you,
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:30.180]   'cause we tried to do that for several years
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.020]   at the beginning.
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:33.460]   Now, of course, we didn't have the infrastructure of Patreon,
[00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:34.780]   but there was no way I could have built
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:36.220]   Twit without advertising.
[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:38.340]   - Right.
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:40.100]   - There's just nobody was gonna give enough money
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.900]   to do what we've done.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:45.220]   Even when we sold bricks to build the studio,
[00:52:45.220 --> 00:52:49.500]   we, as many as we sold, we sold 1,800 bricks.
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.180]   It only went about a quarter of the way
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:52.420]   toward building a studio.
[00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:54.540]   - Right, so.
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:57.460]   - But you are on the other end of that spectrum
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:00.300]   in that you do have, you're in the middle of something.
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:04.420]   - I agree, but if you want to have that spectrum,
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:08.260]   you have to have a spectrum of monetization options.
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:11.820]   If you want everything to be small and user,
[00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:15.340]   you know, the patronage system is a great system,
[00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:18.300]   but there's only a few Michelangelo's that can be,
[00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:21.740]   and I think even fewer metaches.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:24.740]   - But there's even fewer New York Times is, is the point.
[00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.620]   I think you can, I think if you frame it that way around,
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:31.420]   you've got it slightly backwards in that there are many
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:34.060]   people who could have their artistic work.
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:36.100]   - Right, we want many, many, many, many.
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:37.580]   - That's right, that's right.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.380]   - Whereas there is this sort of,
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:42.060]   - There should be only one Twit.
[00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:45.300]   (laughing)
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.140]   - Thank you.
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.700]   - But there was this, I had this,
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:50.180]   I went to the Social Computing Supposed
[00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:52.260]   in New York last week and had one of the sessions there
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:56.260]   was TV people talking about how they use social media,
[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:58.700]   and it was fascinating to hear their point of view on it,
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:54:02.140]   which is that their point of view is that TV
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:03.900]   is a wonderful thing because it enables us
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.380]   to do these large scale things,
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.460]   and it's like, well, it enables you to do those
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:11.140]   large scale things, but to say that the net doesn't
[00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:13.380]   enable that is to miss the point that it enables
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.580]   a gigantic range of things that TV cuts off.
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:16.900]   - Which we love.
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:19.340]   - And it's very hard for those two mindsets to meet,
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:23.700]   because if you are successful in big media,
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:27.060]   it's difficult to take the kind of leap that you took Leo
[00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.820]   and say, okay, I can do this myself
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:32.220]   on my own time at my own scale.
[00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:33.460]   It's not a trivial thing to do,
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:35.420]   and it's actually very hard.
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:39.340]   And for them to, it is easier for them to say,
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.740]   what we need is to find the people who are doing something
[00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:45.580]   in this trivial net media over here,
[00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:47.340]   and make them into TV stars,
[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:49.300]   and that's the sort of the mindset you get.
[00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:50.140]   - Yeah.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:53.340]   - Especially the best TV edition of Max Hedgerman movie,
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:54.820]   20% of the year.
[00:54:54.820 --> 00:54:57.260]   - You actually are Max Hedgerman right now,
[00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:58.100]   which is kind of-- - This is a good meter of--
[00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:02.500]   - Have an amazing, an amazing kind of juxtaposition.
[00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:06.220]   One of the things we talked a lot about is Google AMP.
[00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:09.100]   And I really have misgivings.
[00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:11.020]   I still do about Google AMP,
[00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:13.180]   but we brought in as many people as we could
[00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:15.460]   to talk me off the ledge, including Jonathan Abrams.
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:18.780]   He's the founder of Friendster, you may remember that name,
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:21.460]   and is currently CEO of a news service
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:24.780]   that I use every single day called Nuzzle.
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.820]   He explained why AMP is a good thing.
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:30.020]   - So here's kind of my issue.
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:32.300]   The thing that concerns me is,
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.220]   when I hear that image tags are different,
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:36.540]   Google has specified a new way of doing image tags.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:39.460]   JavaScript is only allowed if it's Google allows it,
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.860]   and certain snippets are allowed,
[00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.460]   not in many, many, many more, not.
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:45.180]   Well, everything else is not.
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:51.260]   It is, I understand the desire to do this
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.460]   and the value of it for users,
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:58.300]   but I worry that Google has invented a new kind of HTML
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:01.340]   without in the involvement of standards bodies,
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:03.700]   just by talking to publishers,
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:06.540]   that is in effect, and this is what I said
[00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.460]   in the tweet, forking the web.
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:10.940]   So I wanted to give you a chance,
[00:56:10.940 --> 00:56:12.660]   A, to tell me what I got wrong.
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:14.780]   'Cause that was your initial tweet,
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:16.820]   and B, is that not the case?
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:19.180]   - I don't think it's the case
[00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:21.860]   because it's not really a fork of the web,
[00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:24.060]   and the reality is AMP is the web.
[00:56:24.060 --> 00:56:29.060]   It is a alternate HTML file,
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:34.140]   still HTML, still loaded VHDP,
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:39.140]   and essentially, it's just trying to standardize things more.
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:42.220]   So instead of all these different publishers,
[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:45.300]   having their own set of redundant, bloated JavaScript libraries,
[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:49.060]   Google's saying here is a single runtime
[00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:53.180]   that we're gonna try to make, solve all these needs,
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.380]   and then address the bloat problem
[00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:57.740]   that's been causing so much problems for people
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:59.620]   on their mobile devices,
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.180]   and it is an open project.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:04.220]   I mean, there's a GitHub repo,
[00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:07.180]   and whether you're on the client side or the publisher side,
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:11.020]   you can go and contribute and talk to them about that.
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:13.340]   Whether someday it becomes part of a standard thing,
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:15.900]   I don't know, I doubt Google would be opposed to that,
[00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:19.620]   but even now, it really is more open
[00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:20.700]   than any of the alternatives,
[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:24.180]   and the alternatives are some of these close platforms
[00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:26.340]   from some of these other big companies,
[00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:29.060]   and the reality is, if Nuzzle wanted to say,
[00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:31.540]   okay, publish those already publishing their content
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:34.380]   for Apple News or Facebook and Synodicals, great,
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:38.180]   let's just show that in Nuzzle, we can't do that.
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:41.860]   So that to me is really not open,
[00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:46.860]   and whereas AMP is something that we were able to be part of,
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:50.140]   and if publishers publish their stuff in AMP,
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.060]   if somebody in Croatia published something in AMP,
[00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:54.860]   and then some startup in New York
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:59.020]   builds some new app that supports AMP,
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:00.580]   two companies that they're never even heard of,
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:01.420]   it's just gonna work.
[00:58:01.420 --> 00:58:02.260]   So that kind of--
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:03.380]   - Well that's true of any fork,
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:06.340]   as soon as somebody supports it, but look what's prohibited.
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:08.620]   - Well let me try this on you.
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.700]   I think the difference is that a fork would mean
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:14.060]   that you'd be cut out and you couldn't use it.
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:15.500]   - No, no, not at all.
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.540]   That's not what a fork means.
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:20.180]   A fork means that you take some,
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:23.740]   so it would fork HTML, that you have a standard,
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:25.420]   and then you've decided, Google's decided,
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.980]   that instead of image, we'll use AMP,
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.020]   it's not a subset, it's a replacement.
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:31.620]   - It's not really.
[00:58:31.620 --> 00:58:35.700]   So HTML 4.0, I mean that was kind of like a fork of HTML.
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:37.820]   But that was W3C proposed.
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:40.020]   That was through a standards body.
[00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:42.740]   But HTML has evolved, I don't have a problem
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:44.260]   with it evolving.
[00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:46.940]   - But the reality is Microsoft and Netscape
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:49.300]   and all those companies had did fork HTML
[00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:51.580]   and added proprietary things that eventually--
[00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:52.420]   - Absolutely.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:53.420]   - go back into standards.
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:55.300]   In this case, Google's not even doing that.
[00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:59.580]   In this case, AMP is really simply just an HTML page.
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:04.820]   It is an, here's a JavaScript library
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.940]   that you can run in a standard browser,
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:09.100]   in a standard HTML page,
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:12.340]   instead of a proprietary JavaScript library
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.700]   from this publisher or one from all these different
[00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:17.780]   analytics and ad companies, it's a standard one.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:21.460]   But it's still JavaScript running on an HTML page.
[00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:24.500]   It's not really a new kind of HTML, really.
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:27.860]   - Well, you can't use IMG, you have to use AMP, dash IMG.
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.980]   You can't use object, param, applet,
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:32.980]   and bed form, prohibited, prohibited, prohibited.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:34.580]   - You can use whatever you want to use.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.620]   But it won't be an AMP page.
[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:36.820]   - This is not gonna be as fast.
[00:59:36.820 --> 00:59:37.820]   - No, it won't be an AMP page.
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:38.820]   - Yes, you can do whatever you want,
[00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:40.620]   but it's not an AMP page, but being an AMP page--
[00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:42.740]   - Yeah, here's where it becomes a problem.
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:45.860]   - And remember, the idea is that the AMP page
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:48.100]   is an alternative version of something
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:49.740]   that exists in regular HTML.
[00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:52.740]   - All the alternative version that is from Google
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:56.140]   and is promoted in the Google search results.
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:59.180]   That's not to me the same thing.
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.900]   - They don't favor AMP per se, they do favor speed
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.220]   and AMP is fast,
[01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.180]   but they don't favor AMP per se.
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.820]   - So if somebody came out with--
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.660]   - That's a difference with a distinction with their own--
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:12.420]   - Their own AMP-like, faster way of doing things
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:16.060]   that would also get the benefit to Google's search rankings.
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:19.620]   But it really isn't, technically it's not a fork.
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:22.780]   Technically, it really just is an HTML page with a,
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.860]   but it's like using jQuery
[01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:27.660]   instead of rewriting your own jQuery like library.
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:31.100]   This time it's something that's been provided,
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.460]   but is open because there is a GitHub repo
[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:37.380]   and people can go in there and see it all and contribute.
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:40.700]   But I think it's also important to think about this
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.740]   in the context of the different realistic options.
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.260]   So option one is these proprietary platforms,
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:50.540]   which really are going back to the CompuServe and AOL days,
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.700]   these truly close platforms.
[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:55.340]   Option two is that everybody just starts using ad blockers
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:58.260]   or using the reader mode in Safari or Firefox
[01:00:58.260 --> 01:01:00.300]   and stripping all the branding
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:03.100]   and business model stuff out of the pages
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.620]   because they're just so frustrated
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.140]   by all the blow and the problems.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:11.940]   And I don't think those are really great options.
[01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:15.660]   - So this is the new, they turn this on today, right?
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.860]   And Mark Zuckerberg did a live feed of it.
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:20.940]   - Chris Cox did two live feeds.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:24.940]   I see he was just on with Jorge Ramos.
[01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.980]   - And he's the guy behind it, I think, Chris Cox is--
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.940]   - Yeah, and much, much, much, much credit here
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.740]   to Fijie Simon, who is the head of,
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.940]   she does all kinds of product stuff, including new stuff,
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:39.420]   but she's been really absolutely nose to the grindstone
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.700]   since she got back from her maternity leave on video.
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.460]   - Now you might say this is a--
[01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:46.940]   - Herb Jop with this, it's just a Me Too product.
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:47.780]   I mean, 'cause this is,
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:49.580]   "Miercat and Periscope" kind of did this too.
[01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.220]   In fact, Facebook, even did this Facebook mentions,
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:53.980]   which was available only to the,
[01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:57.020]   which camera, I should look at this camera,
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.020]   Facebook mentions, which was available
[01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:02.620]   only to the DigiRati for some time,
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:03.940]   and then was open to the public,
[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.820]   but you had to use a separate application.
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.660]   Then they put it in Facebook, but this is different.
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:11.060]   This is more like Meercat or Periscope,
[01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.380]   'cause you could see we've got comments going,
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:18.380]   scrolling up here, and I can do a thumbs up on a comment.
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:22.900]   We also have up here account, and it's live,
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:25.300]   and I should point out, I'm doing this on an iPad,
[01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.700]   'cause you need iOS to do it, it's not available on Android yet.
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:30.620]   But it does work on the iPad, and I should point out
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:35.020]   that it's rock solid if you saw, I mean, even Periscope.
[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:36.980]   And he was working for you too, right, Jeff?
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.580]   - Well, show me, yeah, show me.
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.940]   Oh, you have your feet, your laptop screen.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:41.900]   - Yeah.
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.380]   - So go to your laptop screen, you get me as if I'm on,
[01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:49.380]   now compare the quality of that, now go to me on there.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:52.700]   Now look how much better the quality of that is.
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:54.780]   - Well, less big, I am, and more human,
[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.580]   and flesh colored on Facebook Live than on Skype.
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:02.260]   Now what are you using, I thought you didn't have an iPhone.
[01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:05.500]   - Right, so I'm using my Nexus 6P, the front-facing iPhone.
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.180]   - Oh, so it does work on Android?
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.820]   - No, I'm using mentions.
[01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.820]   - Oh, 'cause you're using the old product,
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:11.660]   which has been upgraded.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:12.660]   - It looks like yours, it looks like yours.
[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:14.780]   - Yeah, they've upgraded it then, yeah.
[01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:17.180]   - But yeah, the Skype is so much worse.
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.900]   - But 'cause I'll tell you why,
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:21.340]   'cause Skype's doing it in real time.
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:24.420]   In fact, we have to use Skype so that you and I can converse.
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.260]   - True.
[01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:28.220]   - In real time, this is not a conversation medium.
[01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:30.140]   There is about five, 10 seconds lag.
[01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:31.180]   - Ah, but they're gonna be groups.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:33.740]   - If you go to the post that announces all the new features,
[01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:37.100]   one is they're gonna allow, well, at least you can do video
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:39.140]   to a closed group, I don't know if you can do group talk
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:40.060]   or not.
[01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:43.700]   - So this is competing more than with just Periscope
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:47.300]   and Mirkat, this is also competing with Facebook's Hangouts.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:48.620]   If the Google's Hangouts, you can--
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.340]   - I'm sorry, Google Hangouts.
[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:51.580]   Wow, that's very interesting.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.780]   - It's like so live for groups in advance,
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:55.300]   or maybe it's just to--
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:56.700]   - Well, you know who's using it right now,
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:00.500]   it's kind of timely, Loik Le Mer, who of course is good friend,
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:05.180]   entrepreneur, founder of Cismic, which was video messaging,
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:08.340]   he did a conference for years called Loib in Paris,
[01:04:08.340 --> 01:04:09.540]   and he sold that.
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:11.460]   He's now doing a new conference called Leaders,
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:16.460]   L-E-A-D-E-R, L-E-A-D-E dot R-S.
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:19.580]   And he's been streaming today from his Leaders Conference
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:23.860]   in Paris with some big names too.
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:24.820]   Reid Hoffman.
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:28.500]   - So--
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.340]   - Loik--
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.500]   - It's an interesting way to do a conference, isn't it?
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.820]   - It really is.
[01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:33.660]   - It really is.
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:37.620]   - Especially since he charged like 800 bucks to go in person,
[01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:39.940]   but you'd probably prefer to go in person
[01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:41.620]   'cause you got a chance to network and meet people.
[01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:45.020]   And I think this is a great way to promote an event.
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.260]   I mean, look at everybody's now doing that.
[01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:52.380]   Google Streams, most of IO, Microsoft just stream most of build.
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.580]   Of course, you still have an incentive to pay thousands
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.260]   of dollars to go and do it in person,
[01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.700]   but if you can't--
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:58.820]   - To schmooze.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:01.660]   But if you can't, this makes sense for conferences.
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:03.820]   He had Phil Libbon, the founder of Evernote,
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:05.660]   who's now become a venture capitalist.
[01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:06.700]   That was earlier today.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.540]   Pretty impressive.
[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:10.900]   - So you could also broadcast just to a group.
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.820]   - So like a closed group, you can invite--
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.300]   - Closed group and Facebook events.
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.540]   - You know why they do that though?
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.980]   They do that for family, right?
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:20.820]   - I would imagine.
[01:05:20.820 --> 01:05:23.060]   - But also companies, don't forget Facebook for work.
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:25.020]   They're trying to push that.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.300]   You know what, Loik is not doing this as leaders.
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:28.900]   He's as part of his leaders conference.
[01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:30.140]   That's not till next month.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:33.220]   This is promotional for his leaders conference.
[01:05:33.220 --> 01:05:36.340]   So he sat down with Phil and they're doing a teaser.
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:39.420]   And he used mentions for this.
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:42.380]   So is it, I mean, look at,
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:46.580]   Mircat went bad, Periscope.
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.140]   I don't see a huge adoption.
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:51.060]   I don't see a lot of Periscope videos on my Twitter timeline.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:52.140]   Why is this better?
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.540]   Why is this gonna do better than that?
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:55.140]   Or even Hangouts, Google's Hangout.
[01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.820]   - Power of Facebook.
[01:05:56.820 --> 01:05:57.820]   - Yeah.
[01:05:57.820 --> 01:05:59.780]   - Right, I mean, I think that I,
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:00.820]   these are people with my friends.
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:01.860]   I'll get a notification.
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:02.860]   I'll see what's what.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:06.140]   The fact that you can do it to a group,
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:07.740]   I think is interesting when I do this.
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:09.060]   I mean, the problem is this is not Hangouts yet,
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:11.220]   but it's not gonna take much for them to do that.
[01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:14.300]   And then you also saw they have a Facebook Live map.
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:17.780]   Journalistically, if something starts going on in the world,
[01:06:17.780 --> 01:06:21.980]   you can go and find people who are broadcasting live
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:23.580]   from events in that location.
[01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:24.820]   Journalistically, that'll be huge.
[01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.380]   If you go to the post, the Facebook post,
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.700]   the first mention down the page,
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:32.060]   you'll see the Facebook Live map.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.100]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:38.300]   - And that, that's not live, I don't know how live it is now.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:39.980]   They don't promote every video that's on.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:41.700]   They just promoted some videos.
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:43.740]   - Well, that was one of the cool things about Periscope,
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:46.500]   is you could see a map of all the different Periscopes
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.580]   and join other people's Periscopes and so forth.
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:50.780]   The idea is build a community.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:53.580]   - No, I click on you, I click on what looks like California.
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:54.980]   There you are, Leo.
[01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:56.740]   - Hey, California, how are you?
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:57.860]   Good to see you.
[01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:01.540]   - But it's telling me that you're live now.
[01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:02.380]   - Yeah.
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:03.780]   - And I can click around the world and go to different live
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:04.700]   things like-- - That's kind of fun.
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:09.740]   - You go to Elmo's Cara is now live.
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:10.740]   - But that's Periscope did this too.
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.820]   - And my own triplet is now live.
[01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:16.020]   - But I wonder, I think one of the cool things about this
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:18.460]   is, I remember when I was a kid,
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:22.340]   I used to listen to "Shirtwave Radio."
[01:07:22.340 --> 01:07:26.500]   - My God, we come a long way in the intervening 50 years.
[01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.380]   But I was so cool, I could listen and hear,
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.220]   (imitates cara)
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:31.660]   I'm listening to Moscow, go to eat Moscow.
[01:07:31.660 --> 01:07:34.500]   And now it's, yeah, I can watch a video from somebody
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.380]   in St. Petersburg showing, you know, I mean--
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:38.220]   - And it's nothing.
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:41.180]   - Charles L. Huff is live right now from Senegal.
[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:42.020]   - Wow.
[01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:46.140]   - Stefano Proceda is live right now from somewhere
[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:50.620]   in the middle of Spain along with Aline Giuseppe.
[01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:52.780]   - How long? - Friends.
[01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:53.660]   - How long is it basically?
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:57.300]   - How long before Facebook puts this in the right hand
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:07:58.980]   column where it shows, you know, trending.
[01:07:58.980 --> 01:07:59.980]   - I know.
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.660]   So mouse over any one of those dots,
[01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.140]   you'll find you on there.
[01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:05.900]   - There I am. - There you are.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.820]   And it's showing all the people who are watching you
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:08.940]   and where they're watching from.
[01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:10.380]   That is-- - Oh, look at that.
[01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:12.060]   So it's drawing a line.
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:14.060]   - That is-- - Oh man.
[01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:16.940]   - Two people are watching us in Hawaii, South America.
[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:18.980]   Wow, we are getting a--
[01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:21.420]   Hello, South East Asia?
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:23.860]   Look at that.
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:25.020]   - Wow. - Australia,
[01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:26.700]   three people in Australia.
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:27.780]   One in Perth.
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:32.180]   Wow, that is really cool.
[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.500]   That is really--
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:36.740]   Now where do I find the map again?
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:39.860]   - Go to, go to the Facebook post,
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:43.860]   go to Facebook Live Map, it's facebook.com/livemap.
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:46.940]   - Okay, facebook.com/livemap.
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:47.780]   Wow.
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:51.580]   So this shows the power of Facebook really
[01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:55.340]   because they can, they've got the servers,
[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:57.860]   they've got the community, they've got the network,
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:00.340]   they've got everything and they could put that together
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:02.660]   fairly instantaneously, right?
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.740]   - Geez, I'm just-- - Should they worry
[01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:06.580]   about the content?
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:10.900]   - You know what I'm saying?
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:13.740]   - Yes, oh yeah, well let me show you Leo.
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:15.420]   (laughing)
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:16.260]   - No, please don't.
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:20.940]   Yeah, of course they're going to
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:22.380]   and I wonder what they're doing about that.
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:23.220]   I don't know if anybody asks--
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:24.140]   - Chris talks about that today.
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:27.740]   - It's the real names thing is gonna help a little bit, right?
[01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:30.340]   - Yeah, 'cause if you mucked up,
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:31.940]   don't say use an M there, sort of--
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:32.780]   - Right.
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:35.020]   - Mucked up. - Mucked up.
[01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:36.100]   - Yeah, they'll kill your account.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:36.940]   - Right. - Yes, so they'll--
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:37.780]   - So you don't wanna,
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:40.300]   you wanna use this in a responsible fashion.
[01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:43.460]   - What, there would be no advantage.
[01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:45.140]   - Still streaming by the way.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.540]   - I'm still streaming too, and poor people,
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:47.740]   by the way, for those of you who are here,
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.780]   all 271 of those names, Leo,
[01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:51.300]   this is the Twig broadcast.
[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:53.900]   You can go to twit.tv/live
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:56.420]   - Yeah. - And you'll see the real show.
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:57.820]   I'm just showing-- - Yeah, but it won't be
[01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:58.980]   as much fun. - You wanna--
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:09:59.980]   (laughing)
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.060]   - Well, they're only hearing me now,
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.140]   so they hear long silences than me.
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.700]   - So incidentally, somebody in the chat room,
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:07.580]   thank you Carlos Contreras,
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:11.380]   says the live map is in the left column under apps.
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.580]   It's the very first app listed,
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:17.900]   so you can, that was just another shortcut to go there.
[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.260]   - That's funny if you guys, there's a lot of people,
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:21.180]   if you look at the dots, - Yeah.
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:22.980]   - With zero viewers.
[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:25.980]   - Well, yeah.
[01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:27.860]   - They're not as famous as we are Leo.
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:30.300]   - No, but wow, I just, I feel like
[01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.140]   this is really interesting technology.
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.180]   - Just, it's fascinating. - Yeah.
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.460]   - So now I've got, around the New York area,
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:38.500]   there's something called Iraq News,
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.900]   and they're live with 253, 350 reviewers,
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.300]   tons of Iraq.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.940]   - Imagine, I mean, this is the beginning
[01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:49.260]   of a new medium almost, a new broadcast medium,
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:52.540]   and in a way that even though Periscope pioneered it,
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:57.140]   or Meerkat, or Justin.tv pioneered it,
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:00.620]   this is so easy, and so many people are on Facebook.
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:05.580]   I can only imagine what the impact,
[01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:07.660]   I mean, would CNN start using this?
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:09.100]   - Well, yes, they will, in fact,
[01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:10.020]   a lot of broadcasters,
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:11.620]   if you go to the Facebook live page at the bottom,
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:13.340]   you'll see broadcasters have been using it all day.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:15.580]   But the best story about this is Jorge Ramos
[01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:18.660]   from Univision, when he covered, for example,
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:19.500]   the New Hampshire primary.
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:23.860]   He did three broadcasts that added up to 75 minutes.
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:25.380]   - Right. - So there were long broadcasts,
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:27.900]   and he got four and a half million viewers that day.
[01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:30.460]   - Wow, of course he's been using Snapchat,
[01:11:30.460 --> 01:11:32.460]   and all these media.
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:34.660]   But I think the advantage of this is,
[01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:35.940]   now I presume after I'm done,
[01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:37.700]   this is saved on my Facebook timeline.
[01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:38.540]   - Yes it is.
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.460]   - It's gonna be a lot of really long boring video
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:42.300]   on the Facebook, my case, because it's one-sided.
[01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:43.700]   - I don't hear it, the people wanna hear you
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:44.540]   with all the hearing aids being.
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:48.260]   - Steve Saylor, who's a good friend from the Toronto area,
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:51.660]   says we started using it at the radio stations he works for.
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:52.860]   - Makes sense. - Yeah.
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:56.380]   - Yeah, we'll use this.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.580]   Okay, so we're gonna be at,
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.860]   somebody asked, are you gonna be at NAB with this?
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:01.620]   We're gonna be at the National Association
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.900]   and broadcasters convention next month.
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:06.980]   In the live view booth, what is live view?
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:11.660]   It's a company that releases some very expensive hardware
[01:12:11.660 --> 01:12:14.300]   that allows you to live stream from anywhere.
[01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.740]   (laughing)
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:17.700]   Using the cell network.
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:18.540]   - Oh.
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:21.220]   - Wow.
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:23.740]   - This is impressive.
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.060]   - Wow.
[01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:25.900]   - Chris Cox, I'm kidding.
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:27.340]   - Stephen says it's not reached,
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.220]   the live map cannot be reached from France.
[01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.940]   I don't know why that would be, but it's interesting,
[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:35.540]   'cause in general this is a global rollout, right?
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.380]   I think what do they say?
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.500]   190 countries or something?
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.100]   - Well yeah, 'cause if you look at the map,
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:42.260]   they're using it from everywhere.
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.100]   - Everywhere, man.
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:43.940]   - Wow.
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:47.500]   - Iraq weed is live now.
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:53.820]   - That is amazing. - That is really fascinating.
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:56.460]   We live in interesting times.
[01:12:56.460 --> 01:13:00.260]   And then I guess the, oh, I see the reason you saw that
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:03.160]   is 'cause it had a pulsing blob.
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.700]   - Yes. - And that is music from Iraq.
[01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:09.340]   - Yeah. - Or they're featuring it.
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:10.540]   Maybe that's it.
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:12.020]   - I guess so, 'cause that's showing the connections.
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.500]   - I'm seeing some featured stuff.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:14.900]   Here's one from Thailand.
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:18.380]   308 viewers.
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:23.860]   - I hope it doesn't devolve though to attractive young women,
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:28.180]   you know, getting all of the feeds,
[01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:31.300]   but people, especially males being what they are.
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.300]   - Well, but look, okay, okay, well, Leo,
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:33.580]   that's the difference, right?
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:35.740]   Why are you gonna discover a video?
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:36.820]   And generally you're gonna discover it
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:38.500]   because it's somebody who's already involved
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:39.700]   with your feed in some way.
[01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:41.260]   Or it's a news source that you're following.
[01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:44.260]   It's another reason to want us to follow a news source.
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:46.500]   You're not gonna get it just because,
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:48.140]   unless you go to this map,
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.140]   even then it's so random the map,
[01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:51.220]   I think it's a way to sample.
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.060]   Why don't we have to hit a few?
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:53.460]   Let's just watch what's happening.
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:54.300]   - Okay.
[01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:57.860]   Here's Anja, Jacasbon Son,
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:01.260]   from, she here, I mean, from Visbaden.
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:04.260]   She's in the car, it looks like.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:06.700]   - I don't know, she's just sitting on our living room.
[01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:07.540]   - Is she speaking German?
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.780]   - I presume so.
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:10.860]   She's smoking.
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:12.260]   - Yeah, she quit smoking.
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:13.340]   - Put a comment in.
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:17.820]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:19.300]   - 372 viewers.
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:22.180]   Yeah, I was saying there, Leo.
[01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:23.900]   Rauken Istverboten.
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:24.740]   - Okay, Nazwah.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:26.580]   - Rauken Istverboten.
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:27.780]   Okay, how do I do that?
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:28.620]   Type that.
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:30.660]   - Sorry, UCH, yeah, I got a comment somewhere.
[01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:32.500]   - Okay, yeah, somewhere.
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:33.740]   She sneezed.
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:35.420]   I don't see how I comment, where do I comment?
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:36.260]   - Anja was a must and hasten,
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:37.580]   pass off the show.
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:40.380]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:41.500]   - I can like it.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:42.420]   Maybe it's over.
[01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:43.820]   - In Anja's life.
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:45.180]   - No, it says a lot.
[01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:50.300]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:14:50.300 --> 01:14:52.940]   - I've been told by people like Chad Johnson,
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:54.620]   people who work on Twitch a lot,
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:58.340]   that the key to success in at least Twitch videos
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:14:59.940]   is to interact with the chatroom.
[01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:05.180]   - Yes, I think I've learned that for another venue.
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:06.980]   - Hey, thanks for being here.
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.700]   - Absolutely, happy to be here.
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:10.180]   - It was kind of exciting, wasn't it?
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:14.060]   This is a first time ever at the Shoreline Amphitheater.
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:17.260]   Can you remember anybody, an outdoor keynote ever before?
[01:15:17.260 --> 01:15:19.060]   I don't, I was like, yeah,
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:20.780]   I think we've ever done something like that.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:22.580]   I know Google hasn't.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:24.740]   - I think Moses was the last time.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:27.740]   - Moses, yes, I have some commandments for you.
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:31.860]   That was the last time we had an outside keynote.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:34.860]   These are the thinnest, lightest commandments we've ever made.
[01:15:34.860 --> 01:15:37.820]   So let's start with Matt.
[01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:40.660]   Now, I know you're Google employee,
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:43.540]   but contextualize what we saw today for us.
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.140]   What does it all mean?
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:51.220]   - Well, I really liked that Google is not giving up
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:53.820]   on trying to figure out getting messaging right.
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.860]   And, you know, some of the stuff like Aloe,
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:15:58.100]   I think is really interesting,
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.980]   because you've always got people who can criticize
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:01.780]   and they can say, oh, it's gonna do this,
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:03.740]   or what about this or that?
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:06.900]   But I think it's really promising to see
[01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:09.700]   Google really not willing to give this up yet.
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:11.700]   We're gonna try to figure out what makes the right sense
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:15.460]   for Android and for iOS, how do you get a platform?
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:17.660]   And then there was also this underlying backbone
[01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:20.380]   of artificial intelligence and machine learning
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:22.780]   where whether it's Google Home or Aloe,
[01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:24.580]   all the way through a lot of the different things.
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.380]   You could see, soon, are mentioning that.
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:29.740]   And as a web guy, I was really happy to hear him call out
[01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:32.620]   progressive web apps and the accelerated mobile pages,
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:34.180]   because, you know, to have the CEO saying,
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:35.420]   hey, this is important,
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:37.380]   and here's the kind of speed improvement you can get,
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:38.780]   I think that's really nice.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:40.860]   - I actually stand corrected.
[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:45.660]   Windows 95 launch was an outdoor launch,
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:48.260]   I think at a big Seattle event.
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:52.380]   But what Windows 95 launch had,
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:54.500]   which the Google launch did not have
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.300]   is a bunch of geeks biting their lower lips
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:17:02.300]   and dancing in the most ungainly fashion.
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:05.540]   - Possible.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:06.380]   - It is unfortunate.
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:09.180]   - Thank you very much. - We're not gonna dance.
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:10.860]   - No dancing.
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:16.020]   Do you feel like Aloe is kind of the on-phone analog
[01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:20.820]   of Google Home, the new physical hub that they announced?
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:23.820]   It feels like really what Google's doing
[01:17:23.820 --> 01:17:25.740]   is putting Google everywhere.
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:28.300]   Google, they've now coined the name.
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:30.340]   Is this new, Matt, calling it Google Assistant?
[01:17:30.340 --> 01:17:31.780]   Is that something new?
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:32.700]   - I think that is new.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.580]   - Okay, but they needed that 'cause we didn't know
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:35.420]   what to call it.
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:38.580]   We have Siri, we have Cortana, we have Alexa, but yeah.
[01:17:38.580 --> 01:17:39.420]   - Yeah, you name it.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.140]   - Yeah, so Google Assistant now,
[01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:43.580]   and the idea is let's put it everywhere.
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.700]   It's on your phone, it's in your house,
[01:17:45.700 --> 01:17:48.020]   you talk to it, it will respond.
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:50.260]   It seems like it will respond in a similar way,
[01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:52.300]   no matter what platform you use.
[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:55.580]   I think that's very compelling, Matt.
[01:17:55.580 --> 01:18:00.580]   This is the science fiction dream that I had for a long time.
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:04.860]   - Well, and if you think about it,
[01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.340]   a very good way to think about Google
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:10.380]   is Google cares about how people get to Google.
[01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:11.820]   How do people typically get to Google?
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.460]   Well, get to Google search,
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:15.060]   they get there via a browser, okay, well,
[01:18:15.060 --> 01:18:16.340]   we need to have a browser.
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:17.420]   And in fact, it's called Chrome
[01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:20.060]   because it tries to get all the Chrome out of the way,
[01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:23.180]   you know, and how else do people get to Google?
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.060]   Well, they'll use a mobile operating system.
[01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:26.420]   Oh, okay, that's interesting.
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:28.500]   They'll use a laptop like a Chromebook.
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:29.500]   Okay, well, that's interesting.
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.900]   And so over and over again,
[01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.500]   you can see Google being very worried
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:36.460]   about people who can get in between users in Google
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:39.020]   and add barriers or obstacles.
[01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:41.580]   And so I do think it's a pretty smart way to think about it
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.300]   as if you can do voice recognition,
[01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:44.300]   if you can do the machine learning,
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:46.220]   if you can be a useful assistant,
[01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.740]   the mechanism of exactly how that gets delivered,
[01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.740]   whether it's a little hockey puck beside you,
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:53.140]   or whether it's in your Google now
[01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:54.340]   or your Google assistant.
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:56.300]   I think Google is pretty agnostic about that,
[01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:58.580]   but they want people to be able to do that
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:00.900]   and thinking about how to get around those barriers
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:02.220]   so that users can do those searches
[01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:03.700]   with a minimal amount of friction
[01:19:03.700 --> 01:19:05.660]   is a pretty good way to think about
[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:06.940]   what Google might or might not do.
[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:09.140]   Well, and speaking of which neither Alonodoro
[01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.900]   require a Google account,
[01:19:10.900 --> 01:19:13.060]   they're both tied to your phone number,
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:15.300]   not to your Google account.
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.980]   Because there's so many people around the world
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:18.700]   who don't have Google accounts
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.220]   or that's just another element of friction.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:24.620]   And so I think maybe you know the phone number of your friend
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:26.980]   and you don't know their email address or something like that,
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:28.580]   making it as easy as possible
[01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:29.900]   that you can have those interactions
[01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.620]   without worrying about join here,
[01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:34.820]   or off to whatever that kind of stuff.
[01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:36.020]   Just makes it a lot easier.
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:37.500]   - Is it the end of Hangouts?
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:41.460]   - I honestly, I think, I saw on Twitter,
[01:19:41.460 --> 01:19:43.660]   they need to clarify what's going on with Google Voice
[01:19:43.660 --> 01:19:45.140]   and Hangouts and all that sort of stuff.
[01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:47.180]   And I think that's a fair knock
[01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:50.020]   because you can try to have a monolithic communication app
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:51.380]   or you can say, oh no, it's actually better
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:52.900]   to break it into different ones,
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:55.220]   like Facebook split out messenger,
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:57.100]   and the right answer might evolve over time,
[01:19:57.100 --> 01:19:58.940]   but I do think Google needs to do a better job of saying,
[01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:01.340]   okay, here's what happens with Google Voice,
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:02.940]   here's what happens with Google Hangouts,
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:06.460]   because you like Google Voice,
[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:08.900]   you've used it a lot in your past, or Google Fi,
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:10.340]   I love Google Fi, I'm gonna use it
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:12.180]   when I'm going abroad in a few weeks.
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:13.700]   And that's very well supported,
[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:15.900]   but how exactly all those pieces interact?
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:17.980]   I think Google could do a better job of explaining
[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:19.780]   what their future roadmap looks like.
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:22.060]   - What do you think, Jason, is it the end of Hangouts?
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:24.700]   - I don't know how they can exist at the same time,
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.860]   how Aloe and Duo can exist side by side with Hangouts,
[01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:32.020]   because yes, Aloe and Duo bring their own expanded functionality,
[01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:33.260]   but I feel like Hangouts,
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.380]   I mean, it was basically like the next iteration
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.020]   of Hangouts was kind of how I saw it,
[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:38.420]   and they did a great job with it,
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:39.740]   I'm very excited to use it.
[01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:42.100]   But I don't know, like I was saying earlier,
[01:20:42.100 --> 01:20:43.900]   because there's so much confusion already
[01:20:43.900 --> 01:20:45.820]   that when you have a messaging app
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:46.900]   and a smart messaging app,
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:48.900]   you have a messaging app that has video chat,
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:50.740]   and then you have a video chat app,
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:51.900]   I don't know how they coexist
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:55.100]   without doing some sort of either elimination
[01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:57.940]   or convergence, or I don't know how they treat that,
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:00.140]   but it feels a little messy as far as that's concerned.
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:01.420]   - We need more clarification,
[01:21:01.420 --> 01:21:03.660]   and they were quick to say that Aloe
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:04.900]   isn't available till summer,
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:06.100]   and Duo is not available to summer.
[01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:06.940]   What do you like?
[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:09.340]   How do you like this thing, Jeffrey, the knock knock thing,
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:13.940]   where when you call somebody, they see you before they answer?
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:15.420]   - Right, so what it really struck me is
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:17.380]   that that's the end of Aloe's Intergram Bell,
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:18.260]   it's the end of the bell,
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:21.660]   it's the end of the ringtone, and all that idea is that,
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.260]   and it also means that you've now got to sell your call,
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:26.060]   'cause nobody wants to talk on the phone, right?
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:27.420]   Nobody likes anymore, so it's gonna be--
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:28.700]   - I'm doing something crazy,
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:30.220]   you gotta talk to me right now.
[01:21:30.220 --> 01:21:33.100]   - Hi, hi, hi, like his daughter, like--
[01:21:33.100 --> 01:21:34.420]   (laughing)
[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:36.660]   - Daddy, talk to me, daddy, look at me.
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:38.740]   (laughing)
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:41.900]   - Yeah, yeah, it's all, could you not talk to me?
[01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:43.820]   (laughing)
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:45.500]   - Oh my God, please.
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.380]   - It's gonna be a holy weather.
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:50.660]   (laughing)
[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:54.740]   - Android, and they did talk a lot about Android,
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:56.700]   and Roshi Lockheimer came on the stage,
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:58.940]   but they said, "We're gonna let you name it."
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:00.300]   Come on, Matt, what happened?
[01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:02.140]   They couldn't get the rice to Nutella?
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:06.900]   - Well, my favorite conspiracy theory is that
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:09.020]   Sundar Pachai visited India,
[01:22:09.020 --> 01:22:11.020]   and someone was like, "Why don't you name it after this,
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:13.860]   "you know, dish that starts with an N,
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:15.780]   "and he's like, "Well, this was like a year ago."
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:18.220]   He's like, "Maybe we'll open it up to an online poll,
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:20.540]   "and maybe everyone in India will vote for it
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:22.420]   "the next day or something like that."
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:24.300]   And so, you know, who knows?
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:26.660]   But I think at the very bottom in the fine print,
[01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:29.380]   it says, "We reserve the right to pick whatever we want.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:30.940]   "This is for entertainment purposes only,
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:32.980]   "it won't be judged, and I think they mean
[01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:35.100]   "you won't get feedback when you say it ought to be called
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:37.300]   "Newtella or not role or whatever."
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:40.740]   - And they specifically said it will not be name face.
[01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:43.140]   - Namey and McName face, they brought that right up.
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:46.140]   Smart. - Yeah, Android, nope.
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:51.220]   - The deadline is 11.59 pm Pacific time June 8th,
[01:22:51.220 --> 01:22:54.900]   so I presume that by the next couple of weeks we'll learn.
[01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:59.900]   You go to android.com/n, and you name Android n,
[01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:04.420]   and I guess this is the Indian dish, nayapam, nayapam.
[01:23:04.420 --> 01:23:06.060]   - It's like there might be tried to--
[01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:08.300]   - Yeah, slant it that way.
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:11.100]   - Android nayapam really, I don't know if nayapam
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:13.340]   is really the name we should give that.
[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:18.860]   Here's noodles and nectarines, nutmeg.
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:20.940]   Oh, I like this one, it had a post-it note,
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:22.420]   it's marshmallow.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:26.060]   The post-it note fell off, wait a minute,
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:28.580]   see, they took marshmallow, crossed off the M
[01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:33.220]   and put the N on there, and then the post-it note fell off.
[01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:37.260]   Mavy bean, that's not a dessert, nuts and nachos.
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:40.860]   - Is this, if only nachos were dessert, alas.
[01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:42.660]   - Oh, nachos. - Okay, what they're saying
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:45.220]   is it doesn't have to be a dessert anymore.
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:46.900]   - Nachos. - This anymore.
[01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:48.620]   - What about nachos?
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:55.580]   Nuts and nachos, together, two great treats together at last,
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:59.100]   and then there's a video about of the naming.
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.940]   I wish it were like this,
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:03.180]   this is straight out of Silicon Valley, right?
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:04.020]   - Let's see.
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:08.860]   - John Smith, I'm CEO of PNI Professional Naming Incorporate.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.740]   Guess we're gonna work on something big.
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:13.780]   The latest version of Android needs a name.
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:15.940]   They want people everywhere to share their ideas,
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:17.740]   but I think it's a job for PNI.
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:19.900]   - They had Kit Kat a while ago,
[01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:22.220]   Jelly Bean, Lollipop, marshmallow.
[01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:25.100]   - I was thinking maybe since we had marshmallow last time,
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:28.380]   maybe now we were gonna have marshmallow.
[01:24:28.380 --> 01:24:31.780]   I don't hate it, maybe like toasted marshmallow if you--
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:33.820]   - Chum, do you-- - You wanna make sure
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:34.820]   that a name is chum. - His name is Chum.
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.020]   - Is inspired.
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:36.780]   - People on the streets,
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:38.340]   they wouldn't understand a lot of what we're doing.
[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:41.060]   There's a lot of mathematics and metrics in it,
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:44.100]   but it's really half science and half art.
[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:45.900]   It's but, it's math and art.
[01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:48.500]   It's like a baby, when you give birth to a baby, it's science,
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.540]   but it's a baby and that is a soul.
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:51.740]   And then you have to name it.
[01:24:51.740 --> 01:24:53.060]   - Nachos. - Nachos.
[01:24:53.060 --> 01:24:55.340]   - It's a nachos.
[01:24:55.340 --> 01:24:56.860]   - No, nachos.
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:58.380]   - Nachos. - Nachos.
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:24:59.980]   - Everything is changing constantly,
[01:24:59.980 --> 01:25:01.100]   it's a global world.
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:02.820]   - If you don't do it right away, it's already--
[01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:03.820]   - Oh, there it is, the name is-- - It's already a--
[01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:04.820]   - You're putting it on a t-shirt.
[01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:05.660]   - Nashi pear.
[01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:07.820]   Naval orange.
[01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:09.860]   It's direct, distinct.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:11.180]   You know exactly what it is.
[01:25:11.180 --> 01:25:13.580]   - I feel really close to marshmallow.
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.100]   - I love you.
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:17.020]   Because it's got a length to it.
[01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:20.260]   - They say if a shark stops swimming, it's dying.
[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:22.100]   I don't know if it's dying, if it stops swimming,
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:26.380]   or if you're not out there, like a shark,
[01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:28.580]   naming things like shark wood.
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:31.140]   - I'm not sure if that's--
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:32.780]   - Okay, so let's bring it in.
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:35.420]   - We are names.
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:36.420]   We are names.
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:38.500]   - We don't need these guys, read the text.
[01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:40.860]   We just need you.
[01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.060]   What would you need?
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.620]   I should take Android N.
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:45.380]   I think that's actually, it's a lot of fun.
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:47.020]   It's not gonna get Bodie McBoveface.
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:48.420]   It's gonna get something.
[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:50.220]   - You know Landor Associates?
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:52.020]   - Yeah, that's what they do, right?
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:53.620]   - That's what they do. - Yeah.
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:55.580]   - I think they created Verizon.
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:56.980]   - They call it branding.
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:00.260]   - Or Nanding.
[01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:01.100]   - Nanding.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:01.940]   - Nanding.
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:02.780]   - Nanding.
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:04.620]   (laughing)
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:09.620]   - Today, Facebook published its criteria for the news feed,
[01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:10.980]   which I thought, I don't know,
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:13.540]   have you had a chance to look at this yet, Jeff?
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:16.380]   - Oh yeah, I wrote a quick post about it,
[01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:17.300]   which you'll find there.
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:18.140]   - Okay.
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:21.780]   - The Facebook said, Facebook did two things today.
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:25.700]   One was that they, for the first time,
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:27.780]   gave people a little more transparency
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:28.620]   into the algorithm.
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:30.460]   To the extent that they said,
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:33.060]   here are the principles that guide what we do.
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:35.060]   - News feed values. - For the only inference.
[01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:35.900]   - Yeah.
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:36.740]   - Right.
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:38.420]   What your family and friends first, that's our job.
[01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:39.700]   That's what Facebook does.
[01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:43.140]   People also wanna be informed and entertained.
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:44.340]   Now, when I've heard this in the past
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:45.180]   with the opposite order,
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:48.140]   it was friends, entertainment, information.
[01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:49.860]   - I know, this hasn't been my experience.
[01:26:49.860 --> 01:26:50.700]   There's, here's the quote,
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:52.380]   that's why if it's from your friends,
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:54.820]   it's in your feed, period.
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:26:56.020]   You just have to scroll down.
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:57.340]   That's not been my experience,
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:58.180]   but I'm-
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.020]   - No, that's not true.
[01:26:59.020 --> 01:26:59.860]   That's not true.
[01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:00.700]   'Cause a lot of people,
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:01.540]   I don't want to,
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:02.380]   I don't want to,
[01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:03.220]   I don't want to,
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:05.060]   but say at the same time,
[01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:06.780]   the second thing they did,
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:09.700]   which is that they also tweaked the algorithm
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:13.380]   to say, yes, we're gonna favor friends even more.
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:14.900]   And their warning news organizations
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:15.740]   are maybe an impact.
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:17.140]   Well, the news organizations are,
[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:17.980]   what, Batfish?
[01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:20.780]   Oh, sorry, sorry about that, Carson, edit.
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:21.820]   They went crazy.
[01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:23.820]   And New York Times,
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:26.940]   shock, shock, they're gonna show us cats, no news.
[01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:29.820]   They're a news organization, what are they doing?
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:31.380]   They've never been a news organization.
[01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:33.060]   It's never been a priority.
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:35.180]   This is a matter of degree.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:36.780]   But the, the,
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:40.820]   Neiman Lab post was the most reasonable,
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:42.420]   but most of the other posts I saw said,
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:44.660]   oh my God, they're gonna de-emphasize news.
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:47.060]   Everybody whose partner would do this with Facebook
[01:27:47.060 --> 01:27:48.740]   is basically an idiot.
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:51.460]   Well, we gotta wait and see over time
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:53.860]   and experience and data what actually happens.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:55.100]   Yes, there's an impact.
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:56.940]   But the real lesson here is,
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:00.140]   Facebook is not a place to read thousand word articles.
[01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:02.220]   Facebook is a place where you discuss things.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:05.940]   And we in news have to feed those discussions appropriately
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.300]   to the platform.
[01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:09.460]   You know, we don't get mad because Snapchat
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:10.900]   will not let us put up an article.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.300]   And we have to make things especially
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:13.980]   and appropriately for Snapchat.
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:16.900]   Well, Facebook is trying to gently guide us there, I think.
[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:20.260]   Nonetheless, all my e-ours in the news business
[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:21.940]   all went crazy today.
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:25.060]   Big bad Facebook is ruining news again.
[01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:26.780]   And I don't think that's the case.
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:29.700]   So the problem, I mean, what are the problems, I should say,
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:32.980]   is that a lot of news organizations in the last year or so
[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:35.340]   have oriented towards Facebook.
[01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:37.820]   And it's a significant driver of their traffic
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:40.420]   when you're trying to achieve those crazy scales.
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:43.020]   So it makes sense that everyone's like,
[01:28:43.020 --> 01:28:45.460]   holy cow, they're changing the algorithm.
[01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:47.940]   It's like when, it's like the Greeks, when they were like,
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:50.220]   oh, the gods are mad at us again, when, you know,
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:51.820]   it didn't rain in enough time.
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:53.860]   That's what it feels like.
[01:28:53.860 --> 01:28:55.500]   So I don't know.
[01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:58.660]   Are they going to start sacrificing goats on Mark Zuckerberg's
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:28:59.540]   porch is a question?
[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:02.700]   They'll be sacrificing journalists as pre-visual.
[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:05.060]   Farhad Manju's headline in the New York Times,
[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:10.140]   Facebook, a news giant that would rather show us baby pictures.
[01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:11.580]   Yeah, that's just so condescending.
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:14.780]   Not only to Facebook, but to every user of Facebook.
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:15.700]   Yeah.
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:16.180]   Yeah.
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:19.420]   I think actually I'll have to say Facebook,
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:23.060]   from my experiences, doing it about right for me personally.
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:23.900]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:25.060]   Yeah, I'm here.
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:29.100]   I go there and I see a nice mix.
[01:29:29.100 --> 01:29:31.940]   I do see a lot of news.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:35.420]   And I can't verify that I'm seeing everything my friends
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:37.380]   and family post.
[01:29:37.380 --> 01:29:38.540]   But I see a nice mix.
[01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:39.060]   And you're right.
[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:40.940]   I don't want to necessarily see everything
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:44.220]   my friends and family post.
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:47.940]   Facebook's ultimate metric is--
[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:49.580]   I mean, I don't think they've--
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:50.820]   Is there a surprise?
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:52.660]   Is, yeah, how much time you spend there?
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:54.260]   Period.
[01:29:54.260 --> 01:29:55.260]   And they're going to just--
[01:29:55.260 --> 01:29:56.460]   They have the data.
[01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:56.860]   They have the data.
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:57.540]   And they know.
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:58.860]   What you like and what you don't like.
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:01.820]   So they're going to just watch and see what you like
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:02.820]   and what you interact with.
[01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:04.340]   And they're going to give you more of that,
[01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:07.900]   because that's their only real job.
[01:30:07.900 --> 01:30:08.260]   Right?
[01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:11.180]   What's in here is the same as it is to be from VidCon.
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:13.780]   Is it less than ever unless you're VidCon?
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:14.940]   They're not about content.
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:16.580]   It's about social tokens.
[01:30:16.580 --> 01:30:19.020]   You make things to serve the conversations people have.
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:20.500]   And you can serve it with journalistic value,
[01:30:20.500 --> 01:30:23.660]   with facts and fact checking and information
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:25.420]   and explanation and education.
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:28.580]   But you do it appropriate to how people live their lives.
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:29.340]   We don't do that.
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:32.140]   We still make a destination product called an article.
[01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:34.420]   Well, that's-- sorry, folks, but that's
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:36.260]   what we have to rethink.
[01:30:36.260 --> 01:30:41.740]   And Facebook is not so gently making us do that.
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:43.180]   You know what's really happening?
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:47.700]   It's another similar shift from the library to the internet.
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:51.260]   So the way you use the library is very different
[01:30:51.260 --> 01:30:52.620]   the way that you use the internet.
[01:30:52.620 --> 01:30:55.740]   But the library is the old days where you would go
[01:30:55.740 --> 01:30:59.900]   to the library and you would get something to read.
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:02.820]   And similarly, you would go to the New York Times site
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:04.780]   and get something to read.
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:07.420]   But nowadays, you don't need to go to the library.
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:09.660]   You go to the internet, which is this tossed salad
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:12.060]   of things to read.
[01:31:12.060 --> 01:31:14.220]   If you want to find something to read, you can.
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:16.220]   But you're not going to go to the New York Times.
[01:31:16.220 --> 01:31:20.540]   You're going to go to a news aggregator or Facebook or Twitter.
[01:31:20.540 --> 01:31:23.820]   And you're going to see a story you're interested in.
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:26.140]   Read that and then read another, you know,
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:30.940]   a crouton from The Washington Post and the onion ring
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:33.380]   from the New York magazine.
[01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:35.220]   And you're going to move around.
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:38.780]   Is that a fair-- is that an after analogy?
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:40.700]   We all be asked your question to get you in trouble.
[01:31:40.700 --> 01:31:43.780]   Are you saying that libraries should close?
[01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:44.700]   Well, I--
[01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:45.300]   Yeah.
[01:31:45.300 --> 01:31:49.340]   As repositories of books, they need to--
[01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:49.780]   No.
[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:50.580]   They shouldn't close.
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:53.900]   What they should do is that they need to rethink their role
[01:31:53.900 --> 01:31:55.180]   in an internet age.
[01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:58.980]   They're no longer the place you go to find facts.
[01:31:58.980 --> 01:31:59.900]   They know that.
[01:31:59.900 --> 01:32:01.420]   They-- of course they do.
[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:05.380]   It's the thing librarians have been chewing on for 20 years.
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:06.780]   Yeah, I really think--
[01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:08.460]   they're trying-- what they should do,
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:11.820]   library's role should be to provide community services
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:14.860]   for people to educate themselves,
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:16.620]   get access to things that they haven't been able to.
[01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:19.380]   I know like our library is doing a lot with literacy,
[01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:20.660]   adult literacy, for example.
[01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:21.820]   They're doing a lot with--
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:23.700]   a lot of libraries are opening up maker spaces.
[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:27.460]   I don't know how they do that in a quiet environment,
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:28.300]   like a library.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:29.500]   But they open up maker spaces.
[01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.260]   And they have 3D printers and other things.
[01:32:31.260 --> 01:32:32.420]   And it's an investment.
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:34.380]   But I think those are the types of things
[01:32:34.380 --> 01:32:37.100]   that libraries can be a wonderful resource.
[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:39.700]   Everybody knows where the library is, or most people do.
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:42.940]   So you go there to learn a little differently.
[01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:44.620]   You might not check out a book, but maybe you'll
[01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:48.580]   learn how to 3D print a holder for your tablet
[01:32:48.580 --> 01:32:49.900]   or something like that.
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:53.900]   So to extend my analogy, perhaps to the point of breaking,
[01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:56.100]   just as a library has to rethink its role
[01:32:56.100 --> 01:33:00.020]   in an internet era, so does a news journal.
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:02.660]   Because you can't expect people to go to the front page
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:07.340]   and read from the top to the bottom and see a giant full page
[01:33:07.340 --> 01:33:08.220]   ad for Macy's.
[01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:09.940]   It doesn't work that way.
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:11.380]   I think maybe the publishers have to--
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:14.820]   I mean, most journalists think of their job not as--
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:17.300]   they think of their job as providing information, I think.
[01:33:17.300 --> 01:33:18.060]   Right.
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:19.100]   Most of the people I do do that.
[01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:20.820]   That's a better way to hold it.
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:24.660]   The business model, though, God help us all.
[01:33:24.660 --> 01:33:28.500]   I have a little something.
[01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:29.180]   Is it a minion?
[01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:30.460]   I want it to be a minion.
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:33.780]   Minion-like, you will now be my minions.
[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:36.300]   You are my minions.
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:37.060]   Oh, you got it?
[01:33:37.060 --> 01:33:38.380]   You didn't have to stand in line?
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:39.380]   Acticles.
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:42.300]   I took advantage of this thing called eBay.
[01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:44.260]   Oh, how much over the market was it?
[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:45.580]   It was only 200 some.
[01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:46.260]   Wasn't much.
[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:46.860]   Oh.
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:47.980]   So they're down for about thousands.
[01:33:47.980 --> 01:33:48.980]   Yeah, and it was a buy-in now.
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:51.580]   And that's because the store in Manhattan
[01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:54.300]   is open all the time, or not all the time, but all evening.
[01:33:54.300 --> 01:33:56.180]   And so it's a lot-- and you can make a reservation,
[01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:57.020]   so it's a lot easier.
[01:33:57.020 --> 01:34:01.660]   I think people are actually content to make 100 bucks.
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:03.380]   I would be content to make 100 bucks.
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:03.700]   They go.
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:04.540]   They get a few.
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:05.540]   Yeah.
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:08.140]   So here you go.
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:08.700]   Should I open it?
[01:34:08.700 --> 01:34:10.860]   I mean, it's sealed in the box.
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:12.380]   I'll have to charge him.
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.980]   But I thought it's probably important for me
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:14.700]   to know about this.
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:16.980]   I'm not a big snapper.
[01:34:16.980 --> 01:34:17.460]   It is.
[01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:18.460]   It's totally important to--
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:18.980]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:21.580]   This is something the kids are doing.
[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:22.100]   And I--
[01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:24.540]   Oh, you chose black, not coral or turquoise?
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:25.780]   Well, OK.
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:28.620]   Call me insane, but I just wanted--
[01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:30.460]   I didn't want to look too weird.
[01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:33.340]   I'm going to call you old Leo.
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:34.260]   I won't call you insane.
[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:35.300]   I'll just-- oh.
[01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:36.180]   Now, I don't know.
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:39.420]   Is this supposed to be speckled like that, or is that mold?
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:40.820]   I guess it's supposed to be speckled like that.
[01:34:40.820 --> 01:34:42.220]   That looks legit.
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:43.620]   That looks legit.
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:45.860]   Smell it and see what happens.
[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:49.940]   Oh, it smells like fine polyurethane.
[01:34:49.940 --> 01:34:51.700]   Oh, that's the charger.
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:52.100]   Right there.
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:52.900]   I'm going to need a--
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:53.500]   Oh.
[01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:54.060]   Yeah.
[01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:55.580]   Because they charge in the case.
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:59.340]   Well, this is new in the box, kids.
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.900]   Ooh.
[01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:03.060]   All right, I'm going to put them on.
[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.220]   I don't think there's a charge on them,
[01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:05.300]   but I'm going to put them on.
[01:35:05.300 --> 01:35:06.540]   You tell me how good I look.
[01:35:06.540 --> 01:35:07.620]   Goofy time.
[01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:08.060]   Ready?
[01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:13.660]   I actually think for your face, they
[01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:15.940]   should be a little bigger, Leo, which is quite a--
[01:35:15.940 --> 01:35:17.300]   I have a very--
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:19.620]   They look huge on everybody else, don't they?
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:21.860]   And I use such a melon head.
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:24.660]   I have the world's most massive head.
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:30.180]   And I have to actually buy special wide glasses.
[01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:30.460]   Like--
[01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:31.580]   The Big and Tall glasses?
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:34.500]   I go to the Big and Tall glasses store.
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:36.780]   And these are too small for me, dang it.
[01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:41.100]   I thought, if anything would be big enough,
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:42.580]   Cara, come here.
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:45.700]   Cara, put these on and see how it looks on you.
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:48.500]   Cara's a beautiful young woman who has a normal size head.
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:49.580]   See, they look--
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:50.740]   Oh, Cara.
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:53.020]   They look so good on you.
[01:35:53.020 --> 01:35:55.700]   Oh, I should just give them to Cara.
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:58.060]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:35:58.060 --> 01:35:59.700]   I was actually--
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:00.540]   I was going to--
[01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:02.660]   I think I'm going to keep them because I want--
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:03.740]   I like the idea.
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:08.260]   I've heard that streaming live videos all the rage these days.
[01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:11.500]   So I was thinking maybe I should do some of that.
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:13.260]   I don't look like Casey Neistat, that's for sure.
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:13.820]   So look at this.
[01:36:13.820 --> 01:36:16.300]   They get a nice USB cable.
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:19.140]   And this is proprietary.
[01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:21.220]   It's not a traditional USB cable.
[01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:24.220]   It's got Pogo pins that go in the back of this.
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:25.300]   But you know what, John, I'm just going
[01:36:25.300 --> 01:36:26.180]   to plug it into the computer.
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.420]   I don't need to--
[01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:29.300]   I don't need to get special.
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:30.460]   Don't do I have--
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:33.540]   He just has to walk three feet to get to the computer.
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:34.900]   Computer.
[01:36:34.900 --> 01:36:36.460]   Hey, what's special?
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:38.420]   Computer.
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:39.180]   OK.
[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:41.180]   Ah.
[01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:42.180]   That is hard.
[01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:44.540]   Now you know you're old when it's a workout
[01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:47.940]   to get up and go inside the table.
[01:36:47.940 --> 01:36:49.540]   Well, when you go that way, yes.
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:50.740]   Yeah, that is the long way.
[01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:53.300]   All right, so I'm going to put them in this box.
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:58.180]   And I have to peel stuff off, peel that off.
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:36:58.540]   Oh, I see it.
[01:36:58.540 --> 01:37:02.300]   And I say that I love charging things in their boxes.
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:06.940]   I love-- I mean, as I've got all these proprietary cable
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:07.380]   dongle pins.
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.500]   Yeah, it's ugly, isn't it?
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:10.060]   I see behind you, you've got a charger.
[01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:12.060]   It's a pain in the butt, right?
[01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.860]   Yes, behind me, there's a charger and a connected blood
[01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:16.260]   cuff, blood pressure cuff.
[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:16.740]   Oh, my God.
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:18.260]   Are you OK?
[01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:18.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:18.780 --> 01:37:20.060]   Oh, you know what's cool?
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:22.860]   OK, this is good design too.
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:25.140]   So the pogo pins-- I was wondering,
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:26.420]   well, where do I plug these in?
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:27.980]   Because you don't see any visible.
[01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:32.220]   The pogo pins are hid behind the hinge on the glasses.
[01:37:32.220 --> 01:37:32.700]   So when you--
[01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:34.220]   Oh, wait, you have to plug them in?
[01:37:34.220 --> 01:37:35.300]   Well, you put them in the case.
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:36.340]   Oh, you just connected them.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:38.460]   But there's got to be a way to connect to the case, right?
[01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:40.220]   And so to the charger in the case,
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:42.980]   and it just goes, it's not the most--
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:43.740]   oh, yeah, you could see.
[01:37:43.740 --> 01:37:45.380]   Oh, oh, oh, you could tell you're doing it right
[01:37:45.380 --> 01:37:48.980]   because the little LED array lights up.
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:51.500]   And actually, they're mostly charged.
[01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:52.620]   They're mostly charged.
[01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:56.820]   So I want to let them sit there for a little bit
[01:37:56.820 --> 01:38:00.660]   and throb gently while we do the show.
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:03.980]   And maybe a little later in the show, I'll Snapchat this.
[01:38:03.980 --> 01:38:05.100]   All right, now, what did it say?
[01:38:05.100 --> 01:38:06.140]   It said, take a picture.
[01:38:06.140 --> 01:38:08.700]   Where's the button on this?
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:09.180]   Here it is.
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:10.060]   There's the button.
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:12.260]   So I pressed this button, and I'm
[01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:14.620]   supposed to see a QR code, right?
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:16.180]   What happened?
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:17.860]   I got to read this again.
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:19.340]   Install the laser for the Snapchat.
[01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:21.380]   Oh, swipe down to view your Snapcode.
[01:38:21.380 --> 01:38:22.940]   Oh, I wasn't viewing my Snapcode.
[01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:25.340]   OK, look at your Snapcode and press the button
[01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:26.260]   on the spectacles.
[01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:28.780]   OK, there's my Snapcode if anybody wants it.
[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:30.980]   You can show my Snapcode.
[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:32.780]   Oh, Snapchat would like access.
[01:38:32.780 --> 01:38:36.340]   Yes, keep looking directly at the Snapcode.
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:36.860]   I'm looking.
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:38.340]   I'm not--
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:40.420]   Spectacles found.
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:43.100]   This has to be easy because this is aimed at--
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:44.300]   name your spectacles.
[01:38:44.300 --> 01:38:46.980]   What should I name them?
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:48.780]   Banana.
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:50.620]   I was going to say, blues brothers come up a lot.
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:52.220]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:54.020]   It's dark.
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:55.380]   We're wearing sunglasses.
[01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:57.340]   We've got a full tank of gas.
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:38:59.820]   I'm going to call it hit it.
[01:38:59.820 --> 01:39:02.860]   Isn't that what they say at the end of that quote?
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:03.940]   Hit it.
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:06.220]   And then only I will know what I'm talking about,
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:08.380]   but it's a little blues brothers reference.
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:13.380]   These are the hit it spectacles, connecting the spectacles.
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:18.500]   So exciting, I can now select an accessory.
[01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.500]   Oh, hit it.
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:19.860]   See?
[01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:21.300]   Hit it.
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:21.700]   Boom.
[01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:25.980]   It's a little emoji with sunglasses on.
[01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:27.260]   Setting up spectacles.
[01:39:27.260 --> 01:39:30.020]   All right, so it's fairly easy.
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:33.820]   This is what the Eros and the Orbeez and everything.
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:36.980]   These are all like the same kind of thing, where you're
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:37.780]   impaired.
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:41.460]   OK, press once to take a 10 second video Snap.
[01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.220]   Press again to extend by 10 seconds
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:44.860]   to press and hold to stop recording.
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:46.620]   So I've been reading.
[01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:49.100]   There's articles on how to get good snaps.
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:51.380]   And one of the things that says is if you triple tap,
[01:39:51.380 --> 01:39:53.180]   you get 30 seconds.
[01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:56.500]   Double tap the side to check your battery level.
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:59.420]   OK, if you're running low, put the spectacles in there.
[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:00.780]   Charging case.
[01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:02.500]   Specs light up when they're charging.
[01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:03.620]   Yeah, I noticed that.
[01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:05.700]   Charging case holds about four full charges.
[01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:06.500]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.140]   So I'm charging the case.
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:08.940]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:10.660]   All right, all right.
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:13.180]   And then I-- oh, apparently I have a story already.
[01:40:13.180 --> 01:40:18.940]   All right, get HD.
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:21.780]   What does that mean?
[01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:23.900]   By default, stories are imported in SD.
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:25.500]   You can import your favorite stories in HD.
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:25.980]   I got it.
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:27.260]   OK.
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:28.260]   All right, no, no.
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:30.780]   All right, so should I do a story?
[01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:31.260]   Probably.
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:32.260]   All right, all right.
[01:40:32.260 --> 01:40:32.980]   Look at me now.
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:33.900]   Look at me.
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:34.580]   All right, ready?
[01:40:34.580 --> 01:40:38.420]   MTF at twice for 20 seconds.
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:41.980]   This is what happened when Leo got his brand new Snapchat
[01:40:41.980 --> 01:40:43.300]   spectacles.
[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:46.380]   Everybody was so jealous.
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:49.340]   They just turned bright green.
[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:50.900]   Hello, everybody.
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:54.060]   I'm-- is it snapping, snap chatting?
[01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:55.060]   Snap chatting?
[01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:55.980]   I don't know.
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:57.340]   Snapping sounds snappier.
[01:40:57.340 --> 01:41:00.580]   I'm with the kids, man.
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:02.020]   Does the light go around in it?
[01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:04.020]   Yeah, that's to let you know that it's going.
[01:41:04.020 --> 01:41:04.540]   That's pretty cool.
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:06.620]   Can you see that it's recording?
[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:07.140]   Yeah.
[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:09.020]   That's the one that's like from your perspective?
[01:41:09.020 --> 01:41:09.580]   Yeah.
[01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:10.700]   Oh, no.
[01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.460]   You can't see anything.
[01:41:12.460 --> 01:41:12.860]   OK.
[01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:13.620]   And now it's--
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:14.780]   So the--
[01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:18.300]   So the thing I read said a couple of things,
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:21.420]   put your hands in the Snapchat a lot.
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.900]   Otherwise, it just looks like a video.
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:25.100]   But this way, now you know it's first person if you do that.
[01:41:25.100 --> 01:41:32.500]   They also said, have a beginning, a middle, and an end.
[01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:35.140]   They also said, what else did she say?
[01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:36.220]   Anyway, stuff like that.
[01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:40.660]   I kind of like the idea of just being
[01:41:40.660 --> 01:41:42.700]   like surreptitious videos that you snapped.
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.060]   Right.
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:43.420]   Or thinking--
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:44.060]   That's surreptitious.
[01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:45.300]   But yeah.
[01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:46.460]   Well, yeah.
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:48.140]   Everybody's going to stay away from the guy with the movie
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:48.860]   classes.
[01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:51.620]   Right after the show, I'm going to Vegas.
[01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:55.140]   OK.
[01:41:55.140 --> 01:41:57.100]   You're going to use it to count cards?
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:59.140]   Send it to your hedge fund dude in the back.
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:41:59.780]   I bet they don't let--
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:02.620]   What do you think if I go in the casino with this and start
[01:42:02.620 --> 01:42:03.540]   to try to play black check?
[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:04.780]   They're not going to like that.
[01:42:04.780 --> 01:42:05.780]   Yeah, I think you should--
[01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:06.460]   They're not going to say surrept--
[01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:10.100]   Were there any stories of Google classic casinos?
[01:42:10.100 --> 01:42:11.900]   Oh, probably not.
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:13.300]   Probably you don't get through the door.
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.340]   I will try.
[01:42:14.340 --> 01:42:18.420]   I do have experience with this because one CES,
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:21.620]   we were going to an event through a casino with a camera
[01:42:21.620 --> 01:42:24.140]   crew, and I said, get everything.
[01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:25.780]   And we immediately got stopped and said,
[01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:27.500]   you have to turn your camera off.
[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:31.580]   And my camera guy, who blesses soul, fought him.
[01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:33.020]   And I said, not physically.
[01:42:33.020 --> 01:42:35.220]   He was, no, I'm not going to press.
[01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:36.260]   So I said, no, no, sorry.
[01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:38.260]   Don't just pretend you're turning it off.
[01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:40.100]   We actually, I think we were streaming live.
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:40.380]   So just--
[01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:44.060]   Yes, in June 2013, the New Jersey Division of Gaming
[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:47.740]   Enforcement issued a directive for Atlantic City to ban
[01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:48.980]   casino patrons--
[01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:53.460]   They don't want any video, any camera in the casino.
[01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:53.900]   Huh.
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:56.820]   Is it because of things like tracking and tracking?
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:59.300]   No, I think, well, possibly, but also, they just
[01:42:59.300 --> 01:43:00.300]   don't want anybody to know.
[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:01.780]   It's the same reason the TSA doesn't
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:05.140]   want you to take pictures at TSA.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:06.740]   Well, that's silly.
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:09.780]   Actually, you're catching people in affairs.
[01:43:09.780 --> 01:43:10.860]   Oh, that's true, too.
[01:43:10.860 --> 01:43:13.140]   What happens in Vegas--
[01:43:13.140 --> 01:43:14.180]   Should stay at the same day.
[01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:16.060]   Show us up on Snapchat.
[01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:18.980]   Well, everybody should follow me.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:20.140]   I just showed you my thing.
[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:23.620]   I don't remember what it was, but I'm that guy on Snapchat.
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:24.540]   Your handle?
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:25.340]   Your handle?
[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:26.620]   I think I'm chief twit.
[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:27.060]   I don't know.
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:30.260]   Can we watch it on Snapchat now?
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:32.660]   I don't know what happens next.
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:33.620]   It should be beautiful.
[01:43:33.620 --> 01:43:36.580]   Yes, it's on Snapchat.
[01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:39.540]   You may have to approve it, actually.
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:40.300]   I don't know what that's next.
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:41.780]   But it should tell you, because--
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:50.740]   Could somebody go look and see if I'm chief twit on the snap?
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:51.220]   Hold on.
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:53.820]   I don't know how this stuff works.
[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:54.260]   We find a way to--
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:58.060]   Snapchat is intentionally, by the way, obtuse,
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:03.340]   because that's all part of the mystique.
[01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:05.940]   Well, I hope you've enjoyed this best of--
[01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:06.580]   I know I have.
[01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:09.020]   It's so fun to go down memory lane.
[01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:11.260]   Welcome Stacey to our team.
[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:12.860]   Watch Jason.
[01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:14.740]   Make almost the biggest fool of himself
[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:17.620]   as I did when I stuck the pen in the galaxy note
[01:44:17.620 --> 01:44:21.060]   for five backwards.
[01:44:21.060 --> 01:44:23.300]   Maybe this year we'll bring a galaxy note eight.
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:24.940]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[01:44:24.940 --> 01:44:26.900]   I know this year we'll bring a lot to talk about.
[01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:29.860]   And we'll do it right here on this week in Google.
[01:44:29.860 --> 01:44:32.420]   We really appreciate your listening or watching.
[01:44:32.420 --> 01:44:33.500]   And I hope you will come by.
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:37.020]   We do it live if you'd like to participate live every Wednesday,
[01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:43.500]   1.30 p.m. Pacific, 4.30 p.m. Eastern, 21.30 UTC.
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:45.620]   And if you can't watch live, there's always

[01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:57.500]   I'm not sure what the link is.
[01:44:57.500 --> 01:44:58.980]   Just go to youtube.com/twit.
[01:44:58.980 --> 01:45:01.940]   And there's a link to the twig channel right there.
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:03.300]   Thanks for being here.
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:05.540]   I hope you had a wonderful holiday.
[01:45:05.540 --> 01:45:10.820]   And I wish you all the best for a brand spanking new new year.
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:12.020]   Have a great 2017.
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:15.100]   We'll be right here this coming Wednesday, January 4.
[01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:16.300]   I hope you will too.
