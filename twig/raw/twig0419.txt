[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.920]   On today's episode, we're going to talk about a Walmart, Google,
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.240]   shacking up, kind of doing the Amazon thing in a new way.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.080]   We're going to be talking about Android Oreo.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.840]   I've got my Oreo cookie right here.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.240]   Samsung's big Galaxy Note 8 event, and a whole lot more.
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.800]   This week in Google is next.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.160]   Netcasts, you love.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.520]   From people you trust.

[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.800]   It's time for Twig.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.760]   This week in Google, this is the show
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.240]   where we talk about Google, the Google.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.400]   Sometimes, as I like to call them, the Goog, the Cloud.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.880]   Sometimes we venture off into different directions,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.760]   Facebook, social media, all sorts of topics.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.800]   But we've got a lot of Google stuff to talk about today.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.080]   So I have a feeling we're going to be mostly on point.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.960]   I'm Jason Hal, filling in for Leo LaPorte, who is--
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.680]   I think he's in Anaheim.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.840]   He's traveling to Anaheim for the podcast movement.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.560]   There we go.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.360]   So he's not here this afternoon.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.960]   I'm joining you.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.680]   I'm super thrilled to be back, joined as always,
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.960]   by Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com, professor
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.800]   at the CUNY School of Journalism.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.840]   How you doing, Jeff?
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.320]   Hey, hey.
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.600]   So is it L-Google, La Google, Derek Google?
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.360]   I think-- well, you know what?
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.080]   Based on the success of a trademark story that we're
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.480]   going to be talking about a little bit later,
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.560]   it might be all over the place.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.240]   It might have the change, and it might stay--
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.800]   It might be lowercase Google, yeah.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.840]   Google might be the new cleanest.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.840]   I don't think I'm always there, but we'll talk.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.200]   Yeah, we'll definitely talk about that.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.360]   It's good to see you, man.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.240]   Also joining us as usual, Stacey,
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.480]   Hey, good morning.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.760]   Creator of the IoT podcast at IoTpodcast.com,
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.200]   and the internet of things newsletter at StaceyOnIOT.com.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.720]   How you doing, Stacey?
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.520]   I am super, super well.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.760]   Super well, super good.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.120]   I am excited to be here today.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.400]   I've had a lot of coffee.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.900]   Excellent.
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.840]   Yeah, problem.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.920]   That makes for the best show.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.040]   I think we're all super cool.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.280]   Everyone be alert.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   And you have some things happening in the background.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.840]   Behind the scenes, your Google Home is booting up,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.520]   because you're going to-- maybe.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.720]   If we can get it to work, you're
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.600]   going to maybe test out making a phone call with your Google
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.760]   Home.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.400]   We love doing these raw demos where we don't actually
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.240]   know what's going to happen.
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.080]   We troubleshoot, so you don't have to.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.400]   That's right.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.440]   We make telephone calls, because no one makes telephone calls.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.440]   We might as well see someone making telephone calls.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.920]   I don't know.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.160]   I guess I don't make very many telephone calls in my life
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.440]   anymore.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.120]   It's all text.
[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.280]   It's all messaging.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.880]   But it's nice to have this feature.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.800]   It hit my Google Home a couple of days ago.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   And then I promptly made a telephone call to myself,
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.560]   because I didn't want to bother anybody, basically.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.640]   Because you have no friends?
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.720]   Because that's how I felt when I alerted my Amazon Echo
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.960]   to its calling features.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.600]   I was like, oh, I don't have any friends.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.080]   Wow, look at that.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.040]   I'm going to message my phone from my Echo.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.040]   Exactly.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.760]   I was like, someone go in the room.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.560]   We'll try it from here.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.800]   I mean, do you know--
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.520]   I'm sure you know people who do have the Echo.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.080]   Have you ever thought about giving them a call in their Echo?
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.920]   So the only person I've ever called on the Echo--
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.120]   well, I called my daughter in her room.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.520]   So we use it like an intercom.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.040]   Actually, that's been useful the last couple days.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.720]   But mostly, I call Kevin Tofol just
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.320]   to like, freak him out in the middle of the day.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.440]   Do you have drop-in privileges with Kevin?
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.760]   So Kevin doesn't have a show.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.760]   Oh, okay.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.960]   So, no, I just make the formal phone call.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.040]   Because he and like, I think one other person are the only people
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.720]   I have that are my Echo friends.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.440]   But Google, since it uses your phone number,
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.040]   you could have real friends with phone privileges.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.920]   It's true.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.880]   I mean, it's a real phone.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.400]   Whatever.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.720]   If you've got Google Voice, if you've got Project Fi,
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.960]   your phone number is going to show up.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.760]   And otherwise, they're not going to pick up the phone.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.520]   Because it's an unknown call.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.400]   But does it do the predicted spam color?
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.120]   Like, I love it.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.960]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.600]   It does that.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.400]   That is the greatest thing.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.800]   I love it so much.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.760]   Although it doesn't give me--
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.680]   I doubted it once.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.400]   And I learned.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.320]   It's like the ways, lady, you never, ever, ever disagree
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.600]   with the ways, lady.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.560]   You both disagree with the Google spam notification.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.000]   It's true.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.320]   You just got to give your trust.
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.840]   Give your trust to Google on this.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.280]   Same thing with navigation.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.240]   I completely agree.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.240]   It's any of those times when I'm like,
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.720]   why are you taking me down there that couldn't possibly
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.080]   save me time is when I end up screwing myself.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.880]   So just put all your faith in Google.
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.480]   I will say, to save a minute or two,
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.320]   my husband will sit in a parking lot
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.720]   or in our driveway plotting the best route.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.680]   And I'm kind of like, you know what?
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's not worth it.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.720]   Let's just go.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.040]   Let's just move.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.600]   And he's like, no, I've got to see the best route.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.560]   It's a little freaky.
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.720]   It's a little OCD-ish.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.960]   It feels like sometimes.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.200]   Toggling the best route within the app
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.840]   or trying to come up with the best route himself.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.040]   Just like, we'll be at Target or something.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.240]   And he's like, oh, we should go home.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.560]   And there are not that many ways to get home from Target.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.200]   We don't have to optimize quite so much.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.680]   (laughing)
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.360]   He'll spend a minute looking at stuff up in the parking lot
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.600]   while someone's waiting for the spot.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.360]   - What about my favorite tweet this week?
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.640]   My favorite tweet this week was someone,
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.640]   it was a guy saying that 20 years of wonderful marriage,
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.160]   the secret to success, GPS.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.760]   GPS is true.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.600]   - It's magical.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.040]   It takes the power out of everyone's hand.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.800]   - It saves you from the worst arguments of all.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.200]   I don't know how I live.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.520]   - The whole new thing is obsessing over roots.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.360]   I like that.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.160]   I would do that, I think.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.920]   - Yeah, I think as we get more technology in our lives,
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.600]   where we're like, it's the same thing.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.880]   It's like Yelp paralysis
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.640]   when you're trying to pick a restaurant.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.480]   - Yes.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.200]   - And you're like, oh, let's look at all the reviews.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.600]   This is really the best restaurant.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.840]   So I tease my husband,
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.800]   but this is a really profound issue, I think.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.760]   - Meanwhile, if you saved a minute in the app
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.240]   and you spend a minute up at the top,
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.400]   it doesn't matter, right?
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.760]   Trying to figure out the best route.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.120]   So you might as well just dive right in.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.920]   And hit the road.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.720]   - All right, so we actually had real things to talk about.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.560]   - Okay.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.920]   - It's complaining about how we laid that.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:25.760]   - We do.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.880]   I think that's important though.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.400]   I think this gets to, you know,
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.080]   everybody, hopefully all of you have a Google Home
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.560]   and you wonder whether you should make calls with it.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.840]   So not to mention,
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.360]   you'll also be able to connect your device
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.200]   to your Google Home via Bluetooth.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   That's another thing that's coming to Google Home.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.680]   I think right now, I haven't tested that out myself,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.680]   but apparently Google is pushing out Bluetooth capability
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.560]   to Google Home.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.000]   So you have a couple of new things to try from this year's
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.240]   Google I/O, still a few things not here yet.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.920]   They had mentioned proactive assistance,
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.240]   which was things like if you've got a calendar event
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.560]   that Google Home is tracking or that assistant is tracking,
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.400]   it will tell you in advance like,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.520]   hey, we just noticed that there's a five minutes
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.560]   slow down on your route to that calendar event.
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.800]   So you better hit the road right now.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.400]   So proactively it'll give you information
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.280]   to hopefully improve your life, not complicate it.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.720]   And then also what was the other one?
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.000]   It was the view of your information on other screens.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.360]   What was that called?
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.960]   Visual responses.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.240]   It's the other function that we haven't seen yet.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.280]   I don't know what we're gonna get to.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.040]   (laughs)
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:40.880]   - Christmas?
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.640]   - Yeah, possibly so.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.880]   Do you wanna try and call someone real quick
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.720]   before we move on?
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.360]   'Cause I mean, we're already talking about Google Home.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.200]   Do you think it's all set up?
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.360]   - Yeah.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.880]   I actually don't know.
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.120]   That's what I'm like seeing her going,
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.440]   I think it's set up, but it doesn't look linked.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.200]   - Now, when you do it out of everything?
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.760]   - Yeah, when you do it for the first time,
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.960]   it actually gives you like, before I make the call,
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.920]   let me tell you a few things about calling with Google Home.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.160]   So it'll probably do that the very first time you try.
[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.200]   But...
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.240]   - So I just need to tell it to make the call?
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.720]   - Yeah, you say call so-and-so,
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.360]   or you can say call business.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.840]   Okay, G call what a business name,
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.160]   and then it taps into the search.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.040]   - So it doesn't say my phone,
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:24.280]   my Google account is linked.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.160]   Well, let's see what happens.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.480]   So I'm gonna call a business,
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.960]   or can I call someone from my contacts?
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.800]   - You can do that too.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.560]   If you've, I think if you've shared your contacts
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.760]   with a system, which you probably already have,
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.240]   I don't know exactly on that one.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.000]   You can call from your contacts.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.480]   I just don't know if it's gonna let you do that
[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.920]   without explicit permission.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.160]   - All right, well, let's call my husband.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.120]   I'm gonna tell him.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.960]   He's at the same place Leo is.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.840]   - Oh. - Let me warn him really fast
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.480]   'cause another thing--
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.040]   - Warning, Leo's there.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.360]   - Well, yeah, that too.
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:05.120]   (both laughing)
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.120]   - I'm telling him not to answer
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.360]   if you don't wanna be on the air.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.800]   - Yeah, yeah, that's probably smart.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.800]   - Yeah, right.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.160]   Probably smart, we don't want to push him.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.480]   - So I just ask it to call.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:15.320]   - Yeah, you say okay, G call.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.720]   - Okay, so guys, I have to actually activate it.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.520]   So, sorry about that.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.000]   Avert your ears, phones.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.840]   - Mute.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.680]   - Hey, look with me.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:25.920]   Call Andrew.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.600]   - Sure, since this is your first call with Google Home.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.480]   Here's a couple of notes.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.840]   First, emergency numbers are not available.
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.840]   At the end of your call, tell me to hang up
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.120]   or tap the top of the Google Home.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.040]   Calling Andrew Alleman, mobile.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.640]   - At least it didn't read out the phone.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.680]   - That was quick.
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.520]   - Yeah, it gives you that the very first time then.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.440]   - Oh, he's in the conference call.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.120]   - After the tone and Google Voice will try to connect you.
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.360]   (beep)
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.880]   - Oh, so I just hang up on him
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.320]   'cause he was like, he's confused.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.840]   He was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.280]   I'm not answering.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.200]   But there you go, see, it works.
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.000]   One thing I notice is like, if you connect to a system
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.040]   that requires dial presses in order,
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.720]   you know, the number presses in order to navigate out,
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.320]   I don't think you can do that.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.480]   - Oh, IVR systems?
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.320]   - Yeah.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.160]   - Okay.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.480]   - I just don't know how you enter a number.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.280]   Like I don't, you can't say.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.160]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.080]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.080]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.920]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:24.760]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.600]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.600]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:28.600]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.440]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.280]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.120]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.960]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.800]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.640]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.480]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.320]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.160]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   - Hey, what was it called?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   - It was like two.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   - Yeah, it's out the microphone two times to do two.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   - That was an option.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   - Yeah, I don't, sorry, it runs with scissors who said,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   "You triggered my home."
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Yeah, it's bound to happen.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   We'll mute it in the downloaded version.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Yeah, so I don't know if there's any way to do that.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   - So what's the advantage for this?
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   - Of phone calls?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   - It's the same thing that you would do, I guess,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   if you had your phone next to you.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   - Right.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   - So, yeah, is there an advantage?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   Oh, I have one.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   This is actually a good use case.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   If you have one in your home and your kid wants to get in touch
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   with you, they can call you even if they don't have a phone.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   So it's like a landline, your house, unless you want to make
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   emergency calls because it doesn't do that.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   - Right, which it really should, let's be honest.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   It should be able to do that, but I guess I kind of understand
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   why it didn't launch with it.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Hopefully they get that eventually.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   That's a really good point.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   The kids could just reach you no matter what,
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   if they don't have a phone.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   - If you're a babysitter, you could just be like,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   calls, you know, Stacey.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   And I'm totally going to tell my babysitters about this.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   This is great.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Okay.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   - So now it does work with multiple accounts, right?
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   So if you've set up multiple accounts,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   then it's going to determine who's talking and therefore
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   whose contact list that query is hitting.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   If your babysitter tries to call you, is it going to recognize
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   that you are you because your babysitter is different from you?
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Like your babysitter doesn't have a contact list.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Maybe your babysitter would need your number in order to do that?
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   I don't know.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   - We could have...
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   - Oh, right.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   - That's a really good point.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   - I have a babysitter coming in, you know, 15 minutes or so.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   - So you, bring the babysitter in here.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   We'll talk to the babysitter and get to the bottom of this.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   - Hi, welcome to your job with me.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Would you come this way, please?
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   I need to set you up and have your voice recorded forever on Google.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   - Yeah.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   - And we're going to release it into the form of the podcast.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   Are you okay with that?
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   - Well, she actually, so her house has a Google home.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   So her voice is already in Google's cloud.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   How crazy would it be if she walked in and Google, like,
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   tracked it to her context?
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   - Oh, that would be freaky.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   That would venture into the weird creepy area.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   - We would all be like, "Ugh."
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   - That would be big news.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Anyways, there you go.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   You know, I mean, I could see myself, like, in the kitchen,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   taking care of stuff, need to call my parents just to check in,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   say hi, like, I would use that totally.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Hopefully it sounds good on the other end.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   I haven't tested that out to know what it actually sounds like
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   when you're calling for that microphone across the room.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   You know, how roomy it is.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Probably going to sound kind of echoey, to be honest, but...
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   - The room I'm in sounds echoey.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   - Sounds great through this microphone.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   We need a high-level phone.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   - This is a great microphone.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   - Yeah.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   - What's that?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   - What's that?
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   - Okay.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   I think this is a high-level.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   - This is a high-level, yeah.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   - It's a high-level phone.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   - It's a high-level phone.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   - It's a high-level phone.

[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   - It's a high-level phone.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   - It's a high-level phone.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   - It's a high-level phone.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   - It's a high-level phone.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   - It's a high-level phone.

[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   - It's a high-level phone.

[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   - It's a high-level phone.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   - It's a high-level phone.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   - It's a high-level phone.

[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   - It's a high-level phone.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   - It's a high-level phone.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   - I buy very few things via voice.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   - Yeah.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   - It's mostly music because it's definitive
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   or it's reordering things I've already ordered from Amazon.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   So I guess I could buy something from Walmart, but...
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   - But you have an echo.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   - So you're probably going to be...
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   - Yeah, I'm also a snob.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   - I'm sorry.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   I just don't shop at Walmart.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   - Yeah.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   - And I know of that.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   - Oh, it's out.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   It's out.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   It's out.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   - It is to you.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   - I am very...
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   I'm not great about this unless I'm in a small town.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   - I couldn't agree more.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   I go in there, I get hives.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   - Yeah, I feel that way about TJ Maxx too.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   - Oh, God, I'm sorry.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   - Oh, it's out.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   - We're learning so much about yours.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   - We're learning so much about yours.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   - Okay.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   - Oh, Stacy is...
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   - Yeah, I would rather shop a target.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   - She's soon going to be putting up Instagrams
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   with hashtags and say, "Armani."
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   - I'm going to say, "Armani Valentino and Hermes."
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   - Yes.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   - Is that Hermes?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   - I can't...
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   - Hermes, yeah, I believe so anyways.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   - Eres was it, yes.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   - Oh, I buy my ammunition at Academy or Cabela's.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   - Oh, no, that's scary.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   This is going okay.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   All right, this has gone off the edge here.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   - You're an arm?
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   - I have not armed.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   I mean, I have arms.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   - No.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   - But not arm, not in this room anyways.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   - So, okay.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   - I don't think you hit the thing that punches Leo's head.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   - Not until I get that.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   - But so, yeah, Walmart, the choices are too many
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   and it's Walmart and that's all I'm going to say.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Sorry, I probably won't use it.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   - Okay.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   - I'm sure there are, I mean, there are obviously,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   there are a lot of people that do shop at Walmart.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   I wonder how much that Venn diagram of Walmart shoppers
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   and Google Homeowners crosses.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   But maybe, I mean, obviously the goal here is to,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   is for Walmart to increase online purchases.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   So maybe exposing it to new markets, new audiences,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   or new customers through that.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   And Google wants people to think of Google Home
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   in the same way that people think of the Echo
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   as a shopping device.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   I just don't know how many people are actually shopping
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   with their voice, but maybe that's because I only have
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   a Google Home and I haven't done that yet and I don't know
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   the amazing, you know, aspects of it firsthand.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   But,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   - You know what would be really awesome is if someone built
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   a service that like scans barcodes and you could scan it
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   and it would actually tie into both the Amazon and Google
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   with Walmart and then get you like the best price.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Like if we were truly talking about competition,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   that's the sort of fulfillment that would happen.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   And then these guys just turn into like fulfillment homes,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   houses, but that's crazy.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   - That is crazy.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   - I know, look at that.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   You think about consumer value as opposed to vertical integration
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   and corporate value.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   - Quit thinking about the consumer.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Have we learned by now?
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   This is going to happen late September.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Google is dropping its $95 Google Express fee.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   So Google Express is kind of a way that it ties in not only
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   to Walmart, but to Target and Costco, I think,
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   and other brands to deliver their products.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   They're dropping the $95 fee for that.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   - Still charging on per delivery.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   - So from what I understand, it's going to be free delivery
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   as long as it qualifies per merchant.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   So Walmart, for example, offers free two-day shipping
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   on purchases over $35.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   And so if you pay more than $35 for the products that you're buying
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   from Walmart through Google Home, then you will pay no shipping.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   It's basically passed through from the merchant on the other end.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   So kind of analogous in some ways to what Amazon is offering
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   with prime, although prime, you have to pay up front.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   And then you get free shipping for the entire year.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   You also get a bunch of other services along with that.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   So the value proposition is a little different.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   As far as that's going to--
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   - And you also get a history.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   And what that'll be kind of interesting, because again,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   like I said, I use my voice ordering only for reorders,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   because I know what I'm going to get, right?
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   So if it keeps your history for you, so like if I can order
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   a tied detergent for Walmart and always get the same kind of tied,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   that actually might be cool.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   - And they do, Stacey.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   - They do.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   - Easy reorder, which is a feature of Walmart that they announced
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   earlier this year, I think, that essentially tracks both your
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   in-store purchases and your online purchases.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   So you can sync that account up with Google Express
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   to do exactly what you're tired about.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   - Meanwhile, the FTC just moments ago approved the Amazon
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   whole foods purchase.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   - Oh!
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   - Oh, really?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   That just must have happened, right?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   - Yes, it just did.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   So this all becomes really meaty.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   - So that is so exciting to me, because I--
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   And this is something I've been thinking about is how I want
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   to order my groceries.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   And I really--
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   I don't want to sit there and tell Amazon or Google,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Apple's-- I don't want to read a list to it, right?
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Nor do I actually think I want to do the dash wand.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   So I think what would be really awesome is if Amazon
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   and Walmart got a step above and started creating like--
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   did a tie in with like a recipe site, so you could click.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   You know, I want to make this, this, and this, this week.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   It generates a shopping list based on that plus your staples.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   And then it's there.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   So I think there's still a missing piece to make this really easy.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   - Way back when my children-- way back when when I was part
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   of the founding team for Epicurious, we worked on just that.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   I was way too early.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   - See?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   - Hmm?
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   - Oh, I'm excited because like, I feel like this is not a crazy
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   thing to want, but maybe--
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   - No, no, no, we worked on this for Epicurious.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   It was way too early, because there was no mechanism to actually
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   buy it.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   It's what would you get?
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   You may be kind of a shopping list in your phone, but that was
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   the idea, as you could say.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   But the complication often is it always comes down to digital
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   inventory.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   What's your inventory in your house?
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   What do you actually have?
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Do you really need that ingredient?
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   You don't need to buy every ingredient and everything you make.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   So how does your house know what it has?
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Is it interesting to challenge?
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   - That's--
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   - So also-- - You can just check it off.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   - Well, you assume you're organized, Stacy, like you.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Look at my office.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   I'm not organized.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   I also don't cock with it.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Sorry, where they damn darn.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   But the second problem is if you're Walmart and if you're
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   a whole food's fine, there's digital inventory.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   When I, years ago, talked to PayPal and eBay when they were
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   together about trying to get local advertisers involved, the
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   problem they said was that local merchants don't have their
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   inventory digitized.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   And I wrote up a whole business plan for basically the open
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   table of local merchants that if you handle your inventory anyway,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   it would then make it available online.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   And then you start to bring in new development mechanisms,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   delivery mechanisms, because the US Post Office, if it has any
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   sense, is going to fight for this too.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   They're going to compete in this space as well.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   There's going to be tons of local merchants and tons of local
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   delivery options.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   So you get to a world where you say, I want chiliquilas and you
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   should be presented with choices as to where and how to get them.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   That's what it's best for you as the consumer.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   - I agree.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   - I also like chiliquilas.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   - I was going to say also the best choice for the consumer is
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   the chiliquilas.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   - Chiliquila.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   - Chiliquila.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   - Is it chiliquila?
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   - I've always been chiliquila.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   - I did put on the rundown.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   The most important thing to talk about Stacey.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   - Son, I don't want to get it now.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   I put up a tweet just for Stacey this week.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   I was in Trader Joe's.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   I was in Trader Joe's.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   - Oh, you bought it.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   - Oh, I bought it.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   I have it.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   - I was eating it.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   I bought, I looked at this at this jar of queso and the nutrition was
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   like zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   I said, how was this possible?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   It's cheese.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   And so I tweeted Leo and Stacey and Stacey came back and very
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   condescendingly but correctly said, it's cheese, Jeff.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   It's supposed to be cheese.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   It's a camping possible.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   It's supposed to have milk and protein and fat and--
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   - It had milk way.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   - Fat has protein, but your ingredients, I think you should
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   eat it and we should watch you for the rest of the show just to
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   see if you feel over.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   - Anyway, I didn't mean to go off on any engines.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   - That's what we did before our very eyes, thanks to the chili
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   cayons in--
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   - It's a good answer.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   - Right, there it is.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Trader Joe's case.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   So there's a picture of us.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Right, there it is.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   There's the ingredients.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   - So cheese dip and--
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   but what we're seeing in the nutritional facts there is
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   different than what you saw.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   - Oh, it is different.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Very different.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   - Okay, all right.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Let's try to figure it out.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   That's weird.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   - Now, so what do you think about?
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Like, I am curious why Amazon didn't buy something like Trader
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Joe's as opposed to Whole Foods, to be honest.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Because their bottle seems--
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   - Well, your model is just right.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Yeah, their model is just right because it's unique properties
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   and all that.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   But I think they want to compete on a commodity level too.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   If you need it, we got it.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   You want bananas?
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   We got bananas.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   - And I guess I don't know what Trader Joe's physical footprint
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   is versus Whole Foods either.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Like, we just got a Trader Joe.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   - How many Trader Joe's stores are there?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   That's a good question.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   - Trader Joe has a number of locations.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   It's 465.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   - 465.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   I'm going to turn the model down the volume again.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   - Whole Foods has like 445.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   - Just do it again.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   - That's a whole.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   - Three hundred.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Trader Joe's has more.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   - That was--
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   - Wow.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   - Your rates, Stacy.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   - That was 7th as of last year.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Yeah, 365 Whole Foods.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   - Wow.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   - According to 465 versus 365.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   - Actually, 468 stores in North America,
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   that's from their company info page.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   So now it's 468.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   - Trader Joe's.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   - Sorry, Whole Foods.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Whole Foods, 468.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   - They're even.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   They're as good as even.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   - Huh.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   All right.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   - Wow.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   - Okay.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   I feel like I've got nothing else to say about this, I guess.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   Other than I can't wait for automation to come to my grocery shopping
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   and meal planning because it is currently the bane of my week.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   My life is really easy.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I'll be honest.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   That's like one of the more challenging things I do during the week.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   - How are they exactly the same?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Something's weird here.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   How--
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   - I know.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   - Whole Foods.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   - I know.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   - The whole street.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   - Trader Joe's saying we have the same exact amount of stores.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   That's strange.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   - They're both kind of ritzy elitist places.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   There's a lot more, like we only have, and we just got three Trader Joe's in Austin,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   or maybe there's only two.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   But I feel like in California, there's like a Trader Joe everywhere.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   - Yeah.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   - New York loves them too.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   But you know, I go there and I, it was like I'm home late from work.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   I have stuff in the freezer that I can just throw on and cook.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   Like they have the most amazing paella.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   - Trader Joe's?
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   - Trader Joe's.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   - You can make this a physically possible.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Yes.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Really?
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   You get up, you get up, you get up frying pan.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   You turn up the heat high.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   That's all you do to it.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   You open the bag.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.640]   You pour it in and it, and these little flavor things all go like crazy.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.840]   And three minutes later, you have paella.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.840]   - I love paella.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.840]   - That's great.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.000]   - Trader Joe's paella is great.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   - Yeah.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   I'm a fan of Trader Joe's for the, I love the tangents we go on by the way.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   - This is great.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   - The audience is going nuts by the way.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.240]   - Hey, hey audience, you know what?
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:06.440]   It's better than me doing politics, isn't it?
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.440]   Okay?
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.440]   So you got a choice.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.640]   We can talk Trader Joe's queso, or we can talk Trump.
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.640]   Which would you prefer?
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.280]   Just tell us, because we're going to go on tangents.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.280]   It's what we do.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.280]   Okay?
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.280]   - I got it.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.400]   - So maybe Google should just buy Trader Joe's.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.400]   Let's think about that.
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.400]   - Oh, what is that?
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:29.000]   - Which is to counter the Walmart, sorry, to counter the Amazon Whole Foods threat.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Trader Joe.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   - I love that.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.640]   And then you also get the Google chefs recipes in Trader Joe's frozen food section.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.840]   - Google chef is terrible.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   Sorry.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.840]   Okay.
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.440]   - Google chefs, the commissary Google chefs.
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.960]   - Oh, I thought you were talking about their little car thing that tries to help you cook,
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.960]   which is...
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:49.960]   - No, no, no.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.560]   - I mean, the food at Google.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.480]   - Got it.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:59.040]   - I don't even know about the other Google chef thing that you're talking about.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.040]   - Maybe I see it because I'm a woman.
[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:07.560]   It's constantly telling me, it's constantly giving me a card called culinary inspiration.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.160]   And it's the crappiest recipes.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.640]   They're so random.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:18.160]   They're like bloody Mary's cauliflower bread, roasted watermelon.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.800]   And I don't understand.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.280]   Google is so good at everything.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.280]   - That's interesting.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.280]   - Like, okay, here are my culinary recipes for the day.
[00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:29.280]   I guess, yeah.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.280]   - Is this in Google now, Stacey?
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.280]   - It's in Google now.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.320]   It's just a card that pops up.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.360]   Literally, I've told it so many times I'm not interested.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.120]   - I never got it.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.120]   Never, never.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.120]   - Try something to...
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:46.320]   - Pinto beans, sour cream coffee cake, banana egg pancakes, mulled wine, balsamic brussel
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:54.040]   sprouts, moong dal, garbanzo beans, cinnamon roll pancakes, minestrone, and treacle tart.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:57.440]   - Sounds pretty good to me, Stacey.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.240]   - It's just weird.
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.600]   These are not like things I don't make desserts.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   I don't have a...
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   Not very often.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.480]   - You're so fun.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.480]   - I know.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.600]   I'm terrible.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.600]   But...
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   And then I actually do search a lot of recipes on Google, but it doesn't show me any of those.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:19.600]   So...
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.840]   - I'm not even finding that section when I check Google now.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:25.840]   Which by the way, they redesigned Google now.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.520]   I don't know if you guys have gotten the new design of it.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.840]   I'm still getting used to it.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:40.320]   But it's very colorful and very icon-filled and, I don't know, adjusting.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:44.080]   But yeah, I can't find the recipe portion here.
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.080]   - Carsten has it.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.080]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.080]   - He's flying over here.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.800]   If I went into all, if I went into more stuff, I'm sure it would be in there somewhere, right?
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.840]   - No, I'm going through that myself, but I never...
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:56.840]   Google knows me.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:00.640]   - Mine shows me the weather updates and then stories.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:02.320]   - Oh, sea recipes for you.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.320]   Get ideas for...
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.320]   - I get dinner recipes.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.320]   I search for...
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.640]   Oh, Stacy, you're so right.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:13.800]   First thing for me is Pillsbury Taco Skillet Dinner.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.560]   It fakes my shop at Walmart.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.000]   - It knows you so well, Jeff.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.040]   Then there's Traeger Grills Roasted Hobo Dinners.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.440]   Who wants to eat hobos?
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.560]   - That's just the beard it's talking to.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.040]   - Sea recipes for you.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.040]   Cooking.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.040]   Here we go.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.040]   Try something new.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.160]   Bake to Mac and Cheese.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.440]   It knows Carsten well.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:38.840]   I would make a lot of those recipes.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.080]   Hamburger meat recipe.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.000]   This is probably what you were talking about, right?
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   It's like...
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   - That sounds...
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.960]   Okay, those are actually dinners.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.760]   Those make so much more sense than mine, although foie gras.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.760]   Wow.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.560]   - Foie gras for those nights you decide to make foie gras at home.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:56.720]   - Yes.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.000]   - How many times have I decided I'm going to make foie gras for dinner tonight?
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   - That's some liver liero.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   - The big goose.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.400]   Where's my goose?
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.400]   Make it again.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.760]   See cooking related articles you viewed recently.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:12.160]   So there's at least a little bit of a history there.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.000]   - There is, but it's really random.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.120]   That's what I don't get.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.440]   It picks like a topic and it's like, this is it.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.600]   It doesn't go by most recent even or the most often ones.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.400]   There's some recipes I always look up.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.480]   I would feel like Google because I'm googling for it.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:34.160]   Ooh, that's a good segue into like...
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.520]   It should just show me those.
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.680]   It knows I want those, but instead it's ooh.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.440]   - Foie gras lollipops.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.680]   I think I've seen enough internet for the day.
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.440]   I've had enough internet.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.920]   I'm pretty sure I would not like foie gras lollipops just hand.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.120]   I'm a big fan of foie gras.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.000]   - I think I just wins the tangent award between...
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   - Hey, we...
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.600]   - I think this...
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.080]   We brought it back around to Google somehow, right?
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.160]   We showed off the future.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.000]   - Boy, apparently, man.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.480]   We're just glancing on Google.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:09.360]   - Did you hear me say I was just gonna Google that?
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:10.520]   Meaning search?
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.760]   - Okay, okay, follow that tangent.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:13.600]   (laughing)
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.600]   - So let's talk about...
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.440]   - Oh, let's talk about...
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.280]   - Let's say see.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.360]   Excellent.
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.360]   - Let's talk about...
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.680]   Is it trademark?
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.520]   It's trademark, right?
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.520]   - Sure.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.200]   What is it?
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.360]   Let me find that.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.400]   This is...
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.520]   This is the Supreme Court is basically...
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.160]   So, okay, all right, it's taken a step back.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.160]   Is Google too generic?
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.320]   That's what this is all about.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.680]   Should it have trademark protection?
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:42.520]   Google, as we know, is very commonly used
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.720]   as synonymous with search.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.120]   Let me Google that for you.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.120]   I went home and I googled this thing, whatever,
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.680]   instead of search, we've just gotten so used to saying that.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.720]   Back in 2012, there was a guy, Chris Gillespie,
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:59.680]   who registered 363 domains with the word Google in it.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:05.560]   Google sued and they won forfeiture of those domains.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:10.240]   Chris Gillespie then sued to invalidate that trademark
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.840]   'cause to him, his case is Google means to search.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.360]   It doesn't necessarily mean Google is a trademark
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.680]   as a company, whatever.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.960]   Appeals panel ruled in Google's favor,
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.160]   saying Google means more than just search
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.120]   because Google has a lot of other products anyways.
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.720]   Also critical to this is that it would have to prove,
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:34.640]   Gillespie would have to prove that Google is an exclusive term
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:38.640]   that competitors must use in order to describe
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:42.280]   their own product, which I think is absolutely not the case.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.040]   Yeah, I doubt that.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.640]   So I can see Microsoft doing that for spite.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:48.920]   Hey, Google little on Bing.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.760]   Yes.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.600]   Totally.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.760]   Google this on Bing.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.560]   Bing that on Google.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.920]   Could totally see it.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.360]   I woke up my home Stacy.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.960]   Oh, sorry.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.600]   You peeled his court loss to the high court
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.920]   now petitioning the Supreme Court to review
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.600]   the lower court's ruling.
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.960]   And yeah, that's kind of where we're at right now.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.040]   We do not know what's gonna happen.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.560]   I mean, it's not gonna happen, right?
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.760]   Google's gonna retain this.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.040]   I don't see how that doesn't happen.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:25.800]   Didn't that have Kleenex Xerox?
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.040]   Where else is it?
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.920]   'Cause Kleenex is Kleenex generic now.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.400]   Where's my AP style book?
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.560]   I don't know.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.360]   I don't know what that is.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:38.240]   Escalator is thermos aspirin videotape.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.080]   These were all trademarked and videotape was a trade.
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:44.400]   Apparently, that's what the artist technical article said.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:50.680]   Were once trademarked and what was the term that they used?
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:54.200]   It's genera, yeah, genera side.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.680]   Genera side.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.000]   Genera side.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Genera side, which is when a name becomes too generic.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.960]   Your name is just too synonymous for this thing.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:10.080]   It experiences genera side and ultimately,
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.560]   that trademark can be revoked.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.200]   That's not gonna happen with Google though, right?
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.280]   It could.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.520]   Why didn't know heroin?
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.280]   Who was fighting for heroin?
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.680]   (laughs)
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.960]   Sorry, ScooterX is saying listing all these crazy ones
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.800]   and I'm like, oh, okay.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.840]   So, okay.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.960]   What a bear trademark?
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.560]   Uh-huh, heroin was a bear trademark?
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.400]   Oh, wow.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.240]   Oh.
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.000]   Gosh, we're all sorts of information today.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.240]   The more you know.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.080]   I know.
[00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:39.920]   Okay, so do we--
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:41.240]   That's what Karg is good for.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.960]   So the danger for Google then is A,
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.760]   it can't control these domains.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:51.920]   B, it can't control what people do with the word Google.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.840]   Or Google, it would be a horrendous decision.
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.680]   Oh yeah.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.280]   It is so clearly a trademark and Google defends it.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.000]   Google had to sue this guy.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.840]   That's how you defend the trademark.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.400]   I can't see the Supreme Court taking this case.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.720]   If somebody's appealing to the Supreme Court,
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.120]   I can't see them taking the case.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.800]   So I think it's a bit of an overblown headline.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.160]   Supreme Court could decide.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.400]   Well, yeah, I can go and appeal,
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.920]   you know, my parking ticket to the Supreme Court.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:16.320]   Anything's possible.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.720]   Yeah, but.
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.720]   Yeah, I couldn't see that happening either.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.160]   But this day and age, you just never know.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.040]   Even the impossible, even the seemingly impossible
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:27.280]   is possible, I suppose.
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:32.000]   I don't know, Google's just got so many other things going on.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:32.840]   Oh, geez.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.160]   Google as a search term, like Google as being synonymous
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.080]   for search, yes, but Google means so many more things
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.120]   other than just search.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.640]   It's just, it's not.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.000]   It's interesting that that's a factor in the case
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.120]   that it is not synonymous merely with search.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:52.120]   Well, that helps keep its company name for,
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:56.120]   I mean, that is an important aspect of the case.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.120]   So that makes sense.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.120]   I'm also wondering whether,
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:04.120]   whether does the fact that tweet is a variant on Twitter,
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:09.120]   is that helpful to the corporation Twitter?
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.120]   Because the verb became a different word.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:15.120]   You know, if I say, I'm going to go Google that.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.120]   As opposed to Google, would that be helpful?
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.120]   That we used a different word, but it still was associated
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.120]   with Google.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.120]   I thought it was kind of funny people said,
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.120]   I'm going to tweet that.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.120]   I got the joke, of course.
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:31.120]   But, you know, I would Twitter that would be more sensible.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:35.120]   The problem here is how many company names like this
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.120]   are turning to verbs in the internet age?
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.120]   You don't Microsoft anything.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.120]   You don't Yahoo anything.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.120]   You don't AOL anything.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.120]   You don't know anything.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.120]   You do.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:45.120]   You do.
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.120]   You Uber places, but you take an Uber.
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:50.120]   So it's both for that.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:52.120]   Let's see.
[00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.120]   No, you consult with our ways.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.120]   Do you select things?
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:58.120]   You do.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.120]   Slack me.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.120]   Really?
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:03.120]   We have, we have said, yeah.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.120]   You know, Slack me or said, I mean, we use other phrases too.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   Like send it to Slack or whatever.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.120]   Let's see.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.120]   Dropbox.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:17.120]   I don't think so.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.120]   Do you think Dropbox is a one?
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.120]   I'm running through my apps.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.120]   I'm like, what else might I say?
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   Skype.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.120]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.120]   That's true.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.120]   Let's Skype.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.120]   Google is generally different in that case.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:41.120]   Where it is a brand turned into a verb, but still it's a rotten case.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.120]   Oh, Venmo is another one.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.120]   Yeah, Venmo me.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.120]   That's please.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:51.120]   That's not obscure to like anybody under the age of 30.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.120]   Oh, thing.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.120]   I'm not.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.120]   I'm not just.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.120]   Ooh.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.120]   Ooh.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.120]   Ages.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:03.120]   It's, I mean, if you hang out with people who like are young people who are young people,
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.120]   like are young staffers.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.120]   Stay safe.
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.120]   Your college kids.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.120]   Oh, come on.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.120]   Okay.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.120]   All right.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.120]   You know, we have, you know the story I want to talk about.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.120]   No, the story I want to talk about.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.120]   What is the story?
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.120]   We'll come back to it after the break.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.120]   Oh, okay.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.120]   Good break.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.120]   What is, what is the story though?
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.120]   Give it, give it tees.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.120]   My fondest hopes for a replacement.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.120]   We're going to talk about that because I completely agree.
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:36.120]   The pixel might have a success.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.120]   It's a mic.
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.120]   Everybody, a million people wrote the story, but we'll talk about that.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.120]   We're going to talk about that.
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.120]   First, let's take a minute.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.120]   Thank the sponsor of today's episode of this week in Google.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.120]   And that is Felix Gray.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:51.120]   We spend so much time looking at screens.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.120]   It's, it's our job.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.120]   We do it day in, day out.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.120]   We do it even when we're not working, right?
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:01.120]   Think of how often you look at screens and you, you might be looking at it.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.120]   Obviously, if you're watching this, you're looking at a screen now.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:08.120]   You might be listening to this podcast to get away from a screen, to distract yourself
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.120]   from a screen.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:16.120]   And we've all experienced the eye rub moment where our eyes just kind of feel dry.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.120]   They feel fatigued.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.120]   They're tired.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.120]   You have a headache, your vision goes a little blurry.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.120]   It's not fun.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:28.120]   You can give your eyes a break with a pair of computer glasses from Felix Gray.
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:34.120]   Felix Gray's lenses are specially designed to filter blue light and eliminate glare, which
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:38.120]   many of us know are the two culprits behind digital eye strain.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:42.720]   Too much blue light from your computer and phone screen can lead to eye strain and make
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.120]   it difficult to focus on things, especially over time, hour after hour.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.120]   It all adds up.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:53.720]   Felix Gray glasses have blue light filtering material embedded into the lenses, so they
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:59.840]   remain effective without that ugly yellow tint or color distortion that you find with other
[00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:01.840]   computer glasses.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:08.400]   Be sure to visit Felix Gray Glasses.com/Twig and you can find more information on the dangers
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.400]   of blue light.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:12.720]   Felix Gray eyewear is beautiful.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:16.320]   Crafted with premium handmade, Italian acetate.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.560]   Their glasses look great, so you can feel confident in any work environment.
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:21.120]   You can keep it at work.
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.560]   These glasses are not my glasses, but it doesn't matter.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.840]   I'll wear them anyway.
[00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:28.640]   What do you think?
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.840]   Anyways, I've been wearing them all morning.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.480]   I've been using them to work.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:38.280]   I feel like I stare at screens all the time and I'm so incredibly used to my eyes being
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.280]   sore.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.400]   I've looked at a lot of screens today in preparation for this show, the Note 8 announcement, which
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.360]   we'll talk about a little bit later.
[00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.360]   My eyes feel great.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.720]   They feel awesome.
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:52.120]   Non-prescription and reading lenses are currently available and prescription glasses are coming
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.280]   soon.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:01.760]   Reading prescription ranges from +1.02+2.5 or you can add +0.25 magnification if you're
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.080]   fixated to your screen.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.800]   Programmers, financial analysts, etc.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:08.880]   A lot of people can benefit from that.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:13.400]   All orders include free shipping and free returns, so there's no risk in trying them
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.400]   out.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.680]   You can get them, try them out, see how they look, see how they feel.
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.560]   I think you'll love them.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.120]   Give your eyes the break they deserve.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:30.400]   Go to FelixGrayGlasses.com/Twig today to try a pair of Felix Gray computer glasses and
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.000]   discover a smarter way to work.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.200]   That's FelixGrayGlasses.com/Twig and we thank Felix Gray for their support of This Week
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.200]   in Google.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:41.200]   All right.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.200]   Now I'm going to just blink the whole time.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   I'm like, say, here guy, oh, my eyes.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   Okay.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.200]   I know.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.840]   Sorry to clue you in on how uncomfortable your eyes are right now, but hey, we got to
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.840]   do what we got to do.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:53.840]   All right.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.840]   So this is the first gen--
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:44:02.360]   I'm going to do my presidential impression.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.720]   Can you see after staring at the sun for so long?
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:05.920]   That's about where they know.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.480]   I'm very, very curious.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:11.880]   We can talk about that here a little bit, but before we do, this is the first generation
[00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.160]   Samsung Galaxy-- sorry, not Samsung.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:18.000]   Oh, fight your tongue, howl.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.640]   Fight your tongue.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:21.640]   Chromebook Pixel.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.240]   That's what I meant to say.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.240]   Sorry.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.640]   It's the same-sung announcement this morning.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.480]   I'm all messed up in the hedge.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.120]   Jeff, help me.
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:33.720]   I've been waiting to replace this with whatever.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.720]   Is that a first or a second generation?
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.320]   This is the first generation.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.640]   I didn't get the second generation because it was still fine.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.640]   It totally has been a great Chromebook.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:47.360]   My first generation is poking along now, so I have two second generation.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.360]   I hear.
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.440]   But it's still a wonderful machine.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.440]   I love it dearly.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.440]   Love it, love it, love it.
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:54.560]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.440]   I'm sure at this point-- I still have a hard time thinking about why I need to replace
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.200]   this other than that it is as old as it is, what's that?
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.200]   2014 was when it came out.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.320]   Still does a great job with what I use it for.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:14.800]   What rumors say that Google's hardware event in the fall might actually have a new Chromebook
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:15.800]   pixel?
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.880]   Finally, possibly with a two-in-one design.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:24.320]   That would actually be really cool considering the fact that Chrome OS now has great support
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.520]   for Android apps.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:31.360]   So having a two-in-one design transferred into tablet mode, Android apps might make
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.160]   a little more sense with some of the apps that you're using.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:42.400]   There's also a weird patent that was posted about that hints at a keyboard trackpad-hinged
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.880]   cover sort of thing.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.240]   If you look at the patent, it kind of hinges up.
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:49.240]   It's kind of--
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.240]   Surface?
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:58.280]   Yeah, well, some are wondering if this is to hinge up as a cover as it transfers into
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.280]   tablet mode or maybe it's a stand--
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.800]   Ah, I think just because it's a case of overplaying a patent.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.800]   I think this is just like--
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.360]   Yeah, I don't see this coming to market immediately.
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:12.360]   Well, I just-- I don't understand what that flap would even be used for.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:13.360]   I don't get it.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.360]   Oh, it's because hiding your scrabble tiles.
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:16.360]   Yes.
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.840]   There, you figured it out.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.000]   I feel stupid for not realizing that.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.320]   Bull yawn cubes.
[00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:29.480]   When you turn the thing around, the problem is that you put it on your lap, the keyboard
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.480]   is exposed.
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:32.440]   It could just be a protector.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.440]   OK.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:34.440]   Oh.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.440]   Oh.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.080]   For a hinged convertible.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:40.920]   I think it's going to be a little much.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:46.640]   But I think it's one of those cases when somebody had an idea and they said, oh, sure,
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.840]   we want more patents.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:48.840]   Right.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:52.240]   Yeah, we might not actually see that with whatever this laptop is.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:56.760]   Oh, yeah, it does look like it covers the keyboard in this bottom.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.400]   So the-- OK, I get what you're saying.
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:03.160]   The idea being you transfer it into the two-on-one tablet mode and instead of having a weird-looking
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:07.800]   keyboard just hanging off the back of the underside of the tablet.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.800]   You cover it up with this elegant cover.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.080]   But then look at the proportions there.
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.640]   Not that this is drawn to scale.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:14.640]   Right.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:20.520]   But that means there's a really tiny keyboard or one huge hunk and laptop.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.080]   Because if you fold that thing down, it doesn't even go halfway.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.080]   No, you're right.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.360]   You've got to get a whole keyboard in that little space there in the proportion.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:33.640]   I don't see-- because what this necessarily means is the flap has to be at least as big
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   as a keyboard.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.640]   Yep.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.640]   Yep.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.240]   That's kind of what that alludes to.
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.480]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:45.000]   And it also means that your keys might not have as much travel, right?
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   True, too.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   Yes.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   Which should be bothersome.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   What do you mean by travel?
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   Like, you're clicking down?
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   Up and down.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   OK.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   How far up and down they go?
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.200]   Like I can't get into the keyboards with the keys that have very, very little travel
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:03.840]   and my wife has the Macbook Pro, the latest and I don't like it.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.600]   I have a hard time typing on that thing.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:06.600]   I just don't like it.
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:07.600]   I do too.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.840]   Oh, I was going to say my Macbook has very shallow keys and I love it.
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:12.840]   They still click like--
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.840]   I get so loud.
[00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.840]   --typing too loud.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.840]   Oh, I know.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:16.840]   Good work.
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:22.040]   But anyways, Jeff, I'm sure you're excited, although it doesn't say whether there would
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:27.840]   be mobile network support because I know that's a priority for you.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:28.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.840]   We're going to get LTE on it.
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.520]   That's not going to happen.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:32.520]   No.
[00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.520]   It's gone.
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:40.520]   I got a dongle you could buy.
[00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:48.200]   We will also possibly see a smaller Google Home, like an Echo Dot sort of miniature Google
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:50.920]   Home device at this event.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.120]   That's what rumors are put into anyways.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:56.760]   The thing I'm excited about, are we going to talk about the earbuds with assistant?
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:57.760]   Go for it.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.760]   Go for it.
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:59.760]   That was pretty cool.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:06.680]   That was also-- I love that kind of sleuthing when you pull back those builds and find the
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.680]   stuff.
[00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:08.680]   Mm-hmm.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.600]   And the not-vistro-vistro, it's-- it-vistro?
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.600]   It's--
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.600]   Bisto.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.600]   Bisto.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.600]   That's it.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.600]   Bisto.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.600]   It's like it's not a word that's real.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.080]   It sounds disturbingly real.
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:28.720]   So I would love something like that because assistant is actually super useful.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.720]   And wait.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.720]   Bisto.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:35.640]   Bisto is a well-known brand of traditional British foods in the United Kingdom.
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.880]   Most famous for its gravy products.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:42.080]   So I just want to make sure we stayed on our theme here before we go too far off of it.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.160]   Of ridiculous food things.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.160]   So Bisto--
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:48.080]   So you could order Bisto from Walmart using your Google Home.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.080]   Good thing.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.080]   Right.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.920]   So this is kind of-- this is gravy on the story here.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:55.640]   Go ahead, they see.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.640]   No, that's-- that's--
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.240]   It's just like icing on the cake or it's just gravy.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.200]   Gravy grails to be honest.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.200]   Gravy grails.
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.200]   Doesn't that sound wonderful?
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:05.520]   The nation's favorite.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.400]   Not this nation, Faz.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.840]   Just add boiling water.
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:13.000]   I just-- I just found out you can buy a whole chicken in a can.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.760]   So I'm not going to mock people for putting gravy in a can.
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:17.760]   Just whatever--
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.440]   I apologize, Stacy.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:20.920]   So now Bisto, keep going.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:21.920]   Go back.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:28.160]   So basically they broke down the APK and they discovered references
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.640]   to Bisto, which looks like Google Assistant in headphones,
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   which-- exciting.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.240]   That's all I know about it.
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:35.880]   But to me--
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:37.800]   What's neat is how you use the functionality they're building
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   in.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.280]   But you can turn it off.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.680]   How it's going to respond to you, things like that,
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:44.920]   which was kind of nice.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:49.080]   I mean, I'm guessing-- I mean, obviously, it would connect to the phone via Bluetooth.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.440]   It has a button, a hardware button that you
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.720]   could use to summon Assistant.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:56.320]   And because it's connected via Bluetooth,
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:00.320]   I'm sure all this is passing through to the phone.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.480]   So when you need to ask it to tell you something,
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.200]   you just hit the button and ask it.
[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.080]   And you get your answer in your ear.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:10.560]   You also get notifications in your ear.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:13.840]   You hear the reply to your queries, all that kind of stuff,
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.800]   channeled into your ears.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:17.640]   Now, it doesn't-- you can--
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.760]   I assume you'll be able to choose your notifications.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.840]   Because there's a huge backlash, again, about notifications.
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.560]   And I'll be honest, they are going bonkers.
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:29.880]   But can you imagine just bing, bing, bing?
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.400]   That's-- no.
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.480]   So do you do separate in ear notifications?
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.640]   But your headset gets more?
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.920]   I'm really curious, as a developer,
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:42.480]   how you're going to have to start thinking about notifications
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:44.840]   at different levels for different UIs.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.360]   And you may never know what someone's going to be on at any one
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.840]   at a point in time.
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.560]   Yeah, it could also depend on which version of the OS
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.040]   that you're on.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.440]   We haven't even talked about Oreo.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.680]   We could talk about that next.
[00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.760]   But one of the features of Oreo is notification channels,
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:02.160]   which is like grouping notifications.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.480]   And it's all customizable on the user side.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:07.040]   So I could say all of my messaging notifications
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:09.080]   go into a single notification channel.
[00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.240]   So it can be collapsed.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.000]   It's a way of organizing your notifications.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.840]   Maybe you add priorities based on that.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.960]   And you say, actually, when I'm out and about,
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.240]   I do want to hear all of my notifications that
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.120]   come from messaging apps, I don't want to hear notifications
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.960]   that come from Google Photos when it says it created me a clodge.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.840]   Like, I don't need that.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.360]   I don't ever need that.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.920]   The fear, of course, is I've got things now
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.720]   that Android is on my Chromebook.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:36.760]   There are certain things that, like, the New York Times opens up.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.360]   When I click on a New York Times link,
[00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.240]   it opens up the New York Times app rather than the New York
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:40.840]   Times on the web.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:41.560]   And I don't want that.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.240]   And I have no idea how to go fix that.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:43.920]   No idea.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:44.600]   Oh, interesting.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:46.840]   So I'm stuck with this forever.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.000]   I've gone through every setting that I can possibly figure out.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.920]   I've tried to search for it because it's too hard to search for.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.320]   Somebody in the chat room, I'm sure, will be smart tonight.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:59.080]   Can you just delete the New York Times app from your phone?
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:00.640]   Well, I want the New York Times app.
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:01.760]   I just want to click on a link.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.840]   I want it to go to the web so I can then share it
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.640]   and do the other things I do with it.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.200]   Oh, so the app is so familiar with it.
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.200]   Yeah, I hate that with Amazon.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.280]   Yes, this happened to me, actually,
[00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.720]   because an awesome book was on sale.
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.200]   So I tweeted out that it was on sale.
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.880]   But I wanted to give a link to the Amazon link.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.320]   But it kept opening in the Amazon app.
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:21.960]   And I couldn't share the link.
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.280]   And I was very angry.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.920]   Well, there's a little link on top that says to get link.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.400]   And if you have the affiliate thing, when I get a link,
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:31.360]   it includes my affiliate in it, so it makes three cents.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:33.480]   Shh.
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.960]   GIRR.
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.000]   GIRR.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.040]   Stupid apps.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.200]   Break in the open web.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:38.680]   Hi.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:41.720]   And even if you didn't have the app installed,
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.760]   it's possible that it would serve up the instant app
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.800]   of the New York Times page anyways.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.240]   Speaking of segues.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:49.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:51.560]   Is there something in here on instant apps I may have missed?
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:53.760]   Well, I sense something in Oreo.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.800]   I think they sounded like instant apps to me.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.760]   There was one of the descriptions of the Oreo functions
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:03.720]   was that you could open an app even without downloading it.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:04.760]   Oh.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:09.400]   That was-- that was promised so much longer ago or so long ago.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.880]   And I was so excited about it.
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.760]   And then this was not even last Google Iibo.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.080]   Oh, but there was the Iibo before.
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:15.880]   That's right.
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:16.760]   Yeah, you're talking-- OK.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.040]   So you are talking about instant apps.
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.640]   That is instant apps.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:20.800]   Same thing.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.320]   OK.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:22.280]   And you know what?
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:25.520]   I have yet to really see that appear organically.
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:30.320]   I think I've forced it to happen, knowing one of the apps
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:32.560]   that if I did a search for that particular service,
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:34.320]   it would probably come up and it did.
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.200]   And it was kind of neat.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:40.560]   But I haven't just stumbled upon it in my searching Google
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:43.000]   for things on my mobile device.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:43.760]   But it's out there.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.480]   It's definitely rolling out more and more.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:46.760]   But I don't think it's--
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:47.520]   I don't think there's a lot of--
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:50.080]   Well, was it a design to be part of Assistant?
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:53.600]   Because the idea was Assistant might say, oh, do you
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:55.880]   want a table for you know, you want reservations?
[00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.560]   And then it would-- instead of opening up open table,
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.760]   it just like make that happen via--
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:03.920]   I always thought it was part of that kind of--
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:06.720]   because if you have an AI doing stuff for you,
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:10.320]   why the heck-- heck, does it need to open up apps
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.680]   and give you choices that you're just
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:12.720]   going to have to deal with later?
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.120]   It should just do it, which means you would need something
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:16.760]   like Instant App.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.160]   It would start doing those negotiations for you.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.920]   That's my hope.
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:25.520]   Yeah, I wonder how they are interrelated
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.640]   between what you could do through Assistant
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:28.760]   and what you can do through Search.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.680]   I know you can get to it through Search, though.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:32.840]   If you do a search for like, come on,
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.000]   what is one of the services?
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:35.400]   It's been a while since I tried it.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.440]   But one of the like, like, Hayak or something like that,
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:43.560]   they've a travel assistant service like that.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.760]   Sometimes it'll pull up the actual app experience,
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.000]   even though you don't have it downloaded,
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.560]   and that's Instant Apps in effect,
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:52.760]   working through Search, not necessarily through Assistant.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:58.960]   So I haven't heard of that as much around Android O.
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:00.560]   I think it's just like coinciding with it.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.840]   Like you said, that was announced a couple of years ago
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.680]   at Google I/O. And now they're finally starting
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:06.000]   to roll that out.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.400]   But we do have Android O. It's a thing now.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:12.040]   And this is my third day eating Oreos.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.440]   I'm not sick of them at all.
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:15.880]   But Amazon--
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.880]   You know, this was life changing.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:21.440]   You know that there are peanut butter filled Oreos?
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:23.160]   Peanut butter cream Oreos?
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.640]   This was life changing for me.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.360]   Are they good? Absolutely like changing.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:27.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:29.000]   It sounds like it is.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.400]   Oh, it might be life ending.
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.200]   They're so good.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.000]   Be careful, be careful.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.040]   Yeah, they've got a ton of flavors of Oreo now.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.080]   So it's not just--
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.440]   This is food day.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:41.000]   Yes.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.880]   Every story we will tie into some sort of food product.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:44.880]   Peanut butter cream.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:47.600]   And there I can see the first link is they're available Walmart.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:52.000]   So I could ask my Google Home to send me Oreo sandwich cookies
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.240]   peanut butter cream.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:54.360]   At the end of September.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.000]   Yes.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.280]   Yes.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.960]   Don't rush out and try it yet.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.480]   Wow.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.280]   Are there seriously all Oreo flavors?
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.400]   Well, there's Japan and China.
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.320]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.760]   Green tea Oreo.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.760]   They went a little crazy here, I think.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.240]   They have pumpkin spice Oreos.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:10.400]   Strawberry milkshake Oreo.
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:10.960]   Brownie--
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.840]   Oreos are nasty.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:14.840]   Oh, brownie butter is delicious, though.
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:16.280]   Don't shut it up, let's say.
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:17.800]   Candy corn Oreo.
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:19.200]   Rawr.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.160]   Oh, we got those at our house.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:21.880]   Oh, really?
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:26.560]   So my husband tested those and yet not good.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:27.560]   But I don't like Oreos.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:31.040]   So I'm really the wrong person to talk about this.
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.040]   Oh, geez.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:33.080]   Stacey, Stacey, Stacey.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.040]   We are finding out that you don't shop at TJ Maxx.
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.200]   You won't shop at Walmart.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.640]   You don't like Oreos.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.960]   Oh, geez.
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.600]   I've been a lot about you today.
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.200]   I grew up at Hamburger Helper.
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:44.760]   So--
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.680]   Oh, I don't believe it now.
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:46.480]   No, I don't believe that.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.480]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:51.600]   Or you're trying to deny your true history.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:52.440]   No, no, it's true.
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:56.640]   I did grow up in pumpkin spice on Hamburger Helper.
[00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:57.720]   I had a working mom.
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:02.120]   That's what working moms feed their kids or fed their kids.
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.000]   My fair share of Hamburger Helper as well.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:04.520]   I feel you.
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:05.920]   Delicious.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.320]   Yeah, and then I went back to it as a grown up.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:10.600]   I was like, yeah, I remember liking this as a kid.
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.400]   No.
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:12.960]   I even had--
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.000]   It was better as a kid.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.280]   Frozen vegetables in there.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.040]   I was like, oh, this will be better.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.640]   I'll put some frozen peas in.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.640]   Oh, no.
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:20.960]   Who sprues it up?
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.680]   Maybe it'll be a little bit better.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.120]   Quit fans.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:25.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.360]   I think maybe we're all hungry or something.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.640]   I brought it back a lot.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:32.920]   I've enjoyed myself in a perverse way.
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:33.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:34.960]   I apologize to you.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:37.240]   But again, I'm going to repeat, would you rather
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:41.000]   food or Trump just to find?
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:41.560]   Fair enough.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.120]   I think this is a wonderful tangent.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.360]   I'm going to take some food.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:46.920]   I mean, Carson took the camera.
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:49.400]   I feel like I'm compelled to eat an Oreo.
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:51.400]   This is double stuff, by the way.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.320]   There's enough flavors of Oreo.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:55.520]   It's always a thing on all about Android, by the way,
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:58.920]   that every time there's a new dessert, we bring in the dessert
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:01.560]   and we eat it, usually last a couple of weeks.
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:04.160]   There's enough different flavors of Oreo
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.000]   that we could probably do this at the beginning of the show
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   for the entire year that Oreo is a thing.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:09.320]   We could--
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:09.840]   There you go.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:10.600]   You're going to eat that on an air.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.240]   You're going to get that horrible Oreo mouth.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.000]   It looks like you're a little kid who just ate dirt.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:14.680]   It happens.
[00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:17.720]   I'm probably going to wait until I'm not talking anymore.
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:20.320]   Android O is Android Oreo.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:23.640]   If you haven't figured that out by now, they had an event.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.920]   Was it yesterday morning or Monday morning?
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:26.420]   It was.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:27.440]   It was Monday morning.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:27.880]   It was just--
[00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:30.000]   And it was Monday morning.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.840]   The unveiling of a statue.
[00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:37.040]   It's basically the Android Oreo figure emerged out
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:37.920]   of this statue.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:38.960]   This is in New York.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.840]   How do I get invited to these things?
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:42.040]   This is-- we all-- I would have--
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:42.880]   Well, we're killed to be there.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.520]   You really needed to be there for this.
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:45.080]   Let me tell you.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:48.320]   This is spectacle to be seen.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.680]   It rises out of the cookie.
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:54.200]   All right, Google did it.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:58.240]   I'm not sure what it is, but they picked Oreo.
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.920]   And yeah, I don't know what we expected out of that event.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.360]   It was literally an event that was just a--
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.200]   here's a statue.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.200]   But hey, it was fun.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:09.000]   They have a new superhero.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.040]   The Android mascot this time around
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.640]   is a female superhero, by the way.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.920]   Body of the Oreo cookie.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.680]   It's a total co-branding partnership.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.200]   You probably remember--
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.720]   Google did this a few years ago with KitKat.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.920]   They had a co-branding relationship with that.
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.240]   And I just didn't think they were going to do that again.
[01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.440]   Everybody was pointing to Oreo as being the next version
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.120]   of Android.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:31.560]   I didn't think they were going to go there again.
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.000]   But apparently I was wrong.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:34.880]   Hey, I'm sorry.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:36.440]   This is a girl?
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:36.760]   Yes.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.480]   Oreo?
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.440]   Yes.
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:41.440]   She is a girl.
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.280]   Wow.
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.120]   Do we--
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:43.880]   You know that.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:45.960]   The cookies have no gender.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.120]   No, no, no, no.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.560]   The cookie-- well, the cookie might not be a girl,
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.760]   but the Android mascot with the cookie--
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.920]   This is where the individual would be in the--
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:57.520]   It's probably a joke calling you cookie.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:58.520]   But how do we know?
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.760]   We see we can do without that.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.640]   We'll skip right over that happening.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.800]   It's going to be awesome.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.560]   But how do we know the statue and the Android is--
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.960]   Yeah, because that's the cape.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:09.320]   A cape?
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.280]   Anybody can wear a cape.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.640]   Yeah, now that-- well, the ad age--
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:13.200]   The antenna?
[01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.320]   --how about this?
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:18.280]   Adage kind of covered the lead up to this.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.640]   And green two-tone socks being girls?
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.160]   I don't know what-- I don't get it.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.360]   That's what they said.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:24.920]   I trusted them.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.560]   Not sure if I should have trusted them, but I did.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.440]   Actually, Google also said this in their announcement.
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.400]   What did they say?
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.440]   They said, "combines--
[01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.560]   Oreo combines the intelligence of Android
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:40.680]   and the playfulness of Oreo."
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.000]   And they mentioned--
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:42.800]   I don't know.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.560]   It's all marketing speak.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.160]   But--
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.160]   What-- hey, let's talk about Project Trouble,
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.600]   because that actually is really possibly pretty cool.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:55.000]   And I'm never going to understand the concept of a female Android
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.640]   cookie, so I'm just going to give up--
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:02:01.280]   my brain is just going to go away from that and into updates
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.200]   and modular architectures and how this could
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:04.560]   be in better support.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.600]   So let's talk about that.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:08.360]   Yeah, no, Project Trouble is a big deal.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.160]   I think Project Trouble, in my understanding of it,
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:15.160]   is the beginning of Google finally--
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:19.040]   Google's known for a long time that Android has an Achilles
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.520]   heel, which is its update situation.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.320]   On Apple's iOS, they control everything, right?
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:29.000]   So when a new version of iOS comes out,
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   you're talking like 95% of iOS users
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.560]   have it within like a week.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:38.200]   On Android, we are a year away from NuGet being officially
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.040]   released, and I think it's at 13% of all devices.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.320]   Now Android also has an insane amount of users.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.760]   So 13% is actually a lot of people.
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:50.240]   But in comparison with the overall pool of Android users,
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.840]   it's a small percentage.
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:54.840]   And obviously, Google would like that to be higher.
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:58.520]   That improves the security for its users,
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:01.840]   and that's just good overall for its brand.
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:06.280]   Project Trouble is kind of the beginning components
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.800]   of separating the underlying architecture,
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.760]   separating the hardware stack that vendors have access
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:18.880]   to away from the updatable elements of Android, the code
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:19.760]   itself.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.120]   So hopefully, what that means is that over time,
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.040]   this in combination with more work
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.400]   than I'm sure they're going to do to kind of separate things
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:31.080]   further means that Google can eventually push out
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.320]   an update to Android and not have
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.800]   to worry about a lot of this kind of time
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.720]   that it takes for hardware vendors
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.720]   to check the code against their hardware
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.600]   and carriers check the code to make sure
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.400]   that it qualifies to run on their network.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:49.160]   They're kind of separating these things
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.920]   into two separate camps so that Google can do its thing
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.520]   and hardware vendors can do their thing.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.080]   And Project Trouble is the start of that.
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:01.440]   So what does that mean though if you want to update
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.800]   the software element?
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.880]   Like, oh, here's Bluetooth.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.960]   Bluetooth actually, with mesh, that will update
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:10.040]   if you have the appropriate hardware all the way back
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:15.560]   to Bluetooth 4.1 or BLE 4.1.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:23.720]   So I'm curious if you wanted to support that in the OS 2,
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.120]   would you have--
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.920]   I'm trying to understand how things like radio support
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.600]   would change with trouble.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.360]   And if you would have access to that--
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:34.760]   if the OS person has to do it, if you'd
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.120]   have to wait for your chip supplier to do it,
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:39.080]   and what that means for the application developers
[01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.320]   who want to use something like mesh.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:43.200]   That is a great question.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.720]   I'm not even entirely sure that Project Trouble would
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.480]   involve changes to something like Bluetooth
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:52.840]   or if it's targeting something entirely differently.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:58.240]   They-- we talked with the Google engineers at Google I/O
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.000]   just a few months ago, Florence Iona and I did.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:01.840]   And we sat down with them.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:08.640]   And they made sure to let us know how much work went
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.720]   into re-architecturing Android from the ground up.
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:13.800]   They said it was probably the most significant kind
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.320]   of rebuilding of Android code since Android launch.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:18.400]   So it's significant.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.200]   But I don't think--
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.200]   At which version?
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:20.960]   At this version?
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:21.400]   For real?
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.280]   At this version, yes.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:22.780]   Yes.
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.000]   Because of Project Trouble, which--
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:25.520]   Because of that.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:26.040]   Oh, wow.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:26.680]   Because of that.
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:30.280]   That was at the core of why they spent so much time
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.520]   working on this stuff.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.880]   And I kind of got the impression that if by no means
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.680]   solves all the problems like you're talking about
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:42.160]   and figures out who does what, but it's a starting point for it.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.280]   The other really big challenge that they're
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:46.920]   going to face with this-- and this happens a lot with what
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.840]   Google puts into Android and how slow things roll out--
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:54.640]   is what do OEMs, hardware manufacturers, what
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.560]   do they actually spend their time adopting?
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.120]   It might be part of the US.
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.680]   But they might have to make changes on their end.
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.200]   I don't think that is the case with Project Trouble.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.840]   I think Trouble kind of comes over
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.800]   if you're creating a device from scratch with Oreo.
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:11.280]   It's trebleized, as they call it.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:14.280]   But there are other reference sets that suffer that.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:14.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.280]   And it actually looks like the OEMs
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:19.320]   would be in charge of their hardware firmware updates
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.760]   that would change your networking functions.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:25.160]   The difference is the Android stuff
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:28.880]   and everything running independent on those,
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.720]   they now run, like you said, independently.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.640]   So if Android-- if I'm redoing Android,
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:39.320]   I don't have to check every version of Android
[01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:42.000]   against the current hardware regime,
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.080]   which would make it faster.
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.160]   OK, I see now.
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:47.640]   I know.
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.000]   That was a long way to get me there.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:49.200]   Sorry.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.280]   No, no, no.
[01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:54.760]   Well, I'm still somewhat confused around Trouble either.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.960]   I'm very happy to see Google taking this so seriously
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.520]   and being creative about realizing
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.480]   that they needed to rebuild something in order
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:04.800]   to make this happen.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.120]   And I really hope it leads to even better things
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.280]   as far as the update situation that--
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.120]   So let me understand the impact of this.
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.400]   You'd have to get to the O level to then
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:21.120]   have more rapid Google updates under Google's control,
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.600]   not the OEMs control to the Google portion.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.400]   Potentially.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.720]   Now, here's where it gets a little tricky, right?
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:29.520]   They did say months ago when they first
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.960]   started talking about this that legacy Android devices that
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:37.200]   are updated to Oreo would not be trebleized,
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.480]   and that it would only be new devices launching with Oreo.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.680]   The only legacy device that would be trebleized
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.880]   would be its own pixel devices from last year.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.320]   Wow.
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:47.720]   However--
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.480]   Probably because the underlying device hardware
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.680]   would also have to be modularized as part of this.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:55.160]   So that makes sense, actually.
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:55.480]   Right.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.400]   No, that makes sense.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.240]   They did say, though, there was a podcast,
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.400]   I think just yesterday with a number of Android engineers
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:06.040]   on it, Chet Haas was there, a few other folks, where they basically--
[01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:09.760]   they hinted at the fact that they're working with--
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:13.760]   they said some companies to update their flagships to Oreo
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.720]   while trebleizing them at the same time.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.760]   So we don't know who, we don't know what devices,
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.480]   but they're hinting now more than what they said a few months
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:24.080]   ago, which is that trouble could be coming to more devices
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:27.520]   that are just merely being updated Oreo, and that's good news.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.080]   Then I see why you're confused.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.280]   [LAUGHS]
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:33.440]   It's a little confusing.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.800]   Hey, but you know what?
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:38.000]   When things break, you can call it trouble damages.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.280]   Ooh.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:39.560]   There's--
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.440]   Stop your right joke.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:41.000]   Trouble.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:41.760]   It's like trouble.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:42.200]   Or--
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.320]   Too much caffeine.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:44.600]   Trouble is trouble.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:45.200]   Sorry.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.160]   OK.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.160]   I'm back.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.280]   The trouble with trouble, yes.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.280]   The trouble with trouble.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:50.840]   Oh, the trouble with trouble.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:52.320]   Oh, the trouble with trouble.
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:52.760]   There are also--
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.120]   OK.
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:54.880]   There are also some folks complaining
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.160]   about Bluetooth issues with Android 8.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:00.760]   And actually, this Sam Boel submitted the Will Bering's
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:01.260]   podcast.
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:02.280]   We have him on Tech News today.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:05.640]   Everyone's wild to talk about autonomous vehicle technology
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:06.320]   and stuff.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:09.000]   He had told me that, oh, prior to this update
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.960]   had broken his Bluetooth auto-connectability
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.680]   with Android Auto a few weeks ago.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.960]   And he was wondering if this new update had fixed that.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.920]   But apparently, a lot of people who are updating to Oreo
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:23.640]   are finding that their devices won't connect to Android Auto
[01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:26.600]   when they get in, has trouble connecting to headphones,
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.240]   might connect, but then drop out intermittently.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:30.480]   I have a little bit of that.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.640]   My Pixel.
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:33.520]   And your Pixel is updated at this point?
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.200]   Are you on the--
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.000]   Well, updated to what to-- oh, no.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.120]   OK.
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.720]   So maybe it's just got a problem.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:43.000]   Yeah, I don't know if this is the same or a different problem.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.200]   By the way, if you want to get in on Oreo
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:47.520]   because it's the official release at this point,
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.920]   sign up for the beta and you'll get a notification right now
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.160]   that you can update to Oreo.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.080]   Oh, what was that?
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.240]   Say, sign up for the beta.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.360]   If you are on the beta program, you
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.840]   can have access to Oreo right now.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.280]   I thought I was.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:06.560]   Check your system update and see if it'll trigger it.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.960]   I did about an hour ago.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.840]   Oh, and nothing.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.200]   Nothing.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.040]   And strangely, you'll know you're on Oreo
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.120]   if when you go to Settings, A, it says Oreo,
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.920]   and B, when you do the Easter egg tap,
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.880]   where you tap on the version number
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.200]   and it pulls up the letter or whatever.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.720]   If you go through that whole process,
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.640]   it'll pull up an octopus.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.640]   It doesn't pull up an Oreo.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.560]   It pulls up an octopus.
[01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:30.960]   Go figure.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:31.960]   Confusing.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:32.960]   New.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:33.960]   New.
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:36.160]   Maybe there is a limit to the trademark.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.160]   Hey, so.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.160]   Maybe there is.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.160]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.560]   Did you get the essential phone or?
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:42.560]   I know.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:43.560]   You know what?
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:44.560]   Leo's waiting for it.
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.760]   We have knocked on the essential phone.
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:48.480]   I asked him the other day if he got a shipping notice for it
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.480]   and he says he hasn't even gotten that,
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.840]   even though he got his order in very early.
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.000]   OK.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.320]   I'm still in the market for a phone, so I'm like, oh,
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.320]   it's a good time.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.320]   It's an eight.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.320]   I know.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.520]   That's why I'm like, I'm very eager.
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:06.120]   Well, the essential, I mean, Ron Richards, all about Android,
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:11.600]   he went to the essential event in New York on Monday.
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.960]   And we talked about it and showed video that he captured
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:14.960]   while he was there.
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:16.720]   He got to play around with the essential phone.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.680]   We talked about that on yesterday's all about Android.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:22.960]   So you can check that out if you want, but he was very impressed.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:26.000]   Everything that he saw, he said that the device just felt
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   significant.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.200]   I mean, it had a nice weight to it.
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.280]   It was super elegant.
[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:32.760]   He was incredibly impressed.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:34.560]   So--
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.560]   Hey.
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.160]   Oh.
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:37.000]   Seems like a good--
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.320]   Or my option.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.200]   $1,000 note eight.
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:41.200]   Ah.
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:42.040]   We'll talk about that next.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.040]   Let's talk about that next.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.560]   We definitely need to dive into Samsung's new--
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.760]   Want to hear your own perspective on that, sir.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.200]   I've got opinions.
[01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:50.440]   And we will chat about that.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.760]   But first, let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.680]   episode of This Week in Google.
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.280]   And that's LegalZoom.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.240]   I love LegalZoom.
[01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:59.000]   I've been using LegalZoom for years.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.600]   I use them when we had our first kid to set up and actually
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.920]   create our will.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.960]   And it was the easiest process in the world.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.280]   And so I love it when I get to do their read,
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:14.760]   to promote them, because it was just so awesome.
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.680]   It's National Make a Will Month also.
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.240]   So it's perfect timing at LegalZoom.
[01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.720]   That means it's time to take control of your family
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:22.960]   and your assets.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.360]   Preparing for your family's future is the most important
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:27.280]   thing that you'll do this summer.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:29.120]   Sure, there's a whole lot to think about.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.440]   We've got lots on our minds.
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:33.480]   But that's why LegalZoom created an estate planning
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.160]   kit to get you going.
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:40.040]   Go to legalzoom.com/prepare, and you'll get your free kit.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.560]   You'll receive helpful information and LegalZoom
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:45.920]   discounts, all the things that you need to stop procrastinating,
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:47.760]   stop putting it off, and to start
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.760]   preparing for your family's future.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.840]   LegalZoom designed this kit to provide the tools you need
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:57.600]   in all in one place, whether a will or a trust is right for you.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:00.120]   You'll get special LegalZoom discounts,
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.120]   plus an estate plan checklist, an e-book, and other information
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.440]   to help you decide.
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:07.280]   LegalZoom is not a law firm.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:09.560]   If you have any questions, you can always
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.800]   get advice from their network of attorneys
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:14.760]   available in all 50 states.
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.840]   And the process is super simple.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:21.920]   I actually have to go back in there and add our second daughter
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:22.800]   to this.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:26.840]   I really need to take advantage of this and get her added.
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:27.960]   I know it's the right thing to do.
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:28.800]   And that's the thing.
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.560]   It's so easy to put this off.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.600]   But you know that it's the right thing to do.
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:34.520]   You know that the sooner you do it, the better.
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:38.200]   So go to legalzoom.com/prepare today.
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.880]   There's no obligation, just great resources
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.520]   to help you protect everything you care about
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.000]   and during National Make a Will Month.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.600]   That's legalzoom.com/prepare, and we thank LegalZoom
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:53.880]   for their support of this week in Google.
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:57.280]   All right, so early this morning about 8 AM Pacific,
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:01.840]   11 AM Eastern, Samsung held its unpacked event
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:06.840]   and showed off the next note, the Note 8.
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:10.040]   Samsung hopes that you will forget everything you thought
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:13.160]   you knew about the Note 7, and you will embrace the Note 8.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.440]   They actually started the event.
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.880]   I wasn't sure if they were going to address it directly,
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:20.680]   but they started with a promotional kind of video
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.800]   about basically addressing specifically like,
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:24.720]   "We let you down.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.040]   You put your trust in us.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.600]   We'll let you down."
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.200]   No.
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:33.080]   "But then showing all the people who stuck with Samsung
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.160]   and hey, thank you for sticking with us
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:36.080]   and all that kind of stuff."
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.680]   So they addressed it first and fourth.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:38.680]   For it.
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:41.680]   But they showed off the Note 8,
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.360]   designed similar to the S8.
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.040]   I have the S8 Plus here.
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:46.520]   Let me get the fingerprints off it
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:49.080]   because it is a magnet for fingerprints.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.320]   But I have the S8 Plus here.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.560]   So it's very similar to this in the kind of what they call
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:57.120]   the Infinity display, the edges on the side.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:00.280]   On the Note 8, of course, you'll have the S Pen that pops out
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.280]   of the corner down there.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:03.080]   Very similar.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.080]   It's basically the same design language as what you have
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.280]   with the S8 and the S8 Plus right now.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.600]   But a little bit larger, 6.3 inch Infinity display.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:14.840]   The Infinity display, of course,
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:17.400]   means that it's a little bit less--
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.360]   well, almost bezel-less on the side
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:21.000]   because it drops over the side.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.440]   But reduced bezels on the top and bottom,
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:27.680]   it really kind of makes it feel like a smaller device.
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:30.200]   Nice Snapdragon 835, which is pretty standard
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.000]   for the premium smartphones this year.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.560]   6 gigs of RAM, most RAM that they offer.
[01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:41.960]   S Pen, like I said, live message just so you can draw a message
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:43.240]   with your S Pen.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:46.080]   And then it animates that drawing in the picture
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.640]   that you send to whoever you're sending it to.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:51.920]   So when they look at it, it shows it drawing on screen.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.280]   Samsung likes the splashy things like that.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:56.520]   You can do live translation of text.
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.720]   You can write on the launch screen.
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.640]   You don't used to do that with Hangout.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.000]   If you drew something in Hangouts,
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.240]   it would show the drawing happening in Hangouts.
[01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:03.880]   Oh, really?
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:04.680]   I don't remember that.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:05.200]   Yeah, I don't remember that.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.560]   That's cool.
[01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:10.200]   When Hangouts was a web interface where you could put on the mask.
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:13.200]   You would draw with your mouse on the web interface
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.520]   not actually in the--
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:16.880]   I know, emmold.
[01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:17.400]   No, no, no.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:20.280]   I've used that web interface a lot.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.280]   And you could put on the masks and everything.
[01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:26.160]   Yeah, all that stuff.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.000]   This is the first Samsung phone with dual camera support.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.960]   So it has dual rear-facing cameras,
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:36.960]   a wide-angle 12 megapixel with an F1.7 aperture
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:40.960]   and a 12 megapixel telephoto camera, same aperture.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.640]   Two times optical zoom, live focus mode
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:47.520]   for getting the Boca foreground background blur.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.080]   And that's done in real time.
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.480]   So this is cool.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.960]   When you take a picture like that, it pops in.
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:55.760]   And you could take the picture with and preview
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.600]   how things in the background look blurred
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:01.960]   compared to things in the foreground being sharp.
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:03.760]   But what you end up with after the fact
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:08.920]   is you end up with a full res image, as well as the combination
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.440]   image that you can then tweak after the fact
[01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:13.960]   and say, I want the background to be more blurry, less blurry,
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:14.760]   whatever.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:19.920]   So it gives you just everything, which is kind of nice.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.480]   Launching with NuGet, not launching with Oreo.
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:24.000]   Sorry about that.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.720]   And yeah, I know.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.600]   Are either of you like Note aficionados?
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.600]   Did you like the lard?
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.320]   My parents.
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:34.200]   My parents loved the Note so much that they didn't get rid
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.560]   of theirs even when they were exploding.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.920]   They stuck at a Pyrex dishes at night to charge.
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:42.160]   The Note 7, so they did not give back their Note 7?
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:45.360]   They finally gave it back when I think Verizon started
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.280]   cutting people off.
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:51.280]   But up until then, they did not give them up.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:53.760]   They don't fly.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.800]   So yeah, they are definitely--
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.080]   my mom was looking at this, and she's like, ooh.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:01.280]   But then she saw the price tag, and she's like, ooh.
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.520]   Yeah, it's a little pricey.
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:06.120]   I mean, we are right on the cusp of $1,000 smart phones.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.520]   Well, they get a break.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:08.520]   But this says they get away.
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:09.200]   Yeah, see this.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:09.800]   Yes.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:11.440]   Now we found that out after the fact.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:16.120]   So OK, so the price without the break, $930 on T-Mobile, $950
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:20.400]   on AT&T, $960 on Verizon, and Sprint.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:26.440]   If you pre-order, you can take your pick of either a gear 360
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:33.080]   thrown in or a 128 gig flash microSD card
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.960]   along with a wireless charger.
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.440]   So you can take your pick of either of those if you pre-order.
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:41.760]   If you buy through Best Buy, they'll also knock off $150.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:47.320]   However, if you bought and whether you returned it
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.680]   or whether you still have it or whatever,
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.600]   I'm curious to see how they handle this.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:53.320]   The Note 7, you get up to-- what is it?
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:58.440]   Up to $425 of a discount off of a discount.
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.080]   Which is crazy.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:18:59.880]   It's difficult.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:00.880]   That is.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:05.440]   Well, because Samsung, I swear, they gave my mom a gear 2,
[01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.720]   which-- you know, meh.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:08.560]   But they gave her a watch.
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:11.160]   They gave them the VR headset.
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:11.880]   What was that?
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.920]   Yeah, the Gear VR.
[01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.120]   Yep.
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:14.640]   There we go.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.960]   OK, the Gear VR.
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:19.560]   So they got all this stuff just the longer they held on.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.200]   So--
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:21.840]   Wow.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.240]   Less alert.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:26.160]   So a discount?
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:26.760]   Yay.
[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:27.160]   Maybe.
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:28.120]   Maybe we'll do it.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:28.960]   And I'm an ad.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.160]   They kind of feel more loyal now.
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.600]   They're like, well, you know, yeah, they did exploding phones.
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:33.480]   But ours didn't explode.
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.760]   And look at all this free stuff we got.
[01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.840]   Well, I mean, isn't that the interesting story here?
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.520]   That's what kind of fascinates me,
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:41.840]   is that when all the Note 7 stuff-- now, maybe it was overblown.
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.400]   But people really reacted to it.
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:45.320]   The press certainly reacted to it.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.520]   You know, you did not stop hearing about it.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.720]   And I'm guilty of that.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.800]   We talked about it so much on this network
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.720]   and on the shows that I was doing.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.000]   It just seemed like a really big deal.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.200]   And I think the reason I was concerned about it
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:20:01.400]   is that Samsung was near if not at the top of the heap.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.800]   At the time, I was like, man, they can only go down
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:05.120]   based on this experience.
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.640]   Like, this is bad for the company.
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:11.160]   Turns out Samsung has had record breaking revenue.
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:13.760]   The past few earnings calls.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:18.280]   People who were Note 7 fans are just as dedicated to this next
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:19.680]   note as they were to that one.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.280]   It really did very little, I think,
[01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:25.600]   to damage their brand loyalty, their brand reputation.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.280]   And that's just a really--
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:27.800]   I don't know.
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:30.560]   That's pretty significant for that company.
[01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:31.120]   Well, they did.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:31.960]   I mean, they-- OK.
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:34.400]   So they didn't tell us what exactly was happening.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:36.920]   But when they realized that there were phones that were
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:40.960]   unexpectedly and unexpectedly exploding, they took care of it.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.600]   They didn't--
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:47.720]   That goes a long way, I think, to fixing it.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:52.600]   I think though, at the beginning, they may have been less chatty.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:55.120]   But they-- once they realized the scope of the problem,
[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.640]   they changed their tune really quickly.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.880]   Yeah, they did.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:01.520]   It was existential for that part of the company.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.160]   Well, it seems to have worked for them.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.160]   Although, nearly $1,000 phone, this
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:11.760]   is not an inexpensive device by any stretch.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.440]   And I don't know.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:17.680]   I think once Apple has their announcement of the next iPhone,
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:19.240]   I think we're--
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.680]   I mean, we don't know the price yet.
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:24.560]   But one could expect that it's probably in the same price
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.440]   range as this for the time.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.360]   When do we expect the new Pixel announcement?
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:30.560]   When do they usually announce Google?
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.400]   I think the last time they had an announcement
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:34.320]   was sometime early October, I believe,
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.960]   and then it was released into October.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:41.080]   So those leaks are probably going to start happening pretty
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:41.400]   rapidly.
[01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:44.080]   So you're not willing to wait that long, Stacey?
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.760]   No, I can wait that long.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.240]   And I think that--
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.640]   Yeah, that's not crazy.
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:51.720]   And I mean, my phone is--
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.320]   actually, it's getting kind of wacky.
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:54.120]   I feel it.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.520]   It feels aged.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:57.560]   What do you have right now?
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:59.000]   What is your phone?
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.760]   I have 5X, so the Nexus 5X.
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:06.480]   It's going to be two years old in October, September,
[01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:07.840]   whenever--
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.160]   It feels like five years, doesn't it?
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:10.720]   I know.
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:11.200]   It does.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.040]   It feels like forever.
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:13.960]   But it's not.
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:15.040]   It is not forever.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:18.520]   It's crazy how fast time flies with that kind of stuff.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.880]   Feels like it anyways.
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.720]   So hey, are we done talking about this stuff?
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:24.220]   Sure.
[01:22:24.220 --> 01:22:25.560]   What do you want to talk about?
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:30.880]   I want to talk about Sonos and the updates
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:36.240]   and get your opinions about kind of this concept of services.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.200]   Are we buying devices?
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:39.120]   Are we buying services?
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.360]   Because I don't know if you saw this,
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:45.040]   but Sonos changed its terms of service in preparation
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:47.760]   for the Amazon Echo integration.
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.240]   And as part of that, it said it wanted
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:54.080]   to collect data from people that we can go into what data.
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:58.120]   But it also said that if you don't agree to the change
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:01.360]   in service, eventually some of your Sonos products
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.120]   may stop working.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.520]   So did you guys not see this?
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:05.680]   Why did not see this?
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:08.960]   Oh, it was really sort of as far as you bought previously?
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:09.880]   Yes.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:12.480]   So that's what's so interesting.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:14.080]   So let's put this on the run.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.160]   It's a ZDnet story.
[01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.120]   Sonos says users must accept new privacy policy or devices
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:19.920]   may quote, "seize to function."
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:23.160]   Well, what does that do with privacy?
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:24.720]   So it's supporting--
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.560]   I thought it'd be like a copyright licensing
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.560]   or something like that.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.720]   Privacy?
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:32.640]   Well, OK.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:33.800]   I'm trying to remember--
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.920]   Oh, this is probably just to protect their rewrite.
[01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:41.280]   So the privacy policy is to get data from the devices.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:44.120]   So when you take data from devices--
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.520]   so they want what's called--
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:48.000]   they call it functional data, including your email address.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.920]   IP addresses, account info, device data, information
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:56.400]   about Wi-Fi antennas, your room names, and error data.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:00.840]   So there's apparently users can opt out
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:03.280]   of some kinds of data, personal information,
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:05.480]   but not that data.
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:08.840]   And if you don't agree to that, then some of your devices
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:13.680]   over time may cease to function is what they're saying.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:15.520]   So it's their privacy, but it's also--
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:19.600]   their privacy party is part of their terms of service.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:21.400]   And they're saying that their service
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.720]   requires these pieces of information.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:26.200]   They say you can opt out of submitting
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.880]   certain types of personal information
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:31.160]   to the company, like additional usage data,
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:34.240]   performance activity information.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:38.520]   But yeah, once you switch off that data
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:41.840]   that they feel is necessary for all of those devices
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:44.200]   to perform basic functions, things
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:46.400]   are going to work the way they used to.
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.960]   Man, I don't know how to feel about that.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.360]   So last-- I think it was last week--
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:57.680]   Plex, the digital media company player thing.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:01.040]   I never know what to call Plex.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.080]   That works.
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:03.280]   Media server?
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:04.680]   Media server, yeah.
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.280]   So they changed their terms of service,
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:09.600]   and it's remarkably similar.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:11.880]   So I just wanted to bring this up,
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:15.520]   because I think this is an issue that--
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.120]   there's actually a good reason for this.
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:20.040]   But I think it's an issue that we're probably
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:23.360]   going to encounter more often as we buy more connected devices.
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:27.120]   But it's also an issue where I think companies can handle it
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.520]   a little bit better.
[01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:33.840]   So I have six sonosys.
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:37.440]   And one of them I bought all the way back in 2008.
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:42.920]   And if I decided not to update my sonosys,
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:46.240]   and that guy stopped working next year,
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.880]   I would still have had 10 years.
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.480]   So what I should ask--
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:51.000]   But you really bought it with the presumption
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.680]   it was yours forever.
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:54.280]   I did.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.080]   What's the--
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.520]   Are there any functional--
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:58.120]   There is.
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:58.800]   So--
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:25:59.800]   Necessity.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.520]   OK.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.320]   If you do the-- sorry.
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.400]   If you do the Madam A integration,
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.360]   they're going to be responsible for quality of service.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:11.400]   So the idea is they need this information
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.200]   to determine room information so they
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:18.520]   can build a skill where you tell the echo, play it in this room.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.280]   So they need that for functionality.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:24.240]   But they also need it to say, oh, the reason this isn't working
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.280]   is because you don't have Wi-Fi service,
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:28.480]   or it's really crappy in this area.
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.760]   The challenge is you could build all of that functionality,
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:36.320]   but you still have to support your older users who
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:39.360]   are on this older version that didn't agree to that.
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:42.240]   So then what you've got is a bifurcation of your platform.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.120]   My hunch is-- and I don't know this for sure--
[01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.120]   is that they wanted-- at some point in time,
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.280]   they're prepping to avoid that bifurcation.
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.080]   They're not saying it's stopping right now.
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.840]   They're saying they may cease to function.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:58.800]   So in 10 years, they may be like, you know what?
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:03.000]   We've got 1,000 people left on these old systems.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:03.920]   Let's take them off.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.760]   It's not worth paying a developer $150,000 a year
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:12.760]   just to keep this old ratty system running.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:16.560]   So that's probably what's behind the legalese,
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.520]   but it's really crappy that they're not explaining this well.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:25.240]   And yeah, sorry, I just talked a whole lot.
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:29.720]   No, I'm kind of taking it in and reading over Plex's thing.
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:34.520]   The EFF is saying, obviously, they're
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:37.520]   critical of this decision on Sonos' part, saying,
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:40.560]   we understand that there are things
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.280]   that you need in order for this to work,
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:47.800]   but companies like Sonos can do a better job of compartmentalizing
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:52.000]   the information that's needed and how it interplays
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.960]   with the device to provide those functions.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.440]   Maybe it doesn't transmit it.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.640]   Maybe it stores it locally instead
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.720]   and it can kind of be the best of both worlds.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.600]   I don't know the reality of that in integration,
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.400]   but I know when I buy something, I
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.800]   expect it to work for a long time.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.880]   At the same time, I expect it to work forever.
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.120]   But at the same time, we're buying
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:12.520]   a lot of things that are dependent on some sort of a service
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:13.120]   in the cloud.
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:16.520]   And I guess those rules are being rewritten because--
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:19.200]   Well, there's like that should never last forever.
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:19.720]   Right.
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.520]   Well, there's two different angles here.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:29.200]   One is that Tesla saying, you can't use my car and my software
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:31.840]   to start your own taxi company.
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.240]   That's ridiculous.
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.000]   I bought the thing.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:35.560]   I can use it.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.560]   However I wish, I have the right to use that.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:40.160]   It goes back to the doctrine of when I bought a videotape,
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:43.520]   I could choose to rent it or sell it if I chose,
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:46.680]   because that was the idea that I bought it and it was mine.
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:47.800]   That's one issue.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:51.040]   So I find that offensive to try to limit my use
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.800]   and turn a physical good into a licensed good.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:57.040]   On the other hand, there are cases
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:01.800]   where to operate functionally, there
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:04.080]   may be a need to be able to know some data,
[01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.760]   and you've got to have a privacy policy.
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:07.960]   And if we can't know that data to make this thing operate
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:10.280]   functionally well, then you can't blame us
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:13.480]   for not operating functionally or properly.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:15.440]   I'm a little more sympathetic to that,
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:19.320]   but that's awfully obscure and difficult.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:21.720]   And it just doesn't sound like a Soto Sky,
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:23.480]   but doesn't sound like they did a good job of explaining
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.520]   whatever the heck it is they're doing,
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:28.200]   and why it's a bit of a consumer.
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:31.000]   And I think as we get into this area,
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.720]   we need much more transparent policies
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:36.880]   about how our data is being used.
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:40.760]   And if Soto explains itself, it would help.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:43.800]   And also if they came up with a date,
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.040]   they may cease to function as pretty vague,
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.600]   but people of course are going to flip out.
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:52.320]   They're like, I mean, I spent $2,000 a couple years ago
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:54.200]   adding more Soto system to my system.
[01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:57.240]   That's, I mean, I may shop at Target,
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:58.720]   but that's still a lot of money.
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:00.440]   - That's an investment, yeah, right.
[01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:04.480]   - Yeah, and it's seeing Macy's to function.
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:05.760]   Well, yeah, it's not.
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.920]   Apparently it's not because it might not work.
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:09.840]   (both laughing)
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:14.840]   So that's kind of, but, oh, so here's the next wrench in this.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.040]   And I don't know if you saw this, but Uber,
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:23.040]   I think it was the second,
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:26.020]   second district appeals court of New York.
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:30.120]   Basically someone had sued Uber
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.480]   for some surge pricing stuff,
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:34.360]   but also sued them because their terms of service
[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:37.000]   were like too long and difficult to read on the screen.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.520]   And the judge was like, oh, that's not true.
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.840]   So what that's done is it said that
[01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:45.200]   Uber's arbitration clause that you accept
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.560]   when you click on the TOS,
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.560]   the terms of service is just fine and dandy in this case.
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:51.120]   'Cause this guy was like, you don't have to send me
[01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.360]   through arbitration, I still have a court case
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.240]   because that, because their terms of service
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:57.880]   were so long and I couldn't read it.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.560]   The judge was like, no.
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.880]   So now what we're actually gonna have happen
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:06.600]   is a lot of our terms of service disagreements
[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:08.000]   and things like this,
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.360]   they might actually get fought in arbitration
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:11.800]   and not in the public courts,
[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.880]   which I think is a huge problem
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:16.320]   because if someone's gonna take Sonos
[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:18.360]   to like a class action suit for this
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.200]   and we're gonna see a lot of explanation
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:22.240]   and what's happening here, that's great.
[01:31:22.240 --> 01:31:24.880]   But if they do it behind the curtain, that's terrible.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:26.800]   We're not gonna have any sense of what's happening
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.720]   to our digital rights as we move more of our economy
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:33.480]   and property in ownership to these places.
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:37.720]   And that was my second freak out of the day.
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:43.400]   - How can we tie this into food though is the question.
[01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.440]   We have to tie this story into any sort of food.
[01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.440]   - I have a connected oven.
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:51.800]   What if one day it doesn't work or it doesn't.
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:54.600]   - No, it refuses to make queso.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.800]   There we got there.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:58.200]   - You don't make queso in an oven.
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.000]   - It says, well, I don't know.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.120]   Well, I'm gonna make mine though
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:03.800]   because all I have to do is microwave mine
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:04.680]   and Trader Joe's.
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:06.240]   So yes, and it's gonna say,
[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:09.280]   and your oven would say, we don't shop at Walmart,
[01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:11.520]   we don't shop at TJ Maxx
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:13.600]   and we will not microwave queso.
[01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:16.080]   Can't do it, we won't do it against the terms of service,
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:16.920]   not happening.
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:19.240]   - We don't microwave queso
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:22.000]   that doesn't have any nutritional value whatsoever.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.280]   - But yeah, so I was gonna say,
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:30.120]   maybe my oven company signs a deal with, you know,
[01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.720]   Trader Joe's or Amazon,
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:36.000]   and so suddenly it will not make any recipes.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.600]   Suddenly all the recipes that I've grown to love would change.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.440]   So I love the way it cooks chicken today
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:44.720]   but maybe in the future it gets a licensing deal with Tyson
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:47.000]   and changes the way it cooks chicken.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.400]   And then suddenly I'm like, wait, no, ah!
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:55.080]   - But you like it roasted, Stacy.
[01:32:55.080 --> 01:32:57.160]   - But you like it this way now.
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:59.680]   - Yep.
[01:32:59.680 --> 01:33:02.960]   Any kind of final stories from the rundown
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:05.520]   before we take a break and then get to numbers
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:07.560]   and tips and picks and everything?
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:09.640]   - Oh, no, I was kind of fascinated with,
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:10.960]   I was troubled by this.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.560]   Where was it under Google?
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:17.280]   The service that's trying to,
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:20.280]   it was confusing civility with decency, there it is.
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:24.160]   Google's anti-bullying AI mistakes civility for decency.
[01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:29.160]   And I think civility is a key need right now.
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:33.280]   Trying to recapture civility, recapture decency
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.720]   and respect among people.
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:36.880]   But I think trying to automate it
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:37.920]   is not gonna be totally successful.
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:42.920]   So the New York Times stopped using the coral projects
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.280]   online comedy and stuff that there was.
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:50.280]   And to use this instead from Google's Jigsaw,
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:55.480]   which is an effort to have a learning system
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:57.480]   that understands how to be taught
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.680]   and to recognize incivility.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:02.200]   But this points out that if,
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:05.640]   unfortunately what it recognizes is so-called decency.
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:10.400]   So if you say, that's awesome, then no, yeah, that's fine.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.240]   If you say that's effing awesome,
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:15.240]   although that's horrible because you used effing, right?
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:20.480]   The subtlety of dog whistles, the subtlety of insults,
[01:34:20.480 --> 01:34:25.480]   the subtlety of trolling and tweeting and harassing.
[01:34:25.480 --> 01:34:31.160]   I don't know that a system can ever be taught this.
[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:34.840]   Granted, Tay was taught pretty easily how to be that,
[01:34:34.840 --> 01:34:36.560]   but it'd be awful.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:39.440]   But it's fascinating to me that as we try
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.880]   to recapture civility that some would say
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:45.160]   the internet ruined, I don't think that technology,
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:46.560]   I don't think technology is fully at fault
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:49.360]   for causing this, I think it exposed it.
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:50.760]   In any case, I don't think technology
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.560]   is gonna be the answer for putting it back
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:55.320]   at the gene back in that bottle.
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.160]   Stacy?
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.800]   - And no, well, I was gonna say this is kind of an inverse
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:00.560]   of the problem that sensors have.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:03.600]   So if you look at China and their censorship efforts,
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:07.440]   how people will automate, even kids around parents,
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.960]   they come up with new ways to say,
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:14.680]   to be in censorship, it's to say things they wanna talk about
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:16.280]   without actually saying the words, right?
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.000]   So language is so fluid and flexible,
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.400]   it feels like any sort of AI is going to be
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:27.720]   at somewhat of a disadvantage because if you,
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:29.840]   I mean, if you ban the word Nazi from your forum,
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:32.840]   people are just going to use, I don't know, Pepe the frog.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.600]   We are, you can't condemn Nazis then too,
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.960]   you can't say those people are Nazis.
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:37.800]   - Right.
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:38.880]   - Right, with good purpose.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:40.760]   That's an excellent example actually, right.
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:44.720]   So Nazi is the Godwood rule, the Godwood law,
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:47.560]   Godwin's law, that by the time it descends to that,
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:49.120]   but we just have a time in the news right now
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:52.960]   when literally Nazis and deciding who are Nazis
[01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:57.000]   and what we say about Nazis is a critical,
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.280]   I would say litmus test of civility,
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:00.640]   leadership responsibility.
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:05.320]   So these efforts to say that we're gonna just put everybody,
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:07.240]   that the machines are gonna make us okay,
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:09.960]   the machines made us all uncivilized
[01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:11.800]   and the machines can make us all civilized again
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.760]   is wrong on both ends.
[01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:16.560]   I reminded of the time that Nick built
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:21.040]   in the New York Times freaked out because Robert Skowable
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:23.200]   walked into the men's room at Moscone Center
[01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:25.720]   during an I/O with his Google class on.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.200]   - Right, I remember that.
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:29.840]   - And, and, and, and, and, and built and called me about this
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:30.760]   and I said a couple things.
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:33.200]   One, one, I said Nick, nobody wants a picture of you,
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:34.480]   John, just relax.
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:39.080]   And, and number two, don't presume that the technology
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:42.920]   made us into uncivilized louts that we were not already.
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.440]   It may have exposed, it made it easier,
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:49.040]   but it made, but don't, don't assume that just the technology
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:49.880]   makes us do this.
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:52.160]   That is a technological deterministic view.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:56.080]   And I even I, the technological optimist, don't believe that.
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.000]   So I just found this really, really interesting.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.960]   I think, I think recapturing civility to me
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:03.320]   in this whole fake news thing that I had concentrated
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:07.080]   on a lot these days, I think that civility, respect,
[01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.960]   is a precondition for openness to facts,
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:13.080]   which is a precondition for openness to people's perspectives.
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:16.240]   So recapturing civility is absolutely critical.
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:18.200]   But if we think that an algorithm is going to do it,
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:19.800]   no matter how smart the algorithm nor,
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:23.400]   no matter how well trained, we are fooling ourselves.
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:25.600]   That, I just found interesting, that's all.
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:28.320]   - Yeah, I mean, maybe at some point these algorithms,
[01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:32.760]   AI gets, there's some sort of breakthrough where nuance,
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:35.120]   where it takes it to a new level in this,
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.640]   like understanding nuance and understanding context of.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:42.040]   - By the time we're there, we're in perfect translation
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.680]   of languages. - Yeah.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:44.680]   - Right? 'Cause that's the,
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:47.080]   that's the unemotional level where you get nuance.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:47.920]   - Right, right.
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:52.560]   - Well, nuance varies by people and by culture.
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:55.320]   That's also, I mean,
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:59.000]   I pity the computer, I mean, people suck at it.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.920]   We just try to be graceful, mostly, when it happens.
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:05.000]   (laughing)
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.360]   So, I don't know how a computer is gonna handle that
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:12.240]   and how people will handle computers handling that.
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.840]   - I wrote a piece some years ago for The Guardian,
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.640]   which I won't spell the word out,
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:20.480]   but I said that BS spelled out is political speech.
[01:38:20.480 --> 01:38:23.040]   If you cannot call BS on things,
[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:25.840]   then you are restricted from political speech.
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:29.200]   So when the FCC and others will allow you to say that word
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:32.040]   on the air, or for that matter, YouTube, in this context,
[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.680]   which is why I'm not saying it,
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:37.480]   it restricts political speech, not just profane speech.
[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:39.640]   - Oh, I just say that's horse poop.
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:42.120]   (laughing)
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:43.960]   Well, thanks a lot, Stacey.
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:47.640]   - I'm just saying that, you know, or as my daughter,
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:49.080]   I pointed out something to her.
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.680]   I came in 'cause I do tend to swear.
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:53.440]   And she's very judgmental of me.
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.680]   She, I told her, I had seen a survey that said,
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:59.840]   people who swear are more like honest and,
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:02.840]   oh, more authentic, they are more authentic than other people.
[01:39:02.840 --> 01:39:04.280]   And she looked at me and she said,
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.520]   "Mom, that's garbage."
[01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:09.800]   And the way she said it, she might as well have said BS.
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:10.640]   - F-A-Gourd.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:11.560]   (laughing)
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:14.280]   - Yes, she's just so much scorned.
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.120]   (laughing)
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:17.000]   That's garbage.
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:17.840]   - That's like, that's horrible.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:21.000]   - That's interesting that your daughter is the Puritan.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.480]   - She had saved, I think when I was nine,
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:27.040]   I was a Puritan, or nine and 10, I was very judgment.
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:27.880]   - Yeah, that's true.
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:31.120]   - She just heard 11, so we'll see how long that lasts.
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:33.440]   - And that ends the day she turns 11.
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:34.280]   That's how it works.
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:36.640]   - Nope, we're still, I still gotta look this morning.
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:39.080]   (laughing)
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:40.720]   - Awesome, okay, we're gonna take a break
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:42.640]   and then we're gonna come back and do tips, tricks,
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:45.200]   and whatever else we got there at the end of the show.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.080]   I've got really quite your numbers, all sorts of things.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:50.840]   We've got lots of stuff for you left over for the show.
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:52.600]   But before that, let's thank the sponsor.
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:55.240]   This week in Google is brought to you by Rocket Mortgage
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.520]   by Quick and Loans.
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.520]   If you've gone through the mortgage process,
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:02.040]   you already know that the process is,
[01:40:02.040 --> 01:40:04.160]   it's not always the easiest thing in the world.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:07.560]   It's dated, it needed, a client-focused,
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.760]   technological revolution, something to kind of tie in
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.160]   with our digital lives, where they do everything online.
[01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.440]   So why not secure a mortgage online
[01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.880]   and make that process easier?
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:19.200]   And that's why Quick and Loans created Rocket Mortgage.

[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:47.560]   It's powerful whether you're looking to buy your first home

[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:26.520]   And we thank Rocket Mortgage by Quick and Loans
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:29.160]   for their support of This Week in Google.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:32.160]   All right, Stacey, why don't we start with you?
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.960]   What's on your mind?
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:36.360]   What's the thing this week?
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:40.800]   - So I didn't, I got a bum light with my IKEA light
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:43.000]   so, and I haven't gone out to replace it.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.680]   So--
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:47.120]   - Sock the IKEA smart light, whatever.
[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:50.880]   - This is the, I'll show you the broken version,
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:53.320]   which is this guy, the Trodfi.
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:54.840]   - Oh, okay.
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:57.600]   - So stay tuned for that, you guys.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:02.600]   But I was going to, so my alternate pick is
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.720]   the prepared.org.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:08.600]   This is a newsletter I subscribe to.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:12.160]   And I think because of the audience overlap,
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:15.800]   this is about hardware, manufacturing, engineering,
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:18.040]   and just nerdy tech stuff.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:21.600]   So like, it's not necessarily, it's a weekly newsletter,
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.040]   there's also a podcast.
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:26.360]   But it's like the physical world around you
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:27.160]   and how it's made.
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.960]   And it's everything from a profile that James Hamilton
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:33.520]   over at Amazon wrote like several months ago
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:37.200]   about his trip to a fiber-ling ship.
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:39.720]   So like how that process works to things like
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.880]   really geeky stuff on tear downs on like
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:44.720]   arduino's and chips and fun stuff.
[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:46.320]   So I like it.
[01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:48.520]   I think a lot of you guys might like it too.
[01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:52.120]   - The prepared, I thought you said be prepared.
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:54.200]   And that took me to the scouting website.
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:57.240]   - Oh, sorry, not the scouts.
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:42:59.640]   They're lovely too, but the prepared.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:01.200]   - The prepared. - There it is.
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:02.040]   - Okay, gotcha.
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:07.520]   - So, yeah, well that's just the tool guide
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:08.560]   for people who do stuff.
[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:09.520]   Oh, what's a rip hammer?
[01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:10.360]   I don't even know.
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:16.440]   - But the news that are, I get the news that are like
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.360]   siding and things, is that what I'm reading?
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:19.200]   - I don't know.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:22.160]   - Do you need food to be prepared this day?
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.920]   You know when we're back to the theme of the day or not?
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.600]   - I can take you back to the theme of the day.
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:29.280]   I can give you a great recipe.
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:33.840]   - Google has surfaced a wonderful flagrata recipe for me
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.560]   that I could share with you guys if you like.
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.480]   - I was like mulled wine in August.
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:38.800]   How do we feel about that?
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:43.680]   - Or I could tell you the Instapot everyone should have one.
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:44.760]   That is all.
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:47.240]   - The rip hammer is generally used for framing
[01:43:47.240 --> 01:43:50.720]   and ripping construction tasks while a curved claw hammer
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:54.280]   is a double ended hammer that is used for hammering
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:56.240]   and pulling out of nails.
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:44:00.600]   - Okay, that is just number?
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:02.280]   No, that's not just number.
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:04.800]   - No, but I imagine it was,
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:09.800]   Karsten was funny putting in the queso nutritional numbers
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:11.080]   under my number.
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:13.880]   - Nice.
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:16.080]   - 15 calories.
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:17.000]   - What?
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.400]   - What?
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:19.800]   - 15 calories.
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:24.200]   Calories from fat zero, total fat 0.5, saturated fat zero.
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:26.120]   This is a cheese, it's supposed to be.
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:28.880]   Trans fat zero, cholesterol zero.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:30.240]   As somebody said in Twitter, I put this up,
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:33.640]   but the sodium is gonna kill you at 170 mgs, yeah.
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:34.480]   (laughs)
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.040]   I'm just going to milligrams.
[01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:37.120]   - Oh, wow, look at that.
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.760]   - Terrible hydrates ree.
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:41.160]   - Oh, okay, I was like two tablespoons, nevermind.
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:42.760]   I was like, that's not that bad, actually.
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:44.680]   (laughs)
[01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:46.480]   - But this is queso?
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:49.120]   - No, it's not queso.
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:51.600]   - If it tastes decent, I'm bathing in it.
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:55.600]   - Karsten says it's really good.
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:56.960]   - Oh, Karsten's had it?
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:00.680]   - Yeah, he's freaking out over it right now.
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.600]   He's jumping up and down, he's, yeah, hands in the air.
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:06.520]   He says it's really good.
[01:45:06.520 --> 01:45:08.560]   - So here's another number.
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:10.600]   You'll remember that Facebook was paying
[01:45:10.600 --> 01:45:12.320]   immediate companies for Facebook Live
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.160]   when they thought that Live was gonna take over the world?
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:16.000]   Oh, nevermind. - Oh, I remember that, yeah.
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.360]   - So now Facebook has watched,
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.040]   which by the way, I can't seem to get to.
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:21.120]   Do you guys get watched?
[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:21.920]   Do you have watched?
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:23.760]   Do you see watch?
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:24.920]   - I have. - What?
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:27.080]   - Not logged into Facebook since December.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.040]   (whistles)
[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:34.360]   If I click on the video tab on Facebook,
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:38.240]   I get nothing but the videos I always got.
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:43.240]   Watch is going to promote episodic serial video shows.
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:44.360]   - Oh, this is their content.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.160]   - Yes, there is a content. - This is their content.
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:50.080]   So they're paying media companies to make shows.
[01:45:50.080 --> 01:45:51.560]   And when they did it before, they said,
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:53.640]   "Hey, we're just doing this temporarily
[01:45:53.640 --> 01:45:57.400]   "in lieu of the money we plan to make and share with you
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:59.600]   "when it comes time to monetize Live."
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:01.360]   Well, now, I don't know if they're saying that or not,
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:06.360]   but they're paying 10,000 to 25,000 per episode for shows.
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:10.240]   And the producers will also receive 55% of the ad revenue
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.760]   while Facebook takes the rest.
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:18.440]   And the shows can be anywhere from two to 240 minutes
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:21.480]   an episode, most are making them five to 10 minutes.
[01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:26.480]   And this is Facebook's effort to spawn loyalty in video
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:31.160]   to become habitual, to get you to subscribe to things,
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:33.000]   to get you to like things, right?
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.760]   So it's what YouTube did better socially
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:36.800]   in terms of video.
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:38.960]   Now the social company Facebook wants to do
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:40.280]   and this is what they're paying for,
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:42.000]   this is what they're expecting.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.040]   So that's my numbers.
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:47.360]   - And they're all getting into this like dumping crazy
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:49.160]   amounts of money for original content.
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:52.000]   I'm really curious to see how this plays out
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.440]   in the scope of like five years.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.280]   - I think it'd be really interesting.
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:56.360]   - There's so much money out of it right now.
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.280]   - I think we really, Leo would yell at me now,
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:00.200]   but he's not here, so what the heck?
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:03.000]   I think it would be interesting for the Twit Network
[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.960]   to make an episodic five or 10 minute show.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.000]   I mean, you've done them in the past.
[01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.680]   You've done these news shows and things like that.
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:12.160]   Why not make one of those things again,
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.840]   put it on Facebook, see what you make.
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:16.040]   - And who did you--
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:18.920]   - Like episodic like scripted content?
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:20.440]   - It doesn't have to be, but it has to be serial.
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:23.680]   It has to be that you're gonna come back time and time again.
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:26.360]   This is, you know, it's a podcast too.
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:27.600]   No reason it couldn't be that.
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.960]   It's just that, you know, people know Twig
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:32.040]   and they come back to Twig, it's we're episodic.
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:32.880]   We're serial.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.160]   - Okay, got it.
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:35.000]   - So like--
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.200]   - I could make a cooking show with gadgets.
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:39.560]   - There we go, I think that's what it has to be actually.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:40.960]   - It is. - I was thinking tech,
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:44.160]   the tech bachelor, but I'd have to do some thinking
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:46.280]   around that and figure out what that is.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:48.480]   - I don't think we should do that show.
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:49.320]   - Okay.
[01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:51.440]   (laughing)
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.560]   - That's my free advice to you.
[01:47:53.560 --> 01:47:55.520]   - Good, I'm happy you talked me down off the ledge.
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:56.360]   I appreciate it.
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:57.560]   - Speaking of which, Stacy, did you,
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:59.080]   was this discussed last week when I wasn't here
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:04.080]   the economist letter that Larry Page should have sent
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:07.080]   to the guy who wrote "The Memo" at Google?
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:09.520]   - Oh no, we didn't talk about that.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:11.040]   - Read it, I didn't read it.
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:11.880]   It's excellent.
[01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:13.000]   - No, I'm so--
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:13.840]   - I don't read it.
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:14.680]   - I'm so excited.
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:17.480]   - I know you're overbosed on it,
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:20.360]   but it says everything you wish someone had said to him.
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:22.240]   It's superb.
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:24.560]   - Yeah, okay. - There it is.
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:25.400]   - Yeah.
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:27.400]   - I haven't read through it, but I think--
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:30.960]   - I think we've, yeah, I'm a little exhausted.
[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:33.120]   - They have the same haircut.
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:34.440]   Is that true?
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:35.280]   - No.
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:37.160]   - Short.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:38.660]   - I know.
[01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:39.500]   - Both are short.
[01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.340]   - All right.
[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:41.520]   - What is gray, what is not?
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:42.480]   - Well, okay, yes.
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:43.480]   (laughing)
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:45.080]   Haircut, haircut.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:48.360]   - Mine's really quick here.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:52.560]   If you use Google inbox and you have multiple accounts,
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:55.880]   they added a new feature to Google inbox
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:59.560]   that allows you to combine all of your email accounts,
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:03.800]   all of your inboxes into one feed,
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:07.960]   which is as noisy as you could possibly expect it to be.
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:10.680]   When I go into mine, you can safely take mine.
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:11.520]   I'll show you.
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:15.160]   It's nothing but spam and everything from the folders
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:16.600]   that I never look at at all.
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:18.600]   So it would be nice to be able to come in here
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:20.920]   and do some, I mean, there's some legitimate stuff.
[01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:21.760]   Sambo, Boil, Sam--
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:23.640]   - This is inboxes from two accounts
[01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.480]   or inboxes within one account.
[01:49:25.480 --> 01:49:29.360]   This is, so this is all inboxes from any account
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:31.000]   that I'm signed, any of the all,
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.400]   or all of the accounts that I'm signed in inbox with.
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:34.240]   - Spooler accounts.
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:35.060]   - Yes.
[01:49:35.060 --> 01:49:38.440]   So I've got my work email, I've got my personal email,
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:41.520]   and all of the inboxes within both of those combined--
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:43.720]   - And you respond to one from your work email
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:46.680]   that will send back to work versus personal to personal.
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:47.520]   - I imagine.
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:48.800]   So yeah, when you tap through it,
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:52.960]   it's as if you tapped into it from that particular account.
[01:49:52.960 --> 01:49:55.520]   So if you like noise--
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:57.840]   - This isn't in Gmail, this is in inbox.
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:49:58.840]   - This is in inbox.
[01:49:58.840 --> 01:50:01.560]   - That's, okay, I was like, I've had this for a long time,
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.440]   and then I'm like, because it's inbox.
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:06.240]   - Right, yeah, this is a feature in Gmail for a while.
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:08.200]   Now you've got it in inbox.
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:10.560]   I would never use it personally,
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:13.040]   but apparently some people would.
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:14.600]   It just seems so noisy to me.
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:16.600]   Like, it would be nice to have controls
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:17.920]   and be able to say these are all the,
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:20.280]   'cause I would use it if I could personalize it a little bit
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.320]   and say, these are all the inboxes that I want to be shown
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:25.600]   just here, and that would be what I would use
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:26.480]   to manage my email.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:29.960]   But anyways, if that's your thing, there you go.
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:32.240]   The more you know, which could be the title today.
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:33.480]   I don't know, we'll have to figure that out.
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:34.880]   - No, no, it's gotta be a food thing.
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:35.960]   - It's gotta be a food thing.
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:36.800]   - Trouble with troubles.
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:38.240]   - Not a food thing, chat room.
[01:50:38.240 --> 01:50:40.640]   I know you'd only do this after the show,
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.560]   but I think we need a food thing to--
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:45.920]   - We have, the chat room will work on that.
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:48.680]   And as they do, I will say,
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:50.920]   we will begin our farewells.
[01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:52.360]   - We'll say, "Bod appa tea, everyone."
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:53.440]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:55.600]   We hope that you've enjoyed your entree.
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:56.880]   It's time for dessert.
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:01.400]   Jeff Jarvis, always fun doing podcasts with you.
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:03.920]   Thanks so much, BuzzMachine.com.
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:05.680]   What else do you want people to know right now?
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:06.920]   - That's enough.
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:07.920]   - That's it?
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:09.560]   That's it, BuzzMachine.com.
[01:51:09.560 --> 01:51:11.680]   - If you care about changing journalism,
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:13.920]   apply to the social journalism program at CUNY,
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:16.160]   it is truly groundbreaking.
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:18.880]   Everything that I say, so that's what I'll plug.
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:20.080]   I'm gonna write about that soon.
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:20.920]   - Right on.
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:22.000]   - Goo!
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.840]   Do I have to be an undergraduate?
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.160]   - No, it's graduate.
[01:51:25.160 --> 01:51:26.240]   Come.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.080]   Come.
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:28.200]   - But then I have to move to New York.
[01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:29.200]   - You will, hello.
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:30.200]   - Send a lot of money.
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:31.200]   - Send a lot of money.
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:32.040]   - Send a lot of money.
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:32.880]   - Send a lot of money.
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:33.720]   - Send a lot of money.
[01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:34.880]   - No big deal, Stacey.
[01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:37.720]   It's not a big deal to move to New York.
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:39.760]   It may seem intimidating, but don't worry about it.
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:40.960]   It'll be fine.
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:42.120]   Stacey, you can buy them,
[01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:43.840]   always fun to do a podcast with you.
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.680]   Thank you for doing this today.
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:46.520]   - Thank you.
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:47.360]   - What do you want people to do?
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:49.800]   - I was like, you're not gonna plug my IOT podcast?
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:52.480]   - Well, IOTpodcast.com, of course.
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:54.160]   What do you want people to know?
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:59.040]   - They're Stacey and IOT or I don't know.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:00.880]   - Or Gigastacey on Twitter.
[01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:03.000]   - You can find me lots of places,
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.400]   but only send nice things.
[01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:05.760]   - Yes, yes.
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:08.280]   Don't criticize my grammar or my saying, y'all.
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:09.360]   I've gotten a couple of those.
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:10.200]   I'm like, really?
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:11.040]   Y'all.
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:13.200]   (laughing)
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:15.280]   - If there's one thing we know about the internet,
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:18.080]   it's that everybody is grammar police.
[01:52:18.080 --> 01:52:19.640]   That's pretty much what I'll expect.
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:22.680]   - Yeah, and I'm Jason Howell, whatever.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:25.360]   I'm all over the network doing techniques today,
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.400]   doing all about Android,
[01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:28.320]   filling in on this week in Google from time to time.
[01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:31.200]   I think in a month, Leo,
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:32.640]   will be gone for a couple of weeks.
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:34.000]   So I'll be back.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.320]   I'll be back hanging out with you guys
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:37.080]   for a few more weeks.
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:38.120]   That's about a month from now.
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:40.240]   But if you want to check out this week in Google,
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:41.080]   you always can.

[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:47.240]   1 p.m. Pacific, probably more like 130, really.

[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.040]   - Yeah.

[01:53:07.200 --> 01:53:08.040]   Just don't worry about it.
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:09.880]   Or you could just go to Google and search for it.
[01:53:09.880 --> 01:53:10.720]   And you'll find it.

[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:19.120]   Thanks, Carsten.
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:21.400]   Thanks, Jammer Bee for helping out here in the studio.
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:22.200]   We've had a lot of fun.
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:23.880]   And we will see you next week
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:25.680]   where we talk more about Google
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:27.040]   and all sorts of things.
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:27.880]   We'll see you then.
[01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:28.720]   Bye.
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:31.300]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:31.300 --> 01:53:33.880]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:36.460]   (upbeat music)
[01:53:36.460 --> 01:53:38.540]   you
