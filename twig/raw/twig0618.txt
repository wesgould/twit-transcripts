[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google Stacey, Jeff and Ant are all here. We will debate whether Facebook is a monopoly or not.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.380]   The judge says, "You gotta prove it." We talk about, "Can you? Can you even prove it?"
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.000]   Amazon wants the chairman of the FCC to recuse herself because she doesn't like us.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.300]   And we'll talk about why you don't have to worry about those 700 million leaked in records.
[00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.200]   So, coming up next on Twig.

[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:07.200]   Stacey Higginbotham is here from Stacey on IOT.com. Her newsletters are fantastic.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.200]   Her events amazing. Don't forget her podcast with Kevin Tofel. It's the IOT podcast. Hello, Stacey.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   Is it 100 degrees where you are? What is the?
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   No, we're now back to 72. We're back to our normal temperatures.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   What was the highest you got to Stacey? I think it was 108.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   120 in Southern Canada. It was a...
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.200]   Yeah, Litten British Columbia got to almost 50 cents.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   Yeah. Terrifying. Terrifying.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   And you're not used to it because you're from Austin. This was nothing for you.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   Right? But oh man, y'all, it was horrible for my plants.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   It doesn't feel natural up here. I mean, like, look at the sky changes color.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.200]   I call it earthquake weather down here.
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   That's Jeff Jarvis. Hello, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   You know who he is, the Leonard Town Professor for journalistic innovation and at the Craig Newmark.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   Craig. Craig. Craig.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   Newmark. Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of Andy Murray.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.200]   Hello there, Jeff Jarvis. Andy Wannett. Andy Wannett.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.200]   Don't... Oh, spoiler alert. Some people are recording Wimbledon.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   Do you say Wimbledon or Wimbledon? Wimbledon. Wimbledon.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   You say it so quickly that no one knows. Well, that's how I do everything.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   Yes. No, you can tell. Just Wimbledon.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   Now, have you ever heard people say it with a T sound? But that's wrong.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   No, it's wrong. That's what I thought. I got corrected by all of Russ Berger and how I say...
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.200]   Edinburgh. Edinburgh. Were you saying Edinburgh?
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.200]   Edinburgh. Oh, say it Edinburgh. No, no, no. It's bra.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   It's lawful. And it's ant prut.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.200]   [laughter]
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   Who's going to go to... Nolens.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   Nolens. He's a Clem Fans.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   He's right.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.200]   From South Kackalaki. Hello. Hello.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   Hello, Mr. Courtney. You be there.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   Boy, there were so many big stories this week. It's kind of hard to know where to start,
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   but I think probably the district court judge who threw out the FTC lawsuit against Facebook
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.200]   along with 48 state attorneys general saying, "Wait a minute, guys.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   You didn't prove that Facebook is a monopoly." Now, I have to point out the judge...
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   The judge was a little salty. He said, "You act as if everyone accepts that Facebook is a monopoly,
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   but you have, in fact, not given me any evidence."
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   Well, that's so true about how the discussion is going these days.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.200]   Well, of course, we're in film bubbles. Of course, it's a monopoly. Of course this.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   And in a suit, you got to come up with the evidence.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   You have to prove it. They didn't do it.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   Well, good or bad news, depending on if you're Mark Zuckerberg or not,
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.200]   is that there are 30 days to refile, and the FTC could very likely,
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   and many experts say, within 30 days, provide that evidence to the judge.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   So the judge didn't really throw out the case. He just said, "You look, you got to give me something.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   Give me something. Help me out here. Give me something to work with."
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.200]   Basically, say, "Get your act together."
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   What, you know, Ben Thompson said, "Of course it's not a monopoly."
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:27.200]   What would you say... I guess you probably agree with Ben Thompson, Jeff.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   Yes, because I put that in the rundown, and you didn't... We've already gone over the before for the show, so yeah.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:37.200]   I agree with Ben, and you don't. And I aired Ben's opinion, and you generously are now area and opinion as well.
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.200]   Actually, you said... I'm sorry, not Ben Thompson. It's Benedict Evans.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   Well, also both.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   Actually, no, Aunt put in Ben Evans.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   Oh, okay. I put in Ben Evans.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   And Ben Tomp? Oh, I didn't erase them both, I guess.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.200]   So...
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.200]   (laughter)
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   That was who dared.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.200]   He was disagreeing with the case.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   So the monopoly would be in personal social networks, PSNs.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.200]   What is that?
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   Well, and I think it would be...
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.200]   Monopoly would mean that they had a dominant position, and I think you could say,
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.200]   "Well, what about Twitter and Discord and the news forums?"
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   What about us?
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   What about what we're doing right now?
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   Well, we're not a social network in that work.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   Oh, you want one of them?
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.200]   What is a social network?
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   Actually, what is a social network?
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.200]   What is a social network, actually? What is a social network?
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.200]   That's the thing.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.200]   You've got to define it if you're going to do it on one of your own.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   We don't even know what monopoly in it.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.200]   What a lot of...
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.200]   The takeaway for a lot of people was, "Oh, that's right, because our antitrust laws are out of date.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.200]   They were written in the 30s, and they need to be rewritten."
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:46.200]   In fact, one member of Congress said, "This is exactly why we have six antitrusts in front of us."
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   Well, let's go to that, how bad those are.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   But no, I think that they shouldn't be rewritten for the time.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   You should go for the principle.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.200]   But the question is, "Our antitrust, as opposed to Europe, is based on consumer harm."
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:04.200]   Now, if you want to change the nature of antitrust, then you do it for everybody,
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.200]   every company, every industry.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   And that's okay.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   You could do that.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.200]   But we shouldn't be directing this at one set of companies.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.200]   We should be talking about what we expect for fair competition and consumer benefit.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.200]   I think...
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   Let me pose this question to you all, not just you, Jeff, but to all of you.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:28.200]   The thing that I think Congress and the FTC are concerned about is the idea that Facebook,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.200]   when it saw a competitor coming along, would just acquire it.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.200]   So that's what they did with Instagram.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.200]   That's what they did with WhatsApp, it's what they tried to do with Snapchat.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:43.200]   And since failing that with Snapchat, they essentially duplicated the features of Snapchat
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   and Instagram, and thereby took away enough market share that Snapchat was no longer a threat.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.200]   So how about that?
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.200]   I mean, that's not currently...
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.200]   That's one of the laws, by the way, would specifically address that.
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   I gather that the Sherman Anti-Trust Act has no...
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   Well, the time you...
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.200]   ...generation of that idea?
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   What Thompson says is that when Instagram was bought, it was mocked because, "Oh, this is too small.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.200]   What are you doing?"
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   And now it's big and would it have been big on its own without Facebook or Facebook?
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   Make it big?
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.200]   These are part of the...
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.200]   It's hard to show that.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   ...because you can't really do.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.200]   Additionally, the FTC approved the merger.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.200]   So...
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.200]   Yes.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   It's not like they weren't given the chance to stop it in progress.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   In fact, that kind of underscores your first argument because the reason they approved it is,
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   well, hell, you just bought a little app with 27 people.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   Who cares?
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.200]   He could be a acquirer, yeah.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.200]   But what about that, Stacey?
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   Should companies be prohibited from acquiring competitors to stifle competition?
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.200]   Explicitly to stifle competition?
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   Well, they're not going to say mark didn't step up.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.200]   You know, we got to buy Instagram.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.200]   They're going to kill us.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   Although, actually, they should pay that.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.200]   There are smokey...
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.200]   There are smokey emails.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   So maybe that would be something that the FTC didn't know about.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.200]   That's a different route.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.200]   So, yeah.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.200]   Whether they say so or not.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.200]   So, if it's...
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   And this is visibly the case.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.200]   This is where I do think we need some updates.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   If not at the legal level, at the regulatory level.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.200]   So, in part of this is why I hate social networks.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   I don't think about them because I don't know enough about them.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   I don't like them.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.200]   I don't have a theory about them like I do about harder technology.
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   But like in, for example, when the FTC is evaluating like telecom mergers,
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   they have a set of standards that defines the monopoly.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.200]   The hyphen...
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.200]   It's the hyphen or something...
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.200]   I can never remember.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.200]   Anyway, they've got math.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.200]   They could do that.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   I don't know if they could establish those equations.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.200]   And in doing so, we would have a debate over how good those equations are
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.200]   and what we should measure and all of that.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   That would be one way to come about this and then be able to prove...
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   That's basically what I think the judge is asking the to do,
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   which is to define what the whatever social network is.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.200]   Well, market.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   What is your market?
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   Where...
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.200]   And then, you know, I do think we should think about the potential for consumer harms,
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.200]   even though that's hard when you're buying an app.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.200]   I don't think we have...
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.200]   So we should be defining the market, but then we should also be taking a very hard look
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   at what network effects can enable with regards to stifling competition.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:35.200]   And that's probably a separate process or should be.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:41.200]   And it should be individual of the big companies and should look at the entire market
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.200]   and what kind of advantages that has and brings.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   And we should figure out redresses to that harm that...
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.200]   If there's harm...
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   Could be applied horizontally.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.200]   There's definitely harm associated with network effects.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   But there's also benefit.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.200]   I mean, Leo, to go back to your question.
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   Well, and that's...
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.200]   There's a lot of companies.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.200]   But that's the point.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.200]   We've got to discuss like what harms are okay...
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   What are the trade-offs?
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.200]   Because we can't just say, well, this could be good or it could be bad.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.200]   I mean, that's kind of like saying technology is a tool and it's neutral.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   Yeah, it is.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.200]   But we as a society then have to come in and actually do something.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   Like, the government actually has to govern that.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   So that's what we need to be talking about.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   But on the other hand, too, we have the people that are governing this be up to snuff on
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   all of this technology.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   Yeah, well said.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   Educated on it.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:37.200]   You know, don't have someone that knows nothing about social media platforms trying to regulate
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   it because it makes no sense.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   They're not going to understand a lot of the nuance in it.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.200]   Leo, I want to go back to your question, too.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   Which is...
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.200]   Because there's talk about this.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.200]   For...forbid them for doing any M&A.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.200]   Well, what that puts a chill on...
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.200]   Yeah, that's by the way, that's the law proposed, which is the election requirement.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   Which is going on far.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   So, right, so look at...
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   But I think that's the reason that it's a response to the fact that it's hard...
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   It's so hard to demonstrate that they're doing it for any competitive reasons, right?
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   Well, but let's also look at the benefit to the acquired company.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.200]   Look at it like Tony Hale was scroll and Twitter, right?
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.200]   So he was struggling along to make it a go.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.200]   He's really smart.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   He was okay.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.680]   But being part of Twitter, the network effects now, led him build the alternative business
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:26.760]   model that he couldn't build independently as much as he can now.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:32.760]   And so it benefited the acquired as much as the acquirer and the market in turn, potentially,
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.760]   Tony's a very smart guy.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:35.880]   I believe he's going to do a good job of it, right?
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:40.280]   So if you then took away that market, then the VCs are going to say, "Well, I'm not going
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.200]   to invest a lot of startups because there's no exit now."
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   If they've taken away the major exit we have, SPACs are going to go away like cotton candy,
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.760]   IPOs are nowhere.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:56.840]   So you see a drying up of investment in innovation and entrepreneurship.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.200]   There's an unintended consequence that comes from this.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.480]   M&A is bad because Facebook did it.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.400]   And definitions are part of the difficulty here.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:15.840]   And so the law that is proposed, which is absurd, is no M&A because we can't decide
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:20.360]   if you're monopoly, we can't decide what your market is and we have no idea if this
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.360]   acquisition.
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.080]   You know, it's crazy because that's why we have the FTC.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.520]   And presumably that's one of the things the FTC and other regulatory bodies that have to
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.520]   approve these mergers.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.520]   But for John.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.520]   That's their job.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:40.480]   Well, and as we, I mean the digital era has basically flattened all distribution and some
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.120]   of the production capabilities of a variety of industries.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:52.400]   So everything from newspapers to book publishing, that's all information-based actually.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:58.000]   But what happens is, "Oh, where'd my point go?"
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Your point is well taken.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   The FTC is looking at Instagram.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   You got it anyway.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   I did get it.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Thank you.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.400]   I got to because this is flattened.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.560]   You normally you would say, "Well, they can't work that company because it's so big."
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:19.400]   But Instagram, a 37 person in application company that looks like nothing could in fact,
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:25.880]   and I think Mark Zuckerberg correctly reasoned be a huge threat to this multi-billion dollar
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.880]   operation.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.880]   That's your point.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.680]   And I agree with you.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.680]   That's what's different nowadays.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:35.040]   Well, and it's easy to enter into these new markets.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.000]   And then again, thanks to network effects, you can start controlling that.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.160]   Facebook knows that because they killed MySpace before they were very big.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.160]   In fact-
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.600]   Yeah, well, you can even see it in things like, I mean, we saw it back when Comcast bought
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.640]   NBC.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:57.640]   This was a big deal because again, the delivery of content is now flat and easy and who owns
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.720]   what matters.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:11.040]   And I would argue that if you look at something like AT&T buying Time Warner, HBO, well, yeah,
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.280]   that didn't go so well.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:20.000]   But when they did that, did you look at AT&T from the position of, well, they've got a
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.960]   physical pipe into X million homes that is not really geographically competitive, but
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.320]   it's competitive with cable in certain areas?
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:36.640]   I mean, or do you look at it like AT&T is going to own all of this content and do some self-dealing
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.080]   with their streaming deals?
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:44.480]   I mean, the types of questions that the regulators have to ask are you getting so much more complex
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.120]   and you have to be so much more forward-looking and you might even still get it wrong.
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:56.280]   They may bet on, you know, I don't know, you know, self-dealing with the content when,
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:02.400]   in fact, the real advantage was, I don't know, zero rating on bandwidth.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.400]   We just don't know.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.800]   It also goes to your, to your examples, it also goes to the competence of the acquirer,
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   right?
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:14.240]   What Comcast, in the hands of Comcast, a very smart company, these acquisitions had more
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.240]   impact on the market.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:20.480]   And the hands of Verizon and AT&T, not so much because they're idiots.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.360]   But the fact is they bought it to keep them from being a competition, whether they made
[00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:27.680]   it a success of it or made a failure of it.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:33.200]   The main goal happened, which is these companies never became a competitor to Facebook.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.960]   Ben Thompson pointed out in December and he was quite right that the FTC pleading was
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:42.920]   really, had twisted in order to prove a monopoly.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:48.120]   For instance, they said, well, LinkedIn is not a social network.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.840]   Strava, the exercise network is not a social network.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.960]   They really, I think improperly narrowed the definition of social network and all to the
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.040]   point of saying, well, look, see, Facebook does have 100% of this market, which is the
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.040]   only player.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.040]   Yes.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.880]   This is Ben Evans argument about Amazon as well.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.880]   What's the market?
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:08.880]   Is it bookstores?
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.680]   Is it all a retail?
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.520]   If it's all a retail, then it's not really a monopoly at all.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.520]   I'll stipulate that.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.520]   No.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:19.640]   But that goes back to my original question was, isn't there some interest though in society?
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.680]   I'm not going to say government because people say, oh, government has no interest in regulating
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.680]   anything.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.560]   So let's say society in the form of our government, but we won't have to mention that society
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:34.840]   has some interest in keeping these companies from doing things like acquiring little companies
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.400]   in order to put them out of business.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.720]   What about when you get a data monopoly?
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:45.760]   So think about the amount of information you know about consumers, about the people you
[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.160]   work with, about the companies that host on your platform.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.640]   Google knows all that.
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.640]   Google knows as much as Facebook.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.640]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:58.560]   I'm just trying to figure out how we can define what's a meaningful way to measure a market
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.600]   that is built on the internet.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.480]   This is the discussion to have rather than what the Congress has done is they leapt in
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.400]   and created eight really dumb laws and the FEC created a really bad suit.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.400]   By the way, is it five?
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.400]   Is it six?
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   Is it eight?
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   I don't know.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.920]   It seems to be going up over time.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   It was five.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920]   I think you're compromising.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.400]   I think it's six now and then there's reconciliation.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.680]   There's probably one in the Senate, one in the House and oh my God, it's a mess.
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.880]   All of this though is with I'm going to give them credit.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.640]   Maybe they don't deserve the honorable intent of trying to solve this.
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.640]   It's not easy.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.640]   No, it's a lot.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.800]   No, they're trying.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.640]   Okay, they're legitimately trying to have these conversations.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:43.680]   Also the discussions we see about these bills and the conversations that are actually happening
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.680]   about them.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.720]   So the public facing discussions are very different.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:57.040]   That's something that when you start covering Washington, you have to be aware of.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:02.000]   What we end up with, I have no idea, and it will probably be half crap, half good because
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.760]   that's how compromise works.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:14.640]   Meanwhile, Amazon is actually petitioning the FTC to have its new chair and the agency
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.640]   needed con.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.640]   Neat con.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:24.000]   Lena con, I'm sorry, recuse herself because when she was a professor, she wrote a.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.640]   She was constantly criticizing.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.640]   It wasn't just that.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.800]   Well, she wasn't constantly.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:32.480]   She was actually thinking about what we're trying to ask people to talk about.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:38.400]   She was actually trying to figure out how to think about monopolies for network effects
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.680]   and the types of companies that were emerging on the internet.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:48.160]   Yeah, she's criticizing Amazon because she's building her definition of this and in her
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.120]   definition, they were act.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:51.120]   They were a problem.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:53.320]   You can't blame Amazon for trying again.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.600]   Oh, no, I can't blame for trying.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.120]   I'm like, of course they're going to try this.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.040]   And if their lawyers didn't, you'd be like, what are you paying your monopoly?
[00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.040]   You're lying.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.040]   In her life is more Amazon rights.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:06.800]   Chair con has made numerous and highly detailed public pronouncements regarding Amazon, including
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.960]   on market definition, specific conduct, theories of harm, and the purpose effects and legality
[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.960]   of such contact.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.880]   Indeed, she has on numerous occasions argued that Amazon is guilty of antitrust violations
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.520]   and should be broken up.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.920]   These statements conveyed to any reasonable observer the clear impression that she has
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:31.160]   already made up her mind about many material facts relevant to Amazon's antitrust capability.
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.800]   She's publicly affirmed these conclusions, not only is a legal scholar, but as an advocate
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.440]   for an antitrust advocacy group.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.880]   And then as a lead author of a major congressional report, you know, they do have a point there.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.240]   She has made up her mind.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.560]   If you were a judge, she would have to refuse herself.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.720]   Now she's not a judge.
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.560]   She's an advocate.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:54.960]   If she had talked about this at a level of principle and an example, but she did attack
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:56.720]   Amazon and you're right Stacey.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:02.800]   She thinks it's an example of what shouldn't be, but it puts her in a position where eyes
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.800]   on you now.
[00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.560]   So how does she have the job?
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.120]   So she got the job.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.680]   So why is she got the job?
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.920]   But it does the FTC chairman.
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:17.560]   She sets the agenda, but ultimately all she can do is sue and you go to court.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:18.560]   Right.
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.560]   Right.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:25.280]   So she should be an advocate for the position by default of the law.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:30.240]   Well, this is where I get frustrated.
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.280]   She is taking a pro-consumer view.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.800]   Wouldn't you want the FTC chairman to do that?
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.800]   Yes.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   Well, that's my argument.
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.560]   I'm going to argue it's not a pro-consumer view.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.720]   It's an anti-consumer view.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.120]   Because what Amazon has done is reduced prices like crazy.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.160]   And other companies don't like that, but it's created a wonderfully competitive world
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.560]   where I can buy books that a lot cheaper.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.800]   No authors aren't crazy about that publishing houses aren't crazy about that, but it's really
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.200]   great for consumers.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.320]   More choice than ever, lower prices than ever.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.680]   How is that not pro-consumer?
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.800]   So consumers are getting hurt by false, false reviews.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.640]   They're getting Amazon as pressuring consumers are also producers.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.360]   You could say consumers are getting hurt because people who buy things also end up working
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.360]   for Amazon.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:20.080]   You could say the companies that work with Amazon also employ people.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.160]   There's also price dumping.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:27.800]   There's, I mean, there is a predatory behavior where companies reduce prices, making consumers
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.120]   happy, but with the long term--
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.040]   Did you see the Wall Street Journal story?
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.640]   No, what'd they say?
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.640]   Today in the Wall Street Journal, they reported out a story.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.640]   What?
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.760]   The warrants?
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.080]   No, this is-- yes, yes, the stock warrants, yes.
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:49.680]   Amazon basically saying that if you do business for certain companies, they're like, hey,
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:55.080]   if we're going to take shares in your company as part of our signing a deal with you.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.720]   Well, Stacey, this is a really good example, I think, because back in the day of startups,
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.920]   every landlord in San Francisco Silicon Valley would demand warrants of the startup there.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.240]   They wouldn't just demand the rent.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.240]   They would also demand warrants.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.240]   Yeah, but not every--
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.240]   And not every--
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.640]   I'm not-- I'm not-- let me just-- I'm not to agree with you, so give me a sec.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.320]   So that's a landlord who is in a position of some power.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:22.400]   Amazon is in a position of much greater power to demand the same thing and is that a misuse
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.840]   of power is an excellent discussion to have.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.400]   So you've agreed, Link.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.760]   OK, I was like, yes, it is important things to talk about.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.760]   Yeah, that is.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.760]   That's a good example of something to talk about.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.160]   I think about whether or not-- here's an activity of the company, is it a misuse of
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.520]   their power in the position that they have because they're so big?
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.520]   I'm all--
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:45.520]   So let me ask--
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.520]   I think that's right.
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.800]   So let me ask for this, because this gets into a big-- this is like a giant issue associated
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:57.080]   with writing legislation, period, which is, do you address the individual harms or do
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.480]   you try to establish a rule that works across a wider--
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.480]   The other pattern of behavior.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.280]   Or is it a matter?
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.680]   See, I don't think we can afford to do that because the government moves three to five
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.640]   years or even 12 years in the case of antitrust laws.
[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:22.520]   So that-- I think that's where we're running into the internet economy and the regulatory
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.040]   the pace of regulation.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.040]   And you can't have--
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:31.120]   The principles we just discussed, what we just discussed, those are eternal principles.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.800]   Those who are in the laws now, that's the definitions of misuse of power are there.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.520]   You could prosecute that now.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.200]   You don't need a new law for that.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.520]   The principles are there.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.240]   So no, I think you've got to start there.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.320]   And if there are things that you think Amazon or Facebook or Google are doing right, I've
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.360]   long said on the show where Google is vulnerable and the government's only now waking up to
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.360]   it.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.360]   So what we're going to do is--
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.360]   Darn, telephone monopoly.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.360]   Hey, Juntz is sponsored.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:06.360]   So yes, it's too bad you don't have AT&T because you wouldn't be getting a Junt calls.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.360]   We'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.360]   Yes.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.360]   Well played.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.360]   It's a joke.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.360]   I'm an AT&T customer.
[00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.360]   Just to be clear here.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.360]   Well, that wasn't your cell phone either.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.360]   No, it wasn't.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.360]   Anyway.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:23.360]   The principles are there.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:29.960]   And I think that what I was going to say was Google has been vulnerable for years on
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.320]   its advertising behavior.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.160]   It's not about search monopoly.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.160]   That's laughable.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   That's ridiculous.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.920]   But it ties in, doesn't it?
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920]   I mean--
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.920]   It's part of the monopoly.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.640]   The monopoly they have in search gives them a leg up in advertising.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:49.040]   Well, but so does-- so plenty of other monopolies and other oligologies in advertising too.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.960]   The issue there searches not the issues because Google's so much more than a search company
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.960]   now.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.600]   It also uses advertising in mobile in all these other ways.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:03.240]   The advertising behavior and the concentration of its power there is where it's more vulnerable.
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.920]   And they're only kind of now waking up to that.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.360]   And they didn't need new laws to deal with that.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.080]   They could have dealt with that 10 years ago.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:17.200]   I do agree with Stacey, though, that because the world has changed, technology has changed
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:23.400]   so many things, especially-- I like your analogy of the flat economic hierarchy.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:31.240]   I don't know if the Sherman A. Trust Act, written in 1933, can really encompass that.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:38.360]   I don't think it's wrong for Congress to try to not completely replace it wholesale,
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.600]   but to try to polish it up and make it more applicable.
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.520]   Do you think that the law that Sherman A. Trust Act is sufficient?
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:53.560]   Generally, yes, but I think where I'm disagreeing here is that if you're going to attack a
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:59.100]   change, fine, but attack it at a universal level so that it pertains to banking and it
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:03.720]   pertains to retail and it pertains to other industries to say we're going to create a
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.880]   law just after one company is not how we do things in this country.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:13.000]   The same way we wouldn't go after-- I'll create a law to go after just one person.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.200]   You don't think these laws are targeting a tech?
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.200]   Two companies.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.200]   Two companies.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.200]   Not even tech, just two companies.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.360]   Two companies, yeah.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.680]   And look at Australia, in that case, they-- well, in fact, I had this discussion.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.720]   I had this exact discussion with the people who wrote Malinowski's 230 law.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:37.720]   I talked to the legislative aides and I talked to Malinowski about this, who's my representative.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.720]   They wrote it in such a way.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.280]   I said, well, watch out, guys.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.360]   The way you wrote this, trying to come up with a definition that would only include
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.320]   those two, you actually ended up including newspapers.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.480]   And they're not going to be-- because you basically said anybody uses algorithm as to
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   rank things.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.480]   Uh-oh, and it's of a certain size.
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:56.360]   I said, well, the size you picked is the size of the newspaper company headquartered
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.360]   near stake.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.880]   You don't want to rethink that, guys.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:01.880]   Right?
[00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:02.880]   So they tried--
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.640]   Kind of like the Florida law that goes after social networks that don't own amusement
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.640]   parks.
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   That was just hilarious.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.520]   That was pretty blatant.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:16.560]   I put up-- there was a great-- I don't know if you saw there were two people.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.080]   Mike Masnick did a brief threat on that.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.320]   There was a much larger one from Ericone.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.320]   It was just brilliant, covering the hearing.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.920]   And the judge was just non-plus with Florida.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.200]   It was hilarious.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.920]   And the Disney thing came up.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.920]   And yeah.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:39.440]   We should point out that those bills are going through markup right now.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.480]   And Zollofgren and others have pointed out there are all sorts of issues, and they're
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:44.960]   trying to adjust those.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:50.040]   So I don't think the bills, as written, are anything near the bills that will end up getting
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.240]   voted on.
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.280]   And then, of course, there's a Senate version, and there's reconciliation.
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.120]   So we're a long way off.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.200]   And I think it's a good starting point.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   But I agree with you.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:00.200]   It's not the final--
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.200]   Yeah, we should be talking about it.
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.120]   We'll see how fast it goes.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.080]   I mean, the other thing is, Congress should not be taking so many freaking breaks.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.840]   They should actually sit down and fix this.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.840]   Well--
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:11.840]   But that's just me.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:16.400]   Don't forget, they're the saucer that cools the hot tea kettle or something.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:17.400]   I do.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.400]   I'm so--
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.400]   I'm so--
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.400]   You know, people--
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.400]   Look.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.400]   Well, they've--
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.520]   The Senate is the saucer that cools the cup.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.920]   The cup, the boiling water, is the House of Representatives.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:37.560]   And the president is-- in this analogy, is he the T. cozy?
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:39.560]   I think he might be.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.560]   So let's take a look at the whole team.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.560]   Turn yourself around.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:45.320]   It's an old-- I think it comes to the federalist papers.
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.320]   It's an old analogy.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.320]   OK, I'm just like sitting here.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.320]   Is this the teapot dome scandal?
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.320]   Oh, weird.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.320]   Yeah, I'm like, what is this coming from?
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.320]   The saucer that cools the tea.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.720]   Let me see where this-- the history of this.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:02.720]   Holy Wilson.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.720]   Was it in Hamilton?
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.720]   It was in Hamilton.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.720]   It was in Hamilton.
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.720]   It wasn't in Hamilton.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.720]   It was in Hamilton.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:08.720]   It was in Hamilton.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.720]   It was not going to get it.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:18.920]   You know, back when old George told Tom, he said the framers created the Senate to cool
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:20.220]   house legislation.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:24.960]   Just as a saucer was used to cool hot tea.
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.560]   I remember those days.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.560]   They created the Senate to make the southern states happy, but that's another--
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.720]   Yeah, well.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.040]   There's a tradition that Thomas Jefferson coming home from France--
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.960]   There's your critical race theory.
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:43.280]   --called George Washington to account at the breakfast table for having agreed to a second
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.920]   and as Jefferson thought unnecessary legislative chamber.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:53.640]   Why asked Washington, did you just now pour that coffee into your saucer before drinking?
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.240]   Was that a thing people did?
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.240]   In the original-- let's see.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.640]   You got me started, Leo.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.560]   In the 17th, 18th century and 17th century coffee houses, that is how they bought their
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.560]   coffee.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.480]   They poured it into a saucer and drank from the saucer.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   Wow.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.480]   Makes no sense, but that's what they did.
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.480]   Jefferson said to cool it.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.480]   Not to glad I'm here for that.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.480]   George E.
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.480]   That's a good answer.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.480]   George E.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:15.360]   My throat is not made of brass.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.640]   Even so said Washington through his solid cherry wood tea.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.200]   My teeth are made of wood.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:26.280]   We pour our legislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.760]   And there is your bicentennial minute.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.120]   Visit your local public library, kids.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:36.680]   We're going to take a little break, come back with more Stacy and Jeff.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:41.160]   Lots more to talk about, but first of all, do you like my shirt?
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.320]   Of course I do.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.360]   I'm forbading whether to keep it buttoned or unbuttoned.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:47.360]   No, no, no, no.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:48.360]   Really?
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.920]   I don't want to see the undershirt.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.920]   Well, I know.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.920]   As long as I never see your undershirt.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.920]   I don't want to see the interchange.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:53.920]   I don't want to see the interchange.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.920]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:55.920]   It's funny because...
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.920]   It's demirror.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:57.920]   It's not a V.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.920]   It's funny.
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.560]   I've had people...
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.960]   X-wives, let's be honest, unbuttoned it.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.960]   Saying, "No, no, no.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:10.240]   You look so uptight when your top button is buttoned."
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.920]   I think wearing, just wearing this beautiful untuck at linen shirt is really pretty casual
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   enough.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.440]   We can debate whether to button the second button or not.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.680]   I do say, "I will a verr that I have not tucked it in.
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.600]   Untuck at shirts are designed not to be tucked in."
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.280]   And that is something everybody agrees.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.320]   It looks a little uptight when you tuck your shirt into your pants.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:39.680]   Untuck at shirts are ready to help you make that transition back to the office, back to
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:44.720]   dinner with friends, back to reuniting with family, especially back to vacations.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.920]   I have stocked up on untuck at linen shirts.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:51.000]   I love linen, especially for hot weather, because we're going to Hawaii in a couple
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   of weeks.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.840]   And I have a whole host of these beautiful untuck at shirts.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.640]   Untuck at shirts are all designed to be worn untucked.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.680]   Although you could tuck them in.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.120]   It's not like you couldn't.
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.120]   You could if you really had to.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.200]   But they designed them.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.760]   It's a tough style to get right.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.360]   It's just the right length.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.280]   It hits your belt line right at mid zipper, which is...
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.280]   So it's not too long.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.360]   You don't look like you're wearing a MooMoo.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.880]   And it's not too short.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.880]   It's just right.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:23.240]   It fits all shapes and sizes, helps you look sharp even when you're looking casual.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.040]   And there are all kinds of untuck at shirts.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.480]   In fact, I want you to visit the website untuckets.com.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.640]   They've got performance shirts at Wix Sweat.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.640]   I have those.
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:32.640]   They have short sleeve button downs.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:33.640]   I have those.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.960]   They have polos.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.960]   I have those.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.040]   They're all made to beat the heat.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:44.720]   They also have office shirts, button downs, hand lace, polos, tees, all the shirts in all
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.120]   the shapes and sizes, including up to triple XL.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.000]   We call that programmer size.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.960]   They also have slim relaxed and tall fits.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:57.880]   Jason Howell, who's very tall, his untuck it fits beautifully even though he's what?
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.880]   6'9".
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:00.160]   There's always something.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.160]   How about you, Aunt?
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:04.640]   Do your untuckets fit your massive biceps?
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.640]   I think so.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.640]   Oh, he's gone.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.600]   He's gone to where his go get his untuck it on.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.600]   What can I ask you?
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.600]   I tell you, they've qualities.
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.600]   He did show us.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.600]   He did show us.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.200]   No, he has a bunch of them too.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.160]   Of course, everything fits beautifully on Aunt.
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.160]   He makes it.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.160]   He makes it.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.600]   He's a model after all.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:26.720]   I think he just went to go do some bench presses actually.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.640]   And tuck it tests every batch of fabric.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:30.920]   They want the best possible quality and consistency.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:35.640]   They're really quality, absolute quality nuts.
[00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.680]   All of their button downs, their polos, their tees, their hand lace have just the right
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:39.680]   length.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:40.680]   They fit perfectly.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.960]   They actually test the colors on the shirt.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:49.160]   All shirts are checked five times to ensure they retain shape, color, strength, the highest
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:50.840]   quality standards in the industry.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.520]   And I noticed that, by the way, when I order online, I'll really notice if the quality
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:01.080]   isn't there, I can tell you right now, I have maybe a dozen untucket shirts and they're all
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:03.040]   perfect.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.040]   Every bit, just wonderful.
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.080]   If you're ready to go back to the office, Aunt Tuckett has you covered there as well.
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:12.160]   They have wrinkle, wrinkle free collection, which I love.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:15.920]   I just throw them in the wash, hang them up after I drive them about halfway.
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:20.240]   So well, I still damp hang them up and they look like they've just come back from the cleaners.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.880]   Whether you prefer short or long sleeves, you're going to get ready to get back to work.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.080]   85 stores nationwide.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.880]   If you want to check it out, they offer free returns and exchanges.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.520]   So there's no reason not to try them online.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.320]   Actually, I'm after COVID now.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.280]   I'm totally hooked on buying everything online because I'm just so used to it.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:44.160]   If it doesn't fit, pack it up, send it back, order the next size up, next size down.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.240]   It's easy.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:47.480]   Summer is right around the corner.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.440]   Actually, I think it's here officially.
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:53.640]   Now's the time to try out an untucket shirt that's just right for you.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:59.360]   If this isn't summer, then the Pacific Northwest has some questions to ask.

[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:23.640]   Look for, if you see somebody wearing a great shirt, look for the little, can you see that
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:28.880]   little corner tab on the bottom of the shirt?
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.320]   That's the untucket sign.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:31.920]   That's just subtle.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:38.840]   You know, when you see it, you go, yeah, yeah, untuckett.com offer code TWIT for 20% off.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:44.400]   Thank you, untuckett for getting me ready for Hawaii, forgetting our staff and our family

[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.880]   Untuckett.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.880]   Did you know there was a ceasefire between Google and Microsoft?
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.600]   I think we remember this, but yes.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.920]   Well, who could forget the Microsoft ads?
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.360]   Let me see if I can find one.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.520]   There was the Gmail man.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.520]   Remember?
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.520]   Do you remember those ads?
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.520]   Let me see if I can find.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:09.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.520]   It's so awful.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.360]   I didn't know there was such a battle.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.080]   Well, I think this is Microsoft's been firing a good group.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:25.200]   I think this is why the truth started when Satya Nadella and Sundar Pachai became CEOs.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.200]   Here you go.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:31.080]   This is from 2011 before the, before the truce.
[00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.040]   The following scene represents, wait a minute, this might not be.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.040]   Did you do your taut sound?
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.720]   Uh, oh yeah, hold on a second.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.720]   Hold on.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:41.160]   This is, I might get the official one.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.560]   This is not official.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:48.080]   This is somebody's somebody, you know, it may be that actually Google has pulled it down
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:49.560]   because they're so embarrassed about it.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.560]   Let me see if I can find the official one.
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:38:00.720]   Uh, Paul Farat, a host of Windows Weekly, loved these and said, um, Microsoft should
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:01.960]   do a lot more of these.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.640]   I was on the other hand a little.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.480]   Let's see.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.800]   It's on Microsoft's, I bet you Microsoft has taken it down.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   Yeah, they have.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   All right.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.120]   We're going to have to look at an unofficial version because Microsoft doesn't want you
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.520]   to remember the Gmail.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.520]   Learn.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.960]   Now up next what Microsoft doesn't want you to.
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.960]   Yes.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.120]   I like that.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:31.880]   The following scene represents the opposite experience of Office 365 says Microsoft.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.280]   Everywhere and nowhere at the same time.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:42.280]   He thinks that every subject in unreal time, probing every sentence and all your punctuation.
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.320]   God has nose in every colon in every situation.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.560]   He's the mailman.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.200]   Not his nose in every colon and every situation.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.200]   Watch, watch.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.200]   No, don't take it away.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.960]   Zucchini, volcano, lava.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.200]   That wasn't real.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   Why?
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.200]   That was a little.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   Mark.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.200]   No, no.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.200]   Are you looking at?
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:04.200]   This is a Microsoft video.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   I'm looking at everyone's mail.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.200]   How can you do that?
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.040]   Oh, man.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:14.640]   Sometimes when a person really loves your Gmail very, very much, the two get together.
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:19.640]   And that is porn.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:25.840]   I know it feels like a parody, doesn't it?
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:26.840]   Gmail, man.
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:27.840]   The giant space.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.840]   That was porn.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.840]   What year was this?
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.840]   Not 2011, not so long ago.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.840]   Good morning, senators and receivers.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:32.840]   10 years ago.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:38.080]   Carolyn Johnson, get up off of that painful itching and burning of yours.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.080]   Come check this out.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:46.080]   No, have you ever saw this?
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:52.280]   No, just skimming for certain keywords.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.600]   Shortly after this campaign, Google did in fact an app they were no longer going to go
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   through your mail for key orders.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.920]   But they were doing this at the time.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:03.520]   But they were also very transparent about it.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.520]   Right.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:08.280]   And in fact, I pointed out when Paul was crowing about these.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.280]   Well, actually I wouldn't.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.440]   Because I was actually writing.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.840]   I pointed out that, well, let me ask you something Paul.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.480]   Does Outlook's eliminate spam?
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.480]   He said, yeah.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.680]   He said, well, how do you think they do that?
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.880]   By reading your mail.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.680]   The only difference is Google was using it for ad keywords.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.840]   Yeah, that was the added.
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.480]   But it's not that Microsoft or anybody else doesn't read your mail.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.480]   It's machines.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.320]   That's the debate we should be having.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.600]   We should be building laws about the situations we want to use this stuff in.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:42.160]   So how it's used is it okay to use facial recognition for tracking?
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:47.160]   Well, this is an example of why laws should be written a principle not technology.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:52.440]   You have a right to privacy only in your first class delivered physical mail.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.040]   Not in your communications when it gets to government here.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:59.520]   Because they wrote it to that specific technology of the mail not anticipating other messaging
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.520]   mechanisms.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.800]   Well, in the mail is a government service.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:07.560]   That was the other thing that was worth noting when we started writing federal laws.
[00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.800]   Because against reading your mail, even if it was a postcard.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   Which is what?
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   And there's no, no, no, no, still cards are a result.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.640]   Oh, you could read.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.640]   They could read your postcard.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:16.800]   They had to because they had to.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   They had to.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.600]   But if it's in an envelope, they can't look in the envelope, right?
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.640]   That's illegal without a warrant without a warrant.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:31.360]   So apparently for the last five years, ever since Satya Nadella became CEO and Sundar
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:37.520]   Pichai became CEO, there was a non-aggression pact, a truce between Microsoft and Google
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:43.760]   in which they agreed not to aim their substantial lobbying firepower against each other.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.760]   This is a question.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.600]   Microsoft never paid attention to that at all.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.320]   This is a great, well, this is a great in a Bloomberg.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:57.760]   That truce, that old non-aggression pact, if you like Soviet era language forged at the
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.880]   time by two new CEOs wanting a fresh start in a formerly acrimonious relationship, had
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.960]   already been fraying before it lapsed in April.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.600]   Isn't this antitrust?
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.960]   Well you can't agree not to close each other's employees.
[00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:14.960]   We know that.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.960]   It's not collusion.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.120]   I mean, to agree not to sue each other isn't collusion.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.760]   No, no, but to agree not to criticize each other?
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:21.760]   I don't know.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.760]   That's an interesting question.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:23.760]   I won't criticize you if you don't criticize me.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.560]   That's a questionable thing I would say.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:29.960]   I was surprised to learn that you can't agree with another company, not to impl...
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.880]   Well, you can't agree with another company not to poach employees.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:36.280]   Apple made an agreement with a number of other Silicon Valley companies.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:40.480]   Steve Jobs wrote emails saying, "Hey, look, we won't try to get your employees if you
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.400]   would stop headhunting ours."
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:46.040]   And that in fact is illegal under this.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.760]   Well, that because it's a harm for the employees.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.760]   Right.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:50.760]   I mean, that creates an actual...
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:51.760]   Yeah, who's the harm here?
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.760]   The documentable harm.
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:53.760]   Yeah, who gets the harm here?
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.760]   So let's figure out the harm for...
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.760]   No, everybody...
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.560]   Well, you have two giant companies.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.560]   Lobbyists.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:05.880]   Two giant companies who hold on to their piece and for somebody else to come in and compete
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:07.480]   with them, they can't break through the wall.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:11.080]   Whereas if Microsoft's criticizing Google for something, then I have a company to answer
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.080]   that.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.080]   That's a good point.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:17.280]   You know, then I can join in with Microsoft and on their slipstream.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:22.080]   Professor Jarvis, I will allow your suit.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.080]   I'm Judge Leah.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.720]   Yes, you are.
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:30.080]   You know how much Judge Judy makes every single year?
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.080]   Made?
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.080]   She's not tired.
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.080]   A lot.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.080]   I think sure it...
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.080]   Yeah, I was like...
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.080]   She's retired because she could.
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.160]   She's retired on her 50 foot yacht, probably.
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:40.160]   She was making...
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.560]   Wait a minute.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.320]   I'm going to make sure this is right.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.320]   47...
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.320]   It was like...
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.320]   I...
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:51.600]   With $47 million a year, according to a journal I respect highly called Entertainment Weekly.
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.080]   How was this related to Google?
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.080]   By the way.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.080]   Because I'm Judge Leah.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.080]   I'm going to google that information.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:00.360]   I thought it was interesting.
[00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:06.200]   Anyway, the first signs of strain between the two companies, according to Bloomberg,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:11.400]   Dina Bass and Niko Grant, appeared more than two years ago when Microsoft protested to
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:17.080]   Google that its search ads 360 wasn't keeping up with new features and ad types in Microsoft's
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.400]   search engine Bing.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:23.840]   In other words, they were favoring Google's spots.
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.920]   Microsoft was testifying against Google.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.040]   Microsoft was doing ads against Google.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:30.880]   They can't remember trade organizations against Google.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.080]   They went against Google in Australia.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.080]   There was no truce.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.080]   That's BS.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.080]   No more truce.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.000]   Well, they weren't lobbying against each other.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.760]   I guess it was a sort of a truce.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.760]   And I thought Microsoft...
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:43.760]   Well, they were.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:46.520]   They weren't going to lobby for a while.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:51.160]   Like recently, like last year, or is that not a thing that's happening anymore?
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.360]   They've been doing it the whole time.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.520]   Especially in Europe, but they've been doing it the whole time.
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:03.120]   And of course, Brad Smith, Microsoft president Brad Smith has been going to Congress saying,
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:07.000]   "Why aren't you investigating us?
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.080]   But why aren't you investigating Google?"
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.760]   All right.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.080]   Anyway, the truce is over.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:21.040]   So get ready for the Gmailman to come back.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.840]   LinkedIn hacked once again.
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:23.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:30.200]   700 million LinkedIn records are for sale on a hacker form as of yesterday.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:34.720]   I'm sorry, June 22nd, sorry, a week ago.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:35.720]   What's in them?
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.760]   That's the thing that's a little scary.
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.440]   Things like imputed salary.
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:47.000]   I don't know why LinkedIn does that, but there's a lot of information in there.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.760]   Public and private profile information.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:50.760]   Oh.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.600]   What are you...
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:54.880]   What do people have in their private linked?
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.480]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.480]   Well...
[00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:03.000]   Is it things like the people who are looking at other people?
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   I remember seeing a lot of phone numbers and just personal contact information being
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.880]   readily available for people.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:11.080]   LinkedIn, by the way, is denying this.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:15.560]   Yesterday, they released a statement saying, "We want to be clear this is not a data breach
[00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:19.320]   and no private member data was exposed."
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:20.320]   The data leak was...
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:25.080]   LinkedIn says, "An aggregation of data from a number of websites and companies as well
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.960]   as the publicly viewable member profile data."
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:30.800]   Of course, there's been court cases over whether you can scrape LinkedIn.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.360]   They can scrape like that.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.360]   And by the way, LinkedIn has lost, most recently lost that.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:42.760]   It is legal to scrape LinkedIn, but they say, "Not technically a breach."
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   So okay.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.760]   Anyway.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   Right.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.160]   Not a breach.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.160]   You're right.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.480]   But in the same way, you can't complain that somebody knows it.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.440]   That's going to be good.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:59.320]   Although let me say the lawsuits around...
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.640]   Oh, go on.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:04.700]   No, I was just saying that goes back to my argument about journalism today.
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.460]   Everything is considered hack and stuff like that once.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:08.460]   Right.
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:09.300]   Not really a hack.
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:10.820]   No, that's exactly right.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.660]   No someone actually just left the door open and said, "Walk in."
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:14.660]   Yeah.
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:17.200]   How's your blood pressure right now, Jeff?
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:19.100]   Is it settled down a little bit?
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:20.100]   No.
[00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.100]   Okay.
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.100]   No.
[00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:24.580]   Do you want to watch some more tennis for a minute so that...
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:25.980]   That'll make me happy, or you'll...
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.700]   I don't want to kill you or anything.
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:37.140]   "17 researchers across disciplines from biology to philosophy published a paper in the prestigious
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:43.660]   or inter-recode prestigious penis earlier this month.
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.660]   What is penis?
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:45.660]   It's not bad.
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:58.020]   Besides a bad hack, I'm asking you all, but you just don't know.
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:02.220]   It is the proceedings of the National Academy of Sinuses.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.220]   Sinuses.
[00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:04.220]   Sinuses.
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:05.220]   Sinuses.
[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:08.220]   How do you say that?
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.220]   Sinuses.
[00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.220]   Sinuses.
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:11.220]   Sinuses.
[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:12.220]   Yes.
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:19.740]   Anyway, according to a bunch of SNOCs, according to this...
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:23.900]   I never realized what a terrible acronym that is.
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:31.540]   According to these researchers, that we should treat the study of technology's large-scale
[00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:35.300]   impact on society as a crisis discipline.
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:39.060]   In other words, a field in which scientists across different fields work quickly to address
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:48.820]   an urgent societal problem like global warming or endangered species are lack...
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:49.820]   I think this is...
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.180]   I don't find this hard to accept.
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.220]   Our lack of understanding about the collective...
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.540]   No, of course not.
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:56.540]   It's in penis.
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.700]   And Jeff has not finished either.
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.780]   I haven't finished, but at least I started.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:01.780]   Collectively.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:05.620]   I got to the point where I just said I can't do this right now.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.260]   My blood pressure is too high.
[00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:11.340]   That's why I asked.
[00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:18.020]   The issue is we don't really understand the collective behavioral effects of new technology,
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:24.460]   and they submit that it might be a danger to democracy and to scientific progress.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:31.200]   For instance, they use as an example the coronavirus pandemic and the epidemic or infodemic of
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:35.740]   misinformation that has hindered widespread acceptance of masks and basins.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:38.860]   I don't know if that's because of technology or social networks.
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:42.100]   It might be because of our political environment more.
[00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.660]   Which has been exacerbated.
[00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:47.300]   The polarization of our political environment has been exacerbated by our social networks.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.300]   Well, that's true.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.580]   You have to do this folks, but you go back.
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:53.260]   It was a lot worse in the early days of media.
[00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:56.580]   It was tons worse.
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:02.140]   The authors warn if left misunderstood and unchecked we could see unintended consequences.
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.620]   I've been arguing this.
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.620]   I don't think that's...
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:08.380]   I mean, Jeff, do you throw that?
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.940]   It's not controversial.
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.300]   I don't feel like it's controversial unless you're Jeff.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:17.540]   I feel like Jeff, you've got to meet your reaction that happens to these.
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:18.540]   I think we have a show title.
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.540]   I do want to hear your opinion.
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.980]   See, this is where you...
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:27.140]   You say let's have a discussion and then this is how you have a discussion.
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:33.580]   No, Jeff, let me ask you, in all seriousness, is it your position that there is...
[00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:37.820]   That we understand the behavioral impact of technology and social networks and that there
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:38.820]   is no concern.
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:39.820]   You're going to hate me for the last number.
[00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:40.820]   Answer this.
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:41.820]   No, I'm not going to hate you.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:42.820]   I'm asking you within all sincerity.
[00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:44.580]   We didn't understand the impact of print.
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.220]   We ended up with a 30 years war and a reformation.
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:48.220]   Some good, some bad.
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:49.220]   Yes, true.
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.220]   We figured it out in the long run.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:51.220]   Same thing.
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.540]   Here, I just wrote a book about just this.
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:57.900]   So they argue in this paper, a quote from the paper, "Neither the evolutionary nor the
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.900]   technological changes to our social systems have come about with the express purpose of
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:05.100]   promoting global sustainability or quality of life."
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:10.780]   No, Twitter started and I think still runs with an effort to improve the quality of life.
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:16.620]   And they're not arguing that it should.
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:22.060]   Facebook says, now we can say that they do a really rotten job of it and that's a perfectly
[00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:26.020]   fine argument, but they believe and I believe they believe when they started that a connected
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:27.420]   world was a better world.
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:30.660]   Google starts with the effort to make the world's information accessible.
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:33.820]   I return to my argument about the pandemic.
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.300]   I return to my arguments about Black Lives Matter.
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:38.540]   I return to the arguments about the good that comes.
[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:43.180]   This thing is filled with leaps that require wormholes to get through.
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:44.180]   Now I'm done.
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:45.180]   Okay.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.460]   So they're not arguing that this is bad.
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:52.120]   What they're arguing is we don't understand the effects of what they call expanding the
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:56.380]   scale of a collectively behaving system by eight orders of magnitude.
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:00.820]   And they're saying that we need to look at that and they're calling it a crisis because
[00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.780]   things are happening faster.
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.660]   They're happening globally.
[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:10.620]   And the impact is affecting far more people at a macro level than the introduction of print,
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:18.140]   which I like your parallel actually because it led to many changes in society, but it
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:24.220]   led to those changes over a longer timeframe and it affected people.
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:25.220]   Yeah, Jeff.
[00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:33.380]   Jeff, I mean, we have seen documented changes in how the people we've elected, how we do
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:36.540]   that, how we talk about building laws.
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:41.820]   I would even say how we public health is perceived.
[00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:48.620]   All of these changes are happening and they're happening at a level like people, not everybody
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.300]   knew how to read, right?
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:56.860]   But now more people have access to this than people had access to print.
[00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:02.660]   So it's a much faster distribution of this type of behavior is what that's all this papers
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:03.660]   arguing.
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.220]   It's not saying it's necessarily bad or good.
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:08.700]   It's saying, we should probably study this and we should probably study it real fast because
[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:09.700]   I agree with studying.
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:10.860]   I agree with studying fast.
[00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:11.860]   I agree with all that.
[00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:16.260]   But no, the way this is work, they just said in here that none of these changes were kind
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:18.660]   were aimed at improving quality of life.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:21.460]   That's the kind of prejudice that's in here that starts us off and out.
[00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:23.420]   What about this sense?
[00:53:23.420 --> 00:53:24.420]   What about this sense?
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:29.480]   Political communication research, people like Joan Donovan in particular has long described
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:36.740]   how alterations of network communications technology appear to impact social movements,
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:39.540]   institutional politics and political participation.
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:40.980]   You would disagree with that, right?
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:44.580]   Well, I would point out that the penny pressed to the exact same thing.
[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:45.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:46.580]   No, no.
[00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:50.380]   They negatively, they just say alterations, it impacts it.
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:55.980]   A consolidated transdisciplinary approach to understanding and managing human collective
[00:53:55.980 --> 00:54:01.460]   behavior will be a monumental challenge yet is a necessary one given that algorithms
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:07.380]   and companies are already altering our global patterns of behavior for financial reasons.
[00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:08.380]   Like media.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:09.380]   You can't deny that.
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:10.820]   Yeah, but you can't deny that.
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:17.540]   Your motivations in other words, should we have stopped as newspapers wanted to do to
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:18.540]   radio?
[00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:19.540]   Should we have stopped radio?
[00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:20.540]   I don't think they're saying stop it.
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:22.540]   I don't think they're saying stop it.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:25.340]   They're presenting as a danger.
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:29.700]   This could have been, I've agreed with the need, I just said to study and then I hope
[00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.020]   we can end the bait Jeff segment.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:35.620]   I'm agreeing that we need to study and we need to study quickly.
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:36.620]   Absolutely.
[00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:37.620]   I couldn't agree more.
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.060]   We need to invent better systems.
[00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:40.060]   Absolutely.
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:43.740]   But again, it's the way that it's presented and then the way it gets presented in turn
[00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:52.860]   and the story is what worries me because then it feeds into bad legislation like we're
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:56.660]   seeing in Florida, Sicily and about 230 and that's my concern.
[00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:57.660]   It's always my concern.
[00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:59.980]   It's the same thing I've said a million times.
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.860]   I think our bad legislation is-
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:02.860]   I think our bad legislation is-
[00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:09.300]   I was just going to say, I think our bad legislation is more a function of corruption
[00:55:09.300 --> 00:55:16.820]   in terms of having the influence of interested parties that are not necessarily elected or
[00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:20.020]   not necessarily citizens.
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:24.620]   That's where I would say bad legislation comes from, less bad, not as much a lack of
[00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:26.500]   understanding about the issues on the ground.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.500]   Go ahead.
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:28.500]   Jeff, what are you saying they want more?
[00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:29.500]   They just want more.
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.500]   They just want more.
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:31.500]   Read the record headline.
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:32.500]   Read the record headline, would you?
[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:33.500]   Well, that might be the wrong headline.
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:34.500]   Jeff, headlines are only-
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:35.500]   That's the point.
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:37.500]   You've got to be aware of what are-
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.500]   The problem.
[00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:39.500]   I would say-
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:45.260]   Yeah, actually the way that I thought is it comes off as a gloom and doom and I totally
[00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:52.900]   lean with Mr. Jarvis on this where social media has done quite a bit and given a lot
[00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:55.500]   of voices to people that didn't really have a voice.
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:58.140]   Not granted on the other side of that corner sometimes.
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:00.100]   I wish some people didn't-
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:04.260]   Oh, well just shut their mouths with some of the foolishness that comes out, but it's
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:08.820]   still nice to know that they do have these different platforms out there that can really
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:12.940]   help shape change around the world from a societal standpoint.
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:17.540]   And wouldn't this kind of study be the first step before legislators kind of weigh in to-
[00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:19.300]   Again, I better understand it.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:20.300]   I agree.
[00:56:20.300 --> 00:56:24.580]   Why some biologists and ecologists think social media is a risk to humanity?
[00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:25.580]   How much more-
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:26.580]   Yeah, but that's re-cold.
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:27.580]   Yeah, but that's risk.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:30.580]   So just say, just say, "re-cold got it wrong."
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:34.620]   Because I don't think that that's a proper statement of what this is.
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:35.620]   I agree.
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:36.620]   I'm just saying-
[00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:39.700]   I have to say, I'm on the other side of it.
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.860]   While I think this would be very valuable, I think a bunch of social scientists getting
[00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:46.180]   together and debating the pros and I don't think that's going to-
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.020]   You're going to get anything valuable at that.
[00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:49.820]   Well, I go a different step too.
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:50.980]   I mean, I couldn't agree more.
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:54.300]   In fact, I'm going to be convening a bunch of people-
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:58.860]   I'm working with two people who couldn't disagree with me more, who've written books
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:03.020]   the opposite of mine to bring together researchers to ask, "What are the questions?
[00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:04.020]   What do we know?
[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.460]   What do we need to know about research?"
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:06.460]   Couldn't agree more.
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:08.460]   I absolutely couldn't agree more.
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:13.100]   But the issue that I have here is that the starting point to me is what do we want to
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.260]   build?
[00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:17.940]   And the starting point too often in this discussion and the way re-code presents it especially
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:18.940]   is it's broken.
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:21.820]   How do we do incremental fixes to the world as it is?
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:23.500]   That's not imaginative enough.
[00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:25.860]   That's not daring enough.
[00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:28.420]   That's not demanding enough.
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:32.020]   Create the competitor to Google, "Please, create the competitor to Facebook.
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:33.020]   Please."
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.820]   That's what I want to train my students to do.
[00:57:34.820 --> 00:57:40.340]   That's why I'm working on an effort for initiative and Internet studies to do just that.
[00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.580]   So I absolutely agree.
[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:46.140]   But if the starting point is constantly that the Internet is broken, then that limits the
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.940]   discussion badly.
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:49.980]   They're not saying anything about the Internet.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:52.340]   They're talking about social media here.
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:55.940]   Well, they're not saying even that it's broken, but just we need to understand how it impacts-
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:56.940]   Yeah, they're just saying that-
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:01.140]   What we know and what we think we know and what we believe and like that.
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:04.500]   I think that that's totally fine for them to say, "You know what?
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:09.900]   This is a really big, big piece of subject matter here that we don't quite understand
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:12.780]   and we are seeing a lot of positive things within.
[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.820]   We're seeing a lot of negative things with it."
[00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:19.540]   But to come out and say, "Hey, we're at risk of this problem and that problem, when
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:24.260]   you don't really quite have a full grasp on everything that's happening with all of
[00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:26.900]   these different platforms, I just don't like how this was-
[00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:27.900]   I didn't know about this stuff."
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:28.900]   I just don't-
[00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:29.900]   Don't I-
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:34.220]   I didn't know Rasmus say, "We ought to really consider the impacts of this printing press
[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:37.860]   because it could be good and it could be bad, but we need to understand better what's going
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:39.780]   to happen to society because of it."
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:43.340]   You know, Rasmus said straight out that he feared that there were too many books for
[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.340]   mankind.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:47.060]   He did jump to the next step.
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:48.060]   Yeah.
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:49.060]   Maybe he was okay.
[00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:50.060]   So, maybe-
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:52.020]   I haven't read at all fairs.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:55.340]   I have not had the time to read the whole paper first and maybe it turns around.
[00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:56.340]   I think that-
[00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:57.340]   You're lying at the beginning.
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:59.900]   That's set it up where I think that it has an impact on little discussion.
[00:58:59.900 --> 00:59:00.900]   I think what those-
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:01.900]   It'd be very wrong.
[00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:02.900]   I haven't read the whole-
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:03.900]   No, no, I think you're right.
[00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:07.940]   But I think what those early lines are is to establish the fact that this is something
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.340]   we need to do now.
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:13.340]   We need to pay attention to because it's potentially damaging.
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:14.340]   But if the other reason-
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:15.340]   Yeah, and you say this about-
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.340]   The attention to it is to see what we can build to our benefit.
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:18.340]   Yeah, and why that is fair.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:19.340]   That's fine.
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:22.940]   Well, so, they dress that in the paper.
[00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:24.740]   They know that there are risks and benefits.
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:28.780]   They even talk about in this regard, social media's influence provides a unique source
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:30.500]   of both risk and opportunity.
[00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:31.580]   Oh, there you go.
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:34.660]   Changes to a few lines of code can impact global behavior processes.
[00:59:34.660 --> 00:59:37.380]   They're talking about recommendation engines and things like that.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:41.940]   Yeah, such changes are ongoing with or without scientific-
[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:45.740]   Why not get you the absolute one in this story and say, why some biologists and ecologists
[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:46.740]   think social media-
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:48.820]   Because that's risk and a benefit.
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:49.820]   I'll tell you the risk.
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.740]   You want to know the risk to society?
[00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:52.740]   Link, bake, and head lines.
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:53.740]   Yes.
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:55.740]   That's the risk to society.
[00:59:55.740 --> 01:00:01.420]   I didn't read this because I see headlines like this pop through my little Google News
[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:02.900]   thing all the time.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:08.060]   And I don't even bother because I hate the fear-mongered headlines out there today.
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.060]   It's just-
[01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.220]   Well, it's a bad trend.
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:16.620]   That is also, by the way, driven by financial considerations.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:21.900]   And I think you could actually quite reasonably rewrite this entire paper and say, "Link
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.460]   bake, bake, head lines in place of social networks."
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:27.460]   And you have exactly the same issues.
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:33.140]   Well, except for social networks making it very easy to share these things with us.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.140]   Well, that's true.
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.540]   They amplify these linkbait headlines.
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:36.540]   The reason is-
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.420]   They also make it easy to share me too.
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:40.220]   They also make it easy to share Black Lives Matter.
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.780]   They also make it easier to share the news.
[01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:42.780]   By the way, Bill Cosby-
[01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:43.780]   They're not arguing that-
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:44.780]   They're not arguing that-
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:45.780]   The judge overturned his condition.
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:46.780]   I just saw that headline.
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:47.780]   What the-
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:49.780]   Was the-
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:51.780]   It was the terrible prosecutor and then the-
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:55.940]   It was actually maybe a justified decision-
[01:00:55.940 --> 01:00:58.820]   I don't know that word, but it was a technical issue.
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.540]   Yeah, it was a technical issue.
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:02.500]   But it was a legitimate technical issue.
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.500]   It was a technical issue.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:08.740]   They used evidence from a civil suit to prosecute him when they had declined to prosecute initially
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:10.020]   and the civil suit followed.
[01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:15.580]   Well, but he said in some kind of public statement he didn't plan to, but it was never a promise
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.580]   made.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.580]   But it's too late.
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:18.580]   It's over.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:19.580]   It's done.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:20.580]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:21.580]   And you know what?
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.580]   I mean-
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.820]   He's 83 and he should have to pay for what he did.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:27.980]   Think about all the women in the painful words.
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:28.980]   I agree.
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:29.980]   I agree.
[01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:30.980]   Yeah.
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:31.980]   He was a predator.
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.980]   Oh, he's old.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:33.980]   I don't care.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:34.980]   He was a predator.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:35.980]   Die in prison.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:36.980]   He thought he should die in prison.
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:37.980]   Yeah.
[01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:40.100]   And he was made by media, right?
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.100]   He was-
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:42.100]   And I was part of it.
[01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:45.060]   I was a TV critic who liked the show then didn't like the show and he hated me for it.
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:47.420]   But right.
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:53.420]   So we elevate people to a level that they too often don't deserve or we demonize them
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:55.980]   to a level they may not deserve to in media.
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:57.980]   It's those extremes.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:58.980]   It's what Ants say.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.980]   It's clickbait.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:00.980]   That's what clickbait does.
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:02.540]   I think Ant wrote this headline here.
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:03.860]   It's not a pixel book.
[01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:07.780]   So sadly, Mr. Jarvis won't buy it.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:10.380]   I appreciate the Ant.
[01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.740]   I appreciate the Ant.
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:15.980]   This is the Android Central Review of a brand new Acer Chromebook 514.
[01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.540]   You've really liked these Acer Chromebooks.
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.540]   All right.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:22.380]   I know Kevin Tofel loved the spin.
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.380]   This is a new one.
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:26.380]   The Chromebook 514.
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:32.420]   Price and on it was too low for Mr. Jarvis last week.
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:33.420]   It's too cheap.
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:35.700]   That's when we brought up the Amazon one.
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:36.700]   Yeah.
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.940]   Is where 8 gigs of RAM, Thunderbolt 4 ports.
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:39.940]   Rip me off.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:44.220]   11th generation Intel processors.
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.460]   It's less expensive than the spin.
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:48.940]   Seems to have some pretty good capabilities.
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:54.660]   It'll start at $600 on sale in August.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.540]   How do you rate the processor and such?
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.540]   That's a good processor.
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.660]   11th generation Intel processor.
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:03.260]   I mean, you know, I don't think Chromebooks really require it.
[01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.260]   You run Chrome OS.
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.940]   This should be plenty powerful for that.
[01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:11.020]   It's going to have a price point would lead him to believe it's not a personal.
[01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.660]   I would not get the $600 one is a penny of gold.
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.260]   I probably wouldn't get that.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.100]   But I three or I five.
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:22.100]   What's the proportion screen?
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.100]   That's the other thing.
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:27.940]   I really like these three by two screens, but this sure looks like a 16 by nine.
[01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:30.460]   Yeah, I think it's a 16 by two.
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:33.580]   It's a 1920 by 1080.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.900]   So it's a nice HD screen.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:39.300]   Do you use your touch screen on your Pixelbook?
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:41.020]   Jeff, do you think that's important?
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.940]   You want the touch.
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:45.020]   It also helps with carpet tunnel.
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:46.020]   Yes.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.460]   Too much with the trackpad.
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.460]   It really hurts.
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:55.420]   And so I can scroll and I can click both hands.
[01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:56.420]   It helps a lot.
[01:03:56.420 --> 01:03:59.940]   We could just give Kevin to give up his master's degree program.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:01.860]   Maybe we can get him on to recommend a Chromebook.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:02.860]   I.
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:07.660]   I'm sure if you asked him, he would give you a Chromebook recommendation.
[01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:08.660]   Oh, OK.
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:09.660]   Just email him.
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:10.660]   Have him fine.
[01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:11.660]   Yeah.
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:16.540]   And also, he does have a whole site that recommends Chromebook.
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:19.140]   So I feel like you could find that out.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:20.140]   We can just check about Chromebooks.
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:22.900]   That's where I go there every week religiously.
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:26.820]   And I read his email news that are religiously.
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.660]   But he's such a fair man that he kind of says, well, it could be this.
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:30.860]   No, I need him to make it a series.
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:34.460]   This have it worked with Kevin for over a decade.
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:35.460]   I feel you.
[01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:36.460]   I'm like Kevin.
[01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.460]   This is a fucking hard time.
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:38.460]   He's like, it really depends on what he uses.
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:43.980]   He's like, it really depends on what he uses it for.
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:49.380]   You know, Mr. Jarvis, I appreciate you bringing up the touch screen in your use case for it
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:54.180]   because I just recently reviewed a laptop for hands on tech a couple of weeks ago.
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.180]   And it had the touch screen in for windows.
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.020]   I never quite use windows, right?
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.020]   Yeah.
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.020]   Right.
[01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:01.020]   And I use windows.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:05.180]   And I never quite got on that train with touch screens on laptops because I don't want
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:07.220]   my fingers on the screen.
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:09.300]   I don't want fingerprints on the screen.
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:15.340]   Now I get having a stylus to use on a laptop that makes perfect sense to me for me as
[01:05:15.340 --> 01:05:16.700]   a creator.
[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.700]   But I just don't see the point.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:19.700]   And let me just guess here.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.980]   Windows and tabs and things like that.
[01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:24.940]   But would you bring an up carpal tunnel?
[01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.700]   I okay that light bulb.
[01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:29.660]   But I'm trying to get a window and it ants mine.
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:33.780]   If you moved your camera and she'll be your desk right now, would it be really neat?
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:34.780]   Negative.
[01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:35.780]   Not even close.
[01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:36.780]   Not surprises.
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:40.260]   And yet you're obsessing about fingerprints.
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:41.820]   I don't get it.
[01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:43.340]   But I'm looking at pixels.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.260]   Yeah, he's looking at his phone.
[01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:46.260]   Okay.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.260]   All right.
[01:05:47.260 --> 01:05:48.260]   Yeah, you're looking at your photos.
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:49.260]   That's true.
[01:05:49.260 --> 01:05:50.260]   It's neat relative to mine.
[01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:54.700]   So we had a hands the hands on tech, which will come out right after the show is aunt
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:06:00.500]   and Micah talking about their home setups because of course with COVID we sent them home.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:05.700]   And we were curious, you know, they both put a lot of work into getting really good quality
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:06.900]   home setups.
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:12.460]   They wanted me to do it, but I didn't want to show my messy desk.
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:13.460]   So but I didn't do it.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:21.100]   What is your policy going to be, boss man, dictator on in office versus homework going
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.100]   forward?
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.100]   What's what?
[01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.100]   What have you learned?
[01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:25.100]   What do you think?
[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.100]   I'm not the dictator in this particular case.
[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:27.100]   No, it's true.
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:30.540]   And we have announced that you're going to ask everybody to come back to work after the
[01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:32.460]   Fourth of July holiday.
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:36.620]   So we won't be opening the studio to a visitor's quite yet.
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:38.540]   That's going to take a little bit longer.
[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:42.860]   But when people come to work on the work on July 5th, they will be working in the office.
[01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:44.340]   And most of our hosts will be working.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:48.260]   And although we've told them that they could work at home one day a week if their supervisor
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.820]   allows it.
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:55.780]   And in some cases, people like aunt and Micah and Jason probably will work at home more
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:59.940]   because as hosts, they do a lot of work getting ready to do shows.
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:03.060]   I get more done at home quite frankly.
[01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:06.220]   And it's always been that way with me and my professional career.
[01:07:06.220 --> 01:07:08.140]   We're of the opinion though.
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:10.100]   And I think a lot of bosses are.
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.420]   Apple just said the same thing.
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:16.660]   That there is a nice synergy that happens when people are all together in the office.
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:21.460]   And when we have a host office where Aunt and Micah and Jason share a space, I don't
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:22.460]   have to go in there.
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.220]   Thank God.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:27.620]   But I think that there are a whole piece of smells.
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:29.620]   I think that there is a thing.
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:30.620]   We have that host office, sir.
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:32.140]   You're only one of the times ever in there.
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.140]   I know.
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:34.140]   No, no, no.
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:37.140]   Before pandemic, when all three of us were in there, we were all in headphones.
[01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.180]   Yeah, because they didn't want anybody to hear.
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.180]   We're busy.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:41.180]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:45.380]   But there I do think that in our business, it's one of the reasons I started Twit is
[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:50.020]   because I missed the conversation with other people in the business because I don't think
[01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:55.140]   you can hold an opinion by yourself as well as you can if you have it challenged by others.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:58.340]   And I think there's so much information that one person can't gather at all.
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:02.340]   So I think there's a lot to be said for having a corpus of journals.
[01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:08.020]   I do look forward to Wednesdays and being in there and seeing everybody from sales.
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:10.340]   That's just because we have free lunch on Wednesdays.
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:11.340]   And food.
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:12.340]   I was getting to that.
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.340]   Yeah, I think I think I think I think that.
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:15.340]   I see what do you think?
[01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:19.500]   As a reporter, I fundamentally believe reporters should never be at their desk.
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.940]   I mean, unless you're writing, you should never be in the office.
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:22.940]   That's different.
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:25.740]   But you're gathering out there.
[01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:30.980]   Well, so like for giga, I would either be out gathering information or I would, I mean,
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:31.980]   I was virtual.
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:32.980]   So it didn't matter.
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:33.980]   But you're home testing devices.
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:38.460]   You're either like, oh, but I think the only time you're ever sitting at your desk is
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.620]   when you're writing a story.
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:45.220]   I come from a culture where if you're testing devices, you do so much better when other
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:51.300]   people are around and you can bounce off of them and they can give you feedback and input.
[01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:55.980]   I think much more useful to form an opinion as a group than it is as an individual.
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:59.620]   It's just much more realistic to be honest because no one person.
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:01.220]   Maybe it's a testing home devices.
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:03.500]   Yeah, I think that may be my issue.
[01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.820]   I'm like, computer sure.
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:06.820]   Light switches?
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:13.620]   Yeah, I guess it's possible to have the Aristotelian truth about a life switch.
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:18.740]   But if you're watching computers, you kind of have to get other people's points of view
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:20.180]   because everybody uses it differently.
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.180]   I mean, it's just a...
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.900]   Anyway, I think it works better.
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:25.540]   We're going to bring everybody back.
[01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:26.900]   I had never left.
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:30.660]   And John and Berk are engineers never left.
[01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:34.540]   Some of our editors, because it's easier to work on the computers at work than it is virtually.
[01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:36.540]   No, you can't leave John.
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:39.980]   Hey, everybody else got the time away.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:41.460]   Now it's my turn, so...
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:42.460]   Yeah.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:47.060]   Well, that's what's really happening nationwide is workers are not wanting to come back to
[01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:48.060]   work.
[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:49.060]   I used to go in every single day.
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.060]   They just want to stay in employment.
[01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:52.700]   I don't want to do it now.
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:53.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:54.700]   I'll go in, I'll go in, teach obviously.
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.260]   Spoil is going to go in nearly as much as I did.
[01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:02.380]   Isn't it funny though, because when we first started teaching via Zoom seemed less than
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:03.380]   ideal, yes?
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:04.380]   Yeah.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:05.380]   Especially for...
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:11.260]   I mean, it depends on the level, but especially for younger kids.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:13.420]   The issue Leo wasn't the teaching.
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:20.380]   The issue for student... I'm going to go to grad school was the cohort.
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:21.380]   Right.
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:26.900]   Because I don't want to tell any tales out of school literally.
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.780]   But I think it was...
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:29.780]   That matters...
[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:33.180]   That's exactly what I'm saying too though, is the cohort.
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.180]   That's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.060]   But I've also seen it go too far.
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.060]   I've also seen...
[01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:43.340]   The program was we had one year, one of the programs I started, the cohort only saw themselves
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:46.220]   for a year and a half, and it was too much.
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:48.100]   They got sick of each other.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:49.100]   Right?
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.900]   And so we had to mix them up with other students more.
[01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:51.900]   There's a fine line here.
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:52.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:57.740]   And what happens too is that is it slack...
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:03.780]   This goes back to the fine professors writing in PNAS or whatever it's called.
[01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:06.500]   I didn't even hear that until I said it out loud.
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:07.500]   Oh, I know.
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:08.500]   I didn't hear it.
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:09.500]   I know.
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.980]   Now you know what I was talking about.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.460]   I'm sorry, I didn't get it.
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.300]   I didn't do that on purpose folks.
[01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.220]   I didn't get that.
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:17.780]   Is studying what the impact is.
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:24.940]   So slack on a group that doesn't have a cohesion in person, and then there's one troublemaker
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:30.060]   who can start stuff in slack, it's interesting what happens then.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:37.220]   And so there's some fine mix of enough cohesion and too much cohesion, and the tools have an
[01:11:37.220 --> 01:11:38.220]   impact, yes.
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:42.460]   I mean again, I will say again, thank God for Zoom.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.420]   Without Zoom, many of us would have been unemployed.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:46.820]   I wouldn't have been able to teach them all.
[01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:48.940]   It made a huge difference.
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:55.460]   So all the whining about Zoom, I'm not terribly sympathetic to because it saved us in the
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:58.860]   pandemic, but overdose, absolutely.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:00.940]   And slack.
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:01.940]   Overdose.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:06.460]   Google is no longer requiring publishers to use the AMP format.
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:10.220]   Through all the back and forth we did over AMP.
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:12.140]   I wasn't a fan.
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:18.540]   We brought your friend who's head of Google News into defend it.
[01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:19.540]   Richard Jingress.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:20.540]   Richard Jingress.
[01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:22.700]   AMP accelerated mobile pages.
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:27.740]   I thought on the face of it a good idea, the idea that pages should load more quickly.
[01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:31.500]   They should have less scripting on them.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:36.060]   But then the requirement that all the scripts be served by Google seemed to me a bad idea.
[01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.780]   It wasn't a requirement.
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:38.860]   It was just the easy way to do it.
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:40.860]   You could have had your own AMP set up.
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:41.860]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:43.660]   Google knew that everybody just used Google.
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:46.100]   So they said, "Oh, or you could set up your own servers.
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.100]   It's okay."
[01:12:47.100 --> 01:12:51.980]   So AMP, and the other thing that Google did was they favored AMP results in their search
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:52.980]   results.
[01:12:52.980 --> 01:12:58.340]   They even had an AMP carousel for a while.
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:02.260]   I was against it because it kind of undermined web standards.
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:05.940]   Although I understood Google's desire to speed up the web and insert it.
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:07.540]   You can get rid of the chunk on web pages.
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:08.540]   There was so much chunk.
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:11.900]   They were thinking of the consumer to a extent.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:14.820]   I was thinking about Google to a bigger extent.
[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:15.820]   Yeah.
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:17.900]   That's why I said to a extent.
[01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:21.300]   AMP is no longer required to get in the news carousel.
[01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.540]   So that's good news.
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:28.980]   This article though from Scott Gilbertson at the register says, "It may be that what
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:31.460]   they replaced it with is worse."
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:34.820]   Then I didn't ever go down to one of the replacing events.
[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:38.300]   Core web of titles.
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.300]   Do you know what that is?
[01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:42.140]   Well, it's a set of standards, I think.
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:47.540]   It's a set of standards kind of like AMP, but not as much of a requirement so that the
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:51.500]   page is still loaded quickly.
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.180]   So let me see if I can--
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.180]   Quality standards?
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.180]   Is that it?
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.180]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:57.180]   Okay.
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:04.380]   Well, I think everybody understands that the web went kind of crazy with a closing JavaScript
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:05.540]   and stuff like that.
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:10.660]   So let me see if I can--
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:13.500]   Web.dev/vitals has somewhat of a--
[01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:14.500]   Yeah.
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.460]   Core web vitals report.
[01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:19.300]   Fix poor user experiences on your site.
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:24.620]   This will tell you how your pages perform based on real world usage data, field data
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:28.700]   that Google collects anyway in the process of spidering.
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:36.980]   So it's about load times, it's about other issues.
[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:37.980]   They're--
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:41.020]   You know, I don't have a problem with this.
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:49.460]   Google-- it's Google's funny because they know-- they come across as a little bit arrogant.
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:51.220]   We know what's best.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.980]   We're going to, for instance, HTTPS.
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:15:00.580]   We're going to use our massive cloud to make everybody do what's best.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:05.260]   And I can't argue that that's wrong, but it does seem a little heavy-handed.
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:11.060]   For instance, by saying if you use HTTPS, you'll show up better in search results.
[01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:15.020]   That's a very powerful carrot or is it a stick?
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:18.140]   So I was at a-- where Apple is done the same thing.
[01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:19.140]   Yeah.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:22.260]   But Apple doesn't have the-- Apple's near the cloud.
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:24.260]   Apple has in its search results.
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.260]   That's--
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.260]   That's massive.
[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:27.260]   Oh, no, they don't.
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:28.260]   They don't.
[01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:30.180]   I'm just saying Apple has been pretty known to--
[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:33.180]   Well, no one would ever call Apple arrogant, would they?
[01:15:33.180 --> 01:15:38.380]   Based on-- they design things based on what they think you're supposed to want to do.
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:39.780]   You know, it's just--
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:46.660]   But you know, Apple's opinion is that we know best how to have the user experience be.
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.620]   Microsoft's opinion is whatever you want.
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.820]   We'll just let you do anything you want.
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:53.900]   Somewhere in between perhaps.
[01:15:53.900 --> 01:15:55.780]   But Google has all this market cloud.
[01:15:55.780 --> 01:16:00.380]   And I think they're very willing to use it, which I'm not sure I really think is a good
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:01.380]   platform.
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:04.260]   So yeah, I was proven wrong on this.
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:10.100]   I was at the newsgeist in Helsinki, I went like four years ago, when this was discussed,
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:13.780]   and AMP was tied to news pages at that event.
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:19.620]   And we were asking Google for help to get portable content models.
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:21.940]   There was more to it than just speed.
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:24.100]   And then Google came back and they said, we're working on this AMP thing.
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:26.020]   This is great for fast pages, da, da, da, da.
[01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:29.100]   And I remember one of the Google people in the room on Bylie and Shadowpaw's room, but
[01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:30.100]   I won't say which one.
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:32.860]   One of the Google people in the room said, no, no, no, no.
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:35.940]   If we touch it, then people aren't going to-- they're going to reject it because we
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:36.940]   touched were too big.
[01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:37.940]   And he was right.
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:38.940]   Right?
[01:16:38.940 --> 01:16:42.100]   That's part of what happened here is that there are people like you who said, ah, what's
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.740]   going on here?
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:51.060]   I think your point about Google is that they often-- what's in their interest is often
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.500]   in our interest.
[01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:57.820]   And they constantly trumpet that they are in favor of and defend the open web.
[01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.940]   It is in Google's interest to do that.
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:03.060]   It is in our interest to have an open web.
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:05.460]   So it's a case where we are in that case aligned.
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.260]   Now advertising isn't an open web, but they have.
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:08.340]   There's nothing that's an art.
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:13.380]   But that's one area where in trying to get a better web experience, it seemed that our
[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:15.180]   interests were aligned.
[01:17:15.180 --> 01:17:20.700]   The limitations of AMP were often technical, like the URLs remain screwed up to the end.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:23.060]   Oh, gosh, yes.
[01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:29.300]   And so then suspicion is a-- and it really didn't serve Google to have screwed up URLs,
[01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:33.020]   but people were saying, well, they're doing this so they could serve everything.
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:36.100]   It was a weakness of the architecture.
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:40.380]   But the presumption in too many quarters is what's Google really up to here.
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.860]   And the suspicion hurt the effort to make it speedier.
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:46.980]   Now Google was going to make AMP and the system at the beginning was open source.
[01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:50.020]   And they did kind of change the government a little bit, but they never really made it
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:51.340]   open source.
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:52.660]   And that I think was the big mistake.
[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:58.220]   I think that if people had adapted standards for a fast web and then shamed publishers
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:01.780]   and advertisers and immediately, we would have a better web to do.
[01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:03.940]   So here's what Google uses.
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:09.100]   If you, by the way, score high and core web vitals, this will help your Google ranking.
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:13.060]   So again, Google is using its big stick to get people to go along.
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.780]   And I don't think anybody would disagree.
[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:16.660]   These are important things.
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:20.340]   They say, by the way, that these metrics will evolve over time.
[01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:25.180]   So this is the set for 2020 that they were using.
[01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:28.540]   It comes down to three aspects of user experience.
[01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:31.340]   Loading, interactivity, and visual stability.
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:38.380]   And the measurements are LCP, which is largest, contentful paint.
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:46.860]   And you want to basically have the majority of content painted up on the screen with under
[01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:47.940]   2.5 seconds.
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:50.700]   I don't think there's anything wrong with saying that.
[01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:54.180]   I think there's a little something wrong with Google saying, and by the way, your search
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:56.500]   results won't be as good if you don't do this.
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.980]   But I understand they believe they're making this a better web for everybody.
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:00.980]   The next--
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:04.060]   Well, yeah, and they have to do something to inspire people to do it, adopt it.
[01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:05.060]   Right.
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:07.060]   Yeah, but that's not-- they're a private company.
[01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:12.980]   I don't think that Google should be using its search index as a--
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:16.460]   They want to have a good experience, just as they don't send you to places that have
[01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:18.620]   a crappy spammy advertising.
[01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.220]   They don't want to send you a page that has a whole bunch of--
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:26.060]   So if a page loads in four seconds and ranks lower because of it, is it because it's a
[01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:29.060]   bad page or because there's a lot of content on it or--
[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.060]   It's because they have--
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:31.060]   No, it's because it has text.
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:32.900]   Well, it's because it's a bad page.
[01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:35.300]   So everything should just be text.
[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.060]   Add things are bad.
[01:19:37.060 --> 01:19:38.820]   There's lots of things that could have images.
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:40.220]   Badly done CSS.
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.460]   First input delay measures interactivity.
[01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:44.020]   This is the second metric.
[01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:51.100]   Pages should be-- allow you to give it your input within 100 milliseconds, one tenth of
[01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.620]   a second.
[01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:56.740]   And if it's slower than three tenths of a second, it'll rank down.
[01:19:56.740 --> 01:19:59.420]   And then finally, cumulative layout shift.
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.420]   Yes.
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:02.900]   Which I do agree with.
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:07.420]   So stability, if-- now let me--
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:08.420]   This is complicated.
[01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:09.420]   I have to move it around the screen.
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:10.420]   Yeah.
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:13.900]   You don't want things moving around.
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:18.780]   Which also is a dark pattern too because you end up trying to click to make the box
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:19.780]   go away.
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:20.780]   The box moves.
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:21.780]   You end up clicking on the ad.
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.780]   Yeah.
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:29.460]   I mean, I guess this is an example of-- well, since there's no regulation about dark patterns,
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:31.620]   then we're just going to let Google do it.
[01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:33.260]   Well, but here's the thing.
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:34.260]   This is my argument.
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:39.340]   Helsinki was that I would prefer-- outsiders do it.
[01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:41.740]   I would prefer that my own industry had done it, but we never did it.
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:44.980]   We just-- we messed up the web, and there was never a movement to medium.
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:50.620]   Well, if the WF3C did it, then I would not have the same problem.
[01:20:50.620 --> 01:20:51.620]   Well, I haven't--
[01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:53.820]   Well, you could always use a different search engine.
[01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:55.620]   I mean, you could always say, you know what?
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.300]   I hate that Google penalizes people.
[01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:00.340]   I want to see even the slowest crap he is loading pages.
[01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:02.420]   I'm going to go to DuckDuckGo.
[01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:06.380]   Well, unfortunately, DuckDuckGo really is just a Google API.
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:07.380]   But--
[01:21:07.380 --> 01:21:08.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:09.380]   Thank you.
[01:21:09.380 --> 01:21:10.380]   I'll use Bing.
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:13.420]   I actually have an answer for your question coming up.
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:14.900]   Last week, I recommended BraveSearch.
[01:21:14.900 --> 01:21:16.900]   I have another one I want to show people.
[01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:21.180]   What's interesting is all of a sudden, there is this kind of-- for whatever reason, perhaps
[01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:24.660]   because of all the FTC and attention--
[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:27.500]   I think it's because Chrome is like a bloated crapper.
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:30.140]   There are a lot of search alternatives suddenly popping up.
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:31.140]   And--
[01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:32.140]   Oh, I was thinking of browser.
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:33.820]   I think it's more about privacy.
[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:35.460]   But because they're all privacy focused.
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:39.060]   But I think it's very interesting.
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:44.380]   Google has also said-- and this really should be in the change look-- but given that it's
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:52.540]   relationship to what we're just talking about, Google has also warned people when you search
[01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:56.380]   for something that there is no good answer to yet.
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:58.300]   It's rapidly evolving.
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:02.060]   So you'll start seeing warnings on search results like this.
[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:04.420]   Here, let me make this a little bit bigger.
[01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:10.860]   If you search for UFO in 106 miles an hour, it looks like these results are changing quickly.
[01:22:10.860 --> 01:22:11.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:18.500]   If this topic is new, it can sometimes take time for results to be added by reliable sources.
[01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:19.500]   Good.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:22.300]   You object to that?
[01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:23.300]   No.
[01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:27.420]   I wasn't saying what you're seeing in search results is right or wrong, but that there may
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:29.420]   be more information to come.
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:30.420]   Yeah.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.420]   Well, OK.
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:32.420]   I've mixed feelings about it.
[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:34.900]   No, I do.
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:37.340]   Because it's an editorial decision.
[01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:39.380]   And should Google be editorializing?
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:44.460]   I guess you could say that they do all the time with their search index.
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.900]   The world goes after them for saying you're linking to horrible stuff.
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:49.460]   You're allowing horrible stuff to be linked to.
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:50.460]   You should clean it up.
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:51.460]   And then they clean it up.
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:53.260]   And they say, well, no, but now you're taking too much power.
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.140]   So you can't wait.
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:22:57.300]   Is it editorializing or is it just any effect?
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:59.100]   I mean, they have the ability to see this.
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:01.900]   So are they just saying, hey, this is changing?
[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:03.860]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[01:23:03.860 --> 01:23:04.860]   How do they know?
[01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:05.860]   How do they know?
[01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:08.900]   Find some way to call that some sort of censorship, too.
[01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:10.140]   You know that's coming down the road.
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:14.180]   I mean, you could say, hey, OK, if you're going to put this, tell us how you've developed
[01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:15.420]   this metric, right?
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:18.300]   How do you decide if something's changing a lot?
[01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:20.020]   What is that entail?
[01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:22.500]   But once they publish that, then people will game it.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:30.140]   So this is why transparency and search is a real big problem, given how much economic
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:33.500]   value a high search ranking can drive.
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:38.340]   It's-- look, I'm not saying it's easy for Google.
[01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:39.540]   By the way, this is a test.
[01:23:39.540 --> 01:23:43.940]   It didn't happen when I did the same search on my Google.
[01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:45.660]   But so you may not see it.
[01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:47.500]   And they're just trying it out.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:48.940]   I would like to know more.
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.220]   And of course, they'll never tell you.
[01:23:50.220 --> 01:23:51.820]   But where do they get this signal?
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:53.860]   How do they know that it's a changing?
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.860]   They might give you a hint of it.
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:56.860]   But--
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:58.860]   Well, you're speculating.
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:01.220]   They haven't given us any indication.
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:04.860]   Well, if they do give us that indication, then that signal will get came.
[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:06.340]   I remember talking to them about this.
[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:08.340]   The earlier days of this information, I know.
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:09.340]   But I'm saying that they said--
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:11.140]   Oh, I was like, can I have one?
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:12.140]   You don't care.
[01:24:12.140 --> 01:24:13.140]   Great.
[01:24:13.140 --> 01:24:14.140]   Great.
[01:24:14.140 --> 01:24:15.140]   Hey, relax.
[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:16.140]   What pressure we can agree?
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:17.140]   I'm--
[01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:20.060]   Oh, 120 degrees in Seattle.
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.060]   They agree.
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:22.060]   Yes.
[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:23.060]   Hell.
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:25.380]   Oh, no, it's Hell freezes over.
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:26.380]   Not.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:32.420]   So Daphne Keller, who's a brilliant, brilliant legal mind at Stanford.
[01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:35.220]   This is about the Siseline Bill and 230.
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:42.060]   But she said that what the bill prohibits in self-dealing potentially says that it opens
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:46.900]   the door for Infowars, Bright Bart, Daily Stormer et al. to bring must carry claims against
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:50.660]   the platforms or demand higher ranking.
[01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:54.220]   Because when the platforms make these decisions, which you label editorial, which I would say
[01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:58.740]   are for a better experience for the users, then they're going to get accused.
[01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:03.700]   And even this Democrats bill, I'm saying they can't discriminate among similarly situated
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:06.700]   businesses.
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:08.740]   That's where this goes then.
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:13.900]   If you say, well, we don't clean up the web, but don't clean up the web, this is the
[01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.060]   vise that they're caught in.
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:16.420]   And this is the essence of the 230.
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:18.020]   I guess I'm going to get a 230 again.
[01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:21.860]   Google be better or worse if they just did PageRank.
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:23.540]   Like that's it.
[01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:24.540]   You don't.
[01:25:24.540 --> 01:25:25.780]   We're not going to say anything at all.
[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:29.140]   We're just going to do PageRank, which is basically a more.
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.380]   That's gameable as hell.
[01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:31.380]   That was the problem.
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:32.380]   Ask Matt Pots.
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:33.380]   That was the problem.
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:34.380]   It was game like crazy.
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:35.380]   And they had to come up with other signals.
[01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:39.300]   And they have to constantly evolve those signals because the gamers are always ahead
[01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:40.300]   of them.
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:42.380]   The malign influences are always ahead of them.
[01:25:42.380 --> 01:25:46.380]   And that was Matt's life.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:47.380]   That's what Panda was.
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:48.380]   Everything.
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:50.980]   Panda was saying that it was worth it.
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:51.980]   No.
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:52.980]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:53.980]   We're going to have these trade offs.
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:57.300]   So we have to say this is going to be the anticipated trade off.
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:59.820]   Do we carve out an exception for it?
[01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:01.900]   Or do we say, well, we'll see what happens?
[01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:08.020]   I mean, when I work on a dot com, I don't actually, I think you could make PageRank
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:09.540]   not be gameable.
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:10.540]   Wow.
[01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:11.540]   Wow.
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:13.180]   Well, OK, so how do people game it?
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:14.940]   They create a link farms, right?
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:15.940]   Yes.
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:18.020]   I'm not happy with my pandemic.
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:23.420]   All Matt would do is say the quality of the result from a link farm is not, should not
[01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:25.740]   be included in the search results.
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:26.740]   That was the pandemic.
[01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:27.740]   Well, they did that.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:31.340]   But then they, that's, but to do that, you have to say things like, OK, an article has
[01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:32.780]   to be X number for its long.
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:38.580]   And then they'd be like, OK, now, I mean, the, the issue is gaming isn't just like it
[01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:39.580]   has to be quality.
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:43.220]   It has to be scalable and like done by computers.
[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:49.180]   So anything that's done by computers as opposed to human judgment and also even human judgment.
[01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:51.380]   I mean, some people find some things offensive.
[01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:52.660]   Some people don't.
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:27:01.740]   So there is no way to give people your, there's no way to stop people from gaming systems.
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:06.580]   And there's no way to give everybody the exact web they want or think they want.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:07.580]   Mm hmm.
[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:08.580]   Sorry.
[01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:15.940]   And I'll, and I love transparency, but when transparency gets used against you, that's
[01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:16.940]   an issue.
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:17.940]   Mm hmm.
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:20.580]   Just to see you and I agree a lot.
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:30.460]   I just, I feel like there must be a way to do search results that are simply search results
[01:27:30.460 --> 01:27:31.460]   without any.
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:34.100]   OK, so here, here's, here's an idea for you.
[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:35.100]   Here's an idea.
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:36.900]   I feel like we should have the stand up.
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:37.900]   I don't see this cheap.
[01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:38.900]   Well, yes.
[01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:44.220]   And all, well, Google's more than that and Facebook films over that, not large, large.
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:45.780]   Here's, here's a way to go in antitrust.
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:48.020]   It is settlement with antitrust.
[01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:51.340]   You could say, because the reason Duck Duck know is, you know, is what it is.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:54.020]   It's just because it's, as you say, it's off the Google API.
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:55.780]   But it's privacy forward.
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:56.780]   That's all.
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:57.780]   Yeah.
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:03.220]   But, but Google could, but the strength Google has is it scraping Google to release that
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:04.220]   as a full API.
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:07.540]   And anybody can build a search engine on top of that database.
[01:28:07.540 --> 01:28:09.900]   You know, you could, you could, you could come to a settlement where they have something
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:10.900]   like that.
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:16.980]   And you could let a, let a hundred search engines then blossom with all different kinds of structures.
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:19.980]   That's, that's one way to think about it.
[01:28:19.980 --> 01:28:20.980]   I'd love to see that.
[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:26.220]   I wonder why is it because Google is so dominant that.
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:31.220]   Well, it used to be that that was, that was part of their secret sauce was that we have
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.220]   the scraping, you don't.
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:33.220]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:36.460]   Now that's less high end view.
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:39.740]   What they have instead is their AI analysis of that.
[01:28:39.740 --> 01:28:51.940]   So the simple scrapes aren't the special competitive advantage that they were.
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:58.900]   I just wish there were a better way.
[01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:04.660]   I just, I feel, do you not feel like Google's results are considerably less good than they
[01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:06.540]   were in the early days of Google?
[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:07.740]   Is that just me?
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:09.220]   It depends on what I'm looking for.
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:12.500]   I mean, I think they're actually overall, I think they're better.
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:13.500]   Yeah.
[01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:14.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:14.500 --> 01:29:17.900]   Often the search results aren't till at least halfway down the page.
[01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:22.900]   Well, what's so miraculous to me, Leo is how, what was I looking up this morning?
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:25.780]   I was looking up something where I couldn't remember somebody.
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:32.340]   But I know what it was.
[01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:35.980]   It was a, I needed to find somebody and I suddenly couldn't remember the name and I
[01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:43.100]   knew where they appeared often and that their, their, their sexual identity was part of their
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:46.820]   public identity and something else.
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:48.660]   And second one of the search ones, right?
[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:50.460]   It was that was that, wow, Google, thank you.
[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:52.260]   You found the exact person I needed.
[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:56.620]   Now, I had to guess enough to say that, but I didn't know.
[01:29:56.620 --> 01:30:02.220]   Its ability to ferret out your intent is beyond what it ever was before.
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:07.260]   And again, that's not, it's not filter bubbly because there have been studies that show
[01:30:07.260 --> 01:30:10.500]   that they don't, your search results and my search results are not that different, less
[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:13.660]   where H.S. can repeat say in our neighborhoods.
[01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:16.180]   But if you ask for questions in certain ways, it's phenomenal.
[01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:20.180]   The other thing, Stacy, you mentioned last week of translation.
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:27.940]   I've been translating books in Google, biographies of, of Audemar, Mergen-thawler.
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:30.260]   I have such a fun life, you know?
[01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:35.540]   And, and my German, I've been taking my German lessons with, with, with Audemar, but it's
[01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:37.220]   not good enough for some of the stuff.
[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:39.660]   So I ended up, yeah, I get a sentence and I say, I'm not sure.
[01:30:39.660 --> 01:30:43.340]   Just type it into Google and, and it's phenomenal what it does now.
[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:44.340]   Absolutely phenomenal.
[01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:49.220]   So the secret sauce is no longer Google has servers everywhere with, they know every site.
[01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:52.020]   The secret sauce is Google, how it analyzes it.
[01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:57.900]   If you want that plain vanilla, crappiest site on top, I say they should let somebody
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:01.740]   have the same argument that is made by some people to Facebook.
[01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:06.900]   You should allow people to, if you want to pick just the, on an algorithmic feed and
[01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:08.660]   see how bad it is, you should be able to do that.
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:09.660]   And you kind of can't.
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:15.340]   Twitter this week got in trouble because it seemed to take off the cron option and there
[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:16.580]   were people who were doing stories.
[01:31:16.580 --> 01:31:20.620]   Twitter abandoned the crime option and came on the product guy said, no, we got a bug.
[01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:21.620]   We're fixing it.
[01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:22.620]   Relax.
[01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:26.660]   Yeah, actually I did not put that in the rundown because it was just a bug.
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:27.660]   It was ridiculous.
[01:31:27.660 --> 01:31:28.660]   Yeah.
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:29.660]   Yeah.
[01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:30.660]   People got very upset about it.
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:35.100]   But do you use the, do you use the filter to the chronological option, Jeff?
[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:36.900]   I use the filter.
[01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:37.900]   I've gone back and forth.
[01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:44.620]   I've tried a lot and I find the filter really, my filter, you mean the, the, the algorithm
[01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:46.260]   make top tweets first.
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:50.580]   I find that it's, it's, it shows me things that I'm glad I saw that I otherwise would
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:51.580]   not have seen.
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:52.580]   Huh.
[01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:53.580]   I'm sorry.
[01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:57.100]   No, I mainly use, I mean, I use lists a lot Stacy.
[01:31:57.100 --> 01:31:59.820]   So that doesn't get that.
[01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:04.740]   My COVID list, my book history, wonks list, a lot of Gutenberg and Mergethaller in there.
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:07.060]   And things like that.
[01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:10.740]   So that doesn't get that benefit, but I know what I'm getting there and I curated that.
[01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:12.460]   What do you use Stacy?
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:14.860]   I use the chronological.
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:18.540]   But my, my Twitter is pretty curated.
[01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:19.860]   I'll bet it is.
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:21.100]   Ant, what do you use?
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:24.180]   I use the algorithm because I don't have as much time anymore.
[01:32:24.180 --> 01:32:29.220]   And it's nice that it seems to be working for me, but most of the time I'm on the list.
[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:33.420]   I open up Twitter and I go straight to three different lists that I have in particular.
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:34.980]   What do you, may I ask for your list, sir?
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:37.140]   Photo is one of them I bet.
[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:39.020]   One is creators.
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:41.180]   One is my Twitter family.
[01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:42.420]   And then there's another one.
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:43.780]   This is called tech and gadget.
[01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:44.780]   Or something like that.
[01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:45.780]   Okay.
[01:32:45.780 --> 01:32:49.500]   Now we would ask the old discussion, but he's going to say that he doesn't use Twitter.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:52.260]   I, what's Twitter again?
[01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:54.300]   What's Twitter?
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:59.020]   Let's take a little break and then actually, yeah, let's take a little break and then
[01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:01.100]   we'll do the Google change.
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:07.620]   If you would like our show today brought to you by AT and T active armor.
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:10.980]   I'll tell you one thing I don't like.
[01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:14.580]   Bam calls in the middle of anything I'm doing on my smartphone.
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:19.940]   We do so much on our smartphones these days, whether it's watching live streaming content.
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:22.340]   I was watching the F1 race the other day.
[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:23.340]   That was exciting.
[01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:24.340]   Wasn't it?
[01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:26.780]   Catching up with the family on weekly video calls.
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:28.540]   I have one every Thursday with the fam.
[01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:29.540]   It's fun.
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:33.900]   We're watching your favorite podcast like this.
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:38.940]   But the matter of course, you're doing on your phone, there's no room for fraud calls.
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:44.940]   Thankfully, AT&T makes customer security a priority helping block those pesky calls.
[01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:46.420]   It's not complicated.
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:53.420]   AT&T active armor 24/7 proactive network security and fraud call blocking to help stop threats
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:55.940]   at no extra charge.
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:56.940]   Did I say that?
[01:33:56.940 --> 01:34:04.460]   At no extra charge compatible device service required visit att.com/active armor for details
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:12.100]   atkomslashactive armor for details.
[01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:14.060]   Who's the woman who does those AT&T ads?
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:16.140]   She was on Master of None.
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:19.580]   I just love her.
[01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.060]   What's her name?
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:23.940]   You mentioned the race.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:31.980]   I love the way it ended because it reminded me of Dion Sanders playing football right before
[01:34:31.980 --> 01:34:35.340]   he scores a touchdown, he dances right before he gets to the goal line.
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:37.260]   Never danced before he gets to the goal line.
[01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:41.660]   It seemed like that's what Matt Swarstappen did just before he crossed the finish line
[01:34:41.660 --> 01:34:43.260]   because he was so far ahead.
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:46.460]   He just slowed down and waved to his team.
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:47.460]   They do that.
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:50.140]   It always makes me nuts.
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:51.140]   There was a TikTok.
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:52.140]   But he was hit by like, I know.
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:54.140]   I could do it.
[01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:55.660]   He's really been dominant this year.
[01:34:55.660 --> 01:35:03.780]   Interesting to watch the Dutchman from the Red Bull team do so well.
[01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:06.420]   Lena Wait.
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:08.140]   Lena Wait, right?
[01:35:08.140 --> 01:35:12.340]   Every time I do those AT&T commercials, I hear her voice in my head and go to it more
[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:15.260]   like Lena.
[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:17.780]   All right, let's play the drums slowly.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:23.580]   It's time for the Google change log.
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:25.900]   Half of what we talked about today could be in the change log.
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:26.900]   Here's some more.
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:30.940]   Google is delaying flock till 2023.
[01:35:30.940 --> 01:35:32.660]   That's two years from now.
[01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:34.500]   Get rid of cookies.
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:35.500]   Well, not so fast.
[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:36.700]   Don't get rid of cookies.
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:38.060]   We like we didn't like flocking.
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:43.660]   We missed the cookies with regulators, privacy advocates and major websites condemning flock,
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:48.460]   which was the Google attempt to replace third party cookies with the federated learning
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:54.180]   of cohorts, FLOC.
[01:35:54.180 --> 01:36:00.140]   As a member of a cohort, a cohort which should change every week based on your internet usage.
[01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:04.740]   Any website could query as you're visiting it, which cohort you're in.
[01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:11.180]   A lot of people, including the EFF said, we think that actually is even worse.
[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:14.380]   It supports fingerprinting and other things.
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:22.620]   So Google says, well, maybe we're looking for a way to make advertising work on the web
[01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:27.220]   without privacy invasions.
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:30.340]   I guess we'll go back to the drawing board with flock.
[01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:36.980]   Here is the simple easy to understand diagram of how flock works.
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:37.980]   Got it?
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:38.980]   Good.
[01:36:38.980 --> 01:36:39.980]   Thank you, Google.
[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:40.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:44.340]   You told us to get rid of good.
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:46.340]   Cookies, we got rid of cookies.
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:47.340]   Hell yeah.
[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:48.340]   Now you like this?
[01:36:48.340 --> 01:36:49.780]   What's this cookie jar doing empty?
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:50.780]   Hey, I want cookies.
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:52.780]   Hey, is it my cookie jar?
[01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:58.100]   Everybody else took one episode of this week in Google first to see how valuable cookies
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:00.260]   can be to one Mr. Leo LaPorque.
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:02.860]   I love my cookies.
[01:37:02.860 --> 01:37:05.900]   You know what I don't love is the ever expanding price.
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:06.900]   I love my cookies.
[01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:07.900]   Yeah, you love your waffles.
[01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:08.900]   Yes, you do.
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:09.900]   You're cooking.
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:10.900]   Everything.
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:11.900]   Look at that.
[01:37:11.900 --> 01:37:12.900]   What kind of things?
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:13.900]   Those are real chocolate chip cookies.
[01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:15.900]   They are chocolate chip with nuts, walnuts.
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:19.340]   I can tell those are 1000 miles away.
[01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:20.340]   Those are daughter cookies.
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:21.340]   Oh.
[01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:25.540]   The best part was when I started the show, I said, hey, do you want cookies?
[01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:26.900]   And she's like, I can use cookies.
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:28.620]   I was like, do you want to make cookies?
[01:37:28.620 --> 01:37:30.620]   It's like I can make cookies.
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:33.820]   I love my hearties, but they're not making cookies.
[01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:34.820]   She can make cookies.
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:38.460]   Yeah, you don't want to know what they're putting in those cookies.
[01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:43.540]   She can make cookies all in their own, like no pronounced supervision required?
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:44.540]   Or did Andrew have to help?
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:46.900]   She's like, she's almost 15.
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:50.140]   Well, now I'm just impressed.
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:51.620]   This is hard.
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:56.460]   You allow her a 14 year old to use a mixer?
[01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:58.820]   Have you not seen the cookies and cakes that child?
[01:37:58.820 --> 01:38:01.060]   She's been baking on her own since she was nine.
[01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:02.060]   Nice.
[01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:03.060]   That is a good thing to train.
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:04.820]   This was one of those fresh out of the oven, Stacey.
[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:07.100]   Yeah, they're warm, y'all.
[01:38:07.100 --> 01:38:11.820]   Oh, Jeff, I know it's well, it's actually no longer a million degrees.
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:13.460]   So you want to come out here?
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:14.460]   I want cookies away.
[01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:16.380]   Oh, cookie.
[01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:24.860]   So when YouTube TV launched, it was 35 bucks a month.
[01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:26.220]   It was a great deal.
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:27.220]   I loved it.
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:28.380]   You got local stations.
[01:38:28.380 --> 01:38:30.900]   You got DVRs for six people.
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:31.900]   All sorts of things to like.
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:36.860]   Then it went up to 45 and 55, $65 now.
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:37.860]   A month?
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:40.300]   No, sorry, 70.
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:41.300]   How much is it?
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:42.300]   It's a lot.
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.220]   It's 65 a month.
[01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:47.420]   They raised it last year to 65 a month.
[01:38:47.420 --> 01:38:53.500]   Now you can add things in addition, but they dropped Fox Sports as regional sports network.
[01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:58.140]   So they've added bundles like HBO showtime and stars for $30 a month.
[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:04.100]   Well, get ready because the biggest add on ever is coming for YouTube TV users.
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:05.100]   4K.
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:08.260]   They'll be the first streamer.
[01:39:08.260 --> 01:39:10.220]   I think maybe Discovery did it.
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:19.060]   The first 4K full time streamer with Dolby 5.1 audio and it will be a mirror.
[01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:21.300]   Additional $20 a month.
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:22.300]   $20 more.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:23.300]   $20 a month.
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:25.860]   We're making cable here.
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:29.220]   Yeah, basically $65 a month.
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:30.420]   That's my cable bill.
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:31.420]   Yeah.
[01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:35.740]   It'll only be $10 for your first year after a 30 day free trial.
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:41.420]   Some major sport, actually, I'm going to buy it because I have a 4K TV and I would love
[01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:47.620]   to see major sports on NBC, ESPN and others in 4K on demand content from FX, Discovery
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:49.900]   networks, taste made.
[01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:53.180]   There's the ones that do the top down recipe cooking things.
[01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:55.060]   Fubo does 4K.
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:40:00.460]   That's the only other live TV streaming service that offers 4K.
[01:40:00.460 --> 01:40:02.940]   I don't think the locals, maybe they will.
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:04.580]   Maybe Google is going to do a deal with locals.
[01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:07.740]   If they were 4K as well, that'd be pretty cool.
[01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:09.700]   That'd be pretty cool.
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:12.540]   So get your checkbook out.
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:14.820]   Has all the live sports and stuff too.
[01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:15.820]   Right.
[01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:16.820]   But I think it's 4K.
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:17.820]   No.
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:20.420]   And doesn't Netflix offer 4K?
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:22.100]   It does, but it's not a live service.
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.340]   So this is the difference between...
[01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:24.340]   Okay, that's the difference.
[01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:25.340]   All right.
[01:40:25.340 --> 01:40:26.340]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:30.900]   There are a lot of ways to watch 4K movies and TV shows, but live stuff, that's different.
[01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:34.540]   I wonder if they'll include the Olympics and...
[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:35.540]   Ooh.
[01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:36.540]   Coming up.
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:37.540]   That would be worth it.
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:38.540]   I had...
[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:42.740]   Man, last time you had to watch it on Xfinity, it was terrible.
[01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:43.740]   It just...
[01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:47.020]   And for me, now they're using these those beautiful Sony cameras.
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:48.740]   Oh, I would love to see 4K Olympics.
[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:51.420]   That would be awesome.
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:55.500]   Google has made it easier to access advanced search in Gmail.
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:41:01.660]   I can't tell you how many times I've explained about advanced search in Gmail.
[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:03.980]   I think a lot of people don't know about it.
[01:41:03.980 --> 01:41:07.100]   The old icon was just this little triangle icon.
[01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:08.100]   Now it's...
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:12.260]   Whatever the hell this is.
[01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:14.180]   What is it?
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:16.700]   That's like a known hamburger bar.
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:17.700]   Sliders.
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:19.500]   It's a hamburger bar with...
[01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:20.580]   It looks like a vent.
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:25.340]   I don't know what the hell it is, but they say that's gonna make it easier.
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:28.500]   There you go.
[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:30.180]   That's a Google change log for you.
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:31.660]   New icon on search.
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:33.700]   Google Play developers.
[01:41:33.700 --> 01:41:38.020]   You'll need to follow not one, but two new requirements.
[01:41:38.020 --> 01:41:42.620]   You're gonna need to enable two-step verification and you're gonna have to prove you are who
[01:41:42.620 --> 01:41:43.860]   you say you are.
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:45.220]   This is good.
[01:41:45.220 --> 01:41:50.780]   This is to make sure that when you're developing an app for the Google Play store that it isn't
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:52.700]   a malicious app.
[01:41:52.700 --> 01:41:59.780]   So it'll be very much tied to your physical address, your verified email address and phone
[01:41:59.780 --> 01:42:00.780]   number.
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:03.660]   What does Apple do, comparatively?
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:07.180]   You have to have a developer account and I think you have to have a real address and
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:10.500]   I think you do have to do this something like this.
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:16.260]   It's also a 99 bucks, which probably helps to keep the riff-raff out.
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:18.220]   That's a good question.
[01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:20.420]   Yeah, and things.
[01:42:20.420 --> 01:42:21.940]   Things cost money.
[01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:23.940]   Those chocolate chip cookies aren't free.
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:26.580]   It's not delicious.
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:28.260]   The nuts cost extra.
[01:42:28.260 --> 01:42:29.260]   Yeah, nuts.
[01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:30.260]   Walnuts.
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:31.260]   Walnuts.
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:33.900]   Lisa V, so mad at me if I put walnuts in her chocolate chip cookies.
[01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:37.900]   And I think she sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon in there.
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:38.900]   Oh, wow.
[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:40.500]   Or it may have been nutmeg.
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:42.460]   It was either cinnamon or nutmeg.
[01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:44.900]   And you might have the past tense there.
[01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:50.780]   You might refer analyzing now your daughter to the best recipes chocolate chip cookie recipe
[01:42:50.780 --> 01:42:55.340]   because they do some very interesting things to deepen and rich in the flavor like browning
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:57.340]   the butter.
[01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:00.180]   She has made brown butter chocolate chip cookies before.
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:02.860]   Yeah, she probably got it from the best recipes.
[01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:05.580]   What did you say Hank was going to make?
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:11.020]   Hank today, salt hank on TikTok, made a, he showed it to me.
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:12.020]   It looked delicious.
[01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:14.260]   I'm just going to have to check.
[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:16.300]   What did salt hank make today on TikTok?
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:19.620]   Yeah, as I was going to say, it's probably already done now.
[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:20.620]   It puts it.
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:22.300]   I asked him, does it matter when you put it up?
[01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:23.700]   He says it doesn't matter when you put it up.
[01:43:23.700 --> 01:43:27.460]   But he for some reason puts it up around 9 a.m.
[01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:30.020]   Here is salt hanks latest recipe.
[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:36.540]   Oh, this was a, a Philo do kind of vegetable tart.
[01:43:36.540 --> 01:43:37.540]   So he's chopping up.
[01:43:37.540 --> 01:43:41.780]   Yeah, mushrooms, onions, cherry tomatoes.
[01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:42.780]   Good chopper.
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:45.220]   Little, yeah, he's a good chopper.
[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:46.540]   There's a little puff pastry.
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:47.540]   He's putting it all on there.
[01:43:47.540 --> 01:43:51.420]   A little bit of browned onion, some feta cheese, some crumbles.
[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:53.940]   He's buttering the, the, the edges.
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:55.540]   Bacon that, there it is.
[01:43:55.540 --> 01:43:56.540]   Delicious.
[01:43:56.540 --> 01:43:59.500]   Was that butter on the edge or an egg white?
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:00.500]   This, oh, maybe it was an egg white.
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:01.500]   I don't know.
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:05.100]   You know, you'll have to ask him because he says, I made a vegetable tart because my
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:08.580]   mom's friends keep saying my channel is too unhealthy.
[01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:11.980]   Oh, what do you make right before?
[01:44:11.980 --> 01:44:12.980]   Uh, steak.
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:17.980]   Add a ball at that steak, a little butter, a little rose.
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:18.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:19.980]   Garlic.
[01:44:19.980 --> 01:44:20.980]   Yeah, his friends are right.
[01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:26.100]   Oh, now we're going to go to the mortar and pestle for a jalapeno garlic and, uh,
[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:27.940]   looks like shallots and parsley and peppers.
[01:44:27.940 --> 01:44:29.900]   So he just needs better friends.
[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:30.900]   Mm hmm.
[01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:34.020]   I'll just point out that his dad has never said that.
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:36.140]   Um, none of my friends have said that.
[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:38.100]   Oh, that was a chimichurri sauce.
[01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:39.100]   I got it.
[01:44:39.100 --> 01:44:40.860]   We made chimichurri very good.
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:43.660]   Bang, bang by the Joe Cuba sextet as his music.
[01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:46.660]   Has Hank come to you to fund opening a restaurant yet?
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:48.900]   No, but I will the minute he wants one.
[01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:49.900]   Yeah.
[01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:50.900]   Look at that.
[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:53.100]   I told him you should be a celebrity chef.
[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:54.100]   Thanks Diane.
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:55.100]   Yeah.
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:56.100]   Yeah.
[01:44:56.100 --> 01:44:57.100]   Anyway, moving on.
[01:44:57.100 --> 01:45:00.700]   Like he enjoys cooking or does he just enjoy being on TikTok?
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:02.580]   He loves to cook.
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:03.580]   Okay.
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:07.180]   And he also loves what he, one of the things he really loves is video editing.
[01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:11.180]   So a lot of this for him, the passion in this is he just loves doing the, oh, he had
[01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:13.340]   a crawfish boil last weekend.
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:14.340]   Ooh.
[01:45:14.340 --> 01:45:15.340]   Yeah.
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:20.940]   With help from his friends at the Louisiana crawfish company, lacrawfish.com.
[01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:21.940]   Wow.
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:22.940]   Yeah.
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:24.940]   Look at that.
[01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:29.220]   The funniest story I think I've read in a long time is it was the Wall Street Journal
[01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:31.340]   talking to these people doing crawfish broils.
[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:32.340]   Yeah.
[01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:37.020]   Because they saw it on TikTok and these quotes for people and they're just like,
[01:45:37.020 --> 01:45:40.980]   I opened the box and they were still moving or alive.
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:45.860]   They're talking about getting their crawfish and they're like, we didn't realize that
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:47.780]   they, they can escape.
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:51.780]   We stuck them in the bathtub and soon they were everywhere and I have to be the quotes
[01:45:51.780 --> 01:45:53.620]   are just fantastic.
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:56.420]   Did someone say bless their heart?
[01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:57.620]   Bless their heart.
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:45:59.100]   I'm sure someone did.
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:00.100]   Bless their little house.
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:03.380]   You'd be careful when you got to go down in Orleans there, aunt.
[01:46:03.380 --> 01:46:05.900]   You could find crawfish following you on the street.
[01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:07.220]   It's totally fine with it.
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:08.700]   I know how to rip their heads off.
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:11.820]   LA crawfish company is not Los Angeles but Louisiana.
[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:13.020]   We should be very clear about that.
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:15.340]   I don't think there's any crawfish in Los Angeles.
[01:46:15.340 --> 01:46:17.500]   I don't know what it's going to be.
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:19.500]   And I wouldn't need them.
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:20.500]   Yeah.
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:21.940]   I'm like, who's with that aunt?
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:22.940]   Wise.
[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:24.700]   That and gas station sushi.
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:27.980]   You just don't know LA crawfish gas station sushi.
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:28.980]   Same thing.
[01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:33.660]   Google has started to use mom for its vaccine search results.
[01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:36.740]   But I think you last said it was going to be like three years before they'd use it.
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:37.740]   So what is mom?
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:45.380]   It's the multitask unified model, a new technology by Google to answer complex search queries.
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:46.540]   Which goes back to your prior.
[01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:50.300]   Oh, I just want a simple search engine that just gives me the results.
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:55.500]   So mom is being used to correctly identify over 800 keywords people use to search for
[01:46:55.500 --> 01:46:56.500]   vaccines.
[01:46:56.500 --> 01:46:57.860]   This is what matters.
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:04.580]   Things like AstraZeneca, Coronavac, Moderna, Pfizer, Sputnik, you know, all different
[01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:10.540]   terms to get you to where you really want to go, which is where can I get one of these
[01:47:10.540 --> 01:47:12.580]   damn things.
[01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:17.140]   They have 800 variations of vaccine names in 50 languages.
[01:47:17.140 --> 01:47:20.860]   Mom identifies them in a matter of seconds.
[01:47:20.860 --> 01:47:24.580]   And after validating mom's findings, Google applied the search results so people could
[01:47:24.580 --> 01:47:32.060]   find timely high quality information about COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:35.740]   Mom is the vaccine is just the beginning for mom.
[01:47:35.740 --> 01:47:42.140]   It's the only confirmed application, but they plan to use mom in other ways, especially
[01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:47.820]   since they've gotten some information about how mom works from doing it, this vaccine search
[01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:50.660]   results.
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:58.820]   It's a task unified model.
[01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:03.100]   Sounds like it depends or I don't know.
[01:48:03.100 --> 01:48:04.700]   It was an I don't know.
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:07.340]   It sounds like I don't know much about it other than what you just said.
[01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:09.620]   So I'm like, what are the kids call that?
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:11.100]   That every time I see the drug.
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:12.100]   The shruggi.
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:13.100]   The shruggi.
[01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:14.100]   Do the shruggi.
[01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:15.100]   Oh, well, the shruggi.
[01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:17.100]   Or I don't know.
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:18.100]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:19.100]   I don't know.
[01:48:19.100 --> 01:48:27.460]   It's just this one is this what they use to have you talk to an alien or something?
[01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:28.460]   Oh, was that mom?
[01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:30.460]   No, no, no, no, that was something else.
[01:48:30.460 --> 01:48:32.980]   That was the talking to Pluto or the paper airplane.
[01:48:32.980 --> 01:48:33.980]   Yeah, that was it.
[01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:34.980]   Yeah, that was.
[01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:35.980]   Yeah, that was it.
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:36.980]   Yeah, that was it.
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:37.980]   What was that?
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:41.100]   That was definitely it was just how do they demonstrate mom?
[01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:43.580]   I can't remember what what I remember that.
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:44.940]   I don't remember mom.
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:45.940]   I must have been high.
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:48.100]   Maybe it was two years ago.
[01:48:48.100 --> 01:48:51.900]   Well, I didn't watch all of Google I/O, so it's possible.
[01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:53.940]   Jeff and I did every--
[01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:54.940]   It's good.
[01:48:54.940 --> 01:48:55.940]   Every--
[01:48:55.940 --> 01:48:57.580]   Yeah, I had to record shows or something.
[01:48:57.580 --> 01:48:58.580]   I had a job.
[01:48:58.580 --> 01:49:02.940]   Hey, did you know Google Messages now lets you star messages?
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:05.020]   Favorite them so you can find important texts?
[01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:06.020]   Yeah.
[01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:08.020]   That's good.
[01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:09.020]   Yeah.
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:13.020]   And finally, this is actually really good.
[01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:17.780]   All right, everything I've said about Google, I take back.
[01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:25.380]   There are many, many people in the United States suffering from insufficient food.
[01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:30.980]   And Google is now using Google Search to help them.
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:35.980]   Feeding America estimates a number of people without reliable access to food is 45 million
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:43.300]   people in 2020, 15 million of them, a third of them, children, one in seven Americans.
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:47.700]   So there is a new site called Find Food Support Site.
[01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:52.980]   It helps you find a food bank, supplemental nutritional assistance program, food stamps
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:56.940]   applications, school lunch pickup, and more.
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:01.100]   They're working with the US Department of Agriculture, NOKID, Hungry, and Food Finder,
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:08.860]   90,000 places with free food support across all 50 states.
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:13.860]   People have tweeted this and it's now just automatic.
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:15.660]   Well, Google is so rich.
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:17.220]   Why don't they feed people?
[01:50:17.220 --> 01:50:19.940]   You want to do everything else that you want to feed the world.
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:21.900]   They're trying to help doing something nice here.
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:24.500]   It's a good thing.
[01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:25.500]   That's our problem.
[01:50:25.500 --> 01:50:26.500]   Our problem is society.
[01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:32.700]   If we're not taxing things right and taking care of our poor people, that's on all of
[01:50:32.700 --> 01:50:33.700]   us.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:36.740]   I usually respond to that with what are you doing?
[01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:37.740]   What have you done lately?
[01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:38.740]   Yeah.
[01:50:38.740 --> 01:50:42.660]   When was the last time you brought some food down to the food bank?
[01:50:42.660 --> 01:50:45.580]   What this really is, is kind of a specialized search page.
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:47.100]   And I think that's fantastic.
[01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:50.540]   Find food support dot with google dot com.
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:54.940]   Which also goes to your earlier point about this.
[01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:58.500]   This is separate from search results.
[01:50:58.500 --> 01:50:59.580]   This is great.
[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:02.140]   And I think Google maps do a hundred earths.
[01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:03.340]   Yeah, why not?
[01:51:03.340 --> 01:51:04.500]   That's fine.
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:10.380]   You can even surface those search results saying, oh, you're looking for food support.
[01:51:10.380 --> 01:51:11.940]   We have a page just for you.
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:12.940]   That's fine.
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:14.860]   I don't have a problem with that.
[01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:15.900]   I think that I don't.
[01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:23.780]   My biggest problem is with Google using its huge market cloud to push stuff when it should
[01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:25.780]   be a priesthood.
[01:51:25.780 --> 01:51:29.060]   It should be as kind of neutral as possible.
[01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:30.060]   It's a business.
[01:51:30.060 --> 01:51:31.060]   Well, I know it's a business.
[01:51:31.060 --> 01:51:33.020]   That's why the government should take it over.
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:34.020]   No.
[01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:39.020]   That's the Google change log.
[01:51:39.020 --> 01:51:42.660]   I'm going to replace this theme with the international.
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:44.660]   It's kind of to the moon Alice.
[01:51:44.660 --> 01:51:50.420]   I think it's become the honeymooners of of the twit, you know.
[01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:55.820]   Do you want to see a hilarious hearing as Florida tries to defend its ridiculous social
[01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:58.820]   media law in court?
[01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:05.220]   A live tweet of the preliminary injunction hearing in net choice versus Moody where the
[01:52:05.220 --> 01:52:08.900]   court should hear arguments about whether Florida should be enjoined from enforcing its
[01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:13.900]   unconstitutional, blatantly unconstitutional social media law.
[01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:18.580]   And apparently Ari Cohn is tweeting this.
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:23.100]   He's a First Amendment defamation lawyer, free speech, cancel attack, Friedman.
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:24.100]   Follow him.
[01:52:24.100 --> 01:52:34.060]   You know, he's saying, "Hey, I'm trying to see if I can find the example."
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:35.580]   Yeah, it is.
[01:52:35.580 --> 01:52:43.220]   And the judge is just non plus to get him again.
[01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:46.980]   Judge during the legislative process, people were talking about social media being monopolies.
[01:52:46.980 --> 01:52:50.900]   I scratched my head at that compared during a mayoral campaign, the Miami-Herald's control
[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:55.980]   over news about the election over Facebook's control over a mayoral election today.
[01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:59.540]   Judge, the Herald had much more control than Facebook has today.
[01:52:59.540 --> 01:53:00.700]   I didn't pick this up.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:03.260]   Go back to the earlier argument because I don't want to.
[01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:07.780]   But if you're the floor of the lawyer in this case, this is what was begging you again
[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:11.700]   and again and again.
[01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:16.660]   It's obvious it will get overturned.
[01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:19.380]   But it's been more than we shall see.
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:23.500]   Are you listening to my show, "While You're Doing My Show?"
[01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:24.500]   That was my voice.
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:27.500]   That was an ad on my page.
[01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:28.700]   It just popped up with...
[01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:29.700]   For me?
[01:53:29.700 --> 01:53:30.700]   Yeah.
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:31.700]   Wow.
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:34.700]   That's like, "Anson, how does he produce it?"
[01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:35.700]   Wow.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:41.860]   That never happens on air, though.
[01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:48.740]   Germany's privacy czar says ministries should just shut down Facebook pages.
[01:53:48.740 --> 01:53:49.860]   Shut down.
[01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:51.860]   Shut down.
[01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:54.420]   Any particular pages or...?
[01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:57.220]   Just that these services just aren't up to their privacy standards.
[01:53:57.220 --> 01:54:00.500]   So let's pull down government attempts to talk to the citizens.
[01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:01.500]   Wow.
[01:54:01.500 --> 01:54:07.540]   He also said, "Clubhouse, TikTok, and Instagram have similar shortcomings and recommended
[01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:09.420]   government organizations stop using them."
[01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:10.420]   Well, that's reasonable.
[01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:12.420]   Back in your eternal shell government.
[01:54:12.420 --> 01:54:13.420]   Yeah.
[01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:17.860]   We don't need that.
[01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:21.500]   BuzzFeed goes public.
[01:54:21.500 --> 01:54:23.100]   BuzzFeed's going public.
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:24.100]   It's a spec.
[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:25.100]   I'm spec.
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:27.580]   Wait, are we still in the changelog?
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:29.060]   Did I miss the end of the changelog?
[01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:30.060]   No, we ended the changelog.
[01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:31.580]   We had played the drums, so we did the whole thing.
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:32.580]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:36.660]   I have like four hours of sleep last night, so I'm just like, "What is happening?"
[01:54:36.660 --> 01:54:39.100]   You know what?
[01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:40.100]   Let's get right to the pic.
[01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:42.100]   So I can ask you one quick question.
[01:54:42.100 --> 01:54:43.100]   No, no, no, no.
[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:44.900]   We could talk about that was not a setting.
[01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:45.900]   No, it's done.
[01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:46.900]   I'm finished.
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:47.900]   I'm done with that.
[01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:49.700]   I have to go pick up my car.
[01:54:49.700 --> 01:54:50.700]   I was just confused.
[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:51.700]   No, no, I have to go pick up my car.
[01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:52.700]   No, no, I'm not.
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:53.700]   I'm sorry.
[01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:57.300]   Listen, if I don't go in the next 10 minutes, Lisa's going to go without me and I will have
[01:54:57.300 --> 01:54:58.620]   to walk to the dealership.
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:55:01.220]   So that's all we're going to talk about right now.
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:03.340]   It's time coming up next.
[01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:04.340]   What?
[01:55:04.340 --> 01:55:05.340]   He has to get out.
[01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:08.100]   Yeah, well, guess who's in charge here, buddy, boy.
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:09.700]   When Ant this week.
[01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:10.700]   Well, Ant is actually.
[01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:11.700]   Ant's always in charge.
[01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:13.620]   He's always going to say boo to him.
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:18.220]   But yeah, and John has some cloud as well.
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:21.140]   Coming up, picks of the week.
[01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:26.100]   Let's start our picks of the week with Stacey's thing.
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:31.260]   Okay, this week's thing is, well, this isn't really a recommendation.
[01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:32.260]   Chocolate chip cookies.
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:33.260]   I hope it is.
[01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:35.220]   Yes, those are delicious.
[01:55:35.220 --> 01:55:37.100]   No, this is Amazon's.
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:42.620]   Today, everyone can get access if you're one of the eight people who are still wearing
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:47.060]   their Amazon halo or still subscribing to the service.
[01:55:47.060 --> 01:55:50.900]   You can now access Amazon's movement.
[01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:51.900]   I have my halo.
[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:53.500]   I haven't worn it in months.
[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:57.140]   Okay, so charge it up because this is a really interesting service.
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:00.100]   It is their movement health service.
[01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:05.500]   So what you do is you've got your halo, you've got your app on your phone, set the app to
[01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:10.700]   record you, and then you do a series of prescribed exercises, like five quick exercises, like
[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:13.220]   lunges, bends, that sort of thing.
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:15.780]   And then it's going to say, oh, you know what?
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:18.660]   It looks like your stretching is not awesome.
[01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:23.060]   We're going to try to make you a little more flexible in your legs or, oh, you don't, you're
[01:56:23.060 --> 01:56:26.300]   having a hard time balancing and your left side looks weaker.
[01:56:26.300 --> 01:56:27.300]   So it'll tell you these things.
[01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:33.100]   And then it prescribes like my, my prescription is like, I think it's about five to seven
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:37.220]   minutes long of exercises that I'm supposed to do three times a week to boost my week
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:38.220]   left side.
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:39.980]   What do they, is this the movement health thing?
[01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:40.980]   What do they call?
[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:41.980]   Yes.
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:42.980]   That is what that is.
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:43.980]   Oh, that's really interesting.
[01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:47.460]   And then so I've been trying this for about a week now.
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:51.260]   And they say like after two to four weeks come back and they'll run through the test
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:53.220]   again, see if you've gotten better.
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:55.420]   And this is all for a wristband.
[01:56:55.420 --> 01:56:58.020]   Well, it's a camera and a wristband.
[01:56:58.020 --> 01:57:00.540]   Oh, oh, you have to do this in front of the camera.
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:01.540]   Yeah.
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.540]   That makes sense.
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:03.540]   Okay.
[01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:05.140]   Yeah, it's not that much of it.
[01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:10.940]   It's comparable they say to a professionally minestrated functional movement screen.
[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:11.940]   Yeah.
[01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:18.900]   So, I mean, this isn't, this isn't like this will help you beef up your like biceps.
[01:57:18.900 --> 01:57:23.260]   This is to be like, Hey, you're getting old and you're having a hard time walking.
[01:57:23.260 --> 01:57:24.540]   I know that already.
[01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:25.540]   Thank you.
[01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:28.260]   Actually, like for people with Parkinson's.
[01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:29.820]   No, no, this is great.
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:32.860]   People announced this as well with the Apple Watch.
[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.660]   They're going to do gate analysis.
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:38.300]   If you look like you are about, you might be fall prone.
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:39.340]   They're going to let you know.
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:40.820]   I think this is really good.
[01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:41.820]   Yeah.
[01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:42.820]   I have, I know.
[01:57:42.820 --> 01:57:48.780]   This is an indication of like trying to take the data from fitness trackers to a more useful
[01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:49.780]   level for more people.
[01:57:49.780 --> 01:57:50.780]   All right.
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:52.860]   I'm going to put my halo band back on.
[01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:55.940]   I guess I've been paying for it because that was automatic, right?
[01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:59.460]   Well, you know, Amazon gave it to people for free.
[01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:00.460]   Like the first six months.
[01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:04.380]   And then I know I got it again for another six months because I don't think enough people
[01:58:04.380 --> 01:58:07.260]   were like really going for dollars a month after that.
[01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:09.580]   Like, you don't recall the coffee.
[01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:11.700]   I thought you were paying for it.
[01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:12.700]   I probably am.
[01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:14.460]   I didn't stop it for anything.
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:17.500]   I just never wear the darn thing.
[01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:18.860]   I'll get the, I'll open up the app.
[01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:20.060]   It'll tell me.
[01:58:20.060 --> 01:58:21.780]   Anyway, very cool.
[01:58:21.780 --> 01:58:22.900]   I'm going to, I want to do this.
[01:58:22.900 --> 01:58:26.020]   This is a great idea because I am getting old.
[01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:29.420]   So we, I think we talked about that earlier in the show.
[01:58:29.420 --> 01:58:30.420]   You alluded to it.
[01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:31.420]   Yes.
[01:58:31.420 --> 01:58:32.420]   Getting.
[01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:33.420]   All right.
[01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:34.420]   All right.
[01:58:34.420 --> 01:58:35.420]   All right.
[01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:36.420]   All right.
[01:58:36.420 --> 01:58:37.420]   All right.
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:38.420]   Neck it off.
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:39.820]   Way's gay.
[01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:45.020]   It's time for Jeff Jarvis's number of the week.
[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:48.740]   I'm the bait.
[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:50.420]   How about I do my thing of the weekend?
[01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:52.420]   Then you can do that first.
[01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:54.860]   I wanted to show you yet another search engine.
[01:58:54.860 --> 01:59:04.500]   As from if two former Googlers, Shridhar Ramaswami and Vivek, Raghu Nafan, they worked at Google
[01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:06.100]   in the ad division.
[01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:10.300]   They thought they should start a new paid search engine.
[01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:11.940]   So they didn't have to do any ads.
[01:59:11.940 --> 01:59:14.100]   It's called Niva N-double-E-V-A.
[01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:16.540]   Currently free.
[01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:19.860]   It will be $5 a month.
[01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:21.820]   It's very easy to install.
[01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:25.700]   It has Jeff, you'll love this dark mode.
[01:59:25.700 --> 01:59:27.700]   Or not.
[01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:28.700]   Or not.
[01:59:28.700 --> 01:59:29.700]   Or not.
[01:59:29.700 --> 01:59:31.900]   Will you install something?
[01:59:31.900 --> 01:59:35.780]   You can have a, so you can just use it at niva.com.
[01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:40.060]   Once you have an account, you could also install a Chrome extension, Firefox extension, you
[01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:41.460]   have a Riving extension.
[01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:43.340]   Let me do a search that you guys would know.
[01:59:43.340 --> 01:59:47.380]   By the way, it says trackers be gone in the search window.
[01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:48.380]   What would be a good search?
[01:59:48.380 --> 01:59:49.940]   Should I search for Jeff Jarvis?
[01:59:49.940 --> 01:59:50.940]   Sure.
[01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:54.500]   Yeah, because you know, you know, a pizza would be good.
[01:59:54.500 --> 01:59:55.500]   All right.
[01:59:55.500 --> 01:59:56.820]   So there you are with the Twit artwork.
[01:59:56.820 --> 01:59:58.540]   Here's a picture of you, American journalists.
[01:59:58.540 --> 01:59:59.540]   I hate that picture.
[01:59:59.540 --> 02:00:00.540]   I saw this one.
[02:00:00.540 --> 02:00:01.540]   I know it's hard to get rid of these.
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:02.540]   I hate that.
[02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:05.740]   I hate the pictures that Google chooses.
[02:00:05.740 --> 02:00:08.180]   This is kind of, they do some kind of fun things.
[02:00:08.180 --> 02:00:14.300]   For instance, you can get up to four months free by doing various little things, including
[02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:18.300]   connecting an app, creating your first space, conducting a tour.
[02:00:18.300 --> 02:00:19.300]   Yeah.
[02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:22.260]   And here's Buzz Machine by Jeff Jarvis.
[02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:23.700]   So this is your appearance on Buzz Machine.
[02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:24.700]   There's your wiki.
[02:00:24.700 --> 02:00:26.500]   So there's a pretty good pizza is a good one too.
[02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:29.260]   Let's see what they do with pizza.
[02:00:29.260 --> 02:00:30.260]   Pizza.
[02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:31.940]   Now I did say you can use my location.
[02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:34.820]   So they're going to show the location of pizza.
[02:00:34.820 --> 02:00:37.700]   Pizza, I'm dropping those are the first things to come up.
[02:00:37.700 --> 02:00:39.180]   And those aren't ads.
[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:40.180]   Those aren't ads.
[02:00:40.180 --> 02:00:42.500]   Yeah, but I'm saying this is bad.
[02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:45.740]   For some reason they're giving me the 10 best pizza places in Tampa.
[02:00:45.740 --> 02:00:49.260]   So go to Google now and look at search for pizza.
[02:00:49.260 --> 02:00:50.260]   OK, OK.
[02:00:50.260 --> 02:00:53.020]   Oops, I'm sorry.
[02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:55.700]   I have to go to Google.com.
[02:00:55.700 --> 02:00:59.780]   I made the Neva my default search here.
[02:00:59.780 --> 02:01:03.140]   I actually like Neva so far, but it's very early days.
[02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:04.140]   So this is local.
[02:01:04.140 --> 02:01:05.140]   Pretty pictures.
[02:01:05.140 --> 02:01:07.140]   Well, yeah, OK.
[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:08.140]   My map.
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:09.140]   Not dark mode.
[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:10.140]   It didn't pull up pizza.
[02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:11.140]   Actually, there's pizza hut.
[02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:12.420]   There's dominoes.
[02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:16.940]   So by the way, those are the first searches I should point out.
[02:01:16.940 --> 02:01:17.940]   They're not ads.
[02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:19.940]   Oh, wait.
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:22.260]   Did you mention that Neva cost $5 a month?
[02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:23.260]   I did.
[02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:24.260]   Yes, yes.
[02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:25.260]   Thanks for listening.
[02:01:25.260 --> 02:01:26.260]   OK.
[02:01:26.260 --> 02:01:27.260]   I'm sorry.
[02:01:27.260 --> 02:01:28.260]   I was interested.
[02:01:28.260 --> 02:01:29.700]   I was telling my daughter to get me more chocolate chip.
[02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:31.100]   Good reason I like that.
[02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:32.100]   Oh, OK.
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:33.100]   All right.
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:34.100]   That's good.
[02:01:34.100 --> 02:01:35.660]   The reason I like that is because that's their business model.
[02:01:35.660 --> 02:01:36.660]   It's not.
[02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:37.660]   Yeah.
[02:01:37.660 --> 02:01:38.660]   I was going to say that's really great.
[02:01:38.660 --> 02:01:39.660]   Yeah.
[02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:40.660]   Yeah.
[02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:41.660]   I don't know if people do that.
[02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:47.900]   You can also, by the way, tell it which news sources you want to see in your start page.
[02:01:47.900 --> 02:01:53.380]   So there's some you can-- you know, I've thumbed up a few and thumbs down a few.
[02:01:53.380 --> 02:01:55.940]   I like that.
[02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:56.940]   I don't know.
[02:01:56.940 --> 02:01:57.940]   I think this is worth taking a look at.
[02:01:57.940 --> 02:02:02.620]   Much as I thought it was interesting to see what Brave is doing.
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:06.580]   What I'm really interested in is how many startups there are attempting to compete with
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:07.580]   Google.
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:11.260]   I think that tells you something, especially since they're all privacy focused like DuckDuckGo
[02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:13.660]   and Neva and Brave.
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:17.540]   So anyway, here's another one to take a look at.
[02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:19.380]   N-W-E-V-A.com.
[02:02:19.380 --> 02:02:20.880]   So far so good.
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:24.580]   How long you think they'll be around if you would have looked into your crystal ball?
[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:28.580]   It depends on how much runway they have, doesn't it?
[02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:30.540]   So what are the odds it's here to here?
[02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:31.540]   All right.
[02:02:31.540 --> 02:02:33.620]   I think it probably will be here in a year.
[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:36.540]   I think so.
[02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:37.940]   I have a six month free trial.
[02:02:37.940 --> 02:02:40.460]   So I mean, you can connect.
[02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:43.460]   So I wonder how much you should find in half to afford that.
[02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:44.540]   These are the apps.
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:46.660]   I connected Google Dropbox and Slack.
[02:02:46.660 --> 02:02:49.140]   What's nice is that is now in my search results.
[02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:55.460]   So they index my Gmail, my Dropbox files and my Slack messages because I gave them permission
[02:02:55.460 --> 02:02:56.500]   I might add.
[02:02:56.500 --> 02:02:58.620]   And then that will show up in my search results.
[02:02:58.620 --> 02:02:59.620]   I kind of think that's nice.
[02:02:59.620 --> 02:03:01.300]   You're going to have different workspaces.
[02:03:01.300 --> 02:03:03.380]   So I have a tech news workspace.
[02:03:03.380 --> 02:03:04.380]   Save for later workspace.
[02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:06.580]   You can have more of them.
[02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:08.740]   You could choose your news providers.
[02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:12.020]   You can see, you know, this is where you turn on and off dark mode, Jeff.
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:13.660]   Oh, isn't that nice much better?
[02:03:13.660 --> 02:03:14.660]   Don't you like that?
[02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:15.860]   I feel so much better.
[02:03:15.860 --> 02:03:17.140]   So much brighter.
[02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:19.060]   You could turn on this by Mr. Gibson.
[02:03:19.060 --> 02:03:21.500]   Yeah, I know.
[02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:22.500]   I didn't.
[02:03:22.500 --> 02:03:23.820]   I don't know what he would do to vet it.
[02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:24.820]   It's not open source.
[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:27.900]   So it's not like you could, you know, vet it.
[02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:29.340]   It has an incognito mode.
[02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:34.980]   I mean, you know, it's a matter of trust that they're doing what they're doing properly.
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:38.860]   Mostly I the only thing I care since I've tied Google to it, by the way, I see my calendar
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:40.420]   over here.
[02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:43.500]   The only thing I would like to see is how good the search results are.
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:45.580]   And so far, I think they're not bad.
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:50.700]   I was weird to see Domino's and Pizza Hut up top, but it was also the first search results
[02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:53.460]   on Google after I got the local search results.
[02:03:53.460 --> 02:03:55.860]   Are they also using Google's API?
[02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:56.860]   No.
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:03:58.460]   What's the story on this?
[02:03:58.460 --> 02:03:59.460]   I forgot now.
[02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:05.100]   Let me let me go back to the fast company.
[02:04:05.100 --> 02:04:07.100]   They have a 60 person staff.
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:08.100]   X Googlers.
[02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:12.940]   They've secured 77 million in funding from Graylock and Sequoia.
[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:15.940]   So they do have some runway.
[02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:21.020]   The main thing is no trackers, no ads, but where are they getting their search from?
[02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:23.460]   That's the question.
[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:26.460]   I don't know.
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:30.340]   It's fascinating.
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:33.540]   I just wonder how much money is in the bank right now.
[02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:35.660]   Oh, one other thing you'll like, Jeff.
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:41.020]   20% of top line revenue will be turned over to publishing partners, including Quora and
[02:04:41.020 --> 02:04:42.020]   Medium.
[02:04:42.020 --> 02:04:45.020]   I can't stand Quora.
[02:04:45.020 --> 02:04:48.860]   Jeff, you're full of opinions.
[02:04:48.860 --> 02:04:50.660]   Like you're not?
[02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:55.900]   Isn't it like the number one search engine for an planet?
[02:04:55.900 --> 02:04:57.260]   Here's something else you won't like.
[02:04:57.260 --> 02:04:59.220]   Scott Galloway is an investor.
[02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:02.460]   Oh, I think that man is hilarious.
[02:05:02.460 --> 02:05:03.460]   I'm sorry.
[02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:04.460]   Scott Galloway.
[02:05:04.460 --> 02:05:09.020]   I'm very interested.
[02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:11.820]   I like seeing this.
[02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:16.940]   I'm sure somewhere in here they talk about where the data is coming from.
[02:05:16.940 --> 02:05:22.020]   That's the biggest barrier to entry right now is how do you build an index as good as
[02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:23.020]   Google's?
[02:05:23.020 --> 02:05:25.860]   Well, again, that's what I was trying to say earlier.
[02:05:25.860 --> 02:05:27.380]   I'm not sure that's the real barrier.
[02:05:27.380 --> 02:05:33.660]   They hired Udi member who is a big key search guy.
[02:05:33.660 --> 02:05:37.100]   He left Google because he was frustrated with ad subsidized search.
[02:05:37.100 --> 02:05:45.180]   So that's a big acquisition.
[02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:46.660]   I don't know.
[02:05:46.660 --> 02:05:47.660]   I apologize.
[02:05:47.660 --> 02:05:51.140]   I should have figured that out before I got to it.
[02:05:51.140 --> 02:05:53.180]   I like a lot of the features.
[02:05:53.180 --> 02:05:56.620]   It knows your zip code, but that's all.
[02:05:56.620 --> 02:06:03.260]   Anyway, just not saying this is the right thing to do, but it's certainly worth taking
[02:06:03.260 --> 02:06:04.260]   a look at.
[02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:07.380]   I like the idea of all three of these new.
[02:06:07.380 --> 02:06:11.340]   And I love the idea of DuckDuckGo as well.
[02:06:11.340 --> 02:06:12.740]   Let's see.
[02:06:12.740 --> 02:06:18.300]   Yeah, I'm scanning through the article to see if they talk about this is Harry McCracken's
[02:06:18.300 --> 02:06:22.900]   story about it, which is as I would expect from Harry, very thorough.
[02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:23.900]   Which makes it harder.
[02:06:23.900 --> 02:06:24.900]   I like him.
[02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:30.780]   Yeah, makes it harder for me to find that information.
[02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:33.100]   Jeff, now I've given you some time.
[02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:34.100]   How about that number?
[02:06:34.100 --> 02:06:44.180]   Accenture came out with an information packed report and slides about the state of newspaper
[02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:45.940]   revenues.
[02:06:45.940 --> 02:06:51.460]   And one headline to me, which I put in the thread that I have there in the list, is that
[02:06:51.460 --> 02:07:00.660]   they say that over this period of 2004, 2018, search had a 51.4 billion growth, dollar growth
[02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:02.540]   in revenue.
[02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:06.820]   Duck says Accenture, three quarters of that came from new business, small businesses couldn't
[02:07:06.820 --> 02:07:08.700]   afford media before.
[02:07:08.700 --> 02:07:13.380]   And the other quarter came from directories and B2B and trade and they insist Accenture
[02:07:13.380 --> 02:07:17.060]   does that it didn't come from newspapers and magazines.
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:22.940]   Meanwhile, of course, newspapers lost at Effie and Fortune over this time from a high
[02:07:22.940 --> 02:07:28.060]   of $60 billion revenue to a present in 2018 of $27 billion.
[02:07:28.060 --> 02:07:32.860]   So a half drop in revenue.
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:35.860]   Most of that came through classifies.
[02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:40.020]   In 2004, newspapers had 81% of classifies.
[02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:42.300]   Now they have 11% of classifies.
[02:07:42.300 --> 02:07:46.060]   And the total market is about the same, $22, $24 billion.
[02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:49.300]   But that doesn't include all kinds of new ways to do classifies that aren't just having
[02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:54.780]   listings, subscriptions for job sites and revenue shares and all kinds of other things
[02:07:54.780 --> 02:07:56.740]   that people have done.
[02:07:56.740 --> 02:08:04.340]   But CERC revenue is fairly, circulation revenue is fairly standard, though the online revenue
[02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:06.140]   is only $0.8 billion.
[02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:11.060]   And as we've said before, two thirds of that goes to three, count them three brands in
[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:15.940]   America, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post.
[02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:17.420]   So I don't think that's that much.
[02:08:17.420 --> 02:08:19.660]   Because if you think, well, okay, CERC revenue is holding steady.
[02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:20.660]   That's pretty good.
[02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:21.300]   Well, they had a building-
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:22.300]   Yeah, building-
[02:08:22.300 --> 02:08:23.300]   Good play advertising revenue.
[02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:25.300]   It's way too good to drop.
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:27.700]   It's in the tank, a tanker room.
[02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:28.700]   Yeah.
[02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:36.100]   And even if you look at CERC revenue, my tenth post, which is from Max sales, not from this,
[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:42.540]   is that changes in multi-traffic before and after Trump left office, boring news is yielding
[02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:47.940]   a lot less traffic for especially extreme sites, but also mainstream sites.
[02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:49.660]   No, Trump was good for everybody.
[02:08:49.660 --> 02:08:52.220]   Well, that's the conflict of interest, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:08:53.220]   Yeah.
[02:08:53.220 --> 02:08:55.300]   Well, I've lost my ride.
[02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:57.540]   So you might as well take your time now.
[02:08:57.540 --> 02:08:58.540]   Oh, sorry.
[02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:07.140]   I'll be walking over to Ford now.
[02:09:07.140 --> 02:09:09.340]   And now at Pruitt-
[02:09:09.340 --> 02:09:12.660]   What was that thing you used to have?
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:13.660]   A bicycle?
[02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:15.060]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:16.060]   A segue?
[02:09:16.060 --> 02:09:17.060]   Segue, don't you?
[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:18.060]   Do you still have your segue?
[02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:21.860]   Yeah, I do, but it's at home.
[02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:25.460]   I can walk home, get on the segue, then go over to the Ford dealer.
[02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:29.140]   Sure, but the Ford dealers between home and here.
[02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:32.980]   It's actually not that far to walk, so maybe I'll just do that.
[02:09:32.980 --> 02:09:34.620]   Ant, you have some things.
[02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:37.620]   All right, I'll try to be brief.
[02:09:37.620 --> 02:09:38.620]   Fairly.
[02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:39.620]   Sorry, I already went straight around.
[02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:40.620]   Oh, now he's going to go to a new one.
[02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:41.620]   Hey, thank you, Tom.
[02:09:41.620 --> 02:09:42.620]   We're going on.
[02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:44.620]   Hey, we want to play some Valheim.
[02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:45.620]   I'm up.
[02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:47.180]   If you are.
[02:09:47.180 --> 02:09:50.220]   You got the time.
[02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:52.620]   My first pick is Adobe.
[02:09:52.620 --> 02:10:00.020]   I saw an article on their blog, and a photographer decided to ask some pretty, you know, knock
[02:10:00.020 --> 02:10:06.620]   away questions of the photographer community and ended up turning them into hashtags and
[02:10:06.620 --> 02:10:09.940]   it's basically a reflection of life.
[02:10:09.940 --> 02:10:16.460]   And if you click up the story, it would basically say, "Well, you know, I can't find a story."
[02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:17.460]   I got it.
[02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:18.460]   I got it.
[02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:19.460]   I got it.
[02:10:19.460 --> 02:10:21.060]   It was on the Create Life Cloud.
[02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:22.060]   Life reflected.
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:23.060]   Life reflected.
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:29.020]   So if you have, say, inspiration and ask someone to take a photograph of inspiration,
[02:10:29.020 --> 02:10:31.060]   you know, what would they come up with?
[02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:36.100]   And he accepted these different images and did some post-processing on them.
[02:10:36.100 --> 02:10:39.580]   But the post-processing is one thing, but what was more interesting.
[02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:42.420]   I find the images where people came up with.
[02:10:42.420 --> 02:10:43.420]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:10:43.420 --> 02:10:44.420]   Right.
[02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:45.420]   The images are beautiful.
[02:10:45.420 --> 02:10:47.140]   And it's a wide range of topics.
[02:10:47.140 --> 02:10:52.060]   And I thought this was a pretty cool project from Adobe and the photography community.
[02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:53.060]   Excuse me.
[02:10:53.060 --> 02:10:55.980]   And that is Life reflected.
[02:10:55.980 --> 02:10:56.980]   Nice.
[02:10:56.980 --> 02:10:57.980]   Really?
[02:10:57.980 --> 02:10:58.980]   Second.
[02:10:58.980 --> 02:11:03.100]   That's at CreativeCloud.Adobe.com under the Discover heading.
[02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:04.740]   That's right.
[02:11:04.740 --> 02:11:12.100]   And the second one, I remember last year when we talked about Trumpetine, the guy Andy Harris
[02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:17.100]   that did the voiceovers reading Trump's tweets.
[02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:18.700]   I don't remember that.
[02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:20.460]   Oh, I think I'm blacked out.
[02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:22.020]   Like, he did it for a Palpatine.
[02:11:22.020 --> 02:11:23.740]   Oh, Emperor Palpatine.
[02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:24.740]   That's right.
[02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:25.740]   I do remember that.
[02:11:25.740 --> 02:11:26.740]   Yes, yes, yes.
[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:37.620]   Well, he has teamed up with Will Ferro's company, Big Money Players, B&P, and has started a podcast
[02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:41.060]   called This Is American's Live.
[02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:44.940]   And it's basically like a spoof of NPR's.
[02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:47.380]   Oh, David, I got to hear this.
[02:11:47.380 --> 02:11:51.420]   Which one should I start with the first one or start with the one I linked there?
[02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:52.420]   It is attachment.
[02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:53.420]   Oh, funny.
[02:11:53.420 --> 02:11:54.420]   Gina Grad.
[02:11:54.420 --> 02:11:56.620]   So this is parody of the NPR style.
[02:11:56.620 --> 02:11:57.700]   All right.
[02:11:57.700 --> 02:11:58.700]   Let's hear it.
[02:11:58.700 --> 02:11:59.700]   Let's just hear a little bit.
[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:00.700]   Hi, guys.
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:01.700]   I'm Remy Bader.
[02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:03.700]   And I'm Connor Wood.
[02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:09.460]   And we're here to tell you about our new podcast, Talk Yell with Remy and Connor.
[02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:11.640]   So each week we're bringing up some of the hottest...
[02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:13.160]   This is not a real podcast.
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:14.160]   That's an ad.
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:15.160]   That's an ad.
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:16.160]   Yes, skip ahead.
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:17.160]   Skip ahead.
[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:18.160]   Skip ahead.
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:19.160]   Scared ad?
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:20.160]   Scared creators and celebrities to get a new podcast.
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:21.160]   All right, I can't skip ahead.
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:22.160]   Can I?
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:23.160]   No.
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:24.160]   Wait a minute, maybe I can.
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:26.820]   You shouldn't ever skip ahead in a podcast.
[02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:28.260]   You should always listen to all the ads.
[02:12:28.260 --> 02:12:29.260]   Here we go.
[02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:30.260]   This is true.
[02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:31.260]   I listen to them.
[02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:32.260]   All the ads, folks.
[02:12:32.260 --> 02:12:33.260]   All the ads, folks.
[02:12:33.260 --> 02:12:37.660]   And the all-powerful, all-knowing, random sentence generator, which inspires the stories you're
[02:12:37.660 --> 02:12:38.660]   about to hear.
[02:12:38.660 --> 02:12:45.180]   Yes, whenever you hear this sound, the next sentence you hear is a random sentence provided
[02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:48.500]   by our revered, un-dependent, and independent sentence generator.
[02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:50.660]   For more, this is Americans Live.
[02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:53.540]   Listen to more episodes of this American Live.
[02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:54.540]   I guess.
[02:12:54.540 --> 02:12:55.540]   And now, American Live.
[02:12:55.540 --> 02:12:56.540]   Yes.
[02:12:56.540 --> 02:12:57.540]   Got it.
[02:12:57.540 --> 02:13:01.740]   As the years pass by, we all know owners look more and more like their dogs.
[02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:03.780]   Was this just another case I'm sticking to identity?
[02:13:03.780 --> 02:13:05.980]   Or did this dog actually look like its owner?
[02:13:05.980 --> 02:13:07.980]   Sweetheart really has her at a yost.
[02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:08.980]   Okay.
[02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:09.980]   This Gerald looked like me.
[02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:13.900]   I think you favor each other, but I would ignore what everybody else is saying.
[02:13:13.900 --> 02:13:14.900]   It gets better.
[02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:15.900]   You're not twins.
[02:13:15.900 --> 02:13:16.900]   It's not like you're conjoined.
[02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:18.820]   You weren't birthed together.
[02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:19.820]   You just favor each other.
[02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:20.820]   So we do.
[02:13:20.820 --> 02:13:22.660]   Look, it's very sweet.
[02:13:22.660 --> 02:13:26.660]   I mean, you both have the craziest sort of golden-slex hair.
[02:13:26.660 --> 02:13:29.060]   Yeah, that's how they do the whole show.
[02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:30.060]   They never random-sips.
[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:32.300]   And then that's the props for the intro.
[02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:35.460]   I was looking at me and I said, "No, you do not look like a dog."
[02:13:35.460 --> 02:13:37.460]   You do look like a dog.
[02:13:37.460 --> 02:13:41.220]   Let me ask you guys, when you think it was the first time that you noticed that maybe
[02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:43.780]   your dog was an owner.
[02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:46.220]   Well, when I, anyway, when I write-
[02:13:46.220 --> 02:13:48.220]   Sounds like you are.
[02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:49.220]   I robot.
[02:13:49.220 --> 02:13:51.180]   The I robot.
[02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:55.020]   This is Americans Live.
[02:13:55.020 --> 02:13:56.620]   Not this American Life.
[02:13:56.620 --> 02:13:57.620]   Correct.
[02:13:57.620 --> 02:13:58.620]   Yeah, I like it.
[02:13:58.620 --> 02:13:59.620]   This is Americans Live.
[02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:03.940]   They're improv comics, Aristotle, ATHRY, ATHRY, ATHRY, and Andy Harris.
[02:14:03.940 --> 02:14:04.940]   That's awesome.
[02:14:04.940 --> 02:14:05.940]   I'm going to have to listen to this.
[02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:06.940]   Thank you.
[02:14:06.940 --> 02:14:07.940]   Good recommendation.
[02:14:07.940 --> 02:14:10.140]   Yeah, so funny.
[02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:15.980]   And lastly, before my studio starts to make me sweat in here, I wanted to give a shout-out
[02:14:15.980 --> 02:14:20.060]   because this is the end of June and this is Pride Month and this has been on my brain
[02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:22.300]   a little bit.
[02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:25.460]   I've been here almost two years now to be two years next week.
[02:14:25.460 --> 02:14:26.460]   I can't believe that.
[02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:27.460]   That's amazing.
[02:14:27.460 --> 02:14:32.260]   And I hope to come out now.
[02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:34.260]   Is this all about coming right now?
[02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:36.180]   Okay, just checking that.
[02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:37.180]   This is not that.
[02:14:37.180 --> 02:14:39.980]   But I'm just saying I've been through it almost two years.
[02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:47.420]   And I think about my experiences here and how much I've learned in three years ago, quite
[02:14:47.420 --> 02:14:50.700]   frankly, I would have never thought twice about Pride Month.
[02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:53.220]   This is just the reality of it.
[02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:58.460]   But being here and being further exposed to different things in just day-to-day life,
[02:14:58.460 --> 02:15:04.060]   it's really opened my eyes and making me check myself even down to...
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:09.580]   There are times I'm out in public at the store and I'll say, "Yes, ma'am.
[02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:11.340]   No ma'am," or, "Yes, sir."
[02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:12.340]   No, sir.
[02:15:12.340 --> 02:15:13.940]   And sometimes I have to check myself.
[02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:19.340]   And I feel bad about that even down to how I answer some emails that come in from PR and
[02:15:19.340 --> 02:15:20.340]   whatnot.
[02:15:20.340 --> 02:15:25.420]   And because I don't know how those photos are identifying from a pronouns standpoint.
[02:15:25.420 --> 02:15:27.420]   I have to check myself and tell myself.
[02:15:27.420 --> 02:15:28.420]   Good for you.
[02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:29.420]   I'm just thankful of that.
[02:15:29.420 --> 02:15:30.420]   I just want to say to everybody.
[02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:31.420]   We're all learning that though, man.
[02:15:31.420 --> 02:15:32.420]   We're all learning that.
[02:15:32.420 --> 02:15:33.420]   Yeah.
[02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:34.420]   So just...
[02:15:34.420 --> 02:15:35.420]   I just want to give...
[02:15:35.420 --> 02:15:38.380]   Just show that community some love and say, "You know what?
[02:15:38.380 --> 02:15:43.500]   I'm learning and I'm still working in it and I just want to show my love."
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:44.500]   That's great.
[02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:46.820]   Well, we love you, Ant Pruitt.
[02:15:46.820 --> 02:15:49.340]   Listen to his latest hands-on photography.
[02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:54.340]   Chicken head in our chat room is saying you're going to love the Lisa Carney photo tips.
[02:15:54.340 --> 02:15:55.980]   Oh, I love Miss Lisa.
[02:15:55.980 --> 02:15:57.180]   She's great.
[02:15:57.180 --> 02:15:59.380]   They were so good.
[02:15:59.380 --> 02:16:00.380]   And she is raw.
[02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:03.860]   Oh, I can't wait now.
[02:16:03.860 --> 02:16:06.220]   And you're so raw.
[02:16:06.220 --> 02:16:08.100]   I return the compliment.
[02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:13.860]   We are so glad to have you and you've taught us an awful lot about grace, about style,
[02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:15.620]   about being a good human being.
[02:16:15.620 --> 02:16:17.540]   So thank you for being part of our family.
[02:16:17.540 --> 02:16:19.980]   We really, really appreciate it.
[02:16:19.980 --> 02:16:22.820]   Ant Pruitt, twit.tv/hop.
[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:27.020]   If you want to watch the latest hands-on photography, they're all there.
[02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:29.620]   Thank you to Jeffrey Jarvis.
[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:35.340]   He is the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Krewr.
[02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:37.260]   Great, great, great.
[02:16:37.260 --> 02:16:42.460]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of Blob operas.
[02:16:42.460 --> 02:16:47.780]   And he is also Frank Sinatra Colomabum and a former team e-guide critic.
[02:16:47.780 --> 02:16:48.780]   And he's the best.
[02:16:48.780 --> 02:16:50.900]   Bill Cosby hated me and that's important today.
[02:16:50.900 --> 02:16:51.900]   Yes.
[02:16:51.900 --> 02:16:52.900]   Yes.
[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:54.980]   I think Bill's coming to get you right now.
[02:16:54.980 --> 02:16:56.780]   It was Mike.
[02:16:56.780 --> 02:17:00.620]   It was his first thing he wanted to do when he got out of prison.
[02:17:00.620 --> 02:17:01.620]   So I'm going to get that jar.
[02:17:01.620 --> 02:17:02.620]   That's so big.
[02:17:02.620 --> 02:17:03.620]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:17:03.620 --> 02:17:04.620]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:17:04.620 --> 02:17:09.340]   You know what the one Sinatra once called a bomb, that one.
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:10.340]   That one.
[02:17:10.340 --> 02:17:14.460]   Sinatra was right.
[02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:20.140]   And ladies and gentlemen, we always want to make sure that everybody understands that
[02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:26.140]   this show is really just a vehicle for Stacey Higginbotham to be herself.
[02:17:26.140 --> 02:17:29.140]   We love Stacey Stacey and IOT.com.
[02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:31.500]   Make sure you subscribe to the newsletter.
[02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:32.740]   Listen to the other podcast.
[02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:33.740]   We won't mention that.
[02:17:33.740 --> 02:17:36.220]   Anyway, great to have you Stacey.
[02:17:36.220 --> 02:17:37.220]   Appreciate it.
[02:17:37.220 --> 02:17:38.220]   Stay cool.
[02:17:38.220 --> 02:17:40.220]   We do this week.
[02:17:40.220 --> 02:17:43.300]   You're listening to the other podcast, but you won't mention that.
[02:17:43.300 --> 02:17:44.300]   What was that?
[02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:46.780]   We won't mention that podcast.
[02:17:46.780 --> 02:17:48.940]   You do with Kevin Tofel, the IOT podcast.
[02:17:48.940 --> 02:17:49.940]   Oh, okay.
[02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:51.740]   I was like, I was like, are you?
[02:17:51.740 --> 02:17:53.140]   I'm just teasing.
[02:17:53.140 --> 02:17:54.940]   Everybody knows that show.
[02:17:54.940 --> 02:17:56.420]   That's a great show.
[02:17:56.420 --> 02:17:58.900]   A great show.
[02:17:58.900 --> 02:18:02.020]   We do this show as such as it is.
[02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:06.340]   Every Wednesday, 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern 2100 UTC.
[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:11.740]   You can watch us do it live at twit.tv/live if you're watching live or listening live because
[02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:13.340]   there's audio there too.
[02:18:13.340 --> 02:18:20.100]   You can chat live, get all the senses engaged at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:18:20.100 --> 02:18:27.060]   You can also chat live in our Discord, which is a lot of fun, as you can see.
[02:18:27.060 --> 02:18:31.380]   I don't know what that animated GIF is all about, but I'm sure I'll find out when I
[02:18:31.380 --> 02:18:32.780]   go back and look at it.
[02:18:32.780 --> 02:18:36.900]   This Discord is fun because it is our club Twitch members.
[02:18:36.900 --> 02:18:39.180]   You have to pay $7 a month to get in there.
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:42.300]   You also get ad-free versions of all of our shows.
[02:18:42.300 --> 02:18:49.700]   You even get a fabulous Twit+ stream with stuff that does not normally show up on the airwaves
[02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:51.500]   here.
[02:18:51.500 --> 02:18:55.460]   Things like our Untitled Linux show, which is every Saturday in the Discord.
[02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:57.540]   All of that available at twit.tv/club-twit.
[02:18:57.540 --> 02:19:02.900]   It really is just about giving us a little extra support, which we greatly appreciate.
[02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:07.740]   Our YouTube channel and all the other links to various podcast players are at the website
[02:19:07.740 --> 02:19:10.260]   twit.tv/twig.
[02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:16.100]   You can download any episode there, listen, or watch at your convenience.
[02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:20.660]   If you do, subscribe to the podcast player, which really is the best way to listen.

[02:19:23.300 --> 02:19:24.780]   Let the world know.
[02:19:24.780 --> 02:19:27.340]   You listen to this week in Google.
[02:19:27.340 --> 02:19:28.340]   Thanks everybody.

[02:19:38.180 --> 02:19:43.300]   Well, every week on Tech News Weekly, my co-host, Micah Sargent, and I, Jason Howell, speak
[02:19:43.300 --> 02:19:47.740]   to the people who are making and breaking the biggest tech news of the week.
[02:19:47.740 --> 02:19:49.180]   We're talking with journalists.
[02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:50.740]   We're talking with industry veterans.
[02:19:50.740 --> 02:19:55.020]   Often, we're talking with the people who are responsible for the story.
