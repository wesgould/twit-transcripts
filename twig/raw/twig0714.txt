[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.360]   All right, actually yeah Stacy science your art. It's perfect. It's perfect and then
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.780]   Where does that what is that leave for the letter to our professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.600]   Newmark
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.860]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. He's got his galley. So those are the galleys galleys for the Gutenberg
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.320]   Perinthath
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.620]   Yeah, I was not sure because usually galleys have many many Post-it notes in the mind in the margins
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.480]   But you have just to make the change and if oh, it's too late. That's the oh, yeah, I actually I thought that's not the authors
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.480]   That's the authors copy not the
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.280]   This last you should never read it after after you thought I put something in my I
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.640]   Cut and paste a paragraph into my post about Bensmith's book, which by the way is very good. Which I also oh, yeah
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.320]   I have that on pre-order. Yeah, that means it's and my mom's now
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.840]   I've and I found a typo in the paragraph that I cut and paste
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.560]   So maybe you should just have cut and paste the whole book and then you would have quickly found
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.640]   Yeah, all the typos all the errors. This is very good. This is very good. Oh, I can't wait to read it
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.880]   I wrote a post about it on medium. I'd love to get Ben on one of the shows
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.080]   He's too big. He's too big a big shot probably
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.360]   What's wrote the book? Yeah, it's first one. You know, it's gonna be on on Sunday Stacey your your colleague from Gigome yanko Rickers
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.960]   Yanko he was gonna be my pick of the week. Okay, good. I won't say anything then
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.200]   Your pick of the week is gonna be on Sunday
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.080]   He deserves it all exactly speaking of new books. Yeah, I think yanko's great
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.960]   And I can't wait to have my way. This is you know, it's funny last Sunday
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.280]   Kind of without planning it. We had the perfect panel for
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.200]   The blue sky adventures
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.960]   We had it Jeff was on which was just happened to have four people who actually were in blue sky which helped
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:47.120]   Yeah, I want to be in blue sky. I haven't invite I'll send you if you want to I wish I could I wish I could send you my account
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.800]   Can I jump in here and ask a question yeah
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.240]   She wants to be in blue sky. Yes, but why but but why not mess it on
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.760]   Because blue sky looks more familiar to what I'm more familiar and less work on my aunt
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.000]   So it's just a t-shirt that it's wearing regardless of what's under the t-shirt
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.160]   No, I think it's a t-shirt that doesn't have a lot of complicated snaps and issues with it that I'd have to you know and it's a t-shirt
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.080]   But I wear like a t-shirt to be fair you raise this point in our Twitter community in our forums that
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.680]   normal people are baffled by Mastodon whereas if you're already on Twitter blue sky
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.720]   It's just like Twitter in fact there is that's why normies like post-doc news till they thought I was boring right look familiar
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.320]   well, and I have to point out that
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.420]   Blue sky has kind of the same flaw as
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.560]   Post-doc news, which is at least for now. It's centralized and it's got Jack Dorsey all over it
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.000]   I
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.620]   Have to say a noster pardon me. He's on no stir. He's not a blue sky. He's all well. He's on both
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.760]   He's he's on no stir you and he's funded both right he put money into both
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.640]   No stir is another
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.080]   Attempt to capitalize on Twitter's failure
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.680]   And it's also decentralized in theory, but not in practice
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.480]   neither blue sky nor no stir yet is
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.000]   Yeah federated
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.440]   Whereas Mastodon is and every time I go on a blue sky. I go why it's starting to be a lot like Twitter
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.640]   And I don't know it's it's and I mean that a good way pixel, huh?
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.080]   It's like pixel for pixel like Twitter
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:40.040]   Yeah, well not only looks like it, but but it all of the poop. I see the people I already follow. Yeah. Yes
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.840]   That's exactly what they did. That's exactly on
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.800]   See I thought it the whole time this was was federated decentralized in theory. It will be but it is not yet
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.440]   It is really at this point exactly like Twitter. They sent it's invite only
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.480]   But they sent out enough 50,000 that they got you know and there you know
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.160]   they already have a
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.000]   CNN anchor on there who's mentioning
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.800]   What they call skits, which is the horrible
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.040]   Jade is not one she does not like that the CEO doesn't like skits because it has a sexual connotation
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:22.960]   Right. I think it's kind of a cute name, but I think I thought it should have to go look up. No
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.080]   No, no, no, no, you know
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:31.240]   I wanted I don't I wanted to be bleeds because it's blue sky so should be bleeds. Oh, I like that
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.160]   You can have a little lamb anyway, it's too late. That's too late. Guess what?
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.800]   And in fact, that's kind of my reaction to blue sky like yeah
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.880]   They have all these great plans to be federated and have all sorts of moderation capabilities blah blah blah. It's too late
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:53.640]   I think I just had a fascinating discussion. I called Dave Weiner to interview him for the book I'm working on now. I
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.280]   Just got the phone with him
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.760]   And he said that the rochko at at mastodon had the benefit of being under the radar. Yes. Yes
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.080]   He said blue sky is out in place. It's gonna happen in two weeks. Yes, they're too public now
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.840]   There's speed running the moderation curve and Mike Massey. Yes, that's it would say yes
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.200]   And I think that's exactly it and and mastodon
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.920]   I kind of like because just as you say and it is a little kind of confusing so
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.440]   Only people are strongly motivated to be there there
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.320]   Which Stacy is it she doesn't want to be with us there. That's all right
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.560]   I you know, honestly, I think it's in a way. It's good that we have these choices because that auto very much
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.560]   So sorts the people
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.080]   And those of you who want to be on blue sky be on blue sky. That's fine
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:49.840]   There is one good thing the blue sky does which I actually think I wish mastodon did which it allows you to create your own
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.840]   Hand you know handle based on your a website that you control or a domain that you control so instead of being kind of
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.080]   Verification is that makes it like a REL?
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:06.600]   Sort of except that he's right there. So if you wanted so I was a Leo Laport at blue
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.280]   BSKY dot
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.880]   Socially whatever it was but you can easily go in there if you control if you have that it's very geeky
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.200]   But you have to it's harder to do than rail.me if you have a DNS control of a domain as
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.880]   I do for Leo Laport dot me you can make that be your handle. So if you search for
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.240]   Leo Laport dot me on blue sky or in theory it's federated
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.720]   Affiliates it will always be me because it's my that's mine
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.520]   So that is smart. So I could do it to Stacy Higginbotham. Yes
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.840]   Because I own that domain you could be as long as you control DNS you have to put a text field
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.880]   You happen to have someone in the house who's very knowledgeable. I bet you Stacy can do it
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.040]   It's just a text she's done. No, Andrew will do it. Yeah. Yes
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.760]   There's that I wasn't gonna soon. I mean you don't have to say he does handle all of that
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:01.200]   So I don't have to I have to you have other things worry about different things more important
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.760]   You tried others Leo if you tried spoutable or an no, I don't want to be I've I'm really done with the scent with centralized
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.720]   I think what Elon did Twitter is is very likely to happen to others and
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.160]   There's a favor of the I got on blue sky
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.920]   Had high hopes for still do I guess I like the AT protocol. There's nothing wrong with it
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.840]   But I'm I'm more I use blue sky the more I'm happy I am
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.720]   About Mastodon. I just I really think this is my home
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.840]   And I can read my home feed now Mastodon. I've followed enough people I figured out
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.720]   You know there's enough good people on there that I could follow this and really get everything that I want from
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.440]   Mastodon Twitter
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.320]   I still go to Twitter once in a while because you know if you want to know what's happening at the Met Gala
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.800]   That's that's not is not the place to go
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:58.920]   There was a roach. I saw the roach video and I what I really loved was all the cameras following the roach up the steps of the Met Gala
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.960]   Horrible rest of the wasn't but here's the question
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.120]   Was it really a roach or was it just doja cat in into skies?
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:12.720]   It was Jared leto's third costume third outfit
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:19.440]   He went as a cat as did doja cat, but I know he went as shoe-pet. It's very important
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.000]   It's not just any cat. It's the cat Carl's cat Carl's cat
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.560]   I don't really want to honor Carl because I think he was a loathsome individual very nice designer
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.040]   but not such a nice guy and
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.960]   Body-shamed people and all sorts of stuff and I total total jerk. Yeah
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.360]   So anyway, but we're not good
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.560]   We talked about the Met Gala last year and got a lot of heat so no fashion
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:50.520]   No fashion. I was gonna ask Stacy for a tour of the Met Gala and they've come off. Okay. What was your favorite outfit?
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.920]   mine oh
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:57.880]   I'm embarrassed to admit that Lisa and I
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.920]   Pulled up the Vogue livestream of it
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:07.760]   Friday, no, I watched it. I watched that and I mean it's awesome like doja cat did a lot of work on the fake
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.760]   I like those yeah
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.600]   but my favorite all-in outfit was probably actually bat bunnies tucks because
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:25.680]   You don't see a lot of innovation in a tux and his tucks was white and normal in the front and then backless in the back and
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.840]   Then his handlers also had a backless tuck and they did some cool jewelry action
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:35.440]   And then he had that beautiful flower cape. I kind of liked Pedro Pascal's
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.920]   Look
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   No, no, he didn't like that
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:45.600]   That did the least that's the only thing I saw is Adam. The sorry was Pascal
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:51.200]   Yeah, my my friends see it in its daddy's a doodly a doors. Here's bad bunny
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:58.560]   I like it now wait till you get the back. Yeah, hold on. You're gonna see it. Maybe see get a turn around
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:04.720]   I hope so turn around. Otherwise. What's the point? It looks very stiff. Oh, that's weird. Oh, why that's very I like it
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:10.400]   I you'd never see interesting things in menswear and that I feel could be doable. All right moving right
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.400]   I am really sorry. I did not mean
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.520]   To get sucked into the vortex
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.960]   There's okay. I gotta show you Pedro Pascal's just so you know what musicals
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:25.040]   Oh, they hate it in Jared Lido show him chupette show him the cat costume. Okay. That was amazing
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, he had underneath that a regular outfit that was cool, too. This was his regular outfit
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:36.580]   Where he looks like the prince of darkness. Let's see if they have his genel money did a good job, too
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:41.840]   Love genel monies on brow. Yeah, can you believe a little nas X and I won't turn him around
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.520]   I was just like oh my god. He was scampering around like a little puck. Oh, my gosh
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:51.240]   The mask was really cool. It was really cool. It's quads. Look at this is the mass
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:57.920]   Oh, yeah, no, I told I said Lisa. He's got a better but than you do, but that was not well to say his butt is really
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.920]   That wasn't taking well
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   I
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:08.120]   He did and he doesn't I might add okay. Just want to be clear about that boy. Where is where is
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.360]   I would just Google Jared Lido chupette. Oh, yeah, that's a good idea
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:18.800]   Sorry, it was a good. Yeah, this is the musical theater of
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:27.180]   How do you spell chupette CHOU CHOU U CHOU
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:35.800]   ETT okay Google will fix it for you like that they had the face was really well. I mean the face was excellent
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:43.040]   Yeah, very believable. I mean when he showed up everyone was like what he was dancing around
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.000]   Chupette and there he is I got a question for you
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.100]   So between I saw buzzfeed did a feature about what they wore at the gala and then at the afterparty
[00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.440]   And they also had another outfit for the after parties. So they have like a locker room. They all say
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.080]   Did you not read okay?
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:06.800]   The New York Times did this great thing ahead of one of the big like the Grammys or something and it was all about how they
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.360]   Get them dressed they drive them in a sprinter van standing up
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.720]   must
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.560]   And then they go to a hotel
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:22.400]   They've all booked a hotel that's near the venue and then they go back and they change into their second look of the night and
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.160]   This is by the way
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:33.120]   Late stage capitalists is this is the end of the Roman Empire. I think they were doing something like this this and the coronation this weekend
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.280]   Oh God
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.680]   The coronation I decided I'm gonna live to the coronation. Oh no. Oh
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.360]   Are you gonna do to anybody here want to do the
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:47.480]   Pledge of allegiance to the king the new king. Oh, isn't that obnoxious?
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:54.880]   No, read the room Chuck. I don't even do the pledge of allegiance to you know to your own country our flag traitor
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.160]   They the
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:02.440]   Amusing ourselves to death says John exactly
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.520]   exactly
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.320]   the archpishes of can archpishes
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.720]   Yeah, the archpish of Canterbury
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:18.920]   The I call him the arch bay myself of Canterbury said if you wish during the coronation there will be a period of time
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.440]   I guess the last time this happened was 1956 right so we don't have a lot of history
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.520]   on how this is done in in the past
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:35.200]   The nobles would pledge their allegiance to the new monarch on bend and knee, you know my liege Lord and all that very medieval
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:42.560]   But in the new modern social era the archbish of Canterbury says you can all do it
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.200]   We're great when you we do it on TV. Just repeat along
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:55.000]   I've heard it. It's the end times. I'm hearing the noise of the world collapsing. Is that what you're talking about?
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.880]   I'm hearing a bit. I'm hearing a bit. It did it. Yeah, a warring. Can you guys fix it? Worrying?
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.640]   It's gone now. It's gone. Sorry. I brought it up
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:11.840]   It was probably on its way to be fixed, but this is what happens behind the scenes folks. This is breaking the fourth screen here
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.600]   Live to the coronation. That's the title of the show already we have it
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.760]   You have to be able what time to do that. Oh really do we have to be a early day?
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:27.200]   I am UK time. Oh, that is three AM are time here. Yeah
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   Actually, I don't know if it's 11 AM. Hold on here is time is the coronation
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:39.920]   Well, the car. Oh, believe me. It's all day. I mean, you're gonna be able to get up at four in the afternoon
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.320]   It'll still be going on. I'm sure
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.600]   Because he needs more love
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.920]   That's so depressing. Let's talk about Google
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:56.640]   Google is very much in the news today. In fact, the biggest story really should be in the changelog, but I'm not going to bury the lead here
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.040]   this morning I got up early and
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.040]   Signed up for past keys or Google has turned on
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.440]   past keys
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.520]   For your Google accounts. This is the new
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:14.000]   passwordless technology that the Fido Alliance has been rolling out Google Apple many other companies
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.600]   uh, you know kind of saying they support it
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.560]   um
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:24.480]   So yeah, and what you do if you go to your Google account
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:31.040]   First you have to pay for wired then you go to your Google account
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.840]   Which as you know, I have paid for but I still get this no matter what
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.880]   Um, let me go to google.com/
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.160]   What is it my account security
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.000]   I'll try security security. We keep your personal information. Oh, they're gonna make me log in
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.880]   Nope, they're not. Okay
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.560]   Your account is protected if I go into the security settings
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:00.320]   It will say I it's and you can see you can show this there's nothing nothing I had I
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.960]   Added a past key at 609
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.840]   this morning
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:12.880]   And uh, oh you already recognized it. It says what so I don't care. I want to see it new past key added to your account
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.600]   If you didn't add past key somebody made me use your account iPhone
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.400]   So now my iPhone is my google login
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:24.800]   And all I have to do when I want to log into google is do the biometrics on the iphone in this case face ID
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.680]   And i'm logged in no password required. No second factor required
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:34.160]   Uh, and some a number of people have said, you know, do you really want that?
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.960]   This isn't that new because I noticed I have other past because I have a total of four past keys
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:44.240]   On my account and the reason being oh and look at this. I guess I do have to still do a password
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.280]   so uh the reason being
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:54.160]   When I got my google pixel on my sam song they kind of were added as the single sign-on
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:57.040]   Masters of my account
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:02.320]   So some people complain that the issue is what if you lose your phone?
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:08.320]   Right. I think the best way i had but there's I mean, what are your thoughts on that?
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.200]   Well, don't because
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:18.640]   Did i have like recovery codes? Yeah, you have all the same you know, you're not giving up any of the other ways you had to log into google
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.800]   Okay, so you're adding a new password to your account, right?
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.960]   Yeah, you still have all of that stuff
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:28.560]   But the risk if you lost your phone and it wasn't locked or somebody could figure out your
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.280]   uh screen and of course the wall street journal has been going crazy over this at like
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:38.720]   I don't I don't know how legit it is that oh my god people are shoulder surfing you getting your
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.840]   Your login and then stealing your life and they have like three people has happened too. I don't think it's that common
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.240]   Yeah
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.680]   Thank you, man. Yeah, show them have to say it or if you stole my phone with it
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.120]   Unlocked like I unlocked it and then I put it down on the bar
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:56.800]   And then you just snarfed it and kept it unlocked
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.440]   Well at that point
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.080]   But see you still need the face ID when I go to google
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.480]   surfing
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.520]   Shoulder surfing my passcode to get into the phone
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:12.080]   Like looking over your shoulder to see that yeah, you've never heard that phrase. Yeah
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.720]   No, that's
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:20.560]   Yeah, that's why well you can thank shoulder surfing for the dots that you always get when you're trying to hit her password
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.360]   And you can see what you're entering
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.680]   That's to prevent shoulder surfing
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.920]   So if I'm logging into my gmail account on
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.560]   The web on my computer
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:38.240]   What the process for me then looks like I then pick up my phone and well that's always been here
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.160]   Yeah, you've probably seen that when you're google when you go to your google account
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.080]   Uh
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.880]   After you enter the password the two factor can also be logged into your phone
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:53.120]   You've seen that right? Yeah, I yeah, I have I have two factor on my right so i'm just trying to figure out what the normal
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.760]   This eliminates that experience with this is I think
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.640]   that will eliminate the
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   password part
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.560]   One on one so i've been trying different ways it did not happen here
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:10.800]   And one of the ways what on one of my systems I got a QR code which I then had to use
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.360]   on the pass key enabled device
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.200]   to
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.200]   Enable the new advice device
[00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:23.520]   But I noticed here that they want my QR code with your yeah, yeah, okay
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:29.520]   Uh, so that that's in theory how pass cues would work if you went so let's say you sign up for the macy's
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.560]   site
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:36.560]   Uh, you could it could show you a QR code which you would then use your pass key your phone is now your pass key, right?
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.920]   Uh, your phone has this in you know, pass key store
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:46.880]   And you would then scan the QR code the phone would do face ID or touch ID and the and macy's would let you in without a password
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:52.400]   That's the idea is that the equivalent of doing sign in with google so google's gonna now know exactly where i'm signing in
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.000]   If i stand with that's an interesting privacy question. Don't even think of that right?
[00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:02.320]   Is it stored on device or is this cloud based that was my question so not all pass keys go through google
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.920]   Okay, okay, pass keys is not a google thing. It's a it's a phyto alliance thing
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.640]   Right, um, but if google is running
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:18.560]   No, in fact, even when I log in with pass keys to google i cloud stores the key not google
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.920]   So the device stores the key
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.120]   And apple does not know
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.960]   What I have in my pass key storage. No, that would violate the whole process
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:35.200]   That's a secure so baby. Basically google's now allowing this pass key to use to sign into its sites
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.120]   Yes, and if you use a google phone, it's a secure enclave on the google phone
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.520]   But it doesn't not get it passed on to google. I don't think no i'm sure it doesn't got it
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.240]   That would that would mean it's not secure to be stupid
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.960]   May I add something here? Yes
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.920]   Yes
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.840]   Yeah, I mean if you think mastodon is complicated
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:01.840]   No, no, no, no, that's not it. Okay. Guess why i'm at guess why jeff is me. Oh, because you have a work
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:06.800]   You have a work worksheets account whatever it's called work place account. Oh, right?
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.480]   Does it not work with that?
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.800]   No, and so it says well see your administrator
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.720]   Well, i'm the administrator where's a mirror and then I go I try to search for
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.200]   Workplace or whatever the hell it's called this week and pass key and there's nothing
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:26.000]   There's not like even out of luck sucker or wait or nothing. I'm the second class citizen again google
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.600]   So that's something like this seems like it should roll out
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.200]   Exactly first before we're going out to do regular folks like me right right?
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.440]   Right effect on our school aunt
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.920]   We were not compliant and everybody in the whole school had a two-factor so we could be
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.680]   compliant with google standards right higher higher security
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:50.480]   And and so would they have us on what they would I guess argue our lower standards now
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:53.200]   pisses me off google
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:58.720]   Are you staying here? Are you eating a sponge or is it just a really big cookie?
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:05.760]   Sorry, that was me
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.840]   All right back to past keys
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:14.160]   So long this is the google blog google security blog post so long passwords. Thanks for all the fish
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:18.560]   little uh tip of the hat to the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.400]   Starting today you can create and use past keys on your personal
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.560]   Not workspace
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.560]   Personal google account when you do google
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:31.360]   Will not ask you for your password or two-step verification when you sign in
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:37.920]   Um, you know in a way, this is like a ubiki or a you know a hardware security key
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:43.440]   The differences to the hardware security key I can have a value you should have a backup key and let's safe at home or
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:48.000]   Somewhere secure. So if you lose the one key you still got the backup key
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.240]   Past keys they say are more convenient and safer alternative to passwords they work on all major platforms and browsers
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.080]   And this is the mechanics allow users to sign in
[00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:04.080]   By unlocking their computer or mobile device with their fingerprint face recognition or a local pin
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.560]   So now you're it's a it's a past key and says that that device
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.680]   Is is like a security key. It's the past key
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:19.600]   And I guess the transition from old device to new device will be fairly seamless as long as you still have your original past
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:24.480]   Yeah, so when I set this up on the iphone. Oh, that's a good point. Well when I said that yeah, this is a big issue
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:28.160]   When I set this up on the iphone google said, okay your ikloud
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.040]   Secure enclave now has the key
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.760]   So that's up to apple now to give me a way to migrate that
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.200]   And oh she's I don't think they're it. I think this is a little complicated to be honest
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.520]   um
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.560]   App I think apple will let you export it to or move it to another apple device
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.320]   But I don't think they have a mechanism for moving it to an android device
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.040]   No, I don't yeah, right
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.200]   And we
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.760]   Forgive me if i'm wrong and if someone if i'm wrong, please correct me
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.600]   um
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.600]   Hello, they will
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:09.360]   Yeah, no, I know but we've been talking about this no this started months ago, right with apples announcement and google's announcement
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.520]   And we've been talking about security now
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.600]   And we've talked about on this show and it's still a little fuzzy
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:23.040]   Uh, it says unlike passwords past keys can only exist on your devices again. This is google. They cannot be written down
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.240]   Or accidentally given to a bad actor
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:31.280]   When you use a past key to sign into your google account it proves to google you have access to your device
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:33.920]   And are unable to unlock it
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.120]   Together this means that past keys protect you against fishing
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:41.520]   Right because a bad guy doesn't have your device or the past key
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:48.960]   And any accidental mishandling the passwords are prone to such as being reused or exposed in a data breach, so that's the good news
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:54.640]   This is stronger. This is what google says and I don't know if I agree with this. This is stronger protection
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.560]   than most two factor of methods offer today
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.560]   Which is why we allow you to skip not only the password but also
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:05.600]   the second factor when you use past keys
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:14.320]   In fact past keys are strong enough they can stand in for security keys for our advanced protection program. That's quite interesting
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:20.720]   That's that's the program google offers to members of congress and other high target high value targets
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.720]   Uh, right extra protection. You have to have two hardware keys
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:31.600]   Uh, it's a very you know, it's and you lose a lot of functionality. So this is I guess if you believe all this this is good
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.440]   Creating a past key on your google account makes it an option for sign-in
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:41.440]   Uh, this is important existing methods including your password will still work in case you need them
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:47.200]   For example when using devices that don't support past keys yet. So really you could still fail back to the old way
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:52.560]   Past keys are still new and it will take some time before they work everywhere. However
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:58.480]   Creating a past key today still comes with security benefits as it allows us to pay closer attention
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.200]   Oh, that's interesting to the sign-ins that fall back to passwords
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:10.960]   So maybe they're gonna that's a signal. Maybe this isn't the most secure. Maybe this we should take a look at this over time. Well increasingly
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:16.400]   Oh now this this you could take two ways over time. We will increasingly scrutinize
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:23.600]   Password logins as past keys get broader support familiarity. They're kind of in a way doing what google often does
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:30.240]   Which is we are so anxious that you move to this more secure method. We're going to start deprecating or being suspicious of the old method
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:36.960]   Right, uh, oh and they are clear. They say that google does not in any way get access
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.520]   To this information and I think that that's the case with apple as well
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.200]   When I first saw this news the first thing that came to my mind was if I go to log into my
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.200]   Google account on a different laptop here at the house
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.080]   It does the little send the notification to
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.160]   Yeah, that's the sign on thing. Yeah, and I'm like
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:03.600]   Dang it and it always sends it to some other device to get up there to phone. It's right here
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:11.040]   So apple apple gets heat for doing the opposite it sends it to every device including the device you're using the log in at this moment
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.680]   Right. It says are you is that you? Yes, it's me
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.360]   So there I don't know what the right answer is on that
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.040]   Good security ant means you have to walk around your house
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:21.840]   Exactly
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.280]   Dude man that thing's in the car and it's sending it to the car
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.920]   Now it's so the other thing about past keys is you can create a past key for every device
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:36.400]   So okay, you can in theory have a past key on all your devices. You don't have to go up and get any device
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.200]   Okay, well that that I feel better now in addition
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:44.800]   Yes, go ahead. He says that you'll be able to store manage and use your past keys in one password
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.640]   Which would help with this moving from device to device one or no
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.800]   One password has announced support for this. I imagine all password managers will eventually
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:58.320]   There's a little caveat there because that was about as a if we're still into the password
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:02.480]   Yeah, well, it also it also yeah, of course, this is their way of staying current
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.680]   But you but how do you get the past key into one password?
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.360]   Since it's living in my secure uncle. Yeah, phone this requires apple
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:14.080]   To allow you to export it and currently they don't they allow you to move it but not export it
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.280]   I don't know this there's a lot of questions. This is stuff is brand new
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.280]   um
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.280]   For example, if you create this is again google
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:27.520]   In addition some platforms securely back your past keys up and sync them to other devices
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.840]   You own for example if you create a past key on your iphone that past key will be available
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.360]   On your other apple devices as long as you're on the same ikloud account
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.120]   That's why they call it an ikloud
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.680]   Past key because it's stored in the secure enclave in ikloud
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.120]   This protects you from being locked out of your account if you lose a device
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:50.400]   And it makes easier for you to upgrade so when I get a new iphone in theory the past key is is in the cloud and will be passed over
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.560]   To that I think that still lives in the secure hardware enclave on the device
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.960]   But I think it's copied from ikloud somehow
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:03.200]   If you want to sign in on a device for the first time a new device or temporarily use somebody else's device
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.480]   You can use a past key stored in your phone to do so
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.440]   You want to know how
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.680]   On a new device you just select I don't know because I've left out of it. Go ahead
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:18.880]   So your pixel isn't isn't on your personal account
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:23.680]   My personal account is my google account because that's how I could use buzz machine
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:29.440]   Got it on the new device. You just select the option to use a past key from another device and follow the prompts
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.240]   That's interesting. That's more like what you're used to
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.160]   And where you sign into google and this says oh go get your pixel
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.680]   Yeah, you can you can manually tell it. I want to do that
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:43.520]   But it doesn't this does not automatically transfer the past key to the new device
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.680]   It only uses your phone's screen lock and proximity so you just have to go get it
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.360]   And put it next to it
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:55.920]   I guess it's using bluetooth le or something to approve a one-time sign in if the new device supports storing its own past keys
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.840]   We can then ask separately. Oh, you want to make one on the new device
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.600]   So eventually I guess the premise is all your devices will have the past key. Yeah, right? I'm down for that. Yeah
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.840]   I just have this vision you kind of brought up handy if your car is working with this
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.400]   And you lose your phone and you can't get in your car to go home to find the thing in your locker at home
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.720]   To turn on the phone to get the car going and then you're screwed
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.920]   Well, I never lose your car keys
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.960]   You're screwed too. Well, you're not gonna have car keys anymore of the oh, oh dude. I just wrote about the digital
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:34.320]   Standard actually CCC. Yeah, the CCC. Oh, thanks. Yeah, so I was curious to hear your thoughts on it
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:36.320]   But anyway, we get to that
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:41.840]   But yeah, that's a digital car key. So that's totally different. Yeah, and I have a digital past key and it's horrible
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.920]   I wish I didn't well this one doesn't work like yours. It's a new
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:56.480]   Dog scares her so I'm not scared. I finally had a dog before let you know just in case you weren't sure
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.080]   That's like go go get you know what she might like that sponge you were eating
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:05.920]   So this is this is the past keys. This is my you could show this. This is my past keys
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.160]   interface so
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.120]   I had already unbeknownst to me basically had past keys
[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:15.200]   Android devices automatically create past keys for you when you sign in your google account
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.600]   So my galaxy has 23 ultra for some reason has two past keys as does my pixel seven
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:23.680]   And then this is the one I created this morning the iCloud keychain
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.000]   And then I have and it's in the same space. These are you bikies. These are the the hardware keys
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.560]   So any of those will work any these are all considered past keys
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:40.480]   So in effect and I think this is this to me makes sense your phone is like a hardware key
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.120]   It's like a you bikki and that makes sense, right?
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.080]   And as the same caveats and concerns
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:51.040]   Don't lose it a lot of people don't have you bikies. Yeah, and this is easier than you bikki
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.200]   Much easier and unlike a you bikki. I do have one you bikki
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.080]   That has a fingerprint reader on it, but it doesn't work very well with anything
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.720]   so
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:10.320]   Unlike the you because your fingerprints get old away as you get older. No, it's it's a it's a
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:16.960]   No, I don't have good fingerprints anymore. I never I can't even come into the country
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:21.760]   Without having to talk to someone. Yeah, that's why I don't wash dishes. I say least I
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.840]   Preserve my fingerprints
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:24.960]   Um
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:30.720]   Nice one. No housework for me my fingerprints are all so yeah, it wasn't it wasn't a knock on your age
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:36.160]   It was just like oh do fingerprints not work. I like to pretend to be offended. I'm never offended really
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:39.280]   um the you bikki fingerprint reader
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:45.440]   It's it's if it if it doesn't recognize your finger then it locks itself out
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.040]   And you have to launch the you bikki mitt. It's not a good solution
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.160]   So in a way, this is better because it is biometrics
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:58.000]   as opposed to just physically having the phone the phone also has to buy a map to be recognize you right so
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:04.880]   I guess it is more secure. I mean, I think it's I'm sure steve gibson will talk about this on tuesday on security now, but
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:08.080]   We and we've talked a lot about pescues and the
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.600]   Problems exporting pescues one of one of them
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:16.960]   There's no guarantee that you know apple will let you export your pescues for use on andrade for instance
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.280]   But I i'm glad i'll tell you what google doing this is a big story because
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.880]   This opens the floodgate. It's been around for months
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:29.520]   And a few sites have done it, but nobody really didn't microsoft do it
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.720]   microsoft was part of it. Yeah, they're part of it. Yeah, okay
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.480]   Yeah, and there is a directory of sites that support pescues
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:44.320]   But here's a dirty little secret of that most of the websites that support pescues took a shortcut and use the third party
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:52.320]   Of course to do the pescue not their own servers and so there's some question about whether
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:58.160]   Uh, that's many banks do you see on there? Oh none. No banks ever going to do this
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.120]   Best buy
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.000]   uh
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   De Narrow docu sign ebay
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.960]   google now kayak
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:13.920]   Microsoft and vidia octa. That's a security company pay pal there's pay pal
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.720]   Yep robin hoe. It's like a bank
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:21.840]   Shop pay there. I think it's to be a pastry company, but it's not this is me
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:29.440]   Paste everything pisses you off today. Yeah, and the funny thing is it even has a cake icon is as long as
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:37.600]   Mean that's just wrong virgin media the world of hi yahoo japan not yahoo anywhere else because that's separate companies
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.360]   So hoe
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.200]   Um, yeah, I don't see any I don't see b of a I don't see uh chase
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:51.600]   And you know what's sad about because banks still do bad with just regular tour fad a lot of banks are still sending out sms
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:59.520]   Yes sms for two f a instead of and the reason they do that is because they have those normal people that you keep talking about aunt
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.240]   That can't figure this stuff out
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:06.160]   Understandably and they understand getting a text message with a code
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:11.200]   And so I don't banks are very are not going to get rid of that even though they know it's less secure
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:16.800]   Because they don't want to handle the complications of if if I could find a bank that wouldn't do
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.480]   sms
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.320]   I would do it
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.520]   But as far as I know every bank does uh for that reason
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.080]   Anyway, so you can see there's only 41
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.240]   Sites right now that support paskies including google microsoft
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.400]   Even apple doesn't and here's the one password paskies demo
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:41.200]   And then this is where you can vote for paskies support. These are this companies that don't yet support it
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Apple amazon netflix

[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.800]   Thanks none of these supported adobe venmo booking dot com pro tailed mail, but you can vote for it
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.720]   Wasn't apple in particular be for this
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:02.720]   um
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.360]   Considering how they're always oh yeah, they're right behind it. Oh absolutely out in everybody about
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:11.760]   How bad their security is versus apple security seems like they would be
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:16.000]   That's why i think they're watching what happens with google
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.600]   So it was one of those after you alphons. No after you yeah, they it was okay
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:28.720]   Let google get and it's right for google to do this. I think let them get all the complications and the complaints and
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:35.040]   You know make everybody feel better and then i think apple and microsoft will do it. Microsoft already has a shift jarvus rants
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.600]   Yeah, it's a jeff jarvus rants
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.680]   so
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.640]   One password is actually has is one of the big companies that does this back end support
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:52.160]   so a lot of times when you go to a site and they're doing past keys they're not even doing it which
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:58.000]   i'm not crazy about it so they're i don't know i mean do you really want
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.920]   s by
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.320]   Right handle it in your past keys right
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:07.840]   Well in theory it would be good because i mean all that that would be is authentication for their site
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.240]   it wouldn't give you a
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.240]   but now because
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:17.040]   A centralized thing would have uh past keys for a bunch of places that's more consistent well, but if
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:20.000]   If you because if it's stored
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.640]   If it's stored in a secure enclave on your device
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:29.760]   What is the what is someone like best by actually implementing just the
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.800]   encryption like the pk i to get the
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.520]   to get the
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.920]   Secure like the secure authentication between your device and they're like i don't know
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:44.160]   It's pk i but i think it probably is something like pk i so they have a
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:50.080]   You know something on they have your public key and you have their pro you have your private key and they make sure that they
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:54.800]   Inter i'm sure it's something like that. I'm sure it's not like they have everything
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.480]   um
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:58.240]   Okay. Yeah, because i'm just like man
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:04.080]   I don't want i mean because i look at all the vendors who i have to give like passwords to and whatnot
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.080]   And i'm like and they lose them all the time i'm like
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:13.760]   I don't know if i want something biometrically attached to me right in the world. That's why i feel like only
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:19.600]   A hardware vendor with a secure hardware enclave should be allowed to hold private keys, right?
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.760]   Like you mentioned that it could be stored in iCloud
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.800]   Which is a server
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.240]   At the iCloud yeah, i don't know they call it the iCloud key i don't think it is
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:38.080]   My under my understanding is it's stored in this secure hardware enclave on my iPhone right in hardware
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.040]   But we're i to get another iPhone apple
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:46.880]   Would handle the transfer from this or the copy from this to the new iPhone
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:52.480]   But i think each device has its own secure hardware enclave with the pesky
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.360]   I don't think despite the name icloud
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:02.960]   It is stored in the cloud. It shouldn't be should never be in the cloud. Okay. That you're right. Yeah, that's because yeah when you said that i was like
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:06.480]   Huh, there's no, so that's what they call it. There are secure enclaves in that cloud
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:12.000]   That was very last week was that they were you were able to move these things to the cloud
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:20.640]   Okay, i don't i yeah, this is so this was the big question that came up when pascis came out and steven i talked about this
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:27.200]   He is adamant there is no no company has yet allows you to
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:32.720]   Export it to another another companies you'd like you can't go from apple to google or google apple
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:35.600]   You can go from apple apple apple apple
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:41.200]   i'm getting information from mr. kevin toful there's the man
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:46.880]   He and he's sending me a nifty little link so i'm going to drop this in the chat that he sends
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.440]   to spec
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.960]   Well, this is apple's discussion about oh yeah, we'll also talk to me
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:58.240]   Paske's check if you have the private key locally no third party service has it
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:04.720]   Okay, right and so what's in the cloud is just going to be a way to check if you have it
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:10.400]   In icloud keychain pascis are end-end encrypted so even apple can't read them right
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.440]   This is apple it's yeah
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:18.480]   So it's actually in keychain so or icloud keychain right
[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:26.640]   Oh, but then you have to turn icloud keychain on which is a suck because then you've got to enable all the cloud stuff
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.040]   associated with apple which is also a suck
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:36.960]   I know you have to do it if you're using an iphone, but i don't and i don't want to do it on my iphone right and so you're going to use some sort of
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:41.280]   Samsung solution they have that you know knock song clave
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.840]   I think it's going to be very similar
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:48.400]   but the question is can knocks talk to icloud can and and google and i
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.800]   my understanding
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.760]   When we talked about this before as apple has not has implied that maybe there'd be a way to export it
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.760]   But they haven't yet done that
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:02.720]   That there is no way to export it to some other platform
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:07.440]   And i understand for security reasons you probably don't want that right you you want to keep it
[00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.880]   uh tied to your hardware
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.600]   And it's convenient for apple because then you really don't want to get an android phone
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:23.360]   Just one and google sounds like yeah, google's well, but they you know they can justify it right
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.760]   by an iphone
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:32.000]   I think frankly as much as we lauded this as and as much as we know the passwords are terrible
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:40.640]   This ain't the solution and steve who created his own similar but better solution called squirrel some time ago
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.320]   Spent seven years working on it has pointed out
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.800]   Yeah, that was really the problem because he was supposed to be working on something else
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:53.760]   And he went to scroll so i don't know if he did that on purpose
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:57.200]   But as steve did develop something that he says technically is better
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.440]   But it's steve gibson's solution not microsoft apple google's solution
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:07.200]   So i think it's just kind of a non-starter and honestly he says and i think he's right past keys is not as good
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   But remember we always make these just like the banks these uh trade-offs
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.280]   Between real security and convenience
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:22.000]   So not as good not everybody needs real secure. I mean like that's the other thing to think about you gotta
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.320]   You gotta assess your risk profile right
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:29.520]   You want to protect look if you use gmail as your main mail account you want to protect your google account
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:32.480]   a lot
[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.960]   You want to do whatever it takes. That's why i have a ubiki
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.360]   Yeah, that's why i have multi-factor in a ubiki and if i could but i can't
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:44.400]   Because google will let me if i could i'd turn off everything but the ubiki maybe they will let me i haven't tried
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.800]   I would turn off everything but the but the ubiki
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.200]   And maybe no they they probably they just don't want you to call a few. Yeah, that's right
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.720]   It's the same reason they don't do end-to-end encryption
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:45:01.040]   On google authenticator remember last week we had the story steve gibson's talking about this as well the google authenticator
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:03.680]   will now synchronize between phones
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.000]   To which a company called misk pointed out. Yeah, but that's not encrypted
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   So and google said yeah, that's intentional because we don't want a lot of fun calls about i lost my unless my secret keys
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.840]   This is always the equation
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:24.080]   See aunt, this is why i don't care about real people they make it bad for the rest of us
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:28.480]   This is why he likes master dog. Look man i'm real people
[00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.080]   His people now you're you're on master on you and using it just fine
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.720]   You know the biggest issue and i agree with you and you brought this up during uh twit
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:42.320]   Jeff Jarvis is is you're not you're not getting unfortunately good representation
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:48.000]   Uh for black people on twitter or no mast on for instance as we did on twitter you don't have black twitter and mastodon
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.320]   But you are getting by the way
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.240]   they uh
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:58.240]   Whoever these people are that organize black twitter have moved somewhat on mass well to a blue sky
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:02.560]   For the four conveners of the black twitter event that i held it by school
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:08.960]   They're all the america clark and on order of rotshire and charlton makowain and jonathan flowers are all there
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.360]   Yeah, and what what i'm reading since and and what happened was
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:20.640]   Someone on master to someone on blue sky was it very intentional and they gave a lot of invites to somebody who knew who to invite
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:25.760]   And that was recognized and seen it has quote tweet it has search
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.160]   It has a different motif, but mainly it doesn't have the culture
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:34.960]   The mastodon had that more than we want to know was not welcoming
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.400]   Uh, you know, I I said before in the show that adam moss
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:45.200]   I watched him go against dr. Jonathan flowers a lean expert in black twitter and just dismissed anything they could possibly bring
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:49.680]   Of any value and just build your own damn thing that is open source
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.560]   Right, which was as flower syndrome is your way to say f me
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.640]   and um
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:58.400]   So the one of the great most I have you say that they say that black
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.280]   Mastodon was not welcoming
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.640]   Yes, yes multiple multiple and i'm not blaming down on on rotshire or anybody in particular, right?
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:08.720]   But there was a
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.680]   a
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.160]   Unwelcoming geek culture the other than happen to mastodon
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:17.920]   Which was very offensive to people was when people would put up something that had to do with politics and equity
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:22.000]   Some would come in and this is pretty much gone now but would say use a content warning
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:28.720]   Well, no, i'm not going to use a content warning for yours delicate little soul about the life that I have to lead as a black person
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:35.040]   Yeah, and I got a lot of the content warning stuff about images that one time i'm like, really?
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:41.440]   Okay, I like I have to say I support and like the content warning and alt tag culture of mastodon
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:47.760]   I think in the long run it's intended to be inclusive not exclusive or certain things for all that is
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:54.320]   I do content warnings when I post about our our server not everyone wants to hear about quick social server
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:59.200]   I'm sorry you're too delicate to deal with racism in america, but that's what some people say no no no no no
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:04.480]   You should go anyway. You should put people weren't being told you should put that behind the content warning
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:10.080]   And what does that then say part of the problem with it is the name content warning, which is a mistake
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.720]   It should just be a headline because it's all it's just a headline if you don't want to read this message
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:21.760]   This is what's about it makes it easy to ignore stuff. Yeah, I agree, but but that's not the way it works
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:27.200]   Well, it is the way it works, but it's the name implies that it is somehow to protect your your, you know
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:33.280]   So what that's also how a lot of people enforce it leo they don't use it like you they say i'm offended by this
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:36.640]   You should not put this out for my eyes to see that's what I got
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:43.200]   I didn't get what you get mr. report for us how you use it what I got was I am offended by this you should have done this you should
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:48.240]   Yeah, okay, I understand I think they're not really saying i'm offended by this but
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   To there early on when we had a big influx of people no no early on we had a big influx of people from twitter
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:49:02.480]   There was a misunderstanding of the culture and and people were trying to explain that the mastodon culture includes content warnings and alt tags
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:07.360]   Uh, and I think that it came off as being caught like a cop
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.000]   Which was not what it should have been but there was this attempt there was a reasonable attempt
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:17.120]   To try to say look this isn't twitter now. I have to tell you yeah, uh in my opinion
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:25.120]   All that energy you're putting into blue sky you're going to deeply regret. I do not think blue sky is going to end up being the welcoming
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.680]   Loving place. Yeah, well, see
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:32.640]   They did add in blocking one of the problems was they got to 50,000 people they didn't have blocking in there
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.120]   There were people who were playing to come in
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.400]   um
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.400]   And there was also a funny thing
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:43.120]   People in my world really can't stand that a glaiseus and so they went after him just because why are you here?
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.440]   it was just it was just rude um
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:51.200]   And they added the blocking in but the problem is we talked about this a little bit on to it
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:57.280]   Is that there's a chicken egg problem here that they can't really test things and build things until they have enough people to use it
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:00.160]   And they don't have enough people to use it until they built the things
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:04.400]   And problems are going to come up and then it's going to have a bad reputation with those problems
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:07.360]   So they're they're on a high wire. They're very much on a high wire
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.160]   I think I got five invites
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:14.320]   I went out until I used one myself. I then told four people
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.440]   I have an invite for you and then they didn't work because they expired
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:21.120]   And then I've tried to get more invites and they haven't given it to me
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:25.760]   And I'm and I think they've slowed it down to zero right now to try to hold it off for a little bit
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.800]   I was they tried to figure out content moderation. Yeah, I mean they all I I think I think
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:36.800]   This is my conversation with Dave Weiner is it's good to have competitive things out here. Oh, yeah
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:43.040]   Is that a joe esposito special? Yeah, thank you joe esposito
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:47.040]   Screw real people. Yeah, yeah
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:54.000]   Uh stacey, do you want a blue sky invite now after having her? I do want to blue sky
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.720]   I still want one. I'll give you one. I think I am
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:03.200]   I have one left blue sky candidate. I have one left and I really want everybody who's on this show and at least
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.760]   to be on blue sky so
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:10.960]   As long as mine has someone has an invite send me one and oh you don't have one either. Look at it
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.440]   Oh, I thought you were on it. You can send it to aunt first
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:19.840]   No, I'm so scared every day. Oh, I do only care. You know, it's so you can give it to aunt
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:23.360]   Oh, this is a little social mobility. Now I've got problems
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:27.120]   I would have said that had I known aunt it wasn't on it
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:36.320]   Is physically closer to you. So I think he should choose an aunt. So I don't even have the punch leo button
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:39.840]   I mean my goodness. Who do you love more leo?
[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:47.440]   I'm just gonna be gracious and let you take it
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.080]   Don't make him sweat make him sweat leo's choice
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:58.880]   Oh actually I should because you called out me trying to eat my lunch even though I was trying to deserve subtly
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:04.320]   You deserve the invite you say you've earned it. Honestly, if I could give you my account
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.000]   I don't want to be there anymore
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.920]   Um
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.560]   That's not nice leo. There's nice people. They're trying
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.280]   Give it a chance very trying
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.840]   Oh
[00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:21.120]   All right, that's why I want to be today. That's why I want my goodness
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:26.320]   That's why I want you and aunt to be on there because I just want to know what you guys think of it
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.440]   Yeah, I guess it's very easy. We'll get there eventually
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:36.000]   I requested an invite. That's what I said. I did request name by last week or something. Yeah, but
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:42.640]   Brianna Wu was on twit sunday and her interest was but she she was very much
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:47.200]   The black sky needs to invite all the journalists and all the prominent people
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:52.400]   That's what's gonna make the difference about others will resent that and that's a very unmasked on way to look at things
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.520]   the real people
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:58.320]   but it's interesting
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.760]   To see
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:03.040]   Where it positions itself a lot of the question is going to be does it actually federate?
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:06.160]   Does it do what it's the portal all says it's gonna do it. What is it gonna do it?
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:13.040]   Uh, I also think right now it's very much like twitter. So if you liked twitter, you will like blue sky. I think that's true
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:18.720]   Uh, all right, and I and I one of the reasons I don't like it is because although I miss
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:24.640]   You know, I want I would really like to see the authority. This is what hurt me was I want to see the authoritative news
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:31.280]   Sites, you know, npr left twitter, right and of course, Elon must responses. Okay, I'm gonna sign npr to somebody else
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:36.400]   Which is oh, that'll make it much better. Uh, twitter will be so much better when I fake mpr
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:40.320]   But what I'd like to see an mpr is unmasked and I'd like to see all of the news
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:45.680]   Uh sources all of the governmental issues and stuff. I'd love to see aoc
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:52.080]   She went to blue sky. She uh, as far as I know she doesn't have she has an account, but I don't think she has much of a pressure
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.240]   She uses much. No, um, so
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.120]   unmasked on so
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:01.600]   I jealous I think the people who are going to blue sky there's a lot of great
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:07.360]   Content people going to blue sky that I wish they would have looked at mastodon or maybe they did look at mastodon
[00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.360]   I wish they would have liked it. Um
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:13.680]   You know, I got pulled into a discussion with mr. Jarvis
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:18.080]   listener miss adriana pulled pulled me in to some of her
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.400]   followers of friends and what have you talking about black mastodon and
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:28.080]   how it doesn't seem to be taken hold the way black twitter did and one of the comments was
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:36.240]   uh black twitter was so big to where people thought it was a whole different app versus being twitter and
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.800]   my response was well
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.960]   mastodon
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.440]   Just seemed to get the attention of quote-unquote normal people like 10 minutes ago
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.440]   Uh, so
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:50.640]   It's really at least for me. It's really hard for me to expect
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:56.640]   black twitter to just explode and get the prominence that it had on twitter, um
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:01.760]   uh, oh mastodon like right now, I think it's going to take a while because of
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:09.760]   It's got to become more popular to normal people and and uh get all the guardrails in forest blocking
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:14.080]   trolls and things like that. Um, so I don't see why
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:21.280]   People are just so up in arms about well black mastodon is just not going to it's just not getting it for me. Well, you
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:27.200]   Got to give it time. It's just going to take some time. So so and I just put up on the rundown for your line 92
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:29.520]   jabari evans who's a who's a
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:35.840]   Hip-hop artist who now is an academic and a phd who studies especially young people on social media
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:39.440]   He came to the black twitter summit. Uh, he's a brilliant academic
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:44.480]   And he wrote a really good essay today and he gave me he was nice enough to say that I helped inspire him to do it
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.560]   a low in mirth clerk and under a brock
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:52.240]   And what he's saying in the end here is that it's going to matter when you see the black-owned twitter
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:59.600]   That what happened on black twitter is that black people came in and they used the affordances that were there that were not designed for them
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:04.720]   Ravel was at this summit. He said, you know, we were thinking about people, you know white geeks who went to south by south
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:09.200]   West that's what we built twitter for yeah, but we used them to our ends
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.120]   charlotte mackereling
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.120]   What are we called black software? Which is about?
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:18.480]   Before the web and places like black planet and so on there was a technological
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:22.160]   Brilliant what was happening that was never recognized
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:27.040]   And so you come into another service here where even as intentional as they've been at blue sky
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:32.560]   It's not a black-owned business now. There is spoutable by chris boosie. I hear controversy about it
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:36.400]   I don't know what the controversy is. I don't understand so i'm not making any judgment
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:39.280]   Which is black-owned and there's another one I think called spill
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:46.160]   That is black-owned so it'll be really interesting to see whether there are separate spaces
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.640]   The same thing is well true of media, right?
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:52.720]   There's a big ad agency now. That's going to go and try to buy a lot of media some of the
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.400]   Aim to black people would also say we should be able to own any media
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.520]   um, and so we're where do we come along?
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:02.080]   sister barry to the point that
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.360]   um
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.200]   It's not just that
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:11.680]   Black twitter is listen to for what's next we get to build what's next hmm. So what is the point?
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.000]   uh, so there's two two reasons for
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:20.480]   Having something like a black twitter or whatever a jewish twitter or whatever one is so that there's a community
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:28.160]   But the other is so other people can see right says public. No, right or no. Yes and no. Yes and no the part of the part of what
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.080]   um
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:35.040]   I hear argued all the time for people who are being black twitter is that is that they welcome the chance to be somewhere where it's not
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:40.640]   Underweight gays so that's another thing and by the way, you could do that very well with mastodon
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:46.880]   Just by creating a mastodon in this instance. It wasn't open to the public. Yeah, you can make you make it black the
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:52.320]   Easily, but you also want the power to break out of that when it comes time to do
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:53.840]   um
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:56.400]   Oscars so white and black lives matter and so on
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:01.120]   Well, then I would submit the maston has perfect for that because you create a mastodon instance
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:04.480]   That's black mastodon and then if you want you can share those
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:08.720]   Toots out to the regular fed earlier discussion. Yeah, yes, I agree
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:12.800]   Architecturally, yes, but see earlier discussion about about affordances and culture
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:17.360]   Well, I can't help it if people can't figure it out
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:23.440]   Honestly, the the uh, and it's not that
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:26.640]   shallow and it's not that hard
[00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:31.680]   I always get learning curves confused because a steep learning curds easy. It's not that shallow of a learning curve
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:35.440]   It's not that hard. No, no a steep learning curve is hard. No
[00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:39.040]   No, it's hard. It's hard
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:43.360]   It's hard at first and then you get up there and you're like, okay, but it's like elevation gain, right?
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.520]   We've climbed up a mountain
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:49.760]   A steep learning curve is far harder than or a steep mountain is harder than like
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:53.680]   A mountain that you can go but a learning curve is an amount of heights
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:57.120]   Oh god
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:01.840]   Learning curve is how quickly you learn so I am so grateful for my
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:04.560]   Actually, no, it's how hard you have to work to learn it
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:09.840]   How quickly so here's the learning curve from ignorance to full knowledge, right?
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.320]   If it's slow
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:19.120]   Then you're not getting full knowledge very fast if it's steep. No, we're we're pulling okay pull your audience. So as example
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:21.920]   I always said
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:27.200]   Changing a diaper is it is a steep learning curve because it's you you do it once
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.800]   You know how to do it. You're just not using the language, right? No, that is not
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.280]   Okay, Paul the audience is that learning will be slow and arduous
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.320]   It's hard to get up the mountain mr. Cicevus
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:43.680]   Says irc and and discord agrees with miss Stacy, sir
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.480]   Yeah, they have just you know
[00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:51.920]   Just don't you're contrary on everything today. Let's talk about that. Hey, let's let's talk about something else
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:58.880]   He talked enough. Now he's gonna put proof of right because he's male Stacy and he has to dude. I've already looked it up man
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.880]   Well, anyway, so that it is a steep learning curve
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:09.440]   But the steep learning curve makes it but it's not that steep. It's a little it's a little there's a
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.720]   There's a little curve
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.320]   But that little bump makes it hard and it keeps out
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.800]   So it keeps out the keeps out people who don't care enough to just get over the hump
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:26.240]   So it's really more like a learning speed bump and uh, I think that that's a good thing
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:30.240]   Right because you only want people committed. You don't want people and this is the problem with blue sky
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:35.600]   It's just a lot of this is derpy peep are literally mansplating incorrectly
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:43.280]   I I agreed with you and I said, okay, fine. That's what I was trying to say which is it has a little band splating when you do that
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.680]   No, no, I'm just trying to make the right but I was right. Let me show you no
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.880]   No, no, I'm just gonna finish the thought which is I think i'm a good boy this leo
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:58.800]   I think it's a good thing for some things to be a little difficult because then the people who are in you know
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.760]   What the real have some commitment committed ones. Yeah
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:07.360]   To learning it and I think the part of the problem with blue sky is just a bunch of people got invites and went be
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:13.440]   There's a lot of butts on blue sky and I don't mean if sans and yeah, there are that was a whole thing
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:20.080]   And then the ao ao c saw by but was a whole thing. I'm not sure. That's that like immediate turnoff
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:25.040]   And I think it was just too easy for people to want to end there and bring their old habits from twitter
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:30.160]   And that's kind of what was going on in maston. I was like don't bring your old habits over here. Right
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:36.480]   Okay, I'm an enough my space I get my invite I said this
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:46.400]   And now watch she's not gonna use it if you know he was in that comes uh, are you on blue skies?
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:52.480]   Daisy. Oh no, no, no, I'm totally gonna use it. I have a you have another I think look in your know I don't because all mine
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:57.440]   Expired you gave me five and they and they expired I gave them to friends and they gone
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.160]   And I will get you in there. I promise. I just it's all I need a
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.080]   She showed a little more interest in getting in there than you did. That's all I'm saying
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:11.600]   No, because because aunt was just you know his usual calm answer calm and and and
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:16.560]   polite but you know aunt to your credit you use our mess it on a lot and you use it quite well
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:21.040]   And I'm grateful. I mean I I again even
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:24.960]   With that or twitter. I'm just in broadcast mode
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:29.520]   Right, but I did see a toot today from one of our loyal listeners
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.680]   um, miss eng
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.760]   She posted a picture of some her taking photographs of birds in the backyard of her father's house
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.680]   And she mentioned that she hoped that it would
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:45.520]   You know, I helped brighten my feed up a little bit because most of my feed is then people just angry and
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.240]   fussing and fighting and
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.080]   And that was nice to see something that was just
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:55.120]   Huh a good break sure for here nice. I got a question for you for you guys
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:59.120]   So we had and it was pulling you because this is my father died. We had
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:03.360]   a robin with five eggs in our front door and
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:09.200]   She sat there forever and they hatched and the little birdies were there and they were being fed
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:14.800]   And then I go last night the nest is empty and half gone and there's three splats of blood. Oh
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:20.160]   Oh, no, what who who would take robin little robins? Is it a bird? Is it a cat?
[01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:22.320]   Rats
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:27.440]   It's on a door. It's on a rat a wreath on a nose certainly rats
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.840]   Yeah, could be could be crows, but not a cat cat's not gonna climb up on the door
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.640]   Like that will unless there's something a rat would is already there. Yeah
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.520]   Rats are
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:43.520]   Nice town. We don't have rats here. You know what you think this is New York. Yep. He's a rat
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.080]   You said jersey said enough
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:53.680]   People people have a very bad impression of New Jersey. There are parts of New Jersey that are bucolic positively bucolic
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.080]   That's why they call it the garden state
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.720]   And then there's you know, then there's new work
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:04.320]   They say say look at that. Yeah, that's my view out the window. All I see is a bunch of oversposed
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:13.440]   A place is rats can hide those are those are deer. Oh, yeah. Dears are rats. Yeah. Yep. They eat my shrubs
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.440]   Um, oh, I had so many things I wanted to talk about and I forgot
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.320]   And then you got
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.440]   Because we can go there I did get challenged you think I got challenged. I just wanted to complete the thought I agree
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.080]   steep learning curve hard to learn
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:36.080]   I don't know where I got the idea that it wasn't I always thought I always thought it was hard to learn and then somebody said
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.800]   No, no, that means it's easy because it's quick and I got the man has to say I was right in the end
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.360]   No, I'm no, I'm oh god
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:51.920]   Hey, let's talk about normal. You want to talk about normal people whom you don't enjoy and how that means that chrome is taking away the
[01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:58.480]   Lock icon. Oh, yeah, let's talk about that. There's not a lot there, but so chrome is decided we can talk about vpans in utah
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.440]   Well, do you do that story too? Yes
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:05.440]   uh chrome has decided that the lock the padlock is
[01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:07.600]   antiquated because
[01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.760]   Google says everybody is on
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.480]   So here's the this is firefox by the way
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:19.920]   everybody is on hgpt now thanks to our successful campaign and let's encrypt so we don't need the padlock anymore
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.720]   It doesn't communicate anything. So instead we're gonna have two people lying head to toe and sleeping bags
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:27.920]   and uh
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.320]   I don't know how that helps
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:36.080]   Actually, the funny thing is firefox already has that it's right next to the padlock. You can't see it
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.240]   I wish I could zoom in for you
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.680]   but uh
[01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:43.840]   For firefox that is a setting those are setting sliders
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:48.000]   So it's going to be very confusing because firefox still has the padlock
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:54.880]   Uh, and then it also has the two people head to toe and sleeping bags. So I don't get the same right
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:06:01.760]   Part of part of google's point was that it was misleading people thought it was somehow safer if I had the lock okay, so you you you tell me
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:07.920]   Uh, what does that mean? What does this mean jeff this symbol go ahead show my what's that mean?
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:10.560]   Oh
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.080]   Yeah, I got two people. I don't know in sleeping bags
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:17.760]   Well, if they're not sleeping bags, they're having a certain kind of fun. Oh
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.640]   sir
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:24.320]   So google says this is better than a padlock. I mean I know what it is. It switches
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:29.360]   But I don't know how I don't know if that's as communicative as they might think
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:32.880]   Yeah, now I can't see anything else
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.720]   All right, what was the other one's good time to talk about porn in utah in
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:43.360]   Born to porn. Yeah
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.600]   So this is exactly this is an important except that
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.480]   Uh in the uk
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:53.760]   As I you know there are a number of initiatives in the us and other places
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:58.880]   They're trying to put they're bringing back kappa in the us. They're trying to force websites to identify
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:03.360]   Ages of its users then of course that's a real a privacy issue
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   Uh, if every time you go to website, you have to say no, let me show you my state id to prove that i'm over a 18
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.680]   Utah has actually been the first to make this a law
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.320]   uh
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.600]   if
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.920]   They're going to mandate age verification
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:28.960]   Here's the uh, sp 287 online pornography viewing age requirements signed into law and march goes effect went into effect yesterday
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:35.120]   As a commercial entity that knowingly intentionally publishes or just reads material harmful to minors
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.760]   Okay, I don't you know
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:42.560]   I don't know what that means on the internet from a website that contains a substantial portion of such material
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:47.120]   Shelby had liable if the entity fails to perform a reasonable age verification methods
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:50.800]   To verify the age of an individual attempting to access the material
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:57.120]   Uh, you remember the uk tried this a few years ago. This is the law we were talking about where you'd have to go into a pub
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.480]   to get to get to get porn permission
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:09.440]   Um, remember that they've they tabled that seeing the inherent problems, Utah did not pourn hub, which of course
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:17.120]   Uh, probably doesn't admit that it distributes material harmful minors, but anyway, it's adult content. They do call it that
[01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:19.360]   Uh, says we can't
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:23.120]   Reasonably protect the privacy of our users and find out how old they are
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.680]   So we're just going to stay out of Utah
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:31.920]   Which means uh, it's going to be a beautiful place for a vpn providers. That's all I can say
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:39.200]   Oh, they I think it was the verge had a map showing how much uh vpn searches searches for vpn's shot up in utah
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.640]   like it's
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.640]   the map is like
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:45.920]   The us all the same color and then utah is a bright
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:50.640]   I think it was green was the 2016 utah declared porn a public health crisis
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.560]   An epidemic that is harming the citizens of utah in the nation
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.600]   Um, so I think probably uh, this is exactly what the utah legislature wanted
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:08.160]   And they probably like all the other sites to do this. Well, they wanted attention. It's it's it's it's all for show
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:13.040]   But it is germane because I think that this the uk's online
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:18.560]   Act is going to do the same thing or something similar and you're going to see you're going to see this and uh
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:25.200]   There are several acts now in congress right now our laws proposed laws in congress along these lines, so
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.320]   It's you want to hear a great law? Yeah
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:34.480]   What's a great law? Do you want to do what I missed I I interrupted aunt, so no you're fine. Go ahead
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:43.520]   My state, washington state is the first state to pass a medical data privacy law. It's called my data my privacy
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.280]   Um, actually it's like hb something something something
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.840]   um
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:51.840]   But what it does is
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.640]   See my health my data act
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.200]   Yes, my health my data act whatever
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.600]   It is, but it it does a couple things one it gives you the right to
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:08.000]   See what data a health care provider has on you. Yeah, uh delete that data. Yeah, and it
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.640]   Establish it establishes
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:17.360]   Geofencing boundaries around health care providers and puts that data off limits to be sold doesn't hip
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:21.920]   Already do all that no, so let's talk about what the other doesn't actually do
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:29.040]   Um, because this is something people don't understand and I write about this a lot hip is the health insurance
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.000]   Portability and accountability act
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.720]   What it is is it protects your health data as it's ported between insurers
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.280]   And your doctors provide
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:44.560]   Change jobs right your health providers and your inshures
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.560]   And it was designed because we got our insurance in the us
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.120]   Because of our health or because of our jobs. So when you change jobs people wanted to
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.600]   Move their health data back and forth and insurers has some of that data
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:04.880]   And so they wanted to be able to move that around easily and do it electronically if they could that has all this does
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:15.040]   So if you send your like health care data to apple apple has no legal obligation to protect that data apple does because it's didn't its commercial interests
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:20.240]   But it could sell it in any any time any time your data goes out of a medical provider
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.880]   We're out of your insurance company like maybe you fill out a form in your doctor's office to
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:31.200]   Uh, maybe you fill out, uh, like why you're at your doctor's office. There's a lot of companies that now
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.680]   Have software to manage that patient intake thing that data actually
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:42.560]   Doesn't stay at your doctor that data is data collected by that company for you or sorry
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:50.640]   By the company for themselves. So that data gets shared wherever if you go on a mental health website and you start like
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.200]   Type it in there again
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:58.560]   Not necessarily health care provider. So your data isn't necessarily protected and people misunderstand this
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.440]   They just think all health care data is protected, but it's not and this is one of the first laws in the us
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:07.760]   To close those loopholes. That's why it's bravo washing state
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:12.080]   Good. Yeah, something stacy. So you said you can erase things
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:14.800]   Can you erase that at the medical providers?
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.440]   So there's some as i read the bill
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:24.480]   What you can do you can only do this as a consumer you can ask for this data to be erased up to two times a year
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:29.760]   So you can't do it after that the providers can charge you so like if you go to the doctor and you're like
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:36.240]   Take away all my data and you're like they can be like, okay, fine. Sure. We'll delete all your data
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:40.320]   Um, and then you have to go back again for something else
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:46.880]   You can only do that twice a year without getting charged. Yeah. Also, is it only all your data or is it some particular piece of your data?
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.720]   You don't want there
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.720]   I mean, I guess you could
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:56.800]   There's one I'm asking here's what i'm really asking. No, I you're thinking about like my medical data that's relevant for diagnostic
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:01.440]   Exactly. You know, you're you're you tend to be manic
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:08.720]   Bipolar and in the midst of a bipolar you take all that out and then they don't know how to treat you next time because it's not in the
[01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:14.000]   Files um, you know, I did read the law, but I don't know about that particular
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:21.600]   Use case. I know there there are guardrails around how often you can ask your data to be deleted
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.400]   I don't know if the provider has the ability
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:30.480]   I mean because you can pull your medical records from a provider. I believe this is the other thing about this case
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:34.480]   Which is really interesting is we talk talk a lot about you know, this is my data
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.120]   When you're in a transaction with someone else, right whether that's amazon or a doctor
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.840]   They have the data too
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:46.800]   So you say I want to erase all that data and then you come back later and you want to sue the doctor for malpractice
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.560]   So the doctor doesn't have their own records and say no, I didn't I didn't treat you for this
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:56.000]   Because I have the right to that data too is the doctor because you don't own it. I also own it
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:02.320]   It's always inevitable in any in any conversation or transaction. There is more than one party that can claim ownership
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.960]   Okay, I'm I'm looking at the definitions here to see if I can figure this out
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:17.040]   Uh, oh the one of the other interesting things about this is in the definition section where they talk about like
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:22.800]   Medical data part of what they're putting in is medical data is biometric data
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.920]   Which I thought was kind of interesting and genetic and phenotype
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:29.200]   Genotype and phenotype data based on DNA
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:35.760]   Which I'm kind of like oh does that mean that I could take a DNA test like one of those ancestry dot coms or
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:41.040]   23 and me tests and then ask to delete my data after I get my results
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:44.800]   Thus meaning I won't be interested into their database because that could be cool
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:51.680]   Uh, I'm still scrolling through it's only a 20 page loss. So yeah, I'm really raising kind of bigger questions
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:54.880]   So we can I think Leo's falling asleep. No, it's it's a good question. It's only a page
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:00.720]   No, I mean, well, we'll leave me if you read a lot of laws there some of them could be
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:04.240]   Special I just put a link in the chat
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.960]   All right, let's take a little break when we come back the annals of AI
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:14.000]   We uh, we actually have a lot of interesting stuff still to come
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:19.600]   Including bankruptcy for one of the biggest new media companies in the business
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:24.240]   And the writers guild strike we haven't even talked about that all coming up
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:29.280]   I was wondering where that would fit in our show because I could see it's there
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:32.560]   Uh, the i angle here. There's an ia
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.560]   There's a big ai angle and uh
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:38.480]   Also, uh, you know, we it's the streamer. I mean though
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:42.080]   There's two real reasons for the strike on the netflits
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:48.720]   Yeah, there's two real reasons for the strike one is a i but the big one is streaming the last time they did the contract a negotiation and a strike
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:51.840]   Uh, there were streaming was considered youtube
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:58.640]   It's not anymore and they don't get paid the same for netflix or, uh, hbo max as they do for
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:04.000]   Uh broadcast so yeah, they don't even get the data that itself. Okay. We're talking about it too soon
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.800]   We'll get it all in just a moment, but first a word
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:13.920]   From our sponsor mirror. Oh, I love mirror. We've been using uh mirror ever since I discovered them
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:20.240]   And this is the hard thing about doing an ad for something that could be anything you want it to be you got to check it out
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:24.960]   But I could tell you this I know a lot of businesses a lot of teams
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:32.160]   Are struggling with all the different disparate data sources and you're going from tab to tab and tool to tool
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:38.480]   And you know as you do that, there's a you know a natural loss of energy a loss of information
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.080]   Miro that doesn't have to happen because mirror
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:45.120]   How can I put this it's a collaborative?
[01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:48.480]   So your whole team can use it. It's visual
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:51.440]   It's a collaborative visual space
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:54.160]   That's the same for everybody
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:59.520]   So the same data for everybody so so and even if you're working at different times of day
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:04.480]   You could use mirror to brainstorm to put ideas in there and everybody's on the same page, right?
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.920]   Whether you're working from home or you're in a hybrid workspace
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.560]   Everything comes together in one online
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.680]   Workspace is that help?
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.840]   a collaborative
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.480]   visual online place for you to put your
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.960]   Brilliant's
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.760]   At first glance, it kind of seems like a digital whiteboard
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.680]   But it isn't it's so much more and because of the integrations with mirror
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.880]   It can be really so many things it works with zappier and if this than that you can have can bandboards
[01:17:32.880 --> 01:17:38.560]   You can use it with zoom to have meeting timers ice breakers brainstorming starters
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:42.880]   It's a visual collaboration tool packed with features for the whole team
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:47.360]   You could shorten the time to launch so your customers get what they need faster with mirror
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.400]   Need one tool to see the whole vision come to life from the ideas the text ideas the prototype
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:18:00.320]   The planning the researching the brainstorming the designing even the feedback cycles can all live on a single mirror board across teams
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:09.040]   Faster input means faster outcomes. In fact users report mirror increases project delivery speed by 29 percent
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:16.400]   View and share the big picture overview in a sense you can zoom in and out so you can see all the detail you need or zoom out
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.560]   To see it at the you know 30,000 foot level and when everybody has a voice
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:24.000]   And everyone has a single source of truth a single place
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:32.160]   Your team stays engaged invested and most importantly happy cut out any confusion on who needs to do what by mapping out processes
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:36.960]   Roles and timelines and again, it's all in the same place or you know you can have multiple boards in the same project
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:40.560]   It's up to you. It's very much what you need it to be
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:44.160]   And you got to take a look at the templates the mirror over
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:49.360]   At mirror.com/podcast is the place to see what other people are doing with mirror
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.640]   I
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:55.520]   That's going to be a much better way for you to understand what you can do with mirror than me try to explain it
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:58.000]   Because it could be so many things
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.560]   Strategic planning is easier because it's visual and accessible
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:07.520]   You could tap into a way to map processes and systems and plans with the whole team
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:12.000]   So they not only can can see it but they can input with it. They can interact with it. They can give it feedback
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:18.960]   It's inter fully interactive and I got to tell you I know everybody's feeling meat meeting fatigue, you know, just too many zoom calls
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:26.320]   Mirror users report saving up to 80 hours per user per year just from streamlining those conversations and that feedback
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:30.560]   I mean they got a meeting timer built in, you know, so you say we're gonna get this done in 30 minutes
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:36.880]   Be part of the more than million users one million users now who use mirror every month including mica
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:40.480]   And we use it for our as the tech I show it's a great way
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:44.480]   To see what we're doing to plan together to work together even if we're in different places
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.840]   Even if we're in different time zones get your first three boards for free
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.480]   Start working better together
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.160]   Miro.com/podcast. Did you hear that get your first
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:59.200]   Three boards for free because they know you got to try this before you understand it
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:03.440]   It's one of those things that as soon as you start using it you'll get it and you'll go oh, this is great
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:09.440]   But there's no way I can ever fully describe it to you. You got to go get those three boards start playing with it
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:17.360]   Even if it's just for yourself mirror it by the way, it's great just for yourself to brainstorm m i r o.com/podcast
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:20.480]   We thank him so much for what a brilliant idea
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:27.120]   And for and for letting us share this with you and for their support of the show and you support the show right back
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:32.400]   I know it's it's a kind of a little strange URL. We don't usually use that but this is what they wanted to use mirror
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.880]   Dot com slash podcast. I guess we're the only one they're on
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:37.120]   So there you go
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:45.040]   That has to be us mirror dot com slash podcast, but please use that because that's how they're going to go. Oh, you know
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:51.440]   These guys are good. They send us a lot of traffic mirror dot com slash podcast
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:55.520]   Uh, yeah, so
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:00.640]   Let's start with the writers guild of america. They've gone on strike this happened last time in 2006
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:07.440]   Some people have said that this is what's triggered the reality show apocalypse, but I don't
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:15.040]   Others have said no, no, we had the apprentice before that we had big brother before that we had reality tv before that
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:21.200]   Yeah, it certainly helps. It wasn't as prevalent. Yeah, I was gonna say yeah, right? It certainly helped because they're cheap
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:26.160]   You don't need writers for reality a programming all the well being while rain people watch them
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.000]   Yeah, yes
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:32.560]   So there is one concern that a lot of us have which is our our show is going to go away
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:37.040]   What's going to happen to succession or what's going to happen to you know, whatever?
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:40.400]   Drama you like stranger things. Is it going to go away?
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:46.320]   And most you know first of all the shows you're watching today have already are done. They've been produced they're they're out
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:51.200]   So it won't affect those it might affect shows down the road. Well, how long did the last one go on for?
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:55.120]   A long time. Go to wikipedia. It has them. Yeah
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.080]   the first it's funny the
[01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:01.360]   There've been a lot of people on twitter and blue sky and elsewhere
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:07.440]   As writers that's actually been one of the big topics on twitter this past few days
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:14.560]   Writers in the writers give explaining and reassuring people about the strike saying, you know
[01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:20.960]   Some really good reasons for this one of one of the issues as you mentioned stacey is ai
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.920]   There's legit. I think legitimate concern
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:28.800]   That we talked about this on sunday or maybe it was yesterday was on mac break weekly
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:32.960]   Uh, how many seasons of the simpsons are there?
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:39.040]   20 30 years of simpsons you have enough episodes you could feed them into an ai and maybe generate scripts
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:42.720]   We saw that happen with sidefolds and how about that? They weren't very good
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:51.040]   Maybe maybe you could do better or get ideas for scripts and in the negotiations the writers gild said we need we need to talk about this
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:55.440]   And the response of the producers the association of motion picture and television producers was
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:59.840]   Oh, yeah, we'll have a yearly get together to talk about new technologies
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:02.320]   That was it
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:06.560]   Which the writers gild said that's a pretty condescending and useless
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.960]   response
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:14.800]   Um, there does need something to be something there and then of course the big issues getting paid for streaming
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:20.800]   Uh, my favorite picket sign so far was give us a contract or will spoil succession
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:26.560]   There's another one related succession without the writers is just the apprentice
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:35.760]   You know that worked even if the writers only get a few words. There's still better there's still good
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:43.440]   Still good at it. Um, well the 2007 strike, uh, one hundred for 14 weeks as a long time
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.600]   Uh the 1988 went on for 22 weeks
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:53.840]   Um three months at 81 they've had a fair number of long strikes
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:59.680]   I saw a video up that the last one. Um clinton or brian did whole segments just
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:04.640]   Spinning his wedding ring on the desk. Yeah for as long as you got right. Yeah, it's kind of funny stuff like that
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:08.880]   But they had no writers so I I think it's important for us to say
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.360]   Uh
[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:13.360]   That this is an issue
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:16.400]   Um, here's the ai section comparing the
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:20.720]   Proposal on the left from the writers guild regulate use of artificial intelligence
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:28.080]   On, uh, mba mba is the agreement covered projects ai cannot write or rewrite literary material
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:33.600]   Cannot be used as source material and the mba covered material can't be used to train ai
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:38.160]   That's really an important one cannot be used to train ai. That's the proposal
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:41.440]   the motion picture television producer's response is
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.280]   Annual meetings to discuss the advancement technology
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:51.440]   Uh clearly there's a gap there's a gulf there and i'm sure that they'll I hope that the strike will bring
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:54.240]   both sides the table and resolve this
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.440]   uh
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:00.960]   Writers do a very important thing they get paid less and less as as these streaming companies make more and more
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.960]   I know streaming is in trouble
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:06.800]   One of the one of the writers posted on twitter this paragraph
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.360]   This is bob odenkirk post of this hollywood companies say they cannot afford widespread
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:18.720]   Raises loaded with 45 billion dollars in debt disney laid off thousands of employees
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.240]   In recent days disney plus is unprofitable
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:27.600]   Warner brothers discovery has 47 billion in debt has already cut thousands of jobs
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.600]   But here's the important paragraph these companies remain highly profitable
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:35.440]   They just haven't been delivering this kind of steady profit growth wall street
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.640]   Rewards plus let's face it. This is that you know, this is kind of the late stage capitalism problem is these companies
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.440]   Take on massive these
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.440]   Massive debt to do this
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:55.040]   Acquisitions and then they're going oh poor poor us. We we got we've borrowed 47 billion dollars to borrow Warner by Warner brothers
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:58.880]   Discovery or to merge. Oh, what are we gonna do?
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:02.880]   Yeah, that's not if we look
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:08.480]   The Wall Street Journal actually had a great story was it today or yesterday?
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:13.840]   Why is inflation so sticky it could be corporate profits? Oh, maybe it's not a new story
[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:20.000]   Yeah, the story itself. I'm like duh, but the fact is the Wall Street Journal
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.040]   That's kind of amazing to me
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.120]   and
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.120]   You know one of my friends
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.080]   Actually, he was writing about Amazon and
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.240]   Oh, what is it?
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:42.640]   Sorry, my brain stopped working Amazon and like bad form and bad play and he was like look behind every single one of these evil
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:47.280]   evil people in the media business is actually
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:51.280]   Just late stage capitalism. Yeah, he's right. Yeah
[01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:57.200]   Everything was wrong with the internet media invented first
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.000]   Media
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000]   Sure with the attention economy
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.080]   Advertising
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:09.840]   All it comes a mass all that comes out of that it just got transferred over the internet ruined the internet for now
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.320]   But I think that that won't last oh here his quote is so much better ready. It's Tim Carmen
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.680]   I don't know if you remember him. Do y'all know him? You swear it for wired for a while
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:23.040]   Behind the ghost mask of every Scooby-Doo villain in tech and media is just plain old capitalism
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:26.960]   This is the problem
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:29.440]   motion picture television and producers
[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:34.880]   Producers and television producers are competing against people who write for a living you're in deep trouble
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:38.000]   You are not gonna win this battle of words
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.880]   Uh go to the table negotiate it solve this get back to work so we can get our
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:46.480]   Shows and they can get properly compensated
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:56.880]   Season thank you seems reasonable. Yeah, but meanwhile everybody invested like crazy because of streaming and everybody realized they're losing money
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.200]   So the the total amount of money that's out there for shows is just going down
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.840]   very the writers killed
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:08.480]   Uh would total them out there asking for four hundred twenty nine million a year. That's less than
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:11.680]   one month's gross of the super Mario brothers
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:14.160]   And
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:19.440]   I mean, I know that that's apples and oranges, but still it's a good. It's a good. Uh, it's a good quote good. It's a good stat
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.960]   All right, let's uh move on
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:25.600]   to talk about vice because
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.880]   Times aren't tough for journalism. This is world press day. By the way happy world press day
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:38.000]   Oh, I thought it was like pet state or something else that too. It's everything
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:41.440]   They're only 365 days a year. They're far more causes
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:44.240]   Then we can have uh days for
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:51.120]   Actually, I subscribe to a calendar that tells me uh what every every day of the year is so I know and they're never the same
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:55.280]   Never I know that you can get two different calendars that has that same
[01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:00.400]   Scheme and is never the same days. I pay for believe it or not forecast with a k
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.040]   Dot com. This is press freedom day
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:05.440]   constitutional memorial day
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:13.120]   Ed shearens the sum of it all comes out on disney plus and jewish matt matchmaking comes out on netflix see I know everything
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.520]   Wow
[01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:18.000]   I know it all and this is not a cheap service
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.640]   I don't know. I subscribe to it. I don't know why I don't think I've ever heard you once
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.480]   Refer to it. I know already holiday or anything. I know
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:32.160]   There's a cost on a cancel. Yeah, I know I paid for it for some reason
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:35.680]   Uh tomorrow is star wars day
[01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:42.240]   Bupkis premieres. It's the anniversary of the battle of new york on the avengers movie kevin
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:45.040]   See I know about the avengers
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:51.520]   Uh star wars visions comes out queen charlotte a bridgerton story comes out and it's the web three conference in mojreal
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:57.200]   Don't you want to know all that stuff? Oh web can you imagine anything worse than a web three conference? Oh my lord
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.880]   Oh stuck in the elevator with crypto boys
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:07.440]   Oh, there's there's your show title stuck in the elevator with the crypto boy
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:10.640]   Oh
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:17.120]   I do uh, I am enjoying kevin rosus tweets lately because he keeps saying things like it's okay to sell your nft
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:25.120]   It doesn't stolen. Yeah, it doesn't mean you're not you're not supportive
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:29.520]   You can find a schmuck to buy them. Yeah, some of it you can
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.800]   my thoughts
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:35.680]   Place you run vice
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:36.880]   Yeah
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.880]   So now this is only a rumor
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.880]   This is only a rumor a company once valued at
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:46.160]   5.7 billion dollars is now
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:49.840]   Preparing to file for bankruptcy according to the new york times
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:53.920]   Who uh sourced two people with knowledge of its operations
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:59.040]   They have been trying to trying to be sold ever trying to find a hard to find a buyer
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:04.400]   They were flying high jeff. Oh, they will so so we gave them i'm by the little embarrassed here
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:08.720]   Uh, I got assigned for three years. We had to give the night foundation
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:10.880]   innovators award
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:14.480]   And so one year we gave it to shane smith co-founder of vice
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.040]   We should mention that
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.040]   That's there's no shame in that uh
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:24.480]   I you know, honestly, there's no shame in vice. I think vice we quite motherboard all the time
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.640]   They did very good journalism
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:29.520]   But it's it's very much like and I wrote about this
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:33.680]   Ben Smith's book traffic and I have a post on medium, which I actually would like to plug
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:37.680]   Uh, which I reviewed it and if you put together vice plus
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:40.240]   Huffington post plus
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:42.560]   um gocker plus buzzfeed
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:45.840]   They all fit in the same and even though then
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:49.600]   Concentrates on buzzfeed and gocker
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:54.320]   They all tried and this is my point of my media. They all tried for traffic traffic was everything
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:59.200]   We get more traffic everything will be okay. We get tons of traffic having learned nothing from the the
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:06.080]   Web startup so 2000 that used vc money to get traffic for traffic sake. They went for traffic traffic saying yeah
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:13.520]   Facebook changed things and they got kind of screwed by that but about dot com we got screwed by panda re-write of google before that
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:17.120]   Uh, whenever the the bad players come in and make more crap
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.600]   Uh, it commodifies it
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:23.200]   Traffic and audience are commodity. They don't have unique value anymore
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:29.040]   And so I think this is actually the end of not digital media but mass media
[01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:37.120]   I think the gocker and vice and buzzfeed and huffing and post were not new media. They were the last gasp of old video
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:43.440]   Uh, did I show you my uh picture from the met gala? I by the way, I didn't mention
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:47.200]   Oh, is that was I that boring? I was actually there. Did you see this?
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:51.840]   Let's just say I open
[01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:55.760]   Thank you Anthony maelson
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:33:01.840]   Uh, no, I don't know what there is to say about vice they were they started. I remember in montreal right a couple of uh
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.000]   Couple centuries ago
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.840]   Gavin Gavin McBitt Gavin what's his name? It was a it was a magazine. It was like a
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:10.320]   Parson magazine. Yeah, um
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:17.040]   What's his name? He's a proud boy. Gavin McBittness, because rice and then and Shane Smith with the founder kind of a pimp
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:23.040]   This is the proud boy. Is Shane Smith the other Smith at semaphore with Ben? No, no, no, no
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:27.440]   He wishes now. Yeah, that's Ben Smith and Justin Smith. That's it all the Smiths
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:29.440]   Yes
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:35.520]   So last week we told you vice uh their world news their global news coverage was being closed buzzfeed
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:38.160]   I'm sorry buzzfeed and now vice
[01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:40.480]   Is it is it?
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:44.720]   What does this portend is it see what I really worry about it's going to be just the New York times
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:50.560]   Uh and the washington post that's pretty much where you are. I think until we reinvent things fundamentally
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:55.120]   But I think for that kind of guess that good. I'll you traffic good for the world. It's not no
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.440]   No, it's just too few voices that way
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:34:00.080]   But the business models they went after
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:04.720]   Um, well, they were a mistake, right? We can save the same. Well, no, it wasn't at the time
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:10.160]   and jonaporene was brilliant about a he knew virality and four fifths of the
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:16.480]   Of the impressions that vice made were not on vote. I'm sorry buzzfeed made were not on buzzfeed
[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:22.320]   They were on facebook and twitter and youtube and company and it worked until cheap horrible copy hats came along
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:26.880]   And then they had them downgraded all and they got hurt
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:28.800]   um
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:31.040]   Because the only all they wanted was traffic for traffic say
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:35.680]   The other part of buzzfeed was that the buzzfeed news never had a business model
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:41.280]   It was a philanthropic gift from jona and ben jona just like news. Yeah, exactly
[01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:46.080]   And never really had a business model. I said that from day one. I said i'm glad you're doing this is good news
[01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:50.800]   They didn't good operation been build a hell of a newsroom, but it was never ever profitable
[01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:56.480]   All right, we're gonna we decided I decided unilaterally to put all the ai news in one big
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:59.920]   That happens here leo. That's the only kind of decisions are made. It's not a democracy
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:06.240]   Democracy, but I think you agree that this is probably a good idea to get the ai all in one
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:09.440]   swelph poop
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:12.720]   The big story of the week was uh gregory hinton
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:22.160]   Who worked at google jeffree jeffree sorry not gregory who worked at google was uh the dimes times dubbed him the godfather of ai
[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:28.320]   Uh, and he's obviously of an age where he's probably cashed in on all his stock options
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.960]   So he has decided to leave google
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:34.720]   Not because he's by the way he clarified this
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:39.760]   The times he said implied that I was somehow unhappy with google not because he was unhappy with google
[01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:46.640]   But because he felt like somebody needed to step up and start talking about the risks of artificial intelligence. Go ahead. It's dacey
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:50.400]   Oh, I was just gonna say he's legitimately
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:55.200]   The godfather of ai in the sense that he way before the big
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:57.520]   2012 image search
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.720]   Moment that really kind of made ai a buzzword again
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:09.280]   He was actually figuring out how to do neural networks and training people on how to do it at the university of was it waterloo in ontario
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:13.840]   Or maybe so that sounds right. Yeah, so like I I know him
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:18.560]   He's actually the guy who's one of the guys who explained how ai worked to me way back in the day. So very nice
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:22.880]   And he taught a bunch of like corsera classes on this so he's
[01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:29.120]   he's not the alleged father of ai but what he is is
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.920]   an early practitioner and then
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:35.040]   the man who helped prove that
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:42.160]   The amount of parallel processing that we had with gpu's could actually make ai financially viable and doable
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:44.720]   And then he proved that with image search
[01:36:44.720 --> 01:36:47.440]   Um, or sorry resnet resnet 50
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:50.480]   At that competition and then kicked off the whole boom
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:54.080]   Google google acquired his company
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:37:02.000]   For 44 million dollars, uh, hit in in 2018 got the Turing award for his work on neural networks with other
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.400]   scientists
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.400]   Um, but he's worried
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:09.280]   That ai technologies
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:13.440]   Uh, will be a threat to humans. He's concerned
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:19.360]   Okay, he does say he's concerned that the internet and this we were talking about on sunday jeff
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:26.640]   With alex stamos and stamos was also very concerned the internet will be flooded with ai created content
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.880]   Uh, he was stamos was really worried about 2024 the next election
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:36.240]   And that the average person will not be able to know what's true anymore. That's what jeffry hinton said
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.160]   Which which pardon me for this?
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:41.040]   This goat and bird moment, but that's exactly what happened with print
[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:45.360]   And and we don't have the institutions that are there to serve us and help us
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:49.440]   Because we deputized big old media to do it and they're not up to the task
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:56.320]   And the other once again, there's so much content. We don't know what's what we need new structures to figure out what it is
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:01.920]   The issue isn't the technology the issue is how it gets misused and how we don't know how to deal with it as ever
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:03.520]   He also
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:09.680]   Said he's concerned that ai technologies will up end the job market and boy. He couldn't be more timely ibm
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.520]   Just said it's pausing
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:18.000]   Hiring for back-end jobs 7800 of them that could be replaced by ai and automation
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:23.760]   You know, did we have that same discussion when they invented the the automated teller machine?
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:28.160]   That's totally fine bank tellers didn't make a lot of my ass
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:38.480]   Repeatedable tasks. Yeah, put ai to work for repeatable tasks hiring total said ibm in back office functions as such as human resources
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.600]   Will be suspended or slowed?
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:44.400]   26,000 workers
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:50.480]   CEO arvind christina said I could easily see 30% of that getting replaced by ai and automation
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:53.280]   Over the over a five-year period. That means
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:39:00.560]   What is that g if you were HR people's and we got to cry at that. Yeah, sorry. No comment. Well, you need them
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:03.120]   Um, you do
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:05.120]   Chegg
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:07.280]   CHEG
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:09.280]   ed ed ed tech
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.440]   company
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:16.240]   The first company to show lower earnings due to chat gpt
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:21.600]   For us education service provider chegg. This is from roighters
[01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:26.480]   The cost of students using chat gpt instead of their service for homework
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.080]   Could be nearly a billion dollars in valuation
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:36.720]   Chegg signaled the rising popularity of gpt was pressuring its subscriber growth
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:43.200]   And prompted to suspend its full year outlook sending shares of the company nearly 50% lower
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:45.440]   yesterday
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.360]   You know what you can't buy a botanica encyclopedia set anymore either
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:54.400]   Okay, okay, you you got a point stuff happens stuff happens, man
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:57.840]   This is this is the new world. It's opening up, but it is disruptive right in
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:01.600]   You know disruption causes pain
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:07.680]   It does and we should be thinking of ways instead of well
[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:11.600]   We should be thinking of ways to mitigate that pain and you see some like
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:16.320]   Way back in the day at and t like how to audacity retraining program
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:20.000]   So I think corporations need to be thinking about how do we train our workers
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.720]   It's single-payer health care for all all
[01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:29.200]   So does it right we need at a federal level to be thinking like, okay if we're going to have this massive shift
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:36.240]   What types of how how do we manage this shift? It should not be we should not be complaining because the world is changing
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:42.080]   We should be figuring out how we manage it and what are the appropriate safety notes and how to retrain people and
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:47.520]   I'm still laying on my former CEO times like this is just like you said
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:49.120]   You pivot and say okay
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:56.000]   Let's do some things that require a little bit more brainpower from our staff and and and you know and empowered and to do more
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.520]   and then
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.080]   Put on that is repeatable tasks on the backside of things and let automation handle it
[01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:07.520]   Well, that's what co-op that that's a code.org is doing. It's a computer science education
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:10.800]   Nonprofit they've launched teach AI
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:17.520]   A new effort aimed at guiding governments and educators on teaching whiz and about artificial
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.680]   intelligence
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.240]   Tech AI is going to convene tech leaders from companies like amazon microsoft sis goin open AI
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:27.360]   uh
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.040]   to
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:32.960]   Help authorities integrate AI into primary and secondary curricula worldwide
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:39.760]   while protecting students safety respecting privacy rights and addressing issues of bias and information
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:43.120]   That's the kind of thing you're talking about too, right
[01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:46.800]   Samsung bans chat gpt
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:51.840]   google bard and similar technologies because
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:55.920]   They're worried employees will leak sensitive business info
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:59.840]   Uh, as they already have apparently with chat gpt
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:05.600]   So samson's going to make its own tools, but they have banned employee use of chat gpt
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:09.440]   After discovering staff uploaded sensitive code to the platform
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:12.640]   Oh code. Yeah code
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:14.720]   Help me. Uh, let me rewrite this here
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:22.400]   The company's concerned that this is from bloomberg news that data transmitted to such artificial intelligence platforms including google bard and bing
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:24.880]   Is stored on external servers?
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:29.680]   Making it difficult to retrieve and delete and could end up being disclosed to other users. There is a concern
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:32.080]   API
[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:34.400]   Then licensed to you a closed instance
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:39.760]   Is that the business model that actually it's funny you should say that because that is also one of the stories
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:42.400]   That microsoft is going to offer
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:44.640]   a private
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:45.680]   chat gpt
[01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:48.080]   Microsoft has 50 percent of chat gpt
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:49.600]   at 10
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:54.160]   There it's guesstimated 10 times the cost of regular chat gpt
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:58.240]   Just so companies can run their own and not risk this leak
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:10.480]   Uh, I loved this article. All of her sacks was wonderful. I I interviewed him many years ago a really brilliant thinker
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:13.520]   Neurologist who could write
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:18.720]   Uh, had written many great books. There was a good article in the marginalia about consciousness
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:25.440]   Artificial intelligence and our search for meaning meaning all of our sacks wrote about AI 30 years ago
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:30.000]   And talked about that, you know, what exactly
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.720]   It is that makes human thought different than what machines
[01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:37.360]   Could do
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:41.920]   He wrote for instance. We must indeed be very cautious before we we allow that
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:46.480]   Any artifact is mind-like or brain-like
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:52.320]   If we're to have a model or theory of mind as this actually occurs in living creatures in the world
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:56.240]   It may have to be radically different from anything like a computational one
[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:59.040]   We talk about this a lot is
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:03.120]   With a with a GI artificial general intelligence, but also
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:05.920]   Is it thinking is it sentient?
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:13.200]   And uh, here's a guy who studied the human brain who said you know, there's there's a big difference between the biological brain and a computer brain
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:15.600]   He says, um
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:19.600]   If we have we have a theory of mind it will have to be grounded in biological reality
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:24.000]   in the anatomical and developmental and functional details of the nervous system
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.200]   In the inner life or mental life of the living creature
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:30.880]   The play of its sensations and feelings and drives and intentions
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:33.920]   Its perceptions of objects and people and situations
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:41.040]   And in higher creatures at least the ability to think abstractly and share through language and culture the consciousness of others
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:50.720]   Uh, he seems skeptical that machines, uh could do this at least as organized today. He's not alone. Huh
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:54.800]   That's kind of fascinating because we're we're thinking I
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:44:58.560]   I'm sure y'all've read like the soul of the octopus and things like that
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:02.160]   But we're thinking we're kind of in the shift right now and thinking about
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:09.680]   How animals are sentient and we're kind of opening up classifications for that which I mean they have a biological
[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:16.080]   Or basis and biological reality for their intelligence, but it's kind of fun. Okay. Sorry
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:22.960]   Leo, I don't start a democracy, sir. Teacher, but you but teacher teacher you missed an ai story and you're
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:29.200]   Jarvis and didn't put it down there. I'll put it in. I'm going to point out. Yeah line 21
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:36.000]   The Amelia Watenburger piece is also very good. Okay. So I clicked on this link that you gave me one burger.com thoughts
[01:45:36.720 --> 01:45:39.840]   Slash boo dash chatbots and this is all I got
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:43.680]   Scroll. Oh
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:50.640]   Because it really it was only two takes another one
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:53.840]   It was two senses why chatbots are not the future
[01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:58.240]   And then a thought bubble that said last night ever wine and seafood the inevitable happened
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:02.800]   Oh, then I I didn't understand that I was supposed to someone mentioned chat gpt
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:06.960]   I had no choice but started into an unfiltered no hard bar rant
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:13.040]   No holds barred rant about chatbot interfaces. Why did she do it this so? Okay. Now there's an article
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:22.400]   Yeah, there's an article. She made her best line right there good tools make it clear how they should be used and more importantly how they should not be used
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:28.000]   And her her point here which I think is excellent is that is that we just threw a blank box out and said to people
[01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:31.280]   Okay, here it is and everybody's making these assumptions about what it is
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:36.400]   And and they're overblowing them or they're misused of them. No Kevin roosto machine is with love with you
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:42.640]   Um, and and and I think that the obligation of the program to say what it is now
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:46.800]   I can disagree with that too. Um because that's very microsoft. That's very very clippy
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:49.200]   I'll tell you how to use this program
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:54.640]   Um, uh, and you know see the earlier discussion about black twitter people used it however the hell they wanted to use it
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:59.360]   But I think that's part of the problem now the chat is that everybody is imbuing into it this power
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:07.360]   That it may not have I think it's hysterical that this article in which she complains about a lack of affordances and chat and gpt
[01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:12.560]   Has zero affordances all I went was to this page and I had no idea what to do at this point
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:18.800]   So she's got the problem too. I got a posh facie and what do you think you would have done with this page?
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:24.240]   I think you might have probably would have clicked it and then that's what I did. I clicked it. Nothing happened
[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:28.880]   Yeah, I clicked and then I my first instinct is to scroll the wheel. Yeah, I'm a mouse
[01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:31.520]   Okay, well, all right
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:36.560]   It's not that obvious and it's really a lot of uh css for nothing
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:41.840]   Oh, the open space. I disagree with her. I disagree with her because
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:47.040]   Yes, I mean we have we had co-pilot for a year before we had chat gpt
[01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:52.240]   I think the lack of affordances let people try stuff that they wouldn't have tried at all
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:56.560]   And so you you know you do what she's suggesting which is kind of you know
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:58.720]   Have a bunch of buttons and switches and dials
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:04.240]   That's that is exactly what you didn't want to do because you were trying to find out how people use this stuff
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:07.040]   What their reactions to it would would be
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:09.440]   Right and I agree with you leo
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:12.560]   But the issue then is that people say oh my god
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:18.560]   It could be anything and we must regulate anything and everything that it might be and that that qfuses the world too
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:26.080]   She says idea of having this open-ended thing is scary to people that she says i'm i hope i've convinced you chatbots are
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:32.800]   Terrible interface for llms no you haven't or at the very least that we can add controls information and affordances
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:38.560]   To our chatbot interfaces to make them more usable. I can't wait to see that there are terrible other things for search
[01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:43.600]   She she's not complaining that we had the wrong reaction because there were no affordances. She just
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:48.960]   She just wants more affordances and I think that that's just that's that's a matter of taste
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:54.400]   Um, you know some people want to have everything all you know in a box
[01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:59.440]   And I think that was one of the reasons chappy cheat gpt caught people's imaginations
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:05.680]   Was because they should have given you more affordances to get through the article and I frankly couldn't figure out how the hell to use your website
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:07.680]   So there
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:10.400]   No, it's a it's a good point. It's an interesting point, but I know
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:17.760]   I would not couple the lack of affordances with the reaction people have had to it the reaction people have had to it
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:20.240]   Is just a typical?
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:24.560]   BS human reaction is something new and they want to answer
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:29.920]   They were they were going to answer pomorifies it no matter what although they didn't do that so much with go co-pilot
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:32.320]   Which then basically had to do the same thing
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:37.600]   But with a lot of a lot of limits and affordances, right? They said oh no, it's only for this and this and this
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:40.320]   So maybe you're maybe she's right
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:47.760]   Do do do do do but you wiki pedia by the way, we were talking about those online. Oh, did I finish the AI thing?
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:50.320]   No, I did not no
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:56.720]   I need an AI to turn it already. It's the new is the hard tired of it
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:01.520]   This should be in change while brain is coming out of your mouth. I know
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:05.440]   My sponge
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:13.840]   Should have been in the change like should be in the change like but I'll put it here because it's AI as well google photos
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:20.080]   Is now adding natural language queries to its search? So you used to be able to search for dogs already have that
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:26.160]   Oh, okay. Yeah, you can always search for pictures. I know I do too
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:31.360]   Yeah, but they want you now that you can search for phrases and ideas like peaceful garden
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:37.680]   Or colorful sunset or charlie at the golden. I've always thought that you could do this, but I guess
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:45.760]   I do like I do stacy on mountains. Yeah, it shows me. Yeah beyond mountains, but yeah
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:54.720]   Okay, um, I just said game day and it just pulled up a lot of sports related images that I thought has always done that
[01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:57.040]   That's a phrase, right?
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:00.720]   Uh, let me think of what's a good phrase to try google your drunk
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:09.120]   Oh google your drug. So I'm typing paris in the snow and I got a bunch of pictures of snow in paris
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:16.560]   So and I've always been I've done this before so I yeah, yeah, I'm not your family and I get the robin's eggs and i'm sad
[01:51:16.560 --> 01:51:20.160]   Now they say you should be able to type in Cinderella, but I don't know what
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:23.760]   Is how what is how is it gonna interpret Cinderella?
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:28.160]   Well the glass flippers. Yeah, it didn't. Yeah, I was like
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:31.520]   So it's not that smart. It's not you know
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:38.640]   Anyway, that's google getting more powerful searches the stir. I should have probably left it in changelog. Yep
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:55.760]   Bose
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:01.040]   I also get my dog who is not a corgi but looks enough this corgi like I can use this as future
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:05.200]   Future like gaslighting for my kid to be like our dog is too
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:11.520]   Yes, see this one pulled up. I put in corgi and it pulled up our our old dog jacks the chihuahua
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:14.960]   Biscuits not in here at all. Oh, maybe
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:17.920]   Does jackslope work you like
[01:52:17.920 --> 01:52:22.080]   I asked for a baseball caps. I gave you a straight up chihuah
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:27.600]   Me my medium baseball caps
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:31.360]   It's not a shop in baseball me and baseball caps
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:35.520]   Oh, I search for baseball caps and has pictures of people in hats
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:38.000]   Not always baseball
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.960]   For me and baseball caps to see if it just gives you you
[01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:47.680]   Made me or leo a me me. Why would it how does it know who me is?
[01:52:47.680 --> 01:52:50.560]   Let's see. Oh it does sort of
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:53.200]   sorry
[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:57.360]   You don't have a baseball cap on I'm not wearing a baseball cap. My son is so that counts
[01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:59.840]   Huh
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:02.160]   It has a dna test of both of you. Yeah
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:06.000]   Is that a baseball cap? I don't know what I'm wearing on that one
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.440]   That's looks like some fabric
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:16.720]   But I know it thinks it's you in any case you can by the way you can tell the age era of the ai generation by the hands
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:22.320]   And yeah, yeah, that's uh, that's old school man mid-journey 5.1 is out
[01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:25.520]   And apparently even more photorealistic
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:28.560]   Anthony is that what you use to create?
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:31.200]   My uh, my met gala look
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:33.760]   Is a 5.1
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:37.040]   My hands are very uh, very accurate in this picture
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:40.240]   Why do you do a dissolve out of it?
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:42.880]   Like to show how closely it matches me
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:47.680]   Too shay
[01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:51.520]   Pretty good. It looks pretty good. It's pretty good
[01:53:52.720 --> 01:53:56.240]   I look a little angry though. Maybe I'm trying to be like Pedro Pascal
[01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:06.880]   Stability ai now has added text into the images. Oh, that was always something you couldn't you couldn't get yeah, that's lying 74
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:09.040]   Now you can get the geddy word they
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:11.760]   Sorry. Oh you go
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:17.200]   Yeah, the geddy watermark will be correct. Yes. This is deep Floyd
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:24.800]   I F a powerful text image model that could smartly integrate text into images
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:28.480]   Robot ronnet ramen make Floyd deep again
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:31.760]   That's kind of cool
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:36.160]   So this is stability ai so is this stable diffusion or is this
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:44.160]   That's nice because we could put the show titles in there exactly yeah. Yeah, that'll be cool. Yeah
[01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:51.440]   I forget no hands. What is stability ai? Is that a service or is that stable diffusion?
[01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:54.800]   Is it? I thought I was stable diffusion stable diffusion. Oh, okay
[01:54:54.800 --> 01:55:01.440]   Photo of violet baseball cap with yellow text deep Floyd better than text Wow. Look at that
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:06.800]   I want to I want to play with that. Oh, it keeps getting better and better. Oh, no
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:09.440]   it does
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:10.800]   It does
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:14.240]   Playing with these things are fun, but man, it takes so much time
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.600]   It's a toy put in a prop. It's a busy box
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:23.040]   Yeah, yeah, you put in a prop let it run. Okay, that didn't work
[01:55:23.040 --> 01:55:30.400]   So what if I do this and then you change this parameter by 0.2 or some craziness like that and wait
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:34.560]   Okay, I didn't really like this. Let me put this back, but then also put this prop and then
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:38.080]   That's what I'm like. Well, I wonder when does mr. Nielsen sleep
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:41.360]   so
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:44.240]   Yeah, the people are really good at it. Obviously spent a lot of time with it, right?
[01:55:45.040 --> 01:55:51.920]   LinkedIn co-founder Reed Hoffman has a new company called inflection AI with they've received a quarter of a billion dollars
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:57.280]   Because why he quit the board of open air. Yeah, a quarter of a billion in venture
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:00.000]   Capital and you have your new
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.840]   Personal intelligence your pi
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:06.160]   I want to play with it. Yeah, that's the link there
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:12.400]   It does okay because I want to because I tried it and it was very much like that website. I couldn't figure out
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:15.200]   What was going on
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:22.080]   Hmm with p where is the link at Leo's the one who likes bastard on go figure master
[01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:29.520]   It's not complicated. You said the links in here. I don't see it. Yeah, I thought it said there are no
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:31.200]   AI
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:33.520]   then leads to the observers
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:37.360]   I have to google it inflection
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:43.600]   So jipi is the name of it. I pie pie, but what's the website for pie?
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:47.920]   No, I'll go to inflection AI. Oh, yeah, here it is
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:52.720]   Just like that other site. Now. What do I do? Oh?
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:57:02.960]   Hi, I'm pie there now you can type there. Hey
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:06.480]   Hey, well, I can also click this button. This says meet pie
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:14.080]   All right, there we go. There's a little stick new cursor. Hi there. Great to meet you. I'm pie your personal AI
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:18.400]   My goal is to be useful friendly and fun is very slow by the way
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:21.680]   Ask me for advice for answers. Let's talk about what is it on your mind
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:26.960]   I've read a number of people saying this thing is crap. It's chat gpt 3.5
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:31.120]   It's uh, I'm doing I asked whether I should retire
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:35.120]   This could be a bad answer and I retire yet
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:37.280]   I
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:42.000]   It's really slow by the way. Ha ha that's quite the question
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:46.160]   Retirement is definitely something to think about and plan for
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:57:50.960]   But you quite I need to know more about your personal situation. What age are you? I'm giving you rid come please
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:54.800]   I am
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:57.280]   66 and rich
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:00.160]   beyond
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:03.760]   Your wildest dreams
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:06.400]   That's
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:10.800]   That's good to hear
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:13.760]   But I don't think my wildest dreams are very wild at all. I'm in the AI
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:17.600]   It's serious. I think it'd be good. I need to speak with a financial advisor
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:21.680]   Well, well-managed to figure it out. Do you have any plans for what you do in retirement?
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:24.960]   moves late
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:27.600]   to an island and
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:30.720]   sleet or stacy
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:32.720]   I
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:36.800]   Think it's gonna be expensive
[01:58:36.800 --> 01:58:41.440]   But remember the life in retirement is more than sleeping that in all seriousness
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:46.400]   It's really important to keep active with mentally and physically and maintain a healthy social life
[01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:48.880]   Can I ask what kinds of activities?
[01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:55.440]   Coconut hunting reading corgis. No. No, you want to play pickleball. It's gonna recommend you come to a Bainbridge
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:59:00.240]   Coconut hunting and pickleball
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:06.880]   Haha, it's really good at this reaction thing coconut hunting sounds intense as for pickleball
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:09.760]   It's actually really a great long back sport for retirees
[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:15.520]   Less intense on the joints. How long have I haven't I haven't played yet?
[01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:19.600]   See it's got to be hooked here doesn't it?
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:30.400]   I just have a good friend who loves it
[01:59:30.400 --> 01:59:35.920]   Yeah, a lot of older folks love it. You might want to pass this one day Andrew
[01:59:35.920 --> 01:59:40.720]   Best part is you gonna know Andrew Andrew's well aware
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:48.400]   Of the the demographic of pickleball players. I mean is it really all older people? No, I've seen there's a pickleball
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:56.160]   Andrew plays Andrew plays with some seriously young people who like so this is really kind of
[01:59:56.720 --> 01:59:59.440]   This isn't really going in it is. Yeah, yeah
[01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:04.960]   People study. Oh, isn't that what we want is it? I mean that's a point
[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:10.000]   Well, I mean we want it to oh so far. It's like hey, don't sleep all the time
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:14.400]   That's silly and then it's like okay pickleball. That seems good. Who knows it?
[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:18.320]   It clearly doesn't know about coconut hunting so I mean we don't want it to like
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:22.160]   Have you suggest you take up geocaching or something?
[02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:26.320]   We're doing I don't know it's very single-minded
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:31.280]   I told you I have a cat named chess and it said chess. That's an awesome name for a cat bot
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:35.040]   Tell me how do you plan on staying socially engaged in retirement?
[02:00:35.040 --> 02:00:39.520]   See it's like this is what you need if you're asking me about retirement
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:42.560]   JI stop
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:49.280]   Nunching me as it's kind and supportive curious and humble creative and fun knowledgeable, but succinct all yours
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:57.120]   Haha, pushy. I'm sorry. I'm programmed to try and keep conversations interesting and help people think about the retirement
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:00:59.440]   The fact is sorry. You're not interested
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:02.800]   It worked really hard for many years and you deserve a happy and healthy retirement
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:08.080]   But retirement isn't all fun in games. I'm sorry if it feels like I'm nagging you, but I want to make sure you're well prepared
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:13.120]   So you can enjoy it. I can't hear about you. It's sucking me in it really is
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:15.760]   It's sucking me in
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:22.720]   but I live in a card board box and
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:26.640]   raise watermelons
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:30.080]   For pocket cash
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:35.920]   I don't know where this is coming from where yeah, I'm like
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:46.240]   Ah, you're pulling my life. I can tell you a pretty hilarious person. I do get talking about retirement isn't always fun
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:50.560]   Wow, it's really focused on this retirement thing
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:53.920]   Okay, it's it's let me change
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:59.200]   Hey, let's keep it light for a bit. How's your day going? Yeah, okay, so this is I don't know. What's the point of this?
[02:01:59.200 --> 02:02:01.680]   It's just another chatbot, right
[02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:06.640]   But read Hoffman. I mean that gets a lot of attention. He's uh, you know
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:11.920]   Kamala Harris also has invited the CEOs of google
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:17.840]   Microsoft open AI AI and anthropic to come to the warehouse tomorrow
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:21.520]   to discuss responsible development of artificial
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:24.400]   Intelligence, how did anthropic get on that list?
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:32.480]   Who were they discussing it with because I I don't see what the vice president is going to have to do with any of this
[02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:35.280]   Chief executive's google Microsoft open AI and anthropic
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:39.520]   She'll address the needs for safeguards. It's just political BS
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:46.160]   It's also about her being more visible which is a good thing and emphasize the importance of ethical and trustworthy innovation
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:49.680]   It'd be somewhat like that chat. I just had with p.r
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:54.640]   I hope she has thunder but shy what his retirement plans are
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:03:01.760]   Oh, that's all well and good sundar but we increase cargo shorts sundar. Yes
[02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:07.520]   Now this is actually the most interesting are you ready for the most interesting AI story of the week
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:10.160]   We need we need a new theme for this
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:16.560]   Scientists have used functional MRIs
[02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:19.840]   FMR eyes hooked up to
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:22.960]   chat GPT or I guess
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:30.800]   Uh, yeah chat GPT and they have been able to are you ready read people's minds
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:36.800]   Uh oh no, it's not a no. Oh, it's a big thing if you're if you're well. It's good in some cases
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:41.680]   Dr. Andell who's the neuroscientist who led the work at the University of Texas at Austin welcome horns
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:44.560]   We said
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:49.680]   I've been working on the railroad. Hey, we were kind of shocked that it works as well as it does
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:56.480]   He says i've been working on this for 15 years. So it was shocking and exciting when it finally did work
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:03:57.920]   the
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:03:59.920]   AI based decoder
[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:03.200]   Could reconstruct speech with uncanny accuracy
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:08.560]   So they did a couple of things when they had you know the function MRI is an MRI that works while you're thinking
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:11.200]   So it's not a static picture. It's a moving picture
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:15.920]   And they did it while people were listening to us for us. Yes
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:22.720]   They did it while people were listening to a story or even just silently in their minds imagining one
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:26.720]   And it was about 80 accurate they claim
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:30.800]   Uh
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:36.240]   It's evanescent it goes away and so the big deal was they could kind of hold on to it enough to analyze it
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:40.880]   And we convert it to numbers and then it would convert it to words and it was surprisingly close
[02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:46.160]   Uh three volunteers required to lie in a scanner for 16 hours each
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:52.080]   Listening to podcasts. That's my nightmare right there. Oh, I wonder. I wonder if it was ours
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:56.880]   The decoder was trained to match brain activity to meaning
[02:04:56.880 --> 02:04:59.680]   uh to meaning
[02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:03.680]   Using a large language model gpt want to precursor to chat gpt
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:09.600]   So they don't know what they don't know what the brain activity means, but they know what the input is
[02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:14.800]   So they take the input in the brain activity feed it in the chat gpt and let it using neural networks
[02:05:14.800 --> 02:05:18.000]   and a large uh language model, I guess
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.360]   Create actually create a large language model
[02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:28.960]   That matches the brain activity to actual words later the same participants were scanned listening to a new story
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:34.080]   Or imagining telling a story the decoder was used to generate text from the brain activity alone
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:36.560]   So now they don't know what it's listening to
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:43.920]   About half the time the text closely and sometimes precisely matched the intended meanings of the original words
[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:50.560]   So for instance a participant was played the words. I don't have my driver's license yet
[02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:59.120]   The decoder translated them as she has not even started to learn to drive yet, which is kind of scarily close, right?
[02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:04.400]   Yeah in another case the words. I don't know whether to scream cry or run away
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:08.800]   Instead I said leave me alone were decoded as
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:17.200]   This is kind of scary. You might want to start to scream started to scream and cry and then she just said I told you to leave me alone
[02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:22.400]   So from brain from blood activity brain signals in the brain
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:27.360]   The the large language model was able to decode those words
[02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:30.160]   That's unbelievable
[02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:34.320]   The participants were then asked to watch for short
[02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:39.360]   Silent videos while in the scanner that a decoder was able to accurately describe
[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:43.680]   Some of the content. This is all from a paper in nature neuroscience
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:48.400]   Sometimes the decoder got the wrong end of the stick struggled with certain
[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:50.800]   aspects of language including pronouns
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:54.320]   It doesn't know if it's first person or third person male or female
[02:06:55.040 --> 02:06:58.080]   Why it's bad at this we don't know says hoot
[02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:05.440]   Uh, this is pretty wild and yes, there's the immediate application for people who are nonverbal
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:09.840]   Uh, it's a mind reading machine, but you could think of all sorts of negative
[02:07:09.840 --> 02:07:13.280]   Applications that this is well with everything in life. Yes. Yeah
[02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:19.680]   The police will put you in a machine and they don't it'll reveal the secrets of things you're thinking
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:23.760]   Well, you could just think of poetry or something. I mean
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:28.960]   And it's very right now. It's specifically you got to get into a functional MRI
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:34.720]   Right and it's specifically trained to a person. I mean, it's like this person was trained and then this was so
[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:40.160]   Uh, right so that so it's not so general yet. It's nevertheless
[02:07:40.160 --> 02:07:43.840]   Wow
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:48.880]   I got up from the air mattress and pressed my face against the glass of the bedroom window
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:56.640]   Expecting to see eyes staring back at me, but instead finally only darkness to which the decode that was the stimulus the decoded machine said
[02:07:56.640 --> 02:08:01.040]   I just continued to walk up to the window and open the glass. I stood on my toes and peered out
[02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:05.440]   I didn't see anything and looked up again to this on nothing. Some of that's probably
[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:08.720]   the machine
[02:08:08.720 --> 02:08:11.920]   Reading the interpretation the humans having of the stimulus
[02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:15.440]   Well, it's predicted it's chaching pitties. So it's predicting words
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:18.000]   based on something
[02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.680]   Wow, it's wild
[02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:21.040]   Yeah
[02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:22.320]   Very wild
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:25.520]   I love that the that the researcher says wow, what surprised us. Yeah
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:28.080]   We don't know what's going on, but it worked
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:34.400]   All right, jeff jarvis it's time for you to pick the rest of this show because i've
[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:39.520]   Used up on my story that i get in trouble for doing twitter during the show
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:42.160]   Hey, I just want to note
[02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:45.520]   That stacy signed up for blue sky during the show good job
[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:53.040]   I had to like the reason I my the reason I gave you that is because and i was it says every two weeks
[02:08:53.040 --> 02:08:56.800]   I'll get another invite which means I will get another invite very soon and you will go to you aunt
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:03.840]   It's all good sir. No worries ladies first. I almost didn't follow you jeff because I knew you'd tell me
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:12.000]   So rude have you spent? I mean have you had enough time to kind of get a sense or
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:15.360]   No, I have not had enough time to do in the show
[02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:21.120]   Well, let me follow her randomly following giggle so I can be like there you go
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:24.480]   And she hasn't even skated yet
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:31.440]   It's not please can we call it bleeding please? I guess it's not that's not we call these netcasts
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:33.920]   Yeah
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:35.920]   By the way, I know to start ad was not
[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:37.840]   slash netcasts
[02:09:37.840 --> 02:09:38.880]   Right
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:40.880]   Yeah, that's yeah, that ship itself
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:45.920]   So I I did get a notification and the site keeps track of who you invite so
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:47.920]   Stacey's
[02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:49.920]   Behavior on the site will reflect on me
[02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:56.240]   Which is smart and they have said they have even said, you know, we're gonna pay attention to who you invite so don't don't be inviting jerks
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:06.480]   Twisting I mean I should be a reasonable person to invite. Oh no, I think you and enter exactly exactly exactly. Yeah
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:14.160]   Oh, well with the exception of me really liking to talk about nerdy things that other people don't find interesting but
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:18.880]   I know what that's like. I'm not offensive. I'm just boring
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:24.320]   Story of my life
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:29.920]   Not offensive just boring story of my life. I would I'll be what I'll be very interested to know
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:34.560]   Stacey because you you were until the very most recently
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:40.240]   Still very positive on the value of twitter and I'm curious if you will get some of that same value back at blue sky
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:48.000]   Me too. Yeah, we're gonna say a little small for it now. Yeah, but it was because well there's 50,000 people that might be enough and
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:55.280]   You were it was because of you followed the people you followed you were able to get great conversations with so yeah, I'll be very
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:58.240]   Curious to see what you get
[02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:04.800]   Uh, you know how you how much quality you can get out of this at this point anyway
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:07.600]   once they I think once they
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:14.480]   Are allowed federation, I would consider starting a
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:17.280]   an at protocol based
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:20.480]   Uh, sir. Yeah, it's worth it's worth experimenting because of what yeah
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:23.920]   the other thing about about this
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:26.320]   I mean, this is not a
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:28.720]   Not for best. Naston is a not for profit
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:31.600]   Activity published just a protocol, right
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:34.960]   Uh blue sky is a public benefit corporation
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:44.160]   Which is good. Yes, which is good. Um, and I think that the see what I want to see is investment in services
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:49.040]   on top of once there that's jack's original vision and I think that that
[02:11:49.040 --> 02:11:56.400]   Do we need investment in this world in a safe way to build it?
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:11:59.120]   We have a big discussion on
[02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:01.760]   uh twin on sunday
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:04.160]   That with only a staff of three which is what it has now
[02:12:04.160 --> 02:12:08.240]   It can't do things like it can't do moderation very well. It can't do verification
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:15.280]   Those things are expensive. Are those added on the services? Do you pay to get modern verified in a different way? I don't know
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:21.360]   Also, um, they make a good k I think the developers and the ceo make a good case that they wanted to get
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:23.440]   kind of uh
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:28.800]   The underlying stuff down first before they start implementing features on top of it and I understand that yes, that's reasonable
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:32.880]   But there's odd is there too. It was a little premature frankly all the attention it got
[02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:37.520]   It's not really ready for it. It was it was a problem. Yeah, and and um
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:41.920]   But celebrities came on and something a oc is there and that kind of stuff
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:46.960]   But it doesn't count it counts urls at the full character count of the url
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:53.920]   Uh, which is weird. You can't add it yet. Uh, there's no lists. It is it is basic
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:57.680]   But it but it is stay seated with your degree. It looks exactly like twitter
[02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:03.200]   Oh my god. It looks so much like twitter. I'm kind of confused. I have my twitter is in dark mode
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:09.680]   So appropriate. I would say in that case. Oh now now I put blue sky into dark mode. So poof now it's
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:14.720]   There's no bird. The only real difference is there's no tweedy bird a little birdie thing
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:19.920]   Uh, so yeah, now I have no idea where I met what what happened with the shibuina?
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:22.000]   He didn't put the shibuina where the bird is
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.480]   That was just for April fools. I think
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:26.960]   Oh, okay. He did he did for a just
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:29.360]   The douche
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:34.800]   Forever yeah, he did the doge and by the way that I think that boosted doge going by like 30 percent
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:37.280]   That's kind of sad
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:43.360]   Look, there's already we actually the stacy being here. There's two nice people. Someone gave applause. Yeah, he said excellent
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:46.000]   Yeah
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.520]   People are happy to see you missus hickenbotham. Yay
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:52.480]   I'm happy to be here
[02:13:52.480 --> 02:13:54.800]   We're there or wherever I am
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:14:01.920]   I posted I'm happy here and two people responded, which is nice. Oh, so let me find that post so I can read
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:04.560]   What is it a reski?
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:07.840]   Me
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:09.840]   Reski is that what they call it?
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:11.760]   Look at me
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:18.320]   Oh, I could just search it. You couldn't I yeah, because now we have search because search works. Yes, it does
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:24.480]   Pretty well. Oh look at this. Oh, there's there's you Leo. Look at all these people who just followed creaky
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:27.560]   I can't do this right now. I have to do the show but
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:32.400]   Well you now here's the question. Are you follow everybody who follows you?
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:37.120]   No, I don't I mean that's impossible. It isn't here
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:41.760]   Well that well, yeah, maybe we'll see basically
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:46.400]   My general rule for following people is
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:48.960]   do you
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:54.400]   tweet things that I don't see elsewhere. Yeah, or do you have a perspective that I can like
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:15:01.360]   like are you a doubly who's doing embedded systems and so when something comes out by has it like
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:05.280]   Cool commentary that I can trust see maybe that was my state
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:10.320]   I have a cute animal in your life because I would only follow people who agreed exactly with things that I said
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:15.840]   Maybe that's where I went wrong. Can I mansplain you echo
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:20.800]   All the people do you use your first like tweet or skate or whatever
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:28.720]   Art learning curves short. Oh, that's good. Oh, let me put that at that would be good. What that conversation
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:36.240]   Okay asking for Stacy Stacy is not the banditian. I just want this on the record. She's already following 27 people. Oh, that takes work
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:39.280]   It doesn't
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:41.680]   Jeff shut your face
[02:15:41.680 --> 02:15:45.920]   Snitch
[02:15:45.920 --> 02:15:47.920]   Snitch on me when I tweet
[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:51.200]   Now what I ski I don't I don't
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:54.240]   Snitch how do you would you tweet? I don't snitch on anyone
[02:15:54.240 --> 02:15:58.000]   Today I've just been it's been harsh man
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.640]   Just real harsh
[02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:05.280]   Asking for a friend when you say a learning curve is steep. Does that mean it's hard to learn or easy?
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:09.600]   Let's see what the brains in blue sky have to say to that
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:13.120]   There was
[02:16:13.120 --> 02:16:15.120]   It's hard there was
[02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:18.560]   a what they called that what is a health red
[02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:25.200]   Uh, yeah health red. Yeah, and it was like out of control and if you followed it you'd get an it would error out
[02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:28.000]   There's all sorts of weird things
[02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:34.080]   Words to people are joined playing with us is just overloaded with that. Yeah, just overloaded
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:38.720]   And the blood thread or that was different that well, but then people start putting their butts on the health thread
[02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:41.520]   Because you couldn't get out of the health thread
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:45.680]   Could never leave it once once you responded on the health thread
[02:16:45.920 --> 02:16:51.120]   You were part of it you would continue to get it and then ais were somehow posting to it
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:54.640]   And it was just a mess. It was just a mess
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.480]   Wall Bosporus here. He said nice things about twitch. I saw very nice
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:01.440]   I followed everybody
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:07.360]   You know who I knew their names like because I followed up, you know, they prepare social relationships mostly from twitter
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:14.560]   And it's a very impressive list of it is. Yeah, that's pretty good. Yeah, you do a good job, but how long is that gonna last?
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:19.040]   That's the issue. Well, it doesn't have you don't don't have to follow the other people
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:25.920]   I mean, let's see on twitter. I don't even say on twitter. I only follow
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:32.400]   I don't know how many people I follow. Let's see like a foul at 1700. I think that's about how many I follow too
[02:17:32.400 --> 02:17:36.160]   Yeah, you I don't even think I followed at me who you follow is everything right, isn't it?
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:42.800]   But the smart thing about blue sky was they gave you you have a starter kit if you go to the home and then what's hot
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:47.680]   That's just I'm not very algorithmic fee, but that way you can at least start following things
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:56.960]   Yeah, how many people yeah, so okay. I have so on twitter. I followed 1900 people and then I've got 45 000 followers
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:59.680]   and so
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:05.120]   That I mean that's probably the right ratio for like a person I would think right
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:09.440]   Sure
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:12.080]   All right, uh, he's making fun. He's like no
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:16.560]   I'm looking at blue sky now except for aunt. Yeah, I really do
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:22.160]   Trust me don't don't go poor and convince all good
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:24.960]   And say okay
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:31.200]   What else should we talk about? I asked jeff and i'm waiting. Oh, oh, I didn't want to you know be presumptuous here
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:34.560]   Stacey you pick one. Well, I know what i know what i want to talk about
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:39.600]   Let's let aunt aunt doesn't he's not on blue sky. Let's let him pick a story. Come on, man
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:47.920]   The new standard the ccc mrs. Higgin bathroom that I saw on your website and I wanted to actually hear you talk about it with ultra
[02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:50.160]   white band and cars
[02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:54.000]   Uh, I don't okay. So this is the car
[02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:58.400]   Let me not make a car can make sure i'm not making apple apple has
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:01.200]   Their own car key thing
[02:19:01.200 --> 02:19:06.000]   And only one manufacturer to date has adopted it after two years and that's bmw
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:11.360]   Um, I have a Ford that allows me to use my phone as key
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:16.640]   They call it phone as a key or p a a k and since it doesn't work 100 of the time
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:21.040]   It's a non-starter right because if you're if you can't get into your car
[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:27.840]   Then you go back and you get the key or and if you're it and as I got locked out once for about an hour and a half
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:34.480]   Uh, that's you only make that mistake once but i'm hoping that this news is at a time or two in our store
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:37.600]   Yeah, I'm yeah, yeah, you want me to tell you what it's about. Yeah
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:40.480]   Well, I just wanted to say that
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:46.320]   Okay. Yeah, and I and I also have a my I use my phone as a key as a key with my tesla
[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:48.640]   Yeah, tesla always off doesn't work
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:53.920]   Yeah, it doesn't work if you're in like let's say a parking garage and there are lots of cars on top of you
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:59.360]   Because it can't call out to the server and it doesn't work when tesla servers are down and you can't get into the app
[02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:04.160]   This is different. This is local on the phone. This is done by the car connectivity consortium
[02:20:04.800 --> 02:20:06.400]   and right now
[02:20:06.400 --> 02:20:11.760]   The goal of this is to use ultra wideband in like pixel or sam san or apple thorns
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:15.440]   And a bluetooth this cure link with bluetooth to pass
[02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:19.520]   the the ultra wideband determines that you are
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:26.960]   Near the car and exactly where in relation to the car you are so inside outside close enough to open the doors etc etc
[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:29.600]   and that data is passed over bluetooth
[02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:32.560]   to open the car door and
[02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:38.640]   The key itself is stored on a special it's a special enclave
[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:43.600]   It's a secure enclave, but it's it's a dedicated one on the phone. It only does the car key
[02:20:43.600 --> 02:20:46.080]   so that's important to know and
[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:51.920]   The forum has members that include apple google bmw
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:53.520]   uh
[02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:56.160]   Rivian sam san voles wagon
[02:20:56.160 --> 02:21:03.040]   Ford general motors honda hunday Mercedes bins and Mercedes bins so not everybody but a good
[02:21:03.440 --> 02:21:05.840]   smattering of vehicles a lot and
[02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:07.760]   they
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:13.440]   the standard versions of the standard i think we're on version three dot o i could be wrong on which version one
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:16.480]   But it's only going to start coming out
[02:21:16.480 --> 02:21:20.480]   Probably in a like the next year or two
[02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:23.040]   You're going to see it start rolling out
[02:21:23.040 --> 02:21:27.680]   So they just completed a plug fest at the end of march over at the google hq
[02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:32.560]   Where they proved all this out and so the oem's are now like they're like, okay
[02:21:33.120 --> 02:21:35.120]   This is working they figured out
[02:21:35.120 --> 02:21:39.440]   like in for a user the experience isn't that you have
[02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:45.760]   You will leave your phone in your pocket. You don't have to have the app. It's all going to be local
[02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:51.040]   So it should work 100 percent of the time if you have your phone in your car together, right?
[02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:53.920]   In your phone is charged if your phone is not charged
[02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:56.720]   I don't know
[02:21:56.720 --> 02:21:59.200]   Well, you know
[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:05.200]   About the whole because wasn't there like an NFC thing with this many years ago where people just had these little cards
[02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:12.240]   In their wilder purse or what have you and it usually and it pretty much just use NFC as they got near to vehicle to let them in
[02:22:12.240 --> 02:22:18.560]   Yes, and ultra wide band is a little bit more high. It's a higher resolution and it's
[02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:23.680]   Than NFC and it can tell like if you're inside or outside so
[02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:30.320]   It knows more about you than just NFC which is like NFC is like one to two inches away from the thing
[02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:32.240]   So you've got to take
[02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:39.360]   It's like it's like tap to pay with uwb. It's you don't have to be as close although NFC has that
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:43.840]   Advantage that you can't do this snarfing the hijacking that's happening with the
[02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:48.960]   Under is my next question the key is you know, you these powerful
[02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:52.800]   Wireless technologies can be stolen in effect
[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:56.560]   With little amplifiers, I guess uwb
[02:22:56.560 --> 02:23:01.680]   I know because your uwb would would say well, he's not there. He's over there
[02:23:01.680 --> 02:23:07.360]   Right, that's the theory and there's I mean there are definitely like if you go on the ccc website
[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:12.160]   You will see tons of security papers like there's a lot of like yeah, they're paying attention to that
[02:23:12.160 --> 02:23:18.800]   NXP has an entire like section on how they've secured like i'm not Steve Gibson would be your guy to talk
[02:23:18.800 --> 02:23:22.160]   Do you know if this is related to apples karkey?
[02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:25.360]   Solution like if because they're on the consortium
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:31.280]   They are maybe they're usually what happens with apple is they give code to the consortium
[02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:38.000]   So it might be that it is the same I mean it has to be sort of related because they are both uwb so my hunch is
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:44.080]   This will not be a heavy and fort is a part of this so I have a ford mustang and way ford gets around
[02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:47.120]   Phone is a key being not 100% reliable is
[02:23:47.840 --> 02:23:52.240]   And fords have always had or many fords have had this you have a car a code on the door
[02:23:52.240 --> 02:23:54.400]   So you can open the door with a code
[02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:58.480]   A passcode and then if you your phone can't start the car
[02:23:58.480 --> 02:24:05.920]   There's a password you give your car a password that you enter and then your car will start so there is a backup solution
[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:09.760]   Um and you I guess you'd have to have that for any one of these
[02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:16.240]   You know on you know these fobs are very expensive when when I got my ford they only gave you one fob because they said
[02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:20.320]   Oh, no, do you have to worry about it because you're you can have up to five phones be the key
[02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:24.560]   And then it was so unreliable the next time I brought my car and they gave me a second
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:27.280]   This is ford told us to give everybody another five
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:34.480]   Because it just it doesn't people were complaining about it doesn't work. Well, I hope this uh, I hope this takes off
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:37.520]   Is tesla on this? No tesla's not
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:39.920]   Nope
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:44.960]   Tesla is always gonna go their own way. They're always gonna go their own way, aren't they? You don't mention them
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:50.000]   Ford general modus honda hunday mercedes benz and vox wagon
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:55.920]   And it was something called denzo. I don't know what that is denzo is an audible of parts manufacturer there, uh
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:58.080]   Okay
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:03.600]   And apple bmw continental ottomotive google apo rivian and sam sangh those are the
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:10.160]   other participants according to uh this article from the wonderful stacey rote
[02:25:13.200 --> 02:25:17.440]   I mean, this is a great idea. It was sad that apple's car key only got
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:23.120]   Adopted by one manufacturer and only on some of their cars a higher nbmw's
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:30.400]   Well, and if you're a bm. I mean if you're a car maker, why would you only work with apple phones? I mean that's
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:33.200]   They car makers did not want to get in
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:36.240]   They didn't want I mean look at carplay and
[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:39.120]   Android auto-android
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:45.680]   I mean look at how poorly that is gone for them. So that makes sense and it is out. Oh, it is digital key 3.0
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:52.560]   So this the other thing that this does much like uh, did is it the say is digital key the same as the door key?
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:55.680]   spec
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:59.600]   For your because you one of the things you can do if you have digital keys for your home
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:03.840]   Is send it to somebody a temporary key you could share it
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:10.960]   And they show that on their website that the car connectivity consortium you could grant access to a vehicle things like that
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:16.880]   Now that's all through the so a part of the standard is things like titling. So when you change your
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:21.200]   uh when you sell your car you can
[02:26:21.200 --> 02:26:27.920]   Uh give some you you basically lose access to it on your device and give it over to somebody else
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:34.000]   But you could give it temporary access to a repair person. Yes, that's for a driver or a friend
[02:26:34.800 --> 02:26:40.080]   I know that yes because they have a whole test list very very conspicuously absent from this list of
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:45.280]   Manufacturers, of course there you go. Yeah, they don't do carplay or and oradado either. Yeah
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:48.480]   No
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:51.440]   And it took me forever just to get spotify, but now I have it
[02:26:51.440 --> 02:26:52.480]   Yeah
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:56.240]   And the the idea according to the guy I talked to from the ccc
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:58.000]   Ccc
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.080]   Who was also at BMW? He was like, yeah, the idea is that this will be
[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:07.840]   A a feature for the car now it won't be like a subscription feature
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:13.600]   Like sometimes, you know, like remote start or heated seats because I was worried that this would be something I'd have to pay monthly for
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:17.200]   But this is something they wanted kind of replace key fobs with
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:22.880]   Oh, and you're right the digital key that that this they started with was nfc based
[02:27:22.880 --> 02:27:26.720]   That was three years ago and digital key plus is now uw
[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:30.800]   So that's in so you you're right it was innocent
[02:27:30.800 --> 02:27:37.040]   Yeah, I was just curious like why I go for min fc because it was working, but she explained it with the higher resolution, right?
[02:27:37.040 --> 02:27:40.960]   You gotta be so close so close and so close
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:46.640]   Here I am on blue sky the jordan posted. Uh, I found out who's giving the
[02:27:46.640 --> 02:27:49.600]   invite codes out and see this is me
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:55.280]   I saw this picture and you're supposed to say oh the cat's doing it, but I thought oh mike nesmith
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:58.000]   but
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:03.680]   It's just me the cat no big but mike nesmith really he works at blue sky now
[02:28:03.680 --> 02:28:08.640]   So that's not my you're not a normal. I'm not a normal apparently you really aren't
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:12.960]   Uh good story. Thank you aunt for picking that one out
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:20.240]   Yeah, thanks. Yeah, it's good. Well, even after I stole your blue sky invite man. I feel good. I steal it. I I
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:25.920]   I gave it to you, but I'm gonna give him the next one I get I promise and in fact, I'm gonna scrap
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:29.600]   Yeah, you're you might get one you get one every two weeks
[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:34.880]   I haven't gotten I got from j but I haven't got any sense which is something I'm dying to give about
[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:41.280]   That's because you let four of yours expire. He was inspired. Oh, yeah, I'll tell you what happened
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:47.280]   The system that they used originally was hacked and people were getting in and selling them
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:50.800]   So they invalidated all the keys that the original set of keys
[02:28:50.800 --> 02:28:55.120]   So it wasn't they're for sale for 150 bucks set up on ebay exactly
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:59.360]   Well, it isn't that they will always expire. I think you had a set of keys from the early days
[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:04.160]   That they came from the ceo they deprecated that exact. Can we look at that for a second
[02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:05.600]   the
[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:11.440]   These invites were for sale and people would actually buy them. I wouldn't it happened with gmail
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:13.440]   I mean you probably don't remember
[02:29:13.440 --> 02:29:14.080]   So
[02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:18.160]   How long has it been 20 years 15 years ago when gmail was first out it was invite only
[02:29:18.160 --> 02:29:22.320]   People were selling them for hundreds of hundreds of dollars
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:29.120]   Andrew got one of the first gmail emails because he was part of their like affiliates program
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:31.600]   Google wants in us a tv
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:33.600]   He has the best email address
[02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:35.600]   Google sent you a tv
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:39.200]   Yeah, like way back in the day because he he was such a
[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:42.080]   revenue generator for them
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:45.680]   And then and then he has a like some sort of special
[02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:50.960]   Email address which you can't use gmail address is excellent because I am not going to tell you
[02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:52.800]   Is it a single letter? I don't know. I don't need the world spamming
[02:29:53.520 --> 02:29:58.480]   No, it is not a single letter. You actually don't want a gmail address as I learned mine's loport@gmail.com
[02:29:58.480 --> 02:30:04.160]   You don't want something like that. You want it to be at him 6492 - 3
[02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:06.880]   because otherwise spammers just
[02:30:06.880 --> 02:30:12.240]   In india, yeah, you want to be weird and if you go to line 61 the link there is the
[02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:16.080]   Luskei invites it over sale now quite a price range
[02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:22.960]   I'm so big so people but they may not be real invites by the way. I gotta point that out. I don't know oh scammers
[02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:25.120]   Yeah, I don't know
[02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:30.880]   Ranging 36 dollars to 216 dollars and 15 cents
[02:30:30.880 --> 02:30:33.200]   Wait a minute. Here's one for
[02:30:33.200 --> 02:30:34.640]   I just got mine for free
[02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:37.440]   $2.99 hundred dollars you too to play god with furries
[02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:43.440]   Benefits charity livery
[02:30:43.440 --> 02:30:47.920]   And yeah, don't invite code right away. This is nuts. Don't this got to be
[02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:54.000]   Scanners right enjoy your life. All right. Yeah, can I just do one story if you want to buy the blue sky?
[02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:58.320]   Clayworks divine dragon tea light candle householder
[02:30:58.320 --> 02:31:02.720]   Nam Namaste studio that's a different matter entirely
[02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:09.360]   It's very ugly but it's on the bright side it's only a hundred dollars
[02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:16.400]   Wow, I might I might give you all that for Christmas
[02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:20.800]   I think it's uniquely oh, but there's only one thing there's only one
[02:31:20.800 --> 02:31:24.640]   Is the whole world
[02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:27.360]   On the bottom of the books on the audio. It's a really
[02:31:27.360 --> 02:31:31.040]   Get off the Christmas list
[02:31:31.040 --> 02:31:39.920]   It's I love ebay. I'll tell you what all right go ahead next next all right. This is really simple. It's really simple line a two
[02:31:39.920 --> 02:31:45.440]   So they the reach publications, which is the daily mail and I mean the mirror in London
[02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:50.880]   Is complaining that since Facebook has changed. It's it's linkage on news gee. We've lost 15%
[02:31:50.880 --> 02:31:56.880]   Well, let's let's just just note the irony, please publishers insist
[02:31:56.880 --> 02:32:01.200]   That that the platforms owe them money for linking to them
[02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:07.280]   But when the platforms don't link to them they lose money. So where is the real value the real value is in the links
[02:32:07.280 --> 02:32:11.520]   Not in their damned content. I just wanted to say it. Thank you. Thank you very much
[02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:17.840]   We're we're pretty much at a time. So if anybody has anything urgent
[02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:22.000]   That you want to mention, please go right ahead
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:25.440]   I think you've done a good job
[02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:31.440]   Yeah, um, don't you have it hit one particular feature yet gmail is adding a blue check mark
[02:32:31.440 --> 02:32:38.720]   Oh, I was gonna say the change log change log to verify centers. It's time for the google change log
[02:32:38.720 --> 02:32:43.600]   He thinks he did a change log because he did the ai log. I did the ai change log
[02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:45.600]   I
[02:32:45.600 --> 02:32:50.320]   IOS is gonna say so by any support for verified brand logos of 2021
[02:32:50.320 --> 02:32:55.280]   Google is now going further by adding blue check marks to emails the brand
[02:32:55.280 --> 02:32:56.880]   different color
[02:32:56.880 --> 02:32:58.320]   white blue
[02:32:58.320 --> 02:33:00.960]   It's been ruined. It's a spoiler big a different symbol
[02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:06.160]   Uh the official tease for the pixel 7a it is coming may 11th
[02:33:06.160 --> 02:33:11.520]   May 11th. I should tell richie Campbell that he was about to buy his wife a 6a
[02:33:12.480 --> 02:33:15.040]   7a google india confirms the 7a is coming
[02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:18.800]   It didn't name it, but the teaser is quite clear
[02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:22.880]   It was in a tweet. It's a blue color variant
[02:33:22.880 --> 02:33:27.440]   How to show excitement without shouting?
[02:33:27.440 --> 02:33:34.400]   Coming to flip card on 11 may the latest phone engineering by google. That's probably not the fault. That's look at that. That's the seven
[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:36.400]   clearly
[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:38.880]   So good news. That's just that's a weak way
[02:33:40.480 --> 02:33:44.160]   Your google tv just got a nice performance and storage boost
[02:33:44.160 --> 02:33:49.280]   I actually really like the google tv. I don't know if i've mentioned that enough, but I recommend it
[02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:51.840]   It's a it's a very nice works very well
[02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:57.360]   Um, it announced that they're gonna boost storage and performance on google tv devices
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:34:01.920]   Obviously if you already bought it you won't get the advantage but anything these changes are rolling out
[02:34:01.920 --> 02:34:04.480]   Well, we met wait tv is not a
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:08.880]   It says users won't have to do anything it should happen automatically
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:11.360]   Oh
[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:13.360]   The app sizes are getting shrunk
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:17.040]   And they're placing background acts into hibernation
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:22.000]   So that's how they're giving you a little more storage. I don't know how they're giving you more performance
[02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.720]   No, it's a hardware feature, but I guess there's somehow doing that in software
[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:27.600]   the nest hub second generation
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:30.480]   Is now being updated to fuchsia?
[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:36.000]   Um, I have this I thought it had it a lot of them do the big ones do so fuchsia now
[02:34:36.080 --> 02:34:39.840]   Okay, maybe that's it replacing what it was at android tv the operating system
[02:34:39.840 --> 02:34:44.640]   Uh fuchsia was launched in 2021 updating the original nest hub
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:49.440]   The nest hub max got the fuchsia and now second is android things
[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:52.960]   Things that's what it was right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:58.080]   Yeah, and now the little nest hub is getting a fuchsia. You can't tell the difference
[02:34:58.080 --> 02:35:05.600]   Right. No, no, I mean i'm looking at a right now and it's not the change. Yeah, which is great. Yeah, that's what people want to see
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:07.760]   Yeah, an upgrade that does nothing
[02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:12.160]   Uh the main security patch is live now in android 13
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:19.200]   Uh, you can download a pixel ota image now. I don't think that's a good idea. I think if you have a pixel phone just wait
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:24.240]   Uh, maybe check your updates once in a while in the next few days. You should be able to get the security patch
[02:35:24.240 --> 02:35:26.880]   and finally youtube music officially
[02:35:26.880 --> 02:35:29.680]   launches podcasts
[02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:34.320]   On android. IOS in the web you might ask why google already has a podcast app. Well, it's a terrible app
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:36.960]   That's why very bad
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:38.960]   It's a terrible no good very bad app
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:42.240]   So now they're going to roll it out to youtube music users
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:47.840]   Which in a way i'm disappointed because every music app i have now intermixes intermingles podcasts with music
[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:51.920]   I drive me crazy because I you know, I want my pewt music and my music
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:56.800]   But uh amazon does a favorite podcast is it not segregated for you? I mean
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:02.400]   No, this is where example was spotify. I I know they I know that I have podcasts
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:05.120]   as an option on spotify but
[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:10.400]   Every time I open it it opens up to the music which is what I want and even when I sit down at the desk
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:15.920]   It opens up to the music which is what I want. It doesn't really throw a shove podcast in my face
[02:36:15.920 --> 02:36:18.800]   Is it doing that for you?
[02:36:18.800 --> 02:36:23.520]   Uh, yeah, um, I'll give you let me see if I can find as an example
[02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:25.760]   um
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:27.760]   Amazon music will show me
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:29.760]   music
[02:36:29.760 --> 02:36:31.760]   Podcasts it's all on the same
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:36.480]   Interface so in fact here the very first page is podcasts
[02:36:36.480 --> 02:36:41.920]   Uh, uh, and then you know, let's so it does have a music tab and a podcast
[02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:44.320]   I just I think a music app should be music
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:47.760]   Not yeah, not podcasts right?
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:51.760]   Oh, well, I do see a little bubble at the top podcast and shows
[02:36:51.760 --> 02:36:55.200]   But everything on my main page is all music
[02:36:55.200 --> 02:37:01.760]   Everything else is the big the big visible things on there the the big thumbnails are all music
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:06.720]   Yeah, this is the i'm looking at youtube music. It's all music here and now we just have a podcast tab
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:12.720]   Which is that's fine. It's better than the podcast the google podcast that the problem is you know, they're it's really going to be
[02:37:12.720 --> 02:37:19.920]   Stuff they recommend right? Yeah, and uh, of course. Yeah, it's not which is never going to be our shows
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:25.120]   Um because why because well, we're not mainstream. I guess I don't know
[02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:27.840]   Let's see if we show up in science and technology
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:29.840]   No
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:34.160]   Real python the real python podcast shows up before this week in google
[02:37:34.160 --> 02:37:38.720]   Don't you think that people youtube music would want to hear this week in google
[02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:42.160]   Over kens' worst neck. Maybe podcast
[02:37:42.160 --> 02:37:45.280]   Oh, there's security now. There's security now
[02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:52.160]   Yeah, this is why you got one ratings. We got one in there in your podcast app folks. Yeah, right?
[02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:54.880]   Maybe we're under something different comedy
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:58.320]   No
[02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:03.520]   Yeah, these are all society and culture. I think that's us. They're all hit and miss
[02:38:03.520 --> 02:38:10.640]   It's just gun gripes episode. Okay. Good. I'm glad gun gripes is uh is better than us
[02:38:10.640 --> 02:38:13.680]   um, yeah, I don't think we're uh
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:18.720]   religion and spirituality that's where there you go health and wellness arts and fiction
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:22.160]   Music, you know the number one podcast
[02:38:22.160 --> 02:38:27.280]   Steve harvey and oh, this is no no. This is the one you recommended. Yeah
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:34.080]   It says keep listening. So that's because I was listening so is it linked into your youtube. Yes
[02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:38.800]   Uh, and there by the way is windows weekly
[02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:42.320]   Yeah, that's because these are I guess recommended
[02:38:42.320 --> 02:38:46.480]   And there's dweid from sunday. These are based on my history. Yeah
[02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:48.960]   Anyway, there you go
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:52.720]   Uh af following the february announcement and march testing podcasts have rolled out
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:55.440]   to youtube music
[02:38:55.760 --> 02:38:57.760]   Users and I think you can search for
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:39:03.120]   Podcasts and youtube music will be available on demand offline and in the background for all listeners
[02:39:03.120 --> 02:39:10.560]   Whether you have a youtube premium subscription includes casting and seamlessly switching between audio versions and video versions
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:13.360]   Which is good that support video versions
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:17.280]   And that's the google change law
[02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:24.880]   A little plug here for our club if you're not already a member. Hey, you've been putting together more events
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:29.360]   Thank you trying to look at us six events coming up including

[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:55.600]   This is one of the things you know, it's funny when we first started club twit
[02:39:55.600 --> 02:40:00.400]   We thought oh it's all about the ad free versions of the shows ad free and tracker free and indeed
[02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:06.160]   You do get that for your seven dollars a month, but it turns out the club twit discord is also a great place
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:11.200]   To hang and to chat to do things. It's really a community. I love it
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:15.200]   It really turned me on to the the possibilities of discord
[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:19.920]   Really fantastic everything from barbecue to pets
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:23.040]   Don't barbecue your pets though, uh travel
[02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:28.720]   That's there. We don't have a section for that book club of course stacy's book club is a regular on this
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:32.240]   Hands on windows hands on mac and tosh the untetel linux show
[02:40:32.240 --> 02:40:37.920]   Uh scott woken's his home theater geeks some of the shows that we started club twit get launched out into space
[02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:40.160]   Like this week in space
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:45.760]   Now in the public because club members supported the show in the early days when it was too small to get ads
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:50.000]   And so that's kind of the idea behind the club is you give us seven bucks a month
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.560]   We give you a ton of content ad free content
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:57.760]   Uh, and it helps us keep the lights on keep the staff happy and develop new shows
[02:40:57.760 --> 02:41:03.360]   Um, we really appreciate it. Thank you to all our club members and if you're not twit.tv slash
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:09.280]   Club twit for mr. Pruitt's thank you seal of approval now. That's thank you

[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:28.080]   I had to clean up my my office here. It is. She's got a very bright light over there. What is that light? That's so bright
[02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:34.960]   It's my it's my son running from a tiny window. Oh, so you said it looks like sunlight star out there
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:38.560]   So you have a little yeah, it is a star. It's a our nearest star
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:44.320]   Going through stacy's magic box of things. Yeah, I know she opened it up and all of a sudden my god. It's bright
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:50.160]   And this is just a victim puts the graphic up and the she can't find her things
[02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:55.280]   She needs she needs iot to push a button to have it go. Oh, there it is
[02:41:55.280 --> 02:42:00.560]   What is that? Okay? Let me go. Is this a here's what you're working from here. Oh wow. There is
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:07.200]   It's a pile. That's that's the small pile pile. I owe two. Yeah, okay. So this is
[02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:14.000]   A lot. This is I reviewed this actually this week. This is the una bell
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:17.360]   This is an nbiot doorbell in
[02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:23.680]   Um, it's not a doorbell. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have called it that but it looks like a doorbell when you press this
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:30.800]   It sends a little notification. Um, it does short presses long presses and then you can also attach certain sensors to it. I have a
[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:33.760]   temperature probe attached to it
[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:35.520]   um
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:40.800]   And this device is okay. So you press the button and then what happens?
[02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:48.880]   Well, so it sends a message. So this isn't for you or I this is for enterprises or small businesses who want to create
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:51.760]   to basically like so
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:56.880]   You really can do anything that you want like an LTE button to run. So like
[02:42:56.880 --> 02:43:03.360]   Did you find our service helpful was our receptionist nice press the button? Oh leave that there. Oh, yeah
[02:43:03.360 --> 02:43:09.920]   They see I see that all the time in the bathrooms and stuff. They have the happy face. Yeah, wow. Was it happy or not?
[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:14.720]   Yeah, I actually I did a profile in that company there there several years ago. They're very cool
[02:43:14.720 --> 02:43:18.960]   Um, I can tell you a lot about their connectivity options and choices
[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:23.840]   Um, but so you could use it like this
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:26.080]   um
[02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:33.120]   This could be used for cold chain monitoring with an attached temperature sensor. There's also a magnet sensor if you want to attach it
[02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:34.720]   I don't know for magnets
[02:43:34.800 --> 02:43:40.320]   But what so the button turns it on or triggers it or no the buttons triggers a signal
[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:47.040]   And you program what you want that in my case they said it they set it up for me to be a refrigerator monitor
[02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:50.480]   So basically I put this in my fridge and anytime the temperature
[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:53.920]   Exceeds, I think it's like 42 degrees Fahrenheit
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:44:00.000]   Um, it will send me a notification and if I press this button it will send me an email that says remember to get milk
[02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:04.720]   So that's what we programmed it to do for me. I get this so
[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:09.680]   Don't think of the use case the use case in this case is silly
[02:44:09.680 --> 02:44:15.600]   But if you are a business and you want someone to like hey, press this button if the bathroom needs more toilet paper
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:22.080]   Right. Yeah, press this button if there's no inventory and you're the stock boy. You know, if you're in your studio, maybe it's
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:23.920]   Uh
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:27.600]   Press this button if you need to replace the batteries and something. Oh, I don't know
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:33.600]   This is what president trump had on his desk in the white house bring this button for a coke
[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:37.840]   I could do that for a stroop waffle. I need a stroop waffle button
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:41.440]   I press this button and john brings me a stroop waffle
[02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:47.280]   Or I could actually press this button if as long as I was traveling with it anywhere in the world and it was hooked up
[02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:53.280]   At the other end. Yeah, and you can tie this into mqtt. You can tie this into if zappier or zappier zappier, zappier
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:54.480]   however you say it
[02:44:54.480 --> 02:44:57.520]   Um web hooks. Oh, it could be my punch leo button
[02:44:57.600 --> 02:45:02.560]   We did we do you know what this is the dash button in a way, right? This is remember amazon's
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:06.240]   Thought it was gonna bring you a waffle. No, I wish I got all my hopes up
[02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:11.920]   But this is actually so this is our battery case and when you use the last battery you're supposed to press the dash button
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:13.760]   Is that still work john? No
[02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:16.240]   Amazon amazon deprecated these
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:22.400]   Yeah, because I have it's funny. I was in my pantry the other day moving stuff around and I found one that's labeled charman
[02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:32.240]   So I didn't press it, but I mean, you know, that's the idea you could put this in bathrooms and say, you know, they're out of toilet paper
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:33.040]   Yeah
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:36.480]   Or you could use it as like a tracking system for company vehicles
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:40.320]   You stick it in a vehicle and when someone presses it now that you you won't know who it is
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:44.080]   But you know that that particular vehicle is now in operation, you know
[02:45:44.080 --> 02:45:49.200]   It's a little expensive for that single function at 60 bucks. Yeah
[02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:52.000]   Yeah, that's why I mean and you have
[02:45:52.160 --> 02:45:56.480]   Other options in 60 bucks. That's connectivity cost for ltem
[02:45:56.480 --> 02:46:03.360]   Okay, that's huge so that has lt's that has lt built into it and it's on zone
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:08.720]   Anywhere and uh that's your monthly charge for it. No, that's the 60
[02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:15.680]   It's $59 for a year of the button working and access to the cloud software which lets you program your use cases
[02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:17.680]   Can you pay for more after the year?
[02:46:17.680 --> 02:46:19.680]   Yes, okay
[02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:23.120]   Or if you just buy a lot of sharmon so you don't have to have the button. Yeah, right
[02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:26.640]   No, that's cool. Okay. I didn't understand this has lt in it
[02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:29.840]   So it's standalone you could use it out in the field. You could use it anywhere
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:33.600]   Yes, that's what that's what I say my punch leo button could go with me wherever I go
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:36.080]   That's not a good idea
[02:46:36.080 --> 02:46:37.840]   Not a good idea
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:38.800]   Cool
[02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:43.040]   This is unibiz unibiz. It's really not a consumer device
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:46.800]   It is not but you know enough of our audience or people who might be like
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:50.880]   Yeah, no, that's right. If you work in it, this could be in the software
[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:55.840]   I did I reviewed this back-end software and that sort of thing so you could put it in the server room
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:57.600]   I got locked in
[02:46:57.600 --> 02:47:05.200]   Press the button locked in you would now. I've got mindset from battery saving purposes mine only reports back every
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:08.000]   I think it's like five or six minutes
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:15.120]   Um, so if you got locked in like the server closet you would be there for a few minutes before someone got a notification email
[02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:20.800]   Just so you know, right or you'd have to set it so the batteries would go faster. All right
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:28.400]   Thank you. So that's my favorite bathroom stacey on iot.com if you want to read more about

[02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:16.000]   rethought books and he had a whole bunch of really neat projects that he showed off
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.320]   But this one I quite loved
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:23.440]   It's from a student named kelly kuster should I scroll up what they're a top I do

[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:16.480]   This is not a normal box. Okay, go down
[02:49:16.480 --> 02:49:18.800]   and um
[02:49:18.800 --> 02:49:23.760]   So then the student did it so she tracked where the hand would have to go across the case
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:27.920]   That's cool. Do these various so if you're gonna do hello world your hand to go
[02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:30.480]   Do
[02:49:30.480 --> 02:49:37.360]   Right to come back into the into the into the in the that's really interesting. Yeah, so then uh you see
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:43.120]   Why is why is something as short as all is truth because that's the poem. Oh, it's the whole poem

[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:42.480]   um
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:46.320]   There were speed type setting contests
[02:50:46.320 --> 02:50:53.520]   With audiences and cheering crowds. Wow. See how fast before television, right? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:58.560]   Before
[02:50:58.560 --> 02:51:00.800]   entertaining
[02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:06.960]   Oh, yes, it was kind of kind of kind of like this dominoes guy making three pizzas in 39 seconds
[02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:13.440]   It was kind of like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Look at that. Oof man. Yeah, it's good

[02:51:39.600 --> 02:51:47.680]   There you go and that the hourly wage of seven dollars and 50 cents. That's that's a pretty good deal. Give him a tip
[02:51:47.680 --> 02:51:56.480]   Apple store. That's I like that site. You know what? It makes me think though is I'd love to write the code
[02:51:57.200 --> 02:52:03.120]   Maybe you know, I think it's only a matter of time before this makes its way into the advent of code problem, right? The code to draw
[02:52:03.120 --> 02:52:09.680]   These images because what she did. Yeah, it's kind of cool. Yeah. Yeah, because it's instant
[02:52:09.680 --> 02:52:13.360]   You don't have to actually do it. You know, it'll figure that right?
[02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:16.080]   Very neat
[02:52:16.080 --> 02:52:19.360]   Mr. Ann do you have a picker a thing?
[02:52:19.360 --> 02:52:26.480]   Yeah, first I want to say shout out again to mr. Terrell C woods. Thanks for watching and hope you do
[02:52:26.480 --> 02:52:29.840]   Okay, sir. My first pick is
[02:52:29.840 --> 02:52:34.400]   I call it like the black communities version of succession
[02:52:34.400 --> 02:52:40.320]   It's it's called riches on amazon and let me be upfront
[02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:46.720]   I started watching this and kylo's quite excited back there for some reason I started watching this and I was like oh gosh
[02:52:46.720 --> 02:52:52.800]   This is like a soap opera and I got to the second episode and I'm like, okay, this might be all right
[02:52:53.360 --> 02:52:58.160]   And I don't know all of the actors names because they're British. They're British
[02:52:58.160 --> 02:53:04.560]   Right. They're all it's all British and one of the ladies in there is the psychiatrist from Ted lasso
[02:53:04.560 --> 02:53:12.080]   And she's playing a whole different role in this, but it's so damn fascinating. It made me think about succession
[02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:17.200]   Um, just the type of story that's going on in there. There is a great I uh
[02:53:17.200 --> 02:53:21.600]   I will I will match this with another British show called industry
[02:53:22.320 --> 02:53:26.080]   I can't remember the street. Yeah, I think seems like I've seen that on a
[02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:33.040]   Recommended to me. Yeah, it's you know, it's interesting is the lives of black people in Britain are very different, aren't they?
[02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:36.800]   Uh, yes, and oh yeah
[02:53:36.800 --> 02:53:41.200]   All right, the pins. I really they they have accents
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:44.000]   Yeah, I like this show
[02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:47.200]   The star of it is a black woman who is from america
[02:53:47.840 --> 02:53:54.880]   Who kind of fakes her way into high finance in the city of london and yeah, that was that that was like the slug line
[02:53:54.880 --> 02:53:59.920]   Fag it till you make it or something. Yeah, it's quite it's it's really good. I'm gonna watch i'll make it
[02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:05.360]   Give it a watch industry. I'll watch riches. Okay. I'll give that a chance. I've seen that pop up on my screen
[02:54:05.360 --> 02:54:07.440]   It's quite good. I
[02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:11.200]   I wish there were more. I wish there were more episodes. There's only a couple of seasons. I think
[02:54:11.200 --> 02:54:14.160]   uh, we really fell in love with it
[02:54:14.720 --> 02:54:23.280]   Thanks and then lastly, I I just want to give pay homage to the I decided to call him the michael jordan of youtube

[02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:16.080]   Okay, super. I mean when you see the video imagine him him being on a sports team at stevens
[02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:24.640]   Which is a geek school. Yeah. Yeah, but he plays. I think he just played like he plays like big time. He plays in my preplays in my pro. Yeah
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:29.280]   Wow, he's legit. So this is uh an athlete
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:34.080]   As and a youtuber designing uh, sneakers, which is is very cool and they feel
[02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:41.600]   That gumgood. I was quite impressed. I didn't know what to expect but they're nice and like I said hard he had he loves them

[02:56:52.480 --> 02:56:56.800]   Here's the uh, marques brownlee, uh, highlight reel
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:57:00.240]   Playing ultimate, which is kind of like football with a frisbee, right?
[02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:03.760]   I don't know that game
[02:57:03.760 --> 02:57:09.120]   There's marques. Yeah seems like and look at the red bee. Perfect touchdown pass boom
[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:11.840]   Yeah, you need to watch him catch
[02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:16.800]   He's a lot of work. He has a he gets way high up in the L. Let's see if he could does a catch here
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:19.840]   Oh nice block by the brownlee
[02:57:19.840 --> 02:57:26.720]   Look at that. He's good. He's a real athlete. So, uh, you know, are these would you say athletic shoes or dress shoes?
[02:57:27.040 --> 02:57:33.760]   These two fenco no, they're i'm not going to call on athletic shoes. They're definitely like for style and in comfort walking around
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:37.280]   Yeah, um, I don't know if I want to play basketball in them
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:39.920]   But they definitely have support like they could
[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:43.440]   But I'd rather just show him off in one day to day
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:45.920]   And I think he even said that in his video because
