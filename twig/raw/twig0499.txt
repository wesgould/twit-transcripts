[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.220]   Professor of journalism at the City University of New York Blogger at Buzzmachine.com
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.220]   And author of many fine tomes including what would Google do public parts and geek experience. Hello Jeff
[00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.220]   Hello, hello, hello, we are glad Singapore's loss is our game Jeff Stig. I was 18 and a half hour flight. I decided not to take
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.220]   I don't blame you. Wow
[00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.220]   Also with us Stacey Higginbotham back in her home in beautiful Austin, Texas
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.220]   All the geeks have left south by is over
[00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.220]   Oh, south by is still happening. It's just not the now the more drunken geeks. It's the is it music or film?
[00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.220]   It's music and film. Oh
[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.220]   So they used to have separate for interactive music and film now they've combined music and film the one thing
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.220]   Film kind of stretches across most of the way. Okay
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.220]   Okay
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.220]   I
[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.220]   Miss we really wanted to go this year and we couldn't but next year. I think we're at least I said we should really go. That's good
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.820]   I won't be here. I have more of my peeps were there this year than have been in recent years that appeared because generally it's marketers and Germans. Yeah
[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.820]   Of course
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.740]   You're not wrong Jeff. You're not wrong. Right the Germans for some reason the Germans thought they love it cool kids go
[00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.380]   And they love it. They have German houses German parties. You're kidding me. I know goes
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.220]   Really there is actually a really big like I would say European in general
[00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.700]   But the Germans are a big chunk of it, but you I I was just there yesterday and there was you know
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.620]   Two fellas speaking French behind me and then I ran into a friend of mine who lives in Finland. So
[00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.700]   Yeah, you know, it's sunny here. It's cold and wet and miserable up there
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.420]   So I'm gonna put it in the chat now Lufthansa runs a special flight
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.820]   Wow the south by south by a twice the lufthansa flying lab. Oh my god in the chat
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.620]   And they and they program it with with with with speakers and other things while you're flying
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.700]   Oh, that would be kind of fun. I would do this very good idea friend of mine started this
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.100]   He's left a little tons of sense, but but it's really very cool. Yeah, so you get a little conference on the way
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.020]   Yeah
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.020]   Look at the speakers
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.020]   You're in it little round
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.300]   Lars Benedict's Jason Katie cook
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.300]   So what do they do they stand up in the aisle and they talk on the microphone?
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.320]   Yeah, they do and so and so everybody watches through their through their devices through the Wi-Fi
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.740]   Oh, no, I want to see should call
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.180]   Oh, this is really interesting
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.780]   right and and
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.820]   Live performance so don't go on this flight if you want a quiet though
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.060]   Quite all by yourself
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.300]   You get a rap artist from Berlin
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.400]   Wow, and then the German house you weren't kidding. Oh, yeah, there's like French house. There's a Chinese house
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.700]   There's all the houses. There's a
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.500]   Michigan house I
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.580]   Heard a brilliant executive from German media just to launch our new program in news innovation leadership at the Newmark school
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.820]   And she was on Facebook and said all I'm not in south by south west
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.260]   That's because you're a New Yorker now only Germans go you're not a New York German anymore. You're New Yorker
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.660]   actually four square was back after 10 years four square was discovered at south by southwest 10 years ago
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.660]   that was this big breakout moment and
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.980]   Paris Martin I was on the Twitter on Sunday talking about her article
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:20.340]   She got a little peek at what four squares up to these days and it might be just a little bit disquieting
[00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.580]   Turns out four squares not gone
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.340]   Far from it
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.020]   they apparently are one of the big data brokers for location information and
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.540]   They pivot at work. It was a big pivot now
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.340]   The thing is I remember when they launched swarm and they said four squares gonna be the place like a guy
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.020]   But swarms would use a check in and I kept doing it for a while
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.020]   But I stopped turns out you don't need to play four square or check in on swarm for four square to know
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.260]   Exactly where you are they're collecting information from a lot of apps on a lot of phones
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.060]   They have during south by I don't know if you saw this Stacy
[00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.780]   They released a demo of this called hyper trending that that had bubbles where the most people were I
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.420]   Think this is really interesting and all like
[00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:19.980]   The the writer of the piece is right. This is both creepy for many people and cool for other people actually it was Dennis Crowley
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.460]   Who said we're not sure we said we're not sure if it's creepy or cool
[00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.380]   like that they threw it out yes at a tech event I
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:38.300]   And I actually would draw the parallel with this and the NBC story that you have on scraping people's photos for facial recognition
[00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.900]   Oh, yeah, it's very clear parallel here about
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.820]   people this actually makes clear what
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.220]   Data is being collected in a way that is pretty visceral for people and it
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.820]   Does it in a way that still respects their anonymity which I think is
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.620]   the best possible way to do something like this but
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:08.340]   It misstates it because you are not in fact anonymous in the actual data that four square cells people
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:14.500]   You are identified by a unique advertising ID, which I think wouldn't be too hard to de-anonymize you
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:20.740]   So yeah, and Crowley who's the founder of four square said we want to we're not sure if it's a responsible thing
[00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.620]   Or not to have a view like this in the phone yet
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.340]   I don't know how people will react to seeing a heat map in real time over all the phones are I can imagine some people would say
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.820]   Oh, that's the coolest thing and some people would be like that's the creepiest thing
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.820]   Well, they want to put out there
[00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.420]   But I think they don't what they're doing is misrepresenting it a little bit because yeah
[00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.420]   These are just anonymous blobs these show numbers
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.580]   But in fact the data that they're selling is much more specific
[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:52.900]   It shows also well in the not this version but in the game they were talking about also showing
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:59.300]   Replacing that unique ID with an avatar and a fake photo and then showing the demographic data
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.460]   I think so I get what you're saying
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.020]   this sort of
[00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:09.740]   Tracking is happening and people kind of assume it's happening, but they don't know what that really means
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:16.500]   I think this gives them a nice window to start understanding what that means and I think anyone who freaks out about this
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.220]   That that's totally fine
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.980]   Then they're gonna say wait
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:27.820]   How does four square know this and then they're gonna suddenly realize when they look into it that four square has co I mean
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.820]   companies like uber and I don't know if Google does
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:39.340]   uber Twitter they're all using four squares code to get your geolocation information and then and to feed more information back in I
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.180]   presume
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:46.940]   Yeah, and then they'll actually be like wait a second can I get out of this and I think that'll start a really important conversation
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:53.580]   Also like so we're gonna switch over. I wish it would but I don't think that this hyper trending thing does that because it's it's
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:59.860]   It's miss it's understating what they're actually doing in 2014 for square launch pilgrim
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:06.780]   Which you cannot see a piece of code that passively tracks where your phone goes using Bluetooth Wi-Fi GPS
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:15.140]   M and identifies this shop or the coffee the park or the restaurant you're visiting feeds data to its partner apps of
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:21.460]   Which there are more than a thousand and that's you know location apps like Twitter and uber?
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:30.740]   Pilgrim and the company's places API are integral part of tens of thousands of apps sites and interfaces as famous four squares website
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.580]   Says if it tells you where it's probably built on four square, but what Paris points out is yeah
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.380]   it's anonymized sort of there is a unique ID and
[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.140]   There would be all sorts of nefarious ways to use this
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.140]   She says you know
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:50.100]   what if you notice the same guy in a few different locations and you had this data it wouldn't be hard at all to put a
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.540]   face with a
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.740]   Number and say now I know where he is and as long as I can get this data
[00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:59.940]   I can see where he is at all times the consumers don't have that data and
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.860]   and
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:07.940]   They're clustering people in this particular app, but that's the point this app doesn't show what they're actually doing
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:13.780]   This is a bowdlerized app to this is this is they took the good stuff out the stuff that yes
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:20.460]   You and I don't have access to but plenty of other companies do they have an API that is much more granular than this I
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.260]   Still think it's a good point in a good place to start the conversation
[00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.020]   They did this much, but they need to do a lot more. So here's my also good
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:32.940]   They showed Paris Mart know what they're really doing because that's much more dramatic
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.020]   They know they have an ID for you Stacy. I
[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:42.900]   Know they have an idea. I mean everybody has an ID for Verizon got a lot of trouble for having an ID for its users
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.900]   They got oh the cookies the super cookies
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:51.620]   Now, I'm sure it's not just for square Google's got to be doing this apples probably doing other companies are doing it as well
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.300]   Oh, you know, either you familiar with you good
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.700]   What's Euclid?
[00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:04.380]   It's a company that tracks Wi-Fi you're like they keep a unique ID for everybody's handset based on their Wi-Fi
[00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:07.740]   There you go. I'm trying to join Wi-Fi networks. So yes, but
[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:17.060]   This is this is happening everywhere. It's not just for square. It's not just like four squares doing location
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:22.060]   You are I would also say I don't know if you're getting a super valuable service
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.940]   Like I don't care that Twitter knows my location, but that uber knows my location is really important to me. It's the
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:34.620]   Bedrock of the so I could point out that uber could get your location by asking your phone in the uber app where you are
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:40.300]   Goober knows where you are, but apparently is collecting more information than you're volunteering
[00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.060]   Well, that is that could be true
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.420]   I don't know the terms that four squared has with uber
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.740]   But one of the challenges with GPS in certain areas is that it doesn't work well
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.420]   So having an overlay like four square is probably helpful
[00:11:54.420 --> 00:12:01.460]   Maybe that's all there is for you. Okay question. I don't know so we'll switch roles here Stacey is all in favor
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.800]   I'm worried about Iran and
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:10.220]   Turkey yeah, and oh Russia. No my point. That's my point precisely a
[00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:15.540]   malicious actor let's say Putin says, you know, we got to take Stacey Higaboth about she's really
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:21.500]   Forget the individual forget the individual. I could be in a cluster of demonstrators. Oh, they're into a place
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:27.100]   There you go. There's there's starting to mount up until you're saying they have cameras though
[00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.820]   Look to track those people already
[00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:37.140]   So yeah, but you could see you could see groups starting to coalesce you could see other things
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.660]   Yeah, you're right with this data you can you could see people's phones now
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:47.300]   That's why a lot of demonstrators try to hop off networks and use like peer-to-peer networks. I mean
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.700]   That's right. I think there's probably going to be if there isn't already
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:58.480]   We're gonna continuously see a development of protocols for people who are protesting and I think it's good
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.900]   And I think some of the things are hey
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:06.780]   How do you use a decentralized peer-to-peer app on your phone to talk to people how like at home?
[00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:11.060]   You're gonna regularly go through tour. I think we're also gonna see things like people
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:18.420]   tweaking their makeup and their hats and everything else to avoid facial recognition and I
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:25.460]   Think those are actually some of the more interesting things to watch because it helps us
[00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.140]   They it's the other side that most people don't see that they bear the
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:35.660]   Surveillance kind of state and surveillance capitalism that we have so I
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:39.380]   Don't know. I don't think this is like the worst thing
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:44.940]   I think it's actually a decent conversation starter and I like the fact that it self-destructs after two weeks
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.260]   And oh, yes
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.900]   Wait, hold on. No, well, what if they delete well, they're not gonna delete all that data
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.980]   Four Square has the same sort of subpoena things that Google and Facebook have they fight that
[00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:03.740]   So I mean you can't argue against this if you're gonna be like, yeah
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.980]   I love Facebook and all that it's done or I'm okay with Google having access to all of this data
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:15.500]   Which they do and more and they also have unique advertisement like yeah, my concerns about the individual levels your phone company knows it already
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.340]   right
[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:23.580]   apps know it already this is not new in that sense the question is that that notion of another view of
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:30.700]   Colossing in using our freedom of assembly so it's the aggregate that it bothers me more than the individual I
[00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:37.900]   Would flip it on it said and I would say how cool would it be to use something like this and check out?
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.340]   How many people are at the DMV when you want to go? Yeah?
[00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:45.860]   Google Maps does that already it'll show you when you want to go somewhere where the busy times are
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.980]   valuable to stores
[00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:57.340]   And it's it's valuable for people counting or understanding, you know, I think people counting is actually a really under
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:03.060]   discussed and under thought about way that we could actually use phones to help people
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.940]   like just
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:10.380]   Make their day better and I'm thinking of things like hey if I have to go to the ER
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:14.700]   Can I see which ERs have the most people could we build a service based on something like this?
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:22.060]   We're not now because there's no profit in it, but those kind of services are highly valuable and you could do that with this I
[00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.140]   Don't know
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.380]   We are all carrying tracking devices and I agree with you
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:36.820]   It's a good idea for four square and others to start the conversation so that we understand we're not taking off guard by this I
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:42.620]   Think part of the problem is it's hard for humans to put two and two together
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.900]   Sometimes and while we are all kind of aware of the fact that our phone knows where we are and our apps know where we are
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.820]   We don't think about other
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.340]   Consequences of it you said face recognition this actually doesn't use face recognition
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.660]   This is oh no the parallel is to the NBC story on people will get to them
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:06.860]   But I'm just want to say that the point is if you combine this with face recognition, you're suddenly de-anonymized. Oh, yeah
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.900]   I'm like, how do your de-anonymized anyway?
[00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.620]   Everybody knows Leo
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.500]   Everybody knows anybody they want to know and if you combine all this data
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:24.700]   I mean, I think you know yes when I think about the born movies right and and you watch them track
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.380]   Jason born all over the place with at what it seemed at the time very
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:33.260]   Advanced stuff like cameras everywhere and stuff. That's now
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:38.380]   Chicken feed compared to the kind they wouldn't have any trouble following Jason born at all
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.340]   nowadays
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:46.660]   So you would have to 3d print your own like new face mask you would have to I'm not kidding
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.580]   You would have to do something crazy like that. You wouldn't have to you'd have to not have a phone
[00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:55.820]   I think it's funny that you're arguing in its favor and Jeff's arguing against it
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.500]   It's just completely blowing my mind. We just conspired before the show
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:08.300]   Let's talk about this Netflix and Netflix flicker thing so yahoo way back when I remember when they did this
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.620]   Made a research database
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.700]   available
[00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:17.340]   Which had a lot of information and information that was quickly de-anonymized by people
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:25.020]   In a variety of ways what I didn't know is that among other things in this database. They put flicker pictures and
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:33.540]   Now it's coming out that the and this is an NBC news story again good good on them for this scope
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.460]   That those flicker pictures are being used by IBM
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.300]   to trade train face recognition in fact
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:49.580]   We could even say IBM is on the side of the angels here because one of the things they're doing is trying to make face recognition
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.380]   more
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.340]   racially fair less racist less racist
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.420]   But I think the problem is that
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:06.620]   A lot of people didn't know that this was going on and the story is that IBM did not inform people when it used their photos for face recognition
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.460]   training now the good news is NBC
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.660]   even though
[00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.820]   IBM would not give them the data set
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.340]   NBC was able to get it in other ways and
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.020]   There is a tool on the NBC site did IBM
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:28.620]   Use your photos and you can enter in and I haven't done this yet your flicker handle and just to see if your photos
[00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:37.220]   The photos I think were always a creative commons, right? So they weren't licensed photos and they were de-anonymized
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.540]   I don't know if they were de-anonymized
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:49.180]   Or were they they were annotated with features, but so that's different than being like they might have had race racial
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:54.260]   Your dog was scared you
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:19:00.540]   That's a good question. I know that the main Yahoo database was and they made a big point about this completely de-anonymized
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.740]   No, none of my photos are in the IBM data set
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:10.620]   What's your flicker handle anybody want to volunteer? Oh, I can't because it was that for cocked a Yahoo thing
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:16.020]   Yeah, cuz I had usually a lot of account tonight. No, it's don't it was the same as a yahoo
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:20.620]   Wasn't okay. Well, I see a little ports in there because I was
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:27.820]   Who ruined everything touched let me see if Chris Markward? I know his flicker handle and see if his oh, yeah
[00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:31.540]   Chris Markwartz photos are in there. Here is one of them
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:38.940]   So here's the most important point I was able to find it because Chris Markwartz submitted these photos to flicker
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:39.940]   but
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:47.060]   Whoever this guy is this friend of Chris's is the face not Chris's but the friend. It's a picture by Chris
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.660]   and
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:54.020]   This guy definitely didn't know that when Chris took his picture it was gonna be included in an IBM
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:20:01.020]   Training set so here's the thing and now on the trick podcast. I might add and I apologize for
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:03.220]   D
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:08.060]   Haven't you haven't you haven't de-anonymized him you've shown a random face on the internet
[00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:13.540]   We don't know who that is yet. Could we find out more easily now that we've seen it? Yes, but but
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.140]   one
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:22.500]   When you when you scrape faces for facial recognition purposes what you're pulling is you're pulling that image
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:27.700]   You're gonna annotate it. So basically that means you're gonna say this is a man. This is a bald man
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.500]   This is a bald white man with a camera
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:37.580]   You're gonna put all of that in there and then you send that to the computer and the computer like looks at it and categorizes it
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:43.980]   Does it stuff and then you get you that picture doesn't ever come up again?
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.460]   so
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.380]   again
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.780]   annotating and
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:55.180]   Anonymizing and de-anonymizing very different and I would say that when you sent your pictures and under creative commons
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:00.300]   If you chose that licensing scheme you did it knowing that your photo could end up on Wikipedia
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.700]   It's not but that's the point is that Chris Markwart did it and made it create comments
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:14.700]   Guy whose pictured is had no consent in it and may not even know
[00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.820]   however, I don't have any problem with it. I want to point out because
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.660]   But it's interesting, isn't it?
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.660]   I don't I mean I for all I know
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:32.500]   I might be one of those pictures - no one else is gonna so the researchers who are annotating it see those pictures
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:37.300]   That's all right, but that's it those aren't we need data for research
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:44.300]   We need it and they want you need knowledge we want to especially to make sure our algorithms are not sexist and racist
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:52.460]   Yep, so what happens with these IBM took a collection of a hundred million images all creative commons licensed
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.540]   Yahoo had released as a batch for researchers in 2014
[00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:04.940]   They narrowed it down to a million faces each annotated with almost 200 values things like oh and some of it was automated not even human
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:11.500]   Right measuring the inter pupillary distance the the the pose the skin tone estimated age and gender
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.900]   And then used to train the data set I think in fact, this is a good thing
[00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:23.340]   Everybody you could I'm sure everybody knows when you allow Google to upload all your photos to Google photos that they are using that
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.700]   For training otherwise that search wouldn't work
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:31.380]   Exactly I would say so here's a thing to think about a
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:39.240]   Picture that is taken in what is clearly a public area might be different than like those naked selfies that you took or
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:44.100]   Pictures of your lover in the bedroom. I don't know if those are filtered out Stacy
[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.780]   What but even then
[00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.260]   Nobody knows no one sees them well
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:53.380]   No, the human researcher some researcher might see and I bet he's saving the good stuff
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.980]   well, that's so
[00:22:55.980 --> 00:23:01.100]   And I mean no, but you put it on flicker for crying out loud in public
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:07.620]   This is why this is why I don't and every time I have to sign a waiver for like my daughter school that she could be photographed and things
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:12.700]   I I say no. Yeah, and that's the thing to keep in mind is that
[00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.180]   In cases like this the subject of the photograph
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:21.540]   Is not really in any way involved. So if you're letting people take your picture
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:26.660]   You should consider might might end up happening and I do I tell like when people take my picture
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:32.020]   I asked them not to tag me if people take a picture and my daughter's in it. I make sure they don't tag her
[00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:38.020]   So and you'll never catch me posting pictures of my daughter right on anything
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.100]   Yeah, so that's really I think now this explains why this is a good idea
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:49.780]   On the other hand, it's also a good idea to give as broad a data set as possible to these face recognition programs because
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:55.780]   If you if they only get white men, they think I'll be very good and what that means potentially is a police
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:24:00.020]   Department that uses these for
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.500]   Finding criminals is gonna be
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:07.000]   Much more likely to have false positives with let's say women and people of dark skin
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.460]   Yeah
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.980]   That's a bad outcome
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.620]   So this is to this is to reverse that I
[00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:20.900]   I'm for it. I'm gonna give him a pass pass
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:25.220]   Okay, Leo gives it a pass. I don't give four square a pass, but I give this one a pass
[00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:31.620]   How about Mark Zuckerberg a week later that came out that took me by surprise during the show last week
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:37.380]   I hadn't read it. I thought we had a great conversation about it was a really interesting conversation. Yeah, um
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:43.780]   And at the time I reactivated my Facebook account my messenger account because I believed he was sincere
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.900]   And I have been since talked out of that and have deleted it again
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:59.620]   Well, I mean i'm willing to give him the benefit of that maybe he'll change things, but after reading uh,
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:04.900]   Francis ben tomsen's excellent commentary mike massed a tech dirt ben tomsen's trajectory
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.660]   um
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:12.740]   Walt mossberg says he's skeptical casey newton says this is huge pivot
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.900]   uh, we were kind of
[00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.500]   ourselves like
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:20.500]   Wow, this is amazing if he does it no no no I was I was skeptical
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.380]   I want you to know well and we and there's no reason to know yet
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.220]   But I think i've been convinced by everybody that what mark said
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:35.300]   I misinterpreted he's not going to change facebook. He's going to add a privacy specific messaging
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.500]   Yes, but he also says he's changing
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.980]   He spoke in those other services right
[00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:44.580]   Well, he also says that he's changing the focus of the company
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.140]   Is he going to kill facebook tomorrow course though?
[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:51.780]   Yeah, or ever say that or ever but but he's but he's basically
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:57.300]   Saying that the focus of the company shifts to encrypted encryption and messaging
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:02.180]   I think what and ben tomsen said is he's having his privacy cake and eating it too
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:06.420]   And his I is but ben says and I think this is actually accurate
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:11.700]   Is it mark saw a real opportunity as we pointed out last week on we chat line
[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.340]   to be the we chat of
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:16.180]   the west
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:20.900]   And that's really what he's saying is I have a brand new business opportunity and we're going to go after it
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.420]   Full throttle and and ben says at the end of the thing
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:31.060]   It is not incompatible a company's own desires is not necessarily incompatible with users interests
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:36.820]   That's right. Resume that is gets us in trouble. So it could be that this is a what we call it that a win win
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:42.180]   Mmm same things like that. I don't say things like that. He I think you
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:48.260]   He actually says he actually says here's the three broad takeaways
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:54.260]   Stop expecting companies to act against their interests facebook is not killing their core business anymore than apple
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:59.540]   Is willing to go to the mat to protect user data in china facebook is doing something that benefits itself
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:05.140]   Facebook doing something that benefits itself is not inherently bad for end users when I was making yes
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:12.820]   It's perfectly reasonable the company can be instituting genuinely user-friendly changes like end-to-end encryption even as it furthers its own self interests
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:18.420]   Relatively and most importantly there needs to be much more appreciation for the anti competitive trade-offs
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.660]   Inherent in an absoluteest approach to privacy
[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:26.420]   Facebook is doing what its fiercest critics supposedly want
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:33.540]   But it's also enhancing its competitive position as a result of unintended consequences folks be careful what you wish for
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:38.500]   I'll tell you what I will use that completely private end-to-end facebook
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:44.820]   But I'm gonna wait until that comes out before I reinstitute my facebook account because it's not that way now
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:52.900]   And I would wait and I would do this because am I a mute? Nope. No. Oh, okay. I was like, what's happening. We just ignoring that's all
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:28:00.420]   Uh, I would wait and this is because he talked about lowering interoperability between services
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.740]   Which he currently says is
[00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.820]   an important
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:10.900]   An important aspect is that users will be built be able to opt in to sharing their we chat with their facebook whatever
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:18.580]   I think given facebook's history he'll say that today and then in a year or so we will suddenly find all of that
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:26.660]   Glom together which to use my example. I do have pictures of my daughter on we chat and I would be really bummed out of that
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:32.260]   We chat. Why are they on we chat not we chat. I'm sorry. What's up? What's my friends in China?
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:39.940]   I do actually have friends in China, but then you I put them on a we chat we chat is totally dominant in China
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:46.180]   Uh as we play it. We chat with what's that? Yeah, what's happened? I get the we chat all the time
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.660]   That could be the we chat of the west it could be this a big opportunity
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:29:00.900]   Um, it's already dominant in a lot of not in the us but in brazil and a lot of countries we what's happened in the is how people communicate and in fact
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.900]   We should point out what's app has had some of the same problems facebook's having
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:11.540]   Uh, it's being accused in india of creating mass violence being used to incite violence fake distribute fake news
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:14.580]   Um, you know, it's still has some of the same problems
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.820]   Yeah, and go. Yeah, so going to a fully encrypted world if you're trying to
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:24.740]   Enforce the law or or deal with this information is not necessarily a good thing
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:29.860]   Yeah, right mark actually said in his wired interview quote the work there. Sorry
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.380]   Um in terms of safety security and safety and spam
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:41.700]   The work there will be harder if we only rely on detecting patterns of activity rather than being able to have the security system see the context
[00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:46.980]   Content of the messages themselves. Of course. I would argue that's true
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.540]   But as a parent for example
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:55.620]   Yeah, my life would be super easy if I kept a surveillance camera on my daughter at all times, but that's not going to help her
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.620]   Develop and allow her to become her own person. So
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:08.500]   So in effect it was the wired interview and kudos to nicholas tomsen a wired who got very quickly got a interview with mark
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:14.500]   Uh, it was this interview that actually convinced me that I misunderstood marks manifesto
[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:21.220]   And it was this paragraph the thinking is there need to be two types of platforms in the world one is a more public platform
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:25.780]   Like the digital equivalent of a town square where you interact with a lot of people at once
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:31.780]   That's largely with facebook and instagram r the other platform is the private space the digital equivalent to the living room
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.420]   And the foundation that we have what's happened
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.380]   to go away
[00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:42.420]   It let let them both exist and those who wish to be public right like me and like you used to
[00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:46.580]   Um can have that and can and can gather and can do things and that's fun
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:50.900]   You know, I don't mind everything otherwise the world turns into a turtle shell in all honesty
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:54.500]   It's not me mining being public. It's mine. Yeah, I mind the public talking back
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:31:02.980]   I don't okay. I don't want to hear from them. So it's uh, you know what i'm saying. I don't mind
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:11.140]   Them knowing everything about me. I just don't want to hear their thoughts about it first time caller. Hello. Hello. Hello. Is everybody listening? Hello
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:19.540]   No, I have to be public. That's my job. But uh, it seems like everybody has a thought about that kind of wears you down after a while
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.060]   That's an entirely different thing. We are another problem
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.780]   Like uh, I'm gonna go there. Please
[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:30.580]   Okay, so i'm a flawed human. What can I say?
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.980]   Uh, but you know, and I'd be very interested if he does take what's app
[00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:41.220]   And or messenger and make it fully private. But when he when he does that's when i'll sign up not not until then how about that?
[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:47.860]   Um, let's take a break because I want to now get to Elizabeth Warren
[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:58.500]   Well, we know actually that was the whole segment right there which um we can stop now and then move on
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.260]   Stacy goes, uh
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.260]   Jeff goes, uh
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:08.500]   But you know what she's probably already I bet you there's some interest in other
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.700]   quarters of the other democratic candidates
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:18.340]   On what she says and how they can slice that they're watching aren't they they're watching did that work
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:22.660]   Kudos to Warren for for being the first to say it
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.460]   But what's the political political?
[00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:32.180]   You think it was cynical. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh good. Let's we're gonna have a nice conversation coming up
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:34.820]   first. I want to show you this
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.060]   I know you think it's an iPad
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.420]   And it is actually it isn't like that but it but it's more than that
[00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:45.460]   This is what you will see the first thing you'll see when you come to twit and a lot of businesses in the world
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.860]   This is our envoy
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:54.420]   Uh, it's time to welcome your guests to the modern lobby and be ready for everything that comes in your front door envoy visitors
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:33:00.340]   And i'll launch it right now is an iPad kiosk that makes workplaces more efficient
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:04.420]   We've always when we've had people come to watch our shows we've always had them
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:10.900]   um sign a waiver and give them an informational thing and all that now we can do it on we do it on the envoy
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:18.420]   Through this really great interface on an iPad when visitors arrived they sign in on the ipad kiosk
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:23.220]   They enter their details if you know, we just need their name sign any legal documents in our case
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:29.380]   Uh, nda not an nda, but a uh, a waiver so that they won't sue us for tripping over wires and stuff
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:33.700]   And they do that right on the ipad the envoy then notifies us
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:38.900]   It automatically if if in an enterprise where you've got people visiting employees
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:43.620]   It'll automatically notify the employee their guest is here. So you don't the front desk is
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.180]   Moses loves this is so much easier for him
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:49.540]   So, you know their employee knows when who's coming and
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.660]   Uh, you don't get surprised by somebody
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:55.780]   I don't know him. What is he doing here? What is he selling me?
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:01.060]   Uh, this is just awesome. I just love it. It is it is it is really streamlined
[00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:04.500]   Our process and the thing is our visitors love it too
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:06.900]   It's a much easier way
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:10.260]   Of doing the things we need before somebody comes into our studios
[00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:14.020]   You'll boost your office efficiency with smart security that doesn't intimidate
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.180]   It's very friendly
[00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:19.380]   Uh, there's no more paper logbook and really what good is that?
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.940]   You know, I'd like to go through your logbook from last year
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.300]   You know, it's all on a database. You can sign in unlimited visitors
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:31.700]   Even print customized badges. We don't do that, but you could do hook up the printer and have it print the badges send alerts when
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:35.620]   VIPs arrive somebody really important comes out though, you know, baby
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:43.460]   It even notifies administrators about unattended guests and all this is exactly how you want to handle a front desk
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:49.860]   You can integrate any existing security systems like Wi-Fi access id checks and murder emergency notifications
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.180]   So you get better security
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:54.820]   And of course you'll have data on the visitors in your office
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:59.140]   So, you know who's coming what when they're on site where they're going who they're meeting and why?
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:06.020]   Uh, octa, which is a great example. This is a security company. They use it. They say it's so good. It actually makes me excited to sign in
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.260]   I love that
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.260]   Uh, they have it at box. Here's Volvo
[00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:14.660]   Envoy gives our guests the right brand impression. Yeah, our logo is right on there
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.660]   It works with everything you already use it works with slack. That's what we use G suite
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.900]   We use that to box salesforce chatter
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.060]   it's designed to help companies of all sizes and all types even those in
[00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.940]   Industries that are highly regulated
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.420]   meet security and compliance
[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.500]   requirements
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:36.100]   It's the biggest companies in the world Nike spotify Pinterest all work with envoy
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:41.220]   30 million visitors. We haven't really added to that number significantly, but we use it to
[00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:48.580]   Protect your people your property and the idea is the welcoming way with envoy 10,000 workplaces worldwide choose envoy to make a

[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.460]   twit
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.980]   Uh, you've probably used it and when you go to some of the big tech companies they all use on
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.700]   It's really awesome
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.180]   So uh, Elizabeth Warren medium post
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.940]   Says we should break up facebook google
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:47.140]   And amazon
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:50.180]   Yeah, well next day
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.580]   It was funny because I think I don't know I have to look at the video
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:56.340]   I haven't seen the video but if when I was reading in the verge neelite patel
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.340]   Uh with the follow up it looked like he jumped her because
[00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:06.980]   Initially her answers are one word. Yes. No, but right away. He says you mean apple too. And she says yes
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:13.700]   Uh, and that's the headline either they run the platform or they play in the store
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.100]   I have to say
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:21.380]   In her defense. I do feel like this was something she hadn't really thought out and then you're like god
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.660]   That's a defense
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:27.700]   That's a defense. She didn't take it out the apple one is less thought out because because basically she said well
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.500]   apple shouldn't be allowed to run the store and sell their apps in the store
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.980]   and honestly
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:36.980]   If that's the problem, that's that's not it. There's a big problem spotify in fact
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:43.540]   Is very upset with apple and it has just started a website and a campaign. I think they might be
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:50.660]   I think they might be planning to sue apple as well. The website is time to play fair.com
[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:55.380]   They have sued them in the EU. They've sued them in the EU, which is the best place to sue them
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.260]   Uh and their complaint is
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:06.580]   Yeah apple, you know has this store, but the real problem is apple requires us to sell subscriptions through the store and they get 30
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:07.700]   percent
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:14.180]   Complete rent taking at the same time apple prohibits us from showing customers how to upgrade any other way
[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:24.420]   And so what did spotify do well? They had to raise the cost of a subscription 30 percent on iphone and then apple comes back starts its own music service
[00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:27.300]   30 less
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:33.220]   and in fact to do to this day you can still not ask a series to launch spotify on the iphone
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.220]   uh
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.220]   so
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:42.740]   Amazon movies or amazon video service also has this complaint
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:48.180]   This is pretty anti-competitive. In fact apple won't work with them on a watch app because apple has a competing product
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.300]   if if Elizabeth Warren had said this
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.300]   I'd say right on I think you're absolutely right. This is
[00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.580]   Absolutely anti-competitive behavior
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.260]   from
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:04.660]   A monopsony not a monopoly, but the uh, I think it's a monopsony, right?
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:09.780]   You get it's the only place you can get apps for iOS devices is apples own store
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.660]   so
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.860]   There are there are some merit to what she's asking for
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:20.340]   Who should we start with? Stacy will start with you
[00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:24.580]   Oh, no, don't start with me. Okay. This whole thing. Please
[00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:30.180]   Let's let's start with jeff would you elaborate? Yeah
[00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.860]   I think it was a cynical move
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:36.340]   to
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:42.420]   Currie favor right now and not thought through you know, for example of forbidding
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:44.660]   House brands
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:48.740]   Will tell that to seers robo and crassman tell that to wall martin
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:53.060]   Any grocery store in america. Yeah, and then it saves consumers money
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:56.420]   And and she might as well move to europe
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.260]   Because the the view of antitrust there is different. There's no
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.500]   And Ben
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.980]   Instratituary did a good Ben Thompson did a good job of this
[00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:09.060]   Saying that I once said the law of aggregation that he calls it
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:14.900]   Yeah, that's the point of these things. Yeah, right. Right. These things are happening because
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.940]   They have consumer benefit because they give us cheaper prices
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.460]   uh
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:23.860]   And um, it's it's an effort to say oh big tech is evil
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:29.460]   What i'm going to be interested in is what a Kamala Harris does in return and I had my Kamala I had outside
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:32.340]   Uh because she is represents california
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.700]   So she's going to have to find a more nuanced view of this to say well
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:40.660]   Here's where the tech companies are crossing problems and here's where they're not and here's what we got to talk about with regulation
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:42.500]   I was in
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.740]   ditch lab near oxford
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.900]   two weeks ago
[00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:51.220]   and I I was dreading it because it was a discussion of content moderation and
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:52.820]   um
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:56.180]   Freedom of expression read regulation and I thought it was going to be
[00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.940]   Uh
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:03.380]   I was gonna be me screaming just like on this show defending the internet and it turned into a very nuanced very intelligent
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:08.740]   Discussion and where a lot of the room came into agreement was a
[00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.020]   um
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:15.940]   an ftc federal trade commission like regime where companies are expected to make warranties
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:19.700]   To their customers and if they fail at what that warranty is
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:24.980]   Then uh, there's a enforcement mechanism against them for basically consumer fraud
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.780]   So I i'm not against regulation
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:31.780]   I think that there are mechanisms and regimes of regulation that can work
[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:36.660]   But to jump all past that and just say they're bad because they're big and we're going to break them up
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:44.340]   Is a is a cynical political move that hurts this country. It hurts technology. It hurts the friggin future
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:46.900]   And she's desperate
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:55.540]   That's what I say. Wow. I don't know if she's desperate. I do think it's opportunistic. I do think it is easy to
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:59.300]   Joust at the tech companies
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.860]   I do think that there are issues
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:06.660]   The issue in the tech world is not that these are too big. It's that
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:13.700]   They do have anti competitive practices. I also think that there is value and understanding
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:20.260]   how they many of these companies have created machines that are these virtuous cycles that
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:23.140]   Pull in more data, which gives them
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:30.180]   Creates a higher barrier to entry for people. That's kind of a more european view on it
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.620]   I would say in the us we asked does that hurt consumers?
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.140]   And
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:39.380]   I would argue that it does because consumers have very little choice that doesn't
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:45.380]   You know grab their data if they're they care about privacy, but we tend to look more at costs
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:48.180]   And there we don't have a case. So
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:51.060]   If
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:55.780]   Elizabeth Warren and the democratic party want to change the way we look at
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:57.940]   antitrust
[00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.540]   This could be a good talking point if it was a little bit more coherent
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.460]   um
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.980]   But as it stands now under our current regime on the little skeptical
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:12.900]   For the conversation about changing our anti-trust green so much today Stacy
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.540]   This is gonna drive the oh
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.780]   So so yeah
[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:21.300]   We are and I would say if it changes like I would
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.740]   Differ a little bit with you jeff in the sense that i'm okay with
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:28.660]   Thinking about changing our antitrust regimes and how we
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:31.380]   Talk about that how we evaluate?
[00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:33.780]   Monopolies or I can never say the word
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.340]   but monopsies
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.260]   but
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:44.020]   You know, I only know the word because Amy Klobuchar keeps bringing it up. So I'm worried about monopolies. I'm worried about monopsies
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:47.860]   Yeah, I I can't make those words show offy
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:52.660]   But I I do think there is a real question about
[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:54.740]   the
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:44:00.900]   The aggregation of data in the cycle that it creates for these companies to get bigger and better and how much of a competitive barrier
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.340]   It point it pulls up. I would also say
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.100]   that
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:15.140]   The cool thing about technology is a totally different startup could actually come in find some random data point or random device that people freaking love
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.980]   in
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:21.620]   Throw all that down. So that's the question. Can you become a spotify today?
[00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:26.980]   Can you if you're not amazon or google build an echo like device? I
[00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:32.260]   I don't know if that's possible Stacy from the thing that I went to in the UK
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:35.860]   What came out again and again and again there was a guy from a
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.580]   Eastern European online service
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:43.940]   And he kept on saying you guys are trying to set this regulation and I understand why and that's fine
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:49.780]   You know what the only people who can afford to do it are google and facebook and amazon and and apple
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:53.380]   And you're killing me. You're absolutely killing me
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:56.100]   articles 11 and 13
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:00.980]   GDPR a lot of these things they just can't afford to do it
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:03.380]   And so the irony here
[00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:10.020]   Is that in the effort to reduce the power of the big platforms again and again and again this regulation gives them more power
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:16.340]   And a competitive advantage over in a higher bar barrier to entry over those new upstarts
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:21.220]   Um
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:25.860]   I would respond to conversation stoppers my my my largest issue with this
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:31.060]   Uh, you know, I understand the outrage people have over these big companies
[00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:33.780]   Um, she seems to be focusing on size in fact
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.380]   I think at one point she even said if they get to a certain point that she would be broken up in size
[00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:39.620]   Which has nothing to do with any trust law or anything else
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:44.580]   Um, a companies in the united states should be allowed to be successful as successful as they want to be
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.220]   as long as they don't
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:53.380]   You know create any competitive environments as long as as long as there's competition as long as there's challengers
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:58.100]   Um, and right so you've got to go with a specific axe and the specific harm. Yeah, and that's my
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:03.540]   Say oh they're too big something like this is like the the pitchforks and the torches
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.620]   Well, we just got to destroy these guys
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:10.660]   That of course is not what anybody wants it would be a horrible detriment to our society
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:13.300]   And i'm afraid this kind of conversation
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:18.580]   D rails a very important conversation one that's been ongoing here for the last few years
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.340]   About well, what should we get the well? How should we regulate these companies?
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:25.060]   I don't think anybody disagrees these companies need to be
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:31.620]   Rained in and especially in privacy practices and i'd really prefer to hear from morn and all the other candidates
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:36.900]   Specific plans in that regard. What are you going to do about our data? What are you going to do to protect our privacy?
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:42.100]   So there is a um fascinating experiment going on. I don't think it's widely known in france
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:45.780]   where they're basically doing um a um
[00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:47.940]   role playing
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.900]   government and and facebook of regulation
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.780]   To understand the dynamics and so they're they don't have any regulation to regulate against
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:47:01.060]   But they're trying to understand what that works and it was that discussion that led the group to a larger view
[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:04.900]   Of this ftc view. I said at one point
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.660]   um
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:08.660]   We have to talk about the terms of service
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.660]   and and
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.780]   It's a mr. Chatham house rule so i'd be careful here, but but a a
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:18.740]   Um a lawyer from a technology world
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:22.660]   Said well, we don't write terms of service against us. We write them against the users
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:30.340]   And I said right but now you're going to be expected to write terms of service that give the users some warranty of what you're promising to do
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:36.740]   That's the level of discussion. I want to see is okay. Talk about your responsibility. Talk about what you guarantee
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:42.820]   Uh say what you don't guarantee let us argue about that make that public and then we're going to hold your feet to the fire for that
[00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.900]   I'm all for that
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:46.420]   And then that allows
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:51.060]   Facebook to have one term of service and read it to have another one and forchan to have another one and
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:57.860]   Apple to have another one as well. They should there are different companies with different relationships with their publics and you leo can choose to reject
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.700]   them all
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.700]   Then you know you're rejecting better. Yeah
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:06.740]   Uh mike maznik writes I think in a very level headed
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:09.380]   Ooh way um
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:14.580]   Again, none of this is to say we shouldn't be concerned about big internet companies with too much power
[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.740]   It's a perfectly reasonable concern, but just because you want to do something
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:24.180]   And this is something doesn't mean that it's the something we should do
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:33.060]   The way to attack the positions of these big internet companies is to enable more competition and you do that by encouraging alternatives in the marketplace
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:41.220]   Um, he's concerned about platforms this idea of creating platforms out of them and forcing them to divest
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.260]   he also points out that uh, you know
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:48.020]   She this is really congress's job
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:53.380]   Not the president's job and congress is never going to agree to do something this dramatic
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:59.460]   I mean, there's all sorts of problems with it. So um in fact even in the logic of it. He points out that
[00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:04.980]   Uh, she starts with this paragraph 25 years ago facebook google and amazon didn't exist
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:08.980]   Now they're among the most valuable and well-known companies in the world. It's a great story
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:14.660]   But also one that highlights why the government must break up monopolies and promote competitive markets
[00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:18.820]   He says i find this very odd. I don't know how the first sentence supports the second
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:25.380]   In fact the first sentence would seem to contradict the second if if these three companies sprang up in the last 25 years
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.260]   That's good. That means another one could do the same thing right
[00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:32.900]   So, uh, yeah, I mean clearly it's a bad idea
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:39.060]   Um, it probably is grandstanding. I mean after all it's a presidential election. Uh, this is there we go
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:44.340]   That's what I was gonna say. This is the time, uh, when we you know, we expect stuff like this
[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:49.700]   And it's also not the time or place well, it may be the place but it's not it's not what we get
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:54.980]   We don't get nuanced conversations from people who are going into primaries. No just end of day
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:50:00.820]   We want sound sites in fact this is probably more complex and less of a sound bite than really
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:06.420]   It's proper. I mean, this is a this is an incredibly complex idea
[00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:12.260]   What is the sound bite break up the big tech companies? Maybe that's okay. Maybe that so I just downloaded this. I haven't I'm ready
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.740]   Uh, it's it's um, so there's an ft
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:17.540]   Interview with timbarrner's lead today
[00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:22.100]   Reester day on the 30th anniversary of his proposal of the world wide web
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:28.340]   So it mentions, uh in their report from the center for international governance innovation
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:35.060]   Uh by kirin ohera and wendy hall for internets the geopolitics of digital governance, right? There's the
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:41.220]   libertarian technology based internet. There's the commercial based internet of the big companies. There's the
[00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:48.500]   Re European regular regulatory internet and there's the the chinese and russian authoritarian internet
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.220]   and what we're seeing here
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:52.340]   is
[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.340]   uh, these forces
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:51:00.660]   Of pulling and pushing each other to determine who's gonna who's gonna regulate and who's gonna what's kind of governing the internet
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.060]   And we're not there yet
[00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:09.460]   Well, it is an unfortunate trend towards, uh, you know for separate internets when I
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:12.420]   Were moving. Yeah
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:20.020]   How long until how long did it take for regulation in you know the air not the airlines, uh, the railroads
[00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.660]   heck airlines, uh, telcom
[00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:27.220]   Like well the best the best analog for this is breaking up at and t right?
[00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:32.420]   Is it okay? I think so. I think so. No because at and t was given
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:34.100]   a
[00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:36.980]   Monopoly yeah, it was given one by government, right?
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:41.620]   You were the only phone company you had to rent your phone from the phone company blah blah blah blah blah
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:43.940]   That's not where we are now. So no, I don't think it's gonna analog at all
[00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:49.140]   Well, yeah, I mean, it's not a good analog also in the sense that uh none of these companies are
[00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:51.540]   Monopoly in the way at and t was a monopoly
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:55.780]   Which is a government sanctioned monopoly, right? But but that's
[00:51:55.780 --> 00:52:00.740]   Ignoring the genesis of the monopoly. That's no, that's pretty major
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:07.300]   Maybe but but ignoring the genesis of the monopoly for a moment. These are monopolies in that way at all a tiny bit
[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:13.380]   What did the what was the purpose of the breakup of at and t and what was the outcome of the breakup?
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.380]   Did it in fact achieve build a bit?
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:18.260]   Yeah, we didn't we didn't achieve anything we wanted
[00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:27.300]   Um, wait, that's why I bring that up. I'm just I'm using as an example of why government and invention in this level may not be the best solution
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:33.060]   Because it's a very big gun that's hard to it's hard to control
[00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:35.300]   That that I forget who made the argument
[00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:40.740]   But I saw it a couple days ago that said that if you what what could happen on intended consequences is that fine?
[00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:45.460]   So zappos and amazon are broken up again, but they're gonna cooperate and they're and they both will probably do better
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:51.700]   And that this could end up, you know, the the shareholders of these multiple companies then now more multiples could do fine
[00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:56.100]   And it doesn't guarantee what was the outcome you want? Are you are you doing what stacey said?
[00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.900]   Are you getting new entrants in the market or not? Are you protecting?
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:02.980]   No, and in fact, if you look at what 18 here's the here's the float chart that's really clear
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:10.340]   With 18 t and the breakup you start at the top with 18 t bell south 18 t america tech pacific telesis south western bell
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:14.660]   whoop back into 18 t whoop now they're 18 t then bell atlantic
[00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:23.620]   with 9x gte and became verizon and then us west with quest and central link we can central link you went from one to three
[00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.900]   And I don't think you in any way fostered innovation or anything else
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:31.620]   You certainly didn't create and by the way if you want to break up some companies that are hated in this country
[00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:35.060]   Try verizon. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, there you go
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:39.860]   In fact, that's what mike maznik or no, I think ben tums and one of them says is hey
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:45.940]   She didn't even talk about Comcast universe mbc universal and and actually she said yeah, I include those two
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:47.940]   I just you know, I mean I only had so much space
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:55.380]   Also, it's also that you're gonna you're gonna reverse decisions that were made by government that did for good or bad reason
[00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.820]   Approved these mergers and then you're gonna turn around and say oh never mind
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:06.260]   So how can you rely on a government decision at any point? I think honestly we can all look at it and say it's not it's a non-starter
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:08.260]   It's not something that ever could happen
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:15.620]   But i think that's true. I think I think we could create genuine policy shift in the us we would it would take longer than the
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:17.380]   the
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:19.620]   Adherence on one side want but I think
[00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:23.940]   You can do that and we have historically done that look at what we're doing
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:29.380]   You know in terms of let's let's call it basic human rights. Let's talk about voting rights
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:33.620]   Yes, that is taking it have normally a long time, but we are fixing it
[00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:42.180]   And so if you look at it not from a five-year time horizon, but you look at it and look how I mean a good example is net neutrality
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:48.420]   Oh my god, we are still debating that 20 years after they're actually 30 years after that is something
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:52.900]   But we have shifted our policies. I would say they abruptly took a
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:57.380]   They would abruptly backwards with the current administration, but
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.860]   I
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:04.020]   I think we could do that. We can't just shrug our shoulders and say this is impossible
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.700]   No, we shouldn't do something about it. I just don't know if breaking them up makes any sensible
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:11.220]   Well having the conversation is started. It is doing something
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:16.180]   It's a good starter and there is a tenor in paul in washington right now of doing something for sure
[00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:23.700]   For sure. No, ironically facebook made it worse because when uh, lisabeth warren bought ads on facebook
[00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:28.180]   Saying let's break up facebook. They took them down
[00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:34.500]   They used the facebook logo the automated algorithm challenged it and took it down because that violates the rule
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.580]   They challenged they got backup
[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:39.860]   So you think it was just that yeah, it's just this
[00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:44.500]   It was just it was just a robot. Okay. It wasn't malicious leo god's sakes
[00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:50.900]   But can I just say who are the amateurs running this sort of thing at facebook good lord? The optics were not good
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:56.500]   The optics were bad, but but but but the but the media it is see is worse
[00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.140]   Yeah, it's a of
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:00.980]   How did that happen?
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:06.420]   But it was obvious it was and this facebook said it was they they don't allow the use of the facebook logo in ads
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:09.140]   They don't want facebook to seem to be endorsing anything. That's a good
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:14.100]   That's actually there's a comment on facebook which they did allow the facebook logo to be used in it
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:20.420]   They should but i'll tell you try to try to do an ad against fox news on fox news. See how far you get
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:23.220]   Yeah, it can happen by the way
[00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:28.740]   You can see an end on cnn ain't gonna happen to it to underscore your point of some episodes ago
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:30.820]   All the ads cost under a hundred dollars
[00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:37.780]   At least candidates are getting smart about how to buy a tie by ad time on facebook these days
[00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:40.660]   um
[00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:46.340]   Okay, anything else you want to say before we move on move on please
[00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:53.380]   Oh, wait, I wanted to ask because I didn't get Jeff. Do you have any books on historical monopolies in the us at regulation of them?
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:55.140]   Oh, that is a good subject
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:59.780]   Uh, I had no but one that I I love and I don't I forget the title of it
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.100]   Uh is a
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:07.300]   I think it's called the great Atlantic Pacific tea company. It was a history of the first chain store which was a a
[00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:09.300]   A&P
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:13.700]   And it's a wonderful wonderful book because it because what happens is
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:17.940]   That the political pressure that goes on that tried to outlaw chain stores
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:20.580]   Because mom and pop stores were getting killed
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:27.300]   Uh, there was political value to the mom and pops and so they tried hard. It's like Elizabeth Warren trying to say um
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:30.420]   Um house brands bad
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:35.460]   Right chain stores bad. So if you own more than one store, this suddenly became became awful
[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:41.540]   And and and you see the the complete arc from the beginning of that, you know, the end of that mom and pop
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:47.140]   Uh, which people can't stand all the way over to um, it was on the wrong way here ark
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:50.180]   uh all the way over to a and p dying
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:55.940]   And uh, it didn't quite go up to that was I recommend it highly. I'll try to look up the title
[00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:58.500]   If anybody in the chat room knows it
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.900]   Well, let me know
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:08.740]   Let's take a break actually before I take a break google says it will unveil the future of gaming on tuesday google
[00:58:08.740 --> 00:58:14.340]   Says it will unveil the future of gaming on tuesday. We will be covering that live
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:18.980]   Uh, we have now learned that they're going to be streaming this keynote from gdc
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:22.740]   So, uh, is it 10 a.m. Carsten on tuesday
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:28.660]   It is 10 a.m. On tennam pacific. That's uh, one p.m. Eastern 1700 utc
[00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:31.540]   Twitter tv slash live it'll be jason how and I
[00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:34.740]   Commenting as we always do on these keynotes
[00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:38.900]   It's expected that google which showed offs kind of a cool
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:41.540]   project stream
[00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:46.980]   Uh, not so long ago. Uh, I missed it. I I couldn't sign up in time that allowed you to play
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:50.020]   Uh, a very nice beautiful game
[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.660]   Called age of empires odyssey
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:55.460]   on your chrome book in chrome
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:59.220]   By by doing all the hard work on servers and streaming the imagery
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.860]   Uh to the chrome book
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:05.860]   It looks like this is probably what google's going to announce the project streams
[00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:08.420]   public, uh, unveiling
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:13.380]   There are some rumors that it might also announce some hardware if it did it would probably be
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:16.580]   kind of chrome castee
[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:20.980]   Hardware that would allow you to say play the game on an iphone castor to a big screen tv
[00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:23.460]   not iphone on an android phone
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:27.460]   Um, because I think that's the whole point of project stream is to show how you can play
[00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.460]   uh
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:31.460]   a triple a games on um
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:33.700]   In on inexpensive hardware
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:39.060]   Maybe even chrome books and that kind of thing, but there is this weird rumor that they might do a high-end console
[00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:43.860]   We'll see wait. This is after they fired all the other people
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:47.300]   Well, the timing of that rumor is very bad because yesterday
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:53.060]   Google asked a lot of people working in their hardware division under rick osterlo to find other jobs
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:55.940]   Yeah, that's another story. Um
[00:59:55.940 --> 01:00:00.500]   The implication is that perhaps google wants to get out of the hardware business
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:03.140]   Uh, these are people working on the slate
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:06.020]   um
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:10.980]   I don't I don't uh, the ta the slate tablet and the laptop the chrome book pixel
[01:00:10.980 --> 01:00:15.940]   They didn't remember they didn't release a new pixel book this year. They did the slate instead
[01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.660]   It doesn't mention the pixel phones though
[01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:24.980]   So I don't know but so do you know did you already know the name? Uh jade raimund?
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:28.900]   Yeah, I saw that in this article. Um, I did not
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:35.140]   He's uh former ubersoft she former ubersoft producer and motive studios founder
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:38.340]   Has joined she's joined google as a vice president
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:43.140]   So given that she is a uh former head of a gaming
[01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.860]   Uh, yeah, so it's interesting. Yeah
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.500]   um
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:51.700]   Going join google as a vp
[01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:56.500]   So
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.060]   I don't know what a vp at google it means really yeah
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:02.660]   She's an industry veteran
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:06.420]   They hired a major evidently role respected major of gaming
[01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:09.300]   executive
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.260]   Oh, yes. No, I recognize. I'm just wondering like what
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.900]   I did google. What are you in charge of?
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.900]   has an article that says she
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:23.700]   Started as a programmer for sony went on to work for electronic arts was a correspondent for the electronic electric playground
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:27.940]   Worked at ubsoft montreal where she was producer of assassins creed
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:34.420]   Uh executive producer of assassins creed to watch dogs and splinter cell blacklist
[01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:39.780]   She helped open the toronto studio for ubsoft. It served as its managing director
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.620]   Um, it's interesting. Yeah, um
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:46.420]   pretty high profile
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:53.220]   So I imagine we'll see raimund at the keynote on tuesday. I don't know. I think this is very interesting
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:59.700]   Why would why why is something why is gaming something google wants to get into? What's your theory on that?
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:07.380]   I have no theories on this. I mean, maybe they have a lot of extra server power and they really want to emphasize that
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:13.060]   You know, I don't know. I'm so not interested in one thing. You can't do well on a chrome book
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:17.460]   Well, there is but it is a very important part of the mobile
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:22.100]   Ecosystem mobile everything's mobile. Yeah, I mean if you look at either either
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.980]   Facebook or or google it'll give a darn about
[01:02:24.980 --> 01:02:27.860]   You know, I have to think about
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:33.460]   What we were saying when microsoft did its hollens to announcement a couple of weeks ago is that it really
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:41.140]   Didn't look like microsoft was that interested in the actual product? It was more as demo of azure of its services
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:44.740]   And it maybe that's the same thing for a gaming play for google is
[01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:50.260]   Yeah, this is a product super facing product, but really what it shows off is google
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:53.940]   Amazing cloud and i'm using low latency network. Yeah
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:59.780]   And that's kind of what microsoft did with hollens right is it's all about all the amazing things you could do with azure
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:06.820]   I think i'll well, yes and no, I think hollens actually has a viable market in the industrial space and
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:15.220]   Microsoft really wants to sell azure and provide the industrial internet that's coming because it will be a huge market in 20 years
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:23.300]   It wants to get in on the ground for there. No, that makes a lot of sense and gamers are not in fact the the customers for google's cloud services
[01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:25.940]   On the other hand if you could put together a very
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:31.220]   See the funny thing is microsoft's doing this they have a project won't be out for a while that's similar
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:35.540]   To the to a streaming gaming service playstation already has such a thing these things
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:42.580]   They're in a company that have failed doing this. It's an excellent test of your computer infrastructure
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:47.380]   So if you think about i mean and i'm i'm this is purely speculative
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:53.380]   But if i think about the challenges required of bringing gaming to the edge there's a couple things that work one
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:59.460]   It's an advertisement for your existing platform two you're going to have to understand changes in networking like 5g
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:04.420]   Three you're going to be pushed into things like ar and vr that we haven't really
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:10.500]   We don't know where that's going gamers are often on the front end of like services and content, right?
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.140]   Not all of them will expand beyond gaming, right?
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:20.580]   Right, you know and so understanding that market and a lot of ways with amazon web services for example
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:27.060]   The ability it had to understand what people were building on its platform and the things they needed
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:33.220]   And then being able to release services on top of that that met those needs based on the data they had
[01:04:33.220 --> 01:04:35.620]   Is what made a ws such a behemoth?
[01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:40.500]   If google can provide the type of in gaming is such a high demand edge service
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.860]   If google can understand that workload
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:46.900]   And build products that make that awesome
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:52.740]   They might have an advantage is more computing goes out to the edge and becomes higher like demands more
[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:58.100]   You know capacity lower latency, etc. That's just a speculation
[01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:03.140]   Yeah, I mean all we can do at this point is speculate
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:05.460]   There is money in gaming
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:11.140]   Google is so hard to understand what google's overarching strategy is in any of this stuff
[01:05:11.140 --> 01:05:13.060]   As we learned
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:17.140]   Google plus happened mostly because vikgun dotra championed it so long and hard that
[01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:21.140]   Everybody just got tired of hearing from and said all right go ahead go ahead do google plus
[01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:28.180]   And the minute he left it died. So maybe this is that maybe there's just some kind is this is this a youtube hedge
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:33.460]   Is it uh, maybe I always forget the name of the service the twitch twitch twitch. Thank you
[01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:36.020]   Amazon owns it, but I'm pretty sure google tried to get it
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:41.220]   Yeah, exactly. So it you know, it's it's another thing people do and spend time on and
[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:49.140]   um, there's a lot of money in it. There's money in it. There's this whole notion of of of of spectator electronic sports
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:54.740]   Uh, you know, we're gonna talk later about amazon and the yes network. I would imagine
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:58.660]   Well, we can do it now. We can do it right now. Amazon has put a bit in to buy the Yankees
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:04.660]   Television network. This is something along with the Yankees and others. Yeah, but this is something that uh,
[01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:07.940]   Alex lindsey predicted a couple of weeks ago on mac break weekly said watch
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:14.580]   In the next few years most of the big sports franchises are up for renegotiation
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:22.020]   And he says the network television is going to lose it because they're going to get the big players netflix amazon
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:26.740]   Uh, uh, I don't know if twitter is big enough to play in that field or not
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:33.540]   But these big players from tech are going to swoop in and offer money that the television networks just can't compete with
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:34.980]   And all the reason
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:41.460]   Rupert Murdoch will will yell about the tech companies because he has one of his yeah and nfl NBA major league baseball
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:43.460]   They're all going to move online
[01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:50.020]   Good because right now cable in television you can't get you can't get it and then there's all these stupid
[01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:56.260]   No re-broadcasting. Yeah. Wait leo you were gonna do an ad a while back. Yes. Do you want me to do that now?
[01:06:56.260 --> 01:07:02.820]   No, I just I was like, I don't know what your sense of timing is but I know that right before you do right before you do stacy
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:09.620]   The book title is the great a np and the struggle for small business in america by marke levenson
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:14.900]   Mark levenson. I love it. Thank you. I like mark levenson. It's an excellent book
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:21.460]   It's just really fascinating and the parallels to to our time now about fear of big giant companies
[01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:24.100]   Uh is is quite wonderful
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:31.140]   I kind of get nostalgic when you say np. That's where we shopped when I was a kid at the a np. They had rest in peace
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:34.980]   It's gone, huh? It's gone instead
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:43.780]   Was the largest company in the world was it really the largest of retailers a retailer retailer in the world
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:48.260]   That's kind of a 16 000 stores. Wow
[01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:55.300]   It's explosive growth made a mortal threat to mom and pop grocery stores across the nation mainstream fought back
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:08:02.180]   the new hoover rosavald and true min administration to investigate the great a np because because
[01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:04.820]   senator warren. I mean, I mean president hoover
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:12.900]   Um said it's just too big the governor press criminal charges against the company for selling food too cheaply and won
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:16.740]   That's pro consumer
[01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:24.900]   Well, that is that does sound like a lot of parallels doesn't it? It's really and it's a well told tale here
[01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:26.900]   It's really quite quite a good book
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.940]   Uh, if you haven't backed up your aloe chats
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:39.620]   All of mine say test did you get this? I have one chat on aloe and it's with jeff jarvis the day aloe launched
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:44.420]   You're right. Yep. And that's it. No, I think it was at an airport
[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:47.780]   uh, they're they're turning off the servers. So, um
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:50.500]   You might as well just delete it from your phone
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:56.500]   Uh, and if you haven't backed up your chats as if you have anything. I don't know on there
[01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:04.980]   I am so baffled by what google's doing. I just don't I don't understand and meanwhile microsoft is is now beta testing
[01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:09.060]   Uh a feature on microsoft windows that lets you put your android app on your
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:12.100]   computer screen
[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:15.620]   Oh, I already have oh I have that through chrome and the messaging. Yeah, it's like that
[01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:22.100]   So great windows is gonna let you do messaging from your android. I guess and other apps any other app you want
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:24.820]   Is is
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.820]   Skye
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:31.220]   Uh, yeah, that was another thing microsoft pulled the plug on linux and chrome
[01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:35.300]   I was using well not linux also chrome and I was using it fine and then suddenly bump gone
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:39.460]   Anti-trust go after um, yeah
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:46.660]   All right, let's take a break. Let's take a break. I was just I had a question related to this. Yes
[01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:52.500]   Before we go and break. I'm very curious of other people. I am having a hard time on my google messages
[01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:58.740]   Getting messages from people with iPhones so I get the texts out of order and now i'm not getting photos
[01:09:58.740 --> 01:10:00.580]   Had this problem
[01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:03.460]   Okay, I was just curious if other people had this because it feels really
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:08.500]   Only so her messages don't come through. I what carrier is she on
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:11.220]   She's on
[01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:13.220]   Etc and i'm on the Etc
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:20.100]   The sending carrier is relevant that uh have been a number of issues sprint and then I think yesterday I read about
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:23.140]   Was it verizon was having trouble?
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:27.140]   You know, these are all handled through gateways, right and their gateways were not
[01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:32.100]   Sending messages in order or messages were being dropped. That's usually
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:40.020]   Carrier specific to the sending carrier is my thank you lio my guess my my my uh experience has been
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:43.860]   Um
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:49.860]   It was good. I was reading an article on headline news the other day about a guy who was redoing all of his
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:53.380]   servers he runs a bunch of servers
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:56.980]   And I was really pleased at first I thought he was running him at his house and then I read
[01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:00.740]   No, no, he's running him off digital ocean because digital ocean is so affordable
[01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:03.620]   He had uh
[01:11:03.620 --> 01:11:05.780]   Australian based
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.260]   This is a ad by the way. Yeah, you can
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:11.460]   Sorry, I say wait that's so so
[01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:16.100]   Inocuously, I probably didn't make it clear our sponsor today is digital ocean
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:20.500]   But I was just really impressed that he was running like a you like a bunch of different
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:27.220]   Stuff public servers on on digital ocean. That's how good it is digital ocean is a place for you
[01:11:27.220 --> 01:11:30.020]   To create your cloud application
[01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.300]   uh
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:33.300]   affordably quickly easily
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.340]   Whether you're running one virtual machine or 10 000
[01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:40.500]   Digital ocean as you're covered with the flexibility to customize standard or even
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.060]   CPU optimized droplets
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:48.660]   You can this is the thing I love about digital ocean. It's sometimes I think people don't understand exactly what i'm talking about but
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:50.420]   um
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:56.260]   The idea is fact if I go to my digital ocean account, I'll show you how easy it is to create a server
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:59.380]   They call them droplets like droplets in the ocean, right?
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:01.700]   So i'm going to create a droplet right now
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:04.340]   Now I use this because I am a hobbyist programmer
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:09.620]   So I always like to have servers running so I can learn how to code and node js and things like that
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:11.860]   So you can start here you with distributions
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:15.540]   Ubuntu free bsd fedora debi and sentos
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:20.740]   There also is complete full support for containers like docker and kubernetes
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:21.940]   um
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:26.100]   There's a marketplace as well of one what they call one button
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.660]   Installs these are all apps. Let's say
[01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:34.260]   Uh, I don't know. What should I should okay? Let's say I want to learn how to do node js
[01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:37.300]   That's actually something a lot of people want to do and I could create a lamp stack
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:43.540]   Very easily or a complete node js installation running on Ubuntu 18.04
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:47.060]   I'm going to choose a plan and you know for when I first start up
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:53.300]   I like to get the cheapest server that gives me a gigabyte of ram a cpu 25 gigs of
[01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:56.340]   fast enterprise grid ssd storage a
[01:12:56.340 --> 01:13:01.460]   Terabyte a month of transfer. So i'm going to set that and I like to enable the backups
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:04.980]   That's a buck a month what you know if I I like to have it be backed up automatically
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.260]   You don't have to uh you can add block storage if you're going to need more storage
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:11.940]   I always start small because you can always add more later choose your server looking at them
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:17.860]   New york san francisco amsterdam singapore london frankfort terano bangalore choose a server you want
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:22.660]   You could turn on additional features like private networking ipv6 user data monitoring
[01:13:22.660 --> 01:13:26.100]   I always turn on my ssh key so it makes it easy for me to log in
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:30.500]   let's name this leos node
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:34.180]   And now basically in the old days
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:40.180]   You would call up a server company and say I'd like to set up a bunto server with a node on it
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.740]   Or maybe they wouldn't even stall that you'd have to do it all for yourself
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:46.820]   And they'd get back to you in a few days say yeah it's we're it's provisioned watch this
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:49.140]   In less than a minute
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.820]   I am going to set up
[01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:56.100]   Provision and have a node server running that I can start programming on that's how fast and easy it is
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:01.460]   Notice my bill up here for my jango instance that i've been running last month $2.41
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:07.140]   You can use kubernetes if you want to improve improve availability scalability and resource
[01:14:07.140 --> 01:14:13.700]   Efficiency using containers the one click apps like I just did our amazing jango docker gitlab lamp my sequel
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:17.300]   node.js rubion rails on and on and on
[01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:22.500]   Uh, they just introduced managed databases for postgres, which is awesome
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:27.620]   You can launch your database with a push of a button dio handles the maintenance and the updates
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:33.460]   Uh free daily backups with point in time recovery stand by nodes with automatic failover end-to-end security
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:39.540]   And the tutorials on here are fantastic. Oh, by the way, did you see my node servers up and running
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:44.580]   In fact, just to prove it. It's got a public IP address. Let me let me just uh, just log in
[01:14:44.580 --> 01:14:50.500]   I'm gonna access the console and log and I can ask this hn right now to my server. It's booting up
[01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.220]   And it'll be ready to run
[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:57.460]   This is awesome for somebody who has an idea for an app for instance
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:01.140]   Uh and wants to build quickly build a minimum viable product
[01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:04.900]   Somebody who wants to learn as I do how to how to use these technologies
[01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:08.020]   Uh, this is fantastic. I am just
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:15.940]   So excited about digital ocean and boy the pricing is right. You can know what you'll pay monthly with a simple flat pricing structure
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:22.420]   Access the compute resources. You need at the lowest rates saving up to 55 compared to other cloud providers
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:28.260]   And oh by the way four nines uptime you get an sla for 99.99
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:31.780]   Uptime they've got cloud firewalls full dns management
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:36.820]   Those data centers are all over the world. There's one near you free round the clock tap sub-tech support
[01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:39.620]   It is truly awesome
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:43.380]   150,000 businesses including some of the world's fastest growing startups
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:50.900]   rely on digital ocean and remove infrastructure friction and deliver industry leading price performance. It's a revolution frankly
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:57.700]   Um, it's we've come so far since my buddy kevin rose setup dig by buying a server in
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:01.220]   And huffing it over to a colo where he had everything
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:03.540]   Yeah, you want to you want to set up coast?
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:11.300]   Boom, boom, just push that button 55 seconds later. It's up and running sign up today. You'll get a free $100 credit
[01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:16.340]   Now we're talking at dio dot cio slash twit
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:23.540]   It's digital ocean dio dot cio slash twit for a hundred dollar credit digital ocean trusted by businesses
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:27.620]   loved by developers it really is
[01:16:27.620 --> 01:16:31.860]   It's a revolution. It's hard to overstate how important this is
[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.540]   um
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:37.300]   To creating the next big thing. I just love it digital ocean
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:40.820]   We thank it for their support
[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.700]   Would you like to get a little change vloggy on us here?
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:46.500]   Yeah play the trumpets
[01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:49.140]   The google change
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:51.140]   angel
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.900]   We miss the trumpets
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:17:03.300]   I am waiting on my pixel three to be invited because android q is
[01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:06.340]   in beta public beta
[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:10.820]   Uh, you do have to of course as always in the past sign up for the beta
[01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:16.500]   So the way you do it is in role by going to google.com/android beta
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:19.220]   view your eligible devices
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:22.900]   They tell me there are a lot of eligible devices this time
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:26.740]   Uh, i've opted in for my pixel three excel and of course all the pixels
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:31.540]   Will be uh, will be opt to optimal. So i'm just waiting because now that i've
[01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:35.300]   Pushed that button. Let me just see i'm gonna i'm gonna go to the updates and see if
[01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:39.700]   If hey, maybe there's an update available and I could go to android
[01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:42.980]   Oh, oh, let's see check for update
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:47.220]   Do you do this a lot? I do this a lot. I'm all the time i'm sitting here pressing that button
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:50.420]   preparing system update
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:54.580]   Here comes the queue
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:18:00.020]   So i don't know what's in here. I don't care because it's the new operating system, right? That's all we care about
[01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:06.740]   Google is releasing android beta feedback app for reporting issues
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:12.980]   And feature requests at the same time. So if you're uh, if you oh here it is update size
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.620]   1.3 gigabytes
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.620]   download and install
[01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:20.100]   Should i do it?
[01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:22.260]   Oh, what the heck what could possibly go wrong?
[01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:27.140]   Uh, I would actually now that i'm doing that i probably she can't show you
[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:29.620]   Uh, this but it's pretty good news if you're using a pixel phone
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:35.220]   And I think this is going to eventually go to all android devices, maybe even ios
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:38.500]   Do you ever use the google keyboard gboard which is uh, i
[01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:45.300]   I got it. I got it. I got it. It's so fast. It is so awesome. Okay. That's so dictation is now on device
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:51.300]   No more network delays and it's supposed to be very fast. So tell me about it you playing with it
[01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:56.580]   Um, well, I just I use voice dictation all the time me too and so
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:02.100]   Here did you have to download something new or anything? No, it's just an updated gboard
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:07.220]   But what are you on? Okay, hold on. I'm on the pixel too. It is an update to gboard
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:11.460]   But it does ask if you want to download this it's I think 85
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:17.220]   Oh, because you have to download some soft some additional yeah, you have to download the voice recognition modules
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:24.180]   And then you also have to allow gboard access to your storage drive on your phone and some and your microphone
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:29.300]   Although I thought I'd already had access anyway. Those were the two things I noticed happening, but here i'm going to
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:35.620]   Send you leo leo. I don't have your number or your phone
[01:19:35.620 --> 01:19:42.580]   This is me sending dictation almost instantaneously and it's really quick and it's apparently
[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:49.860]   More accurate right it uses a bent built-in end-to-end recognizer on device for it's only for american english on pixel smartphones right now
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:55.220]   I'm going to lower my thing so you get the contrast wait. It's high contrast so y'all can see it
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:58.820]   On device force. I don't know
[01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:06.500]   This is me dictating lots of things really fast to you actually turn down the brightness is what you need to do not the contrast
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:09.380]   Okay, because it's so bright. It's blowing out the camera
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:12.260]   Sorry camera. Okay
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:14.260]   End-to-end all neural
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:20.020]   On device and all neural on device go ahead show it. Yeah, there you go. Keep talking
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:25.460]   I'm telling you everything I can think of right now and it's doing a pretty good job
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:27.620]   It used to take
[01:20:27.620 --> 01:20:32.020]   Several minutes not several minutes. It used to take at least a minute. It would have to round trip to the server
[01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:37.700]   That is awesome. It's a real time. So you think on a notification. How did that happen? Stacy? How did that happen?
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.700]   You want to get a bash?
[01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:40.740]   A bash?
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:44.340]   You are a special. I got a notification. It sent me I
[01:20:44.340 --> 01:20:47.940]   Where did it send it to me? Oh, it is still listening. Hold on stop
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:55.620]   Where did it? I think I got a notification and it said hey would you like to speed up your
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:57.220]   voice
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:21:02.100]   Recognition or something like that and I said would I and then I read about it really quick and then move
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:06.340]   I if you're one of these nerds and I bet you are Stacy that loves reading geeky
[01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:10.580]   You know text about how this all works go to the google AI blog
[01:21:10.580 --> 01:21:14.420]   because there's a really good discussion of
[01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:17.380]   what the issues are
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:21.220]   And how they trained it and the kinds of training they did
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:27.700]   And this is you know really interesting deep dive into it and how offline
[01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:30.420]   Recognition is difficult and challenging
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:36.580]   This is awesome. Oh, yeah. Okay. They're using in case you want to know parameter quantization
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:39.060]   And hybrid kernel techniques
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:43.860]   Made publicly available through the model optimization toolkit in the tensile flow light library
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:51.140]   Model quantization delivered at four times compression with respect to train floating point models and a forex speed up at runtime
[01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:55.780]   Our rnnt to run faster than real time speech in a single core
[01:21:55.780 --> 01:22:04.420]   80 megabytes it was it was almost 80 megabytes. Yeah. Yeah, it was actually I think 85 which is really tiny
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:08.020]   So this actually makes sense y'all
[01:22:08.020 --> 01:22:11.860]   Can't does it what is it type when you say y'all?
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:18.180]   Oh, it's a why apostrophe a l l or y a w l which is what I type
[01:22:18.180 --> 01:22:22.420]   Oh, no, that's not you pronounce it y'all. Hey, hold on
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:30.740]   Y'all need to spell this correctly. Yep. Why apostrophe a l l damn. That's good. Oh that 80 megabytes
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:33.460]   I
[01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:38.260]   Remember my children way back when when at the San Francisco examiner. We had a
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:41.940]   CMS called systems integrators, Inc
[01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:46.260]   And we had my god. Did you guys call it sync for short?
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:50.660]   No, we called it sii should call this and they had a
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:54.420]   Smart term because before that all these things have been dumb terminals
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:23:01.220]   And so they had a smart terminal and the and the I remember the founder of the company lauding the absolute rock star programmer
[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:04.660]   Who got hyphenation and justification on to the terminal
[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:07.700]   And this was a huge
[01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:13.460]   It really was a huge deal and now you think what you just did Stacy. It's just I'm sorry
[01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:18.580]   I'm having my old uncle jeff moment. Yeah, but it's just amazing. Well, thanks to connectionist
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:22.740]   Connectionist temporal classification. We've been able to have the latency of the
[01:23:24.020 --> 01:23:31.060]   production recognizing basically basically they they used a certain they used recurrent so the rnnt
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:34.260]   Is recurrent neural network transducers?
[01:23:34.260 --> 01:23:39.220]   And if you think about a recurrent neural network installed in my head, I know yeah
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:46.100]   We're already in there. That's why I like tech companies because they're already there and it doesn't hurt people. It's okay. All right
[01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:51.300]   It so instead do you really want to know this I can break this down. Yeah, I'll do break it down Stacy
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:57.620]   so an rnnt a recurrent neural network transducer instead of
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:03.780]   Getting the whole input and then doing an output. It's doing it continuously. So that's the first part
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:09.460]   That's really cool. Right. So instead of waiting for like a segment of text. That's why it looks like it's typing
[01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.940]   It looks like it's going a letter at a time. It's really amazing
[01:24:11.940 --> 01:24:17.780]   Exactly. Yeah, and when they talk about things like parameter quantitization and hybrid kernel techniques
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:20.420]   Just ignore that they're shrinking
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:27.460]   They're sure. I mean that's basically that's how they're shrinking it. Yeah, but the bottom line is this can do it
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:33.380]   Continuously all the time, but it took 450 megabytes to do that and they were like nope
[01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:36.660]   We got to make it smaller. So they use those techniques to make it smaller
[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:38.820]   and then
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:45.700]   You and they use the tensorflow light library to do that and now it's super fast continuous and it's super small
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:48.340]   So it fits on your phone. How was that neat?
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:53.780]   As we continue with the change log look out, which has been around for a while
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:25:01.860]   Has been kind of revamped. It's also AI to help people who are blind or have low vision identify their surroundings
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:06.660]   This is so great. It even shows the edges with haptic feedback
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:12.580]   By holding or wearing your device. We recommend hanging your pixel phone from a lanyard around your neck
[01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:15.060]   Replacing it in a shirt front pocket
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:20.660]   Lookout tells you about people text objects and much more as you move through a space
[01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:24.900]   Once you've opened the lookout app all you have to do is keep your phone pointed forward
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:28.340]   No more buttons to tap within the app. You just focus on what you're doing
[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:31.140]   And it'll say that's a dog
[01:25:31.140 --> 01:25:35.700]   Screen shot image of lookouts most including explore
[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:37.620]   shopping
[01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:39.380]   quick read
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:41.700]   Here it is detecting a dog in the frame
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:49.380]   Uh really cool really cool. So great if you're blind or you know somebody's blind you might want to get them set up with a pixel
[01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:53.140]   Break them up because they're all evil and they never do anything good for people. Yeah
[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:59.060]   Okay, okay hold up there. That's like saying someone who abuses their family
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:03.060]   Is a decent person because he once gave a homeless guy a cheeseburger?
[01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:10.900]   No, it's not it's like it's what it's saying is that size can yield the benefits to do things like this like like atnt
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:12.900]   Labs back in the day
[01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:16.740]   And incidentally google is not the monolipistic mop and the
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:21.940]   Monopoly some off any that some of you thought it to be for a example
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:27.700]   In chrome 73 which is rolling out right now. You can change your search engine to duck duck go
[01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:30.580]   Take that take that
[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:35.780]   About five people will do it next google's gonna give a cheeseburger to a homeless guy
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:40.980]   Uh, there's other features in this is this this this is the
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:43.620]   Better
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:45.700]   Yeah, what's it?
[01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:50.420]   Chrome 73 is also updated from act windows and linux. This is the android version
[01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:56.580]   Some redesigning and the downloads experience and the manager the omnibar link shortcuts and light
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:58.820]   pages
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:02.580]   Anyway, new brand new there's a brand new chrome in town
[01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:10.900]   So I talked to a microsoft executive recently and was asking about the results of the european breakup regulation all that for the past
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:14.180]   to this day microsoft has to offer a
[01:27:14.180 --> 01:27:17.940]   Windows version with no browser windows end
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:22.100]   And I said how many ds l he said i'm maybe a hundred or 200 a year
[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.780]   Yeah
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:27.540]   Just what everybody's looking for yeah, oh jeff you turned back orange
[01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:33.060]   Were you watch this whole time? Oh, yeah, I fixed it every once in a while because he's learned up here. You're warming
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:39.380]   Oh, yeah, it's the magic hour in uh, yeah brandy wine. I should I should be having a glass of wine and prime me right now
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:44.100]   But I don't yeah get a glass of wine. Don't stop on our class. I'll I'll join you jeff you just
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:48.100]   Too early for you stays so good. It's 520
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:53.940]   The sun's over the yard arm somewhere as my grandfather was one to say
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:57.620]   That's what he said what my father says every time. Yes
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:06.100]   Sun's gone over the yaw says it's toony time toony for martunis martunis martunis should have a martunis
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:11.060]   Mm-hmm. It's my father from west Virginia. He says things like that. I love it
[01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:14.100]   That's folksy
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:15.300]   It is
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:21.300]   He's more fun than a one armed paper hanger in a room full of rocket chairs. Uh, it's what the kind of things
[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:24.580]   Yeah
[01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:28.900]   Chrome extension from google helps you filter toxic comments
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:35.060]   Unfortunately, not from this show, but from reddit twitter facebook youtube and discuss. It's called toon
[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:37.700]   It's a toon extension and it lets you control
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:40.580]   what comments
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:44.740]   I have to say I have been in a number of sites. What was I reading an article?
[01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:51.540]   It may be a variety when every single comment on the article was spam. I mean, it was like they had just given up
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:56.020]   Yeah, I I've given up on the comments. I should say this out loud but on on buzz machine
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:58.500]   It did there's not been any of their decent for a long time. Just turn them off
[01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:03.300]   Every month or so I go in. Yeah, I should just sort of walk every month or so I go in and I kill like it
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:06.740]   It catches up pretty quickly. So it's maybe 10 spams are in there on the night
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:12.660]   Well, this doesn't do spam, but it lets you control I guess
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:15.940]   This is this is jigsaw, which is the kind of
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:20.020]   quality media and
[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:22.980]   and public discourse
[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:29.060]   Division of google that does neat things with media companies and it's kind of an odd interface you can set the volume
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:31.780]   on the comments you see
[01:29:32.020 --> 01:29:36.660]   Uh, keep it quiet. Keep it loud. Keep it blaring
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:39.460]   Turn it up to 11 turn it up to 11
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:43.860]   Uh, this is built on the machine learning models that power perspective
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:49.220]   I don't know what perspective is perspective. It's something that's been offered to media companies and others
[01:29:49.220 --> 01:29:51.940]   To try to fix their comments
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:55.940]   To to to to to I think it's the right thing
[01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:56.980]   um
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:58.580]   They this whole
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:29:59.620]   effort
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:01.620]   gives moderators
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:05.940]   Tools so that it will automatically kill things the moderators can just check it
[01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:10.580]   And the moderators have a sliding bars to where they want to go on things and so on
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:15.220]   It's pretty cool. So this does the same thing, but only on your machine. Yeah on your
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:19.700]   Chrome. Yeah, I had a conversation today with a a former
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:24.020]   government regulator who was talking about she's she's in
[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:25.780]   Baku
[01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:29.700]   About to moderate a panel and what do you do about disinformation? We do it as a mission. I just say
[01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:34.340]   You will never get rid of it. We got to stop that notion of
[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:43.300]   Of wakimul with the world with nasty things and wrong things and we've got to change the fertile ground that which they
[01:30:43.300 --> 01:30:47.380]   They plant their seeds, but we're going to have bad stuff
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:52.740]   And so having more tools like this out there that help you control your experience will mean they'll be less panic about it
[01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:54.820]   And that's a fine thing
[01:30:54.820 --> 01:30:57.060]   So I'm not sure I want to uh
[01:30:57.060 --> 01:31:00.580]   Demonstrate this because I'd have to go to uh
[01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:03.620]   I don't know a bad website
[01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:08.580]   And uh, and if it didn't work it would be uh a bad thing
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:15.460]   But I've installed it on my chrome. I don't use chroma sign in with google and click the tune extension. Okay, so sign in with google
[01:31:15.460 --> 01:31:19.140]   Okay, click the tune extension icon
[01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:21.860]   To get started. Okay. Oh
[01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:25.540]   No personal data is stored. Well, that's a relief
[01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:31.860]   Okay, so I guess I control for comments and use should I go to twitter and I don't know what I'm a
[01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:36.180]   Twitter or any shield you from stuff it works on twitter
[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:39.940]   Um
[01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:43.540]   Should I go somewhere like a really bad should I go somewhere really bad on reddit?
[01:31:43.540 --> 01:31:50.020]   Yeah, or yeah, reddit's probably are a good toxic place go to like the
[01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:54.180]   Okay, I'm gonna go to a good toxic place
[01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:58.340]   Um, I'm just trying to think of a good reddit place where you're gonna get some
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:02.740]   So the first thing you do what do you want? What do you want to tune? So i'm gonna tune reddit
[01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:07.940]   Okay, or actually all of them youtube twitter facebook reddit discuss. Oh, just go to youtube
[01:32:07.940 --> 01:32:12.900]   You can show this you could show this car soon. I'm not doing anything bad and okay, so I've selected which sites done
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:18.180]   Okay, now set the volume. I don't really understand what that means on the comments
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:20.980]   You want loud meme
[01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:21.620]   Oh, look
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:27.460]   So look at the comments on the right as I turn down the volume it's starting to shrink
[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:33.620]   They're all oh man. I turned it way down silence
[01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:37.540]   So
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:40.580]   I don't I don't know what it's taken out
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:43.300]   um
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:49.860]   So here's a here's a comment genius says the redneck marketing team if I turn it down that disappears
[01:32:50.580 --> 01:32:53.140]   turn it up such comments as
[01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:57.380]   You can fit so many inbred cousins in this bad boy
[01:32:57.380 --> 01:33:03.540]   Um, I before I go on you should probably see what they're talking about because it's not as bad as you think
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:07.780]   It's a limousine which is just a bunch of pickup trucks. Well did
[01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:09.860]   Together
[01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:12.740]   It's a weird way to stretch. So understand
[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:18.020]   I realize now in vacuum those comments might have seemed lewd, but they're in fact just talking about that
[01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:20.820]   Uh, then turning it up. Well, this does do something
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:25.620]   So words like redneck probably yeah probably redneck triggered it
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.940]   Yeah, that's the problem with these automated things
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:33.860]   It can't possibly deal with nuance even though nuance is an odd word to break to that discussion
[01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:38.420]   Well, and even what is what is loud medium blaring? I mean
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:43.460]   I guess that means that tones down the commentary down the comments. All right
[01:33:43.460 --> 01:33:46.340]   it works
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:52.820]   It definitely uh, it does it. Uh, there you go. And by the way, this is a very fun
[01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:58.660]   Subreddit that I've just discovered diy spelled w-h-y
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:02.420]   And it's just a bunch of stuff people have done
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:07.380]   Really they shouldn't have like turning this piano into a desk
[01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:10.420]   Uh
[01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:15.780]   You know, here's a here's a life hack instead of packaging your expensive lenses
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:19.300]   Uh, just throwing them in a box and letting them rattle around
[01:34:19.300 --> 01:34:23.060]   The life hack is filling up with popcorn
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:27.940]   And then and then throw the lens in
[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:35.060]   But the best part of this is the comments like well, I think you need more butter on that popcorn and things things like that
[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:36.420]   so
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:40.340]   Uh, this is actually a I don't know karstin. Do you follow diy?
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:47.860]   It's a high karstin. I seem to here's a good one. This is uh, this is uh, they're taking hot dogs
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:50.420]   And they're going to build
[01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:52.500]   What looks like a lego a lego log
[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:59.460]   Lincoln log structure out of hot dogs is basically you've seen this before karstin
[01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:01.940]   You're familiar with this
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:08.820]   But the funniest thing is this this whole this whole
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:11.300]   Subreddit mocks
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:16.020]   What has become a huge industry on youtube which is the how to you know video
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:19.620]   And now they're now they're cooking the you cook it. Oh, well
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:22.900]   You've seen a Lincoln log hot dog bucking on palace
[01:35:22.900 --> 01:35:25.540]   There is such a thing, huh?
[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:27.620]   If there's not one should make it. Yeah
[01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:31.700]   This is this is a great uh, I really enjoy this
[01:35:31.700 --> 01:35:33.700]   um
[01:35:33.700 --> 01:35:36.820]   He made boxers out of towels. I don't you know, it's just
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:39.860]   Wait a minute. Is it too cold to dive in?
[01:35:40.420 --> 01:35:42.580]   So here's what you do you take a black trash bag
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:46.260]   Uh cut a a fun noodle to hold it onto a hula hoop
[01:35:46.260 --> 01:35:52.260]   Then instead of black absorbed sunlight and lets the pool heat and then it's nice and
[01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:54.660]   That's pretty cool
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:57.220]   That is okay
[01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:00.900]   Some of these are quite long and when you get to the end you go
[01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:05.620]   Wait go back to the cat what's the cat doing? Okay, how to make a briefcase bed for a cat
[01:36:05.620 --> 01:36:08.020]   Everybody needs to know this
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.100]   Uh, this is this is uh
[01:36:10.100 --> 01:36:12.100]   You gotta close the case on the cat
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.100]   No, no, no, no, no, no, these are mean
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:18.100]   They're just like why see stay see you become too cynical now
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:24.180]   So he's got an old briefcase. So basically what's about to happen here is in a eight-minute video
[01:36:24.180 --> 01:36:26.660]   Where he basically just takes
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:32.180]   Briefcase apart and puts full minute to make some cat bed and at the end of it you go
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:34.180]   um
[01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:36.180]   Okay, why why?
[01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:38.580]   Why? Why? Why?
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:44.660]   Because you you've saved that briefcase from the landfill. It's not the perfect cat bed though
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:48.500]   Oh, look you're putting he's putting wheels on it
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:52.820]   I'm seeing this mistake so to stand maybe the cat really likes
[01:36:52.820 --> 01:37:00.100]   Sitting in briefcases. Maybe that's it. Maybe this is a cat that has as many cats do a predilection for sitting in luggage
[01:37:00.100 --> 01:37:04.420]   Uh, you could just you could just uh now you can satisfy your cats
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:08.420]   This youtube's full of crap like this, you know
[01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:13.700]   You complain about the other world falling apart. There's no harm in this
[01:37:13.700 --> 01:37:17.860]   Wait, now he's printing uh cat imagery to make the cat happy
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:22.580]   I got a decorate. Yeah. Yeah, this is somebody who needs a job. Well, no, this is somebody
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:24.580]   He's got a job. He's a youtuber
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:30.580]   Just likes do wins. I mean like haven't you ever made like a silly stupid project? Yeah, that's what this
[01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:32.740]   Anyway, really?
[01:37:32.740 --> 01:37:33.620]   No
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:39.060]   I made a portable uh podcasting studio out of the ikea box and some little things. I mean
[01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:41.780]   You don't make great stuff. I think he's gonna
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:45.540]   Put it aside the ikea box and think I made something. Oh, this is so sweet
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.380]   Uh
[01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:49.460]   Wow, they're really this guy's not stopping
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:53.220]   He's not but sad sort of thing. He's not a rambling it
[01:37:53.220 --> 01:37:55.940]   Where's the cat? Wait, we gotta wait
[01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:59.940]   Unfortunately now we have to see the whole thing because the cat's not gonna bother
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:05.220]   The cat's gonna say the cat actually goes in this thing. Oh, he's put a bell in because the cat likes to play with the bell
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:11.460]   Oh, look at that. Aren't you glad you have that in your house? Oh and the cat loves it
[01:38:11.460 --> 01:38:14.740]   Cat loves it
[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:17.860]   Okay, i'm gonna run home and make that
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:22.500]   Anyway, turn the comments down on that
[01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:26.820]   Uh, maybe I don't know that's something you can do with
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:29.700]   Tune
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.660]   Let's let's continue off the google changelog
[01:38:32.660 --> 01:38:36.260]   I have in my in my twitter feed today is this the show began
[01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:42.500]   Can you all talk about google related topics? This is getting a bit out of hand. Hey, that's hard. Just did add a whole segment
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:44.580]   This is all google
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:46.580]   Your mission gumshoe
[01:38:46.580 --> 01:38:48.740]   catch carman san diego
[01:38:48.740 --> 01:38:52.820]   in google earth where in the wood is
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:55.540]   San diego to celebrate
[01:38:56.420 --> 01:39:01.060]   The global exploring of all of us google is introducing the crown jewels caper
[01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:04.740]   This is the first in a series of carman san diego games in
[01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:08.900]   google earth they did it with hooten mifflin harcourt
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:12.500]   Uh, which is where carman san diego let's try it. Should we go?
[01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:17.300]   Search for carman san diego and google earth. I want to find walled. Oh
[01:39:17.300 --> 01:39:22.980]   Didn't they have walledow in google maps at one point? I feel like they did. I think so
[01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:26.820]   I think google earth has decided to download the entire earth
[01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:31.940]   So we'll just let that continue on and say that concludes
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:35.300]   Who do changel
[01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:40.340]   Uh gosh, there's a lot of stuff. Uh, I shouldn't mention
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:43.940]   uh patrick tele handy our our engineer who has a
[01:39:43.940 --> 01:39:46.580]   wonderful child named caden
[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:52.820]   Uh as often happens with the younger set the the babies make friends with other babies and the parents get together
[01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:56.100]   and apparently uh one of cadence friends
[01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:59.140]   Has said his first word
[01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:08.900]   Oh my god
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:11.860]   Oh
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:13.860]   First word
[01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:16.100]   Was google
[01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:17.140]   She should get lakes
[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:20.020]   Google should send that baby. She could have made your scholarship
[01:40:20.100 --> 01:40:24.020]   Now when I first saw this story, I thought well every baby's first word is good
[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:27.940]   But I think she very clearly when daddy said hey
[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:31.300]   She said google. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:34.340]   You know like too hard for a baby to say
[01:40:34.340 --> 01:40:39.300]   Yeah, uh, so that is yeah, you can't say it's not like yeah
[01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:44.020]   Twice i've activated my phone now
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:47.700]   So that is uh, that is a very important story and i'm glad we got to that
[01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:50.580]   I
[01:40:50.580 --> 01:40:54.660]   Just before we wrap it up is there anything I'm missing excuse me. I've got to go
[01:40:54.660 --> 01:41:00.100]   You know paste some uh keep my kids heads on on on the water polo players
[01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:07.860]   That is a wild story. Okay. We are not talking about that. That is a wild story. There's no google angle
[01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:09.860]   There's no tech angle really except that
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:14.820]   Uh the department of justice has actually indicted 50 parents for bribing
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:17.700]   administrators
[01:41:17.700 --> 01:41:21.060]   Coaches and others to let their kids into college
[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:24.100]   including a couple of well-known actors
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:32.340]   And then david mamet who's friends with felicity huffman and her husband William h macy writes a letter in support saying everybody does it
[01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:38.500]   No, I don't think so he's he's saying like okay
[01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:46.420]   Jared got into harvard aft it just was a coincidence that his father gave harvard a million plus bucks
[01:41:46.420 --> 01:41:49.380]   And then jared gets into harvard
[01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:55.700]   But it's a hooty jared's sat test for well, but yeah, so so so that's one thing and that's happened for years
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:42:02.420]   But uh, I've read a number of people at admissions department saying no look if somebody calls us up and says I really want my son to go to harvard
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:07.140]   I went to harvard. He's a legacy and how much is it going to cost me? I'll endow the library whatever
[01:42:07.540 --> 01:42:10.980]   They say no we just we send it over to the development group, which by the way
[01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:14.980]   Development is academic speak for fundraising
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:20.500]   And so we send over development and development knows the words to say which is well we
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:28.340]   Would love that gift, but of course we can can't guarantee placement at harvard only if your child is worthy, you know
[01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:31.700]   You can show a picture of the water polo team your child's on
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:34.660]   well apparently these
[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:37.780]   Kid these actually the kids had nothing to do with these parents
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:42.260]   We're so anxious to get their kids into big fancy schools
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:49.060]   That uh, they were bribing and uh, yeah, that's a felicity huffman did she paid 15 000
[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:52.500]   to this uh key uh
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:54.420]   Charity
[01:42:54.420 --> 01:42:58.500]   To make sure that a proctor would allow would she fix any bad questions in the sat
[01:42:58.500 --> 01:43:01.060]   exam giving her a very high score
[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:06.980]   But that's not that's neither here nor there. I don't know stop, but it's amazing. But you know jeff
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:11.220]   We know he loves that kind of story. It was relief not be in the
[01:43:11.220 --> 01:43:19.540]   Political story for once. I was never attempted to bribe anybody to get my kids into college. Uh, god. No, but you don't want them
[01:43:19.540 --> 01:43:24.180]   Uh to go and have a bad experience if they're not ready for it, right?
[01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:29.540]   You have to trust that the school is going to admit somebody now admittedly sometimes schools make mistakes
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:35.220]   But it says more about the parents. It says more about the pressure. We're putting our children a lot of the pressures. Yeah
[01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:40.340]   Yeah, sometimes life, you know, sometimes life just makes mistakes and you have to roll with it
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:43.700]   It's the way it is. It's the way and what's the lesson you're teaching kids?
[01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:46.100]   honestly
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:49.220]   Well, that is a lesson that they've learned already throughout their lives
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:52.420]   Yeah, there's i'm privileged and white and I can get what I want. Yeah
[01:43:52.420 --> 01:43:55.220]   Yeah, they probably already know that lesson
[01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:59.860]   All right, let's take a break and do our picks of the week and we can send you all home and I can get on a
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:05.380]   Big old jet airliner 737 max headed for los angeles
[01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:10.020]   What could possibly go wrong? I showed today brought to you by
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:12.900]   WordPress
[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:15.940]   If you want to know what's going on with with leo in the world
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:18.820]   You don't go to facebook. You don't go to instagram
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:22.660]   You don't go to twitter you go to my blog because that's my home on the net
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:27.220]   And I would submit that even if you are all over facebook and twitter and instagram
[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:30.500]   Even if you're a business and of course you have to have pages on all those sites
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:35.940]   You still should have that one site that's your website your domain with your name
[01:44:35.940 --> 01:44:41.140]   The place where your stuff links to the place where your best stuff shows if you're a restaurant
[01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:44.100]   That's where your menu is the reservation system if you're a plumber
[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:50.260]   That's where you talk about your services your fees and maybe even you post an article on two on there about how to fix a toilet or
[01:44:50.260 --> 01:44:54.340]   A leaky faucet. It's it's a place where you can put yourself out there on the net
[01:44:54.900 --> 01:45:00.420]   And I am still maybe it's old fashioned. I'm still a firm believer that that's the best possible thing you can do
[01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:03.860]   You want your name your site to show up with people google you
[01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:08.500]   I tell teenagers this all the time get yourself a website start putting your best stuff up there
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:11.060]   And the best place to do it wordpress.com
[01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:15.780]   It's easy. You don't have to be a geek. You don't have to be an html wizard

[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:11.540]   Uh
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:14.420]   How about a pick of the week from stacy higginbotham?
[01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:18.980]   Yes, I actually was going to do the google download but
[01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:23.940]   Since we talked about it in the changelog, I switched it to the latest book that I'm reading which is
[01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:25.940]   awesome
[01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:30.260]   Um, it is called billion dollar whale the man who fooled wall street hollywood and the world
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:35.780]   This is about the one mdb scandal. This is the malaysian banking scandal where this
[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:38.420]   This con man basically went in and stole
[01:47:39.380 --> 01:47:44.020]   That 1.2 billion. Oh, no, they're saying over 5 billion. Wow
[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:47.060]   from
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.420]   Uh, this
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:55.140]   Bank in malaysia and then it was covered up by the prime minister and various officials at malaysian and state agencies
[01:47:55.140 --> 01:48:01.140]   The book involves the scandal it involves how the hat the con man who did this
[01:48:01.140 --> 01:48:05.780]   Had parties with like famous people like britney spears. It is
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:11.300]   Well written. Oh, it is good true and it is awesome
[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:17.780]   Very good. I really recommend it. What'd you say? It is. Oh, it's billion dollar whale
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:22.900]   The man who fooled wall street hollywood and the world and it was written by two
[01:48:22.900 --> 01:48:27.540]   Tom right who is a wall street two job two wall street journal reporters
[01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:29.780]   Awesome
[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:31.300]   Yeah, it's really good
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:35.460]   Good like I I think it should be a movie. Maybe it is already a movie. I don't know
[01:48:36.020 --> 01:48:38.020]   That's a good movie doesn't it
[01:48:38.020 --> 01:48:44.100]   And no whales were harmed in the writing of this book. No whales. He was a whale in casino terms only only
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:47.460]   Do you have a number jeff? I have a few
[01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:53.460]   One is that uh yesterday harvard stern announced his new book harvard stern comes again
[01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:56.180]   Oh lord
[01:48:56.180 --> 01:48:58.260]   It was already
[01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:01.780]   Immediately number one bestseller on amazon. Oh my goodness
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:05.940]   I called it to the show today. It was amazing. And if you went yesterday and searched for harvard stern amazon
[01:49:05.940 --> 01:49:07.940]   You couldn't find it. It was hard to find
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:09.460]   uh nonetheless
[01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:14.180]   Uh, it still went up there immediately and he's going to be writing about his transition to be an a great interviewer
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:17.700]   And uh, I can't wait. It's his first book in uh 20 years
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:21.140]   Well, well that it's the first one he's promoted without a terrestrial radio station
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:26.260]   But it just shows you his satellite uh voice is still pretty darn large
[01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:28.900]   Phenomenal phenomenal
[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:33.300]   So here's why there's a mistake for him to go to satellite. No, it was not not at all
[01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:36.260]   Certainly not to his private fortune
[01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:40.260]   So I I looked up. I couldn't figure out where I had bought the amp book
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:45.780]   But these are numbers that I think will find interesting. Um, again. This is from the great amp
[01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:48.580]   of uh
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:50.580]   It's not a whole already at my library
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:51.700]   Oh good
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:56.500]   So I just have a couple numbers here which are fascinating in 1926. Kansas city
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:00.820]   Had 30 food markets per square mile
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:04.500]   Right, um
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:09.620]   Which is phenomenal. There was one food market for every 51 american families
[01:50:09.620 --> 01:50:13.780]   That's how inefficient we were in um
[01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:22.020]   The average working class family in the 1920s devoted one third of its budget to groceries
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:27.620]   The average farm family even more most households spent more to put dinner on the table than rent or their mortgage
[01:50:27.620 --> 01:50:33.460]   And for the average pardon me for this housewife shopping for food consumption large part of the day
[01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:38.820]   So a a and p came in and changed that and made food cheaper and
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:44.900]   More accessible and they got in big trouble for it. Mm. Sounds familiar. Mm
[01:50:44.900 --> 01:50:48.100]   Yeah, what was the harm after all?
[01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:50.180]   Yep
[01:50:50.180 --> 01:50:52.900]   Well all those bomb and pop groceries that had to find new
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:51:00.340]   Through that. I mean there is an actual harm. I'm not saying it's you know, legitimate to stop that down. I'm just like but that is an actual harm
[01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:03.060]   All right, okay
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:05.060]   I'll give it to you
[01:51:05.060 --> 01:51:09.940]   Uh, I'm gonna I'm gonna recommend even though audible no longer advertises on our network
[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:16.260]   I don't care. I love them still and I've I just listened to this audible original. I just liked it so much
[01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:23.300]   Uh, one of the things audible started doing is uh, these originals and they actually commissioned
[01:51:23.300 --> 01:51:25.540]   a play
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:27.540]   it was a live reading
[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:28.500]   um
[01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:32.980]   recorded from billy crystal at the minutal lane theater in Greenwich village
[01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:37.620]   And as far as I know the you know, the only way you could hear it is on audible
[01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:43.460]   I listened to it. It's amazing kevin klein stars as the president of the united states who's having a actually a
[01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:48.580]   Terrible day and that Benning is his wife the first lady billy crystal is
[01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:55.940]   I don't want to tell you you'll find out he's funny in it. It's very funny, but it's actually very poignant next
[01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:59.540]   I didn't know billy crystal was a good writer, but it's an incredibly
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:01.620]   well-written
[01:52:01.620 --> 01:52:05.060]   Little play and it's an hour and 46 minutes. So it's easy to listen to
[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:08.980]   Um, I quite enjoyed it have a nice day
[01:52:08.980 --> 01:52:13.060]   I this is not the first time audible's done a play
[01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:19.380]   on their originals and I just I think it's kind of uh, it shows you the radio theater really could have
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:22.260]   Made it if you had great writers and great actors
[01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:28.020]   Because a lot of times when you hear radio old-time radio the acting is so broad and the writing is so terrible
[01:52:28.020 --> 01:52:31.220]   You think well, this is not a good medium for theater
[01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:35.300]   But then you hear something like this or hitchhiker's guy to the galaxy and you realize
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:40.660]   Actually audio is an amazing medium for theater. Oh
[01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:46.020]   Yeah, I mean have you heard like the bb's every year her bbc does a new game in book
[01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:48.340]   Yeah, amazing. I mean those are awesome
[01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:54.260]   I want to hear more of this and I know that some podcasters kind of venturing into it like homecoming from uh, right?
[01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:56.180]   uh gimlet, but um
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:53:00.340]   Wow is this one is this one good he uh billy crystal co-wrote it with quinton peoples
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:03.220]   Um, and it's just it's really good
[01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:09.540]   There's sound effects in it. They do it. It's done live which is amazing and these actors are so good. They're really great actors
[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:12.180]   It just uh, it's just fantastic
[01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:17.380]   So if you have a an audible credit line around or you're an audible subscriber and you get the originals
[01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:22.740]   Uh, it's it's a free original this month. I think it's still free this month. Have a nice day
[01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:25.380]   with uh billy crystal
[01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:30.660]   And that my friends concludes this nice day was stacey higginbotham

[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:51.220]   And anything else you want to talk about that you're doing?
[01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:54.420]   No
