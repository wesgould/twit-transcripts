[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.560]   My name is Jason Howell
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.440]   I post a few other shows on the network all about Android is one of them and if you like Google maybe you like Android
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.520]   So maybe you've seen me over there, but this is my first twig a little intimidated ain't gonna lie
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.760]   But you know it's made a little easier because I have a lot of awesome people
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.520]   Joining me on the show today first up my cohort from all about Android Gina trip Annie. How are you doing Gina?
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.360]   Good good good to be here. It's so weird in a cool
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.000]   I love it. I saw you a mere 20 hours ago Jason doing all about Android. I love it
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.560]   It's like a reunion right now. We're one Ron shy of a reunion. There we are. That's all right
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.680]   That's all right. Well, it's awesome to be doing a show with you less than 24 hours later
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.880]   Yeah, and of course Jeff Jarvis joins us as well. How's it going sir?
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.880]   All right, all right, we were doing pronunciation guides before the show and lyston should threat lights already
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.320]   Yeah, so you sprung literally 10 seconds before we started. Hey, you should learn this word and lights done shoosh tracked
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.720]   You know, that's it. Okay, I'm gonna forget it in like five seconds. So that's just
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.120]   Lyston shoosh cracked. Well, okay. I'm gonna get up on that for now
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.760]   And also joining us to fill out the panel today Danny Sullivan search engine land. How's it going sir? Good. How are you?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.720]   Excellent super thrilled to have you join us today
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.060]   Something about you Danny sure so Danny and I were at the news geist
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.960]   Unconference run by Google and I foundation Phoenix
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.280]   Yours, well, I've always had a best respect for Danny
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.880]   but after we had the session about what Google could do for news and
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.320]   Danny's insightful incisive comments. I just left saying damn that guy is effing smart. Oh
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.560]   I've always been a fan Danny, but but boy, you know, you when you sit down to analyze one of the issues at hand
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.000]   You really just are amazing that that have any the right
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.320]   Perspective and right way to say it so I'm always happy when you're on the show. Well, thank you very much
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.120]   It's good to be here and it was fun being in professor Jarvis's classroom
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:06.360]   We all sat down as like classrooms and I'm like wow, can I get the calling professor?
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.360]   Oh
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:17.600]   So let's see here so I was kind of pouring through stories to fill out the dock of course
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   I'd say I'm closest to Android content, but wow, there's been no Android news. So let's not start there
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.000]   How about we start with the thing that literally I think I saw come through less than an hour ago
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.440]   But it kind of caught my attention and that is that Google is going to
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.120]   Kind of put their put their efforts behind creating products and products
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.960]   Taylor products their most popular products for 12 and under for children essentially
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.300]   Pavni de Wange was the VP of engineering at Google told USA today
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.560]   the company is looking to create these tailored versions of their of their services and
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.400]   Says the big motivator inside the company is everyone's having kids
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.760]   So there's a push to change the products to be fun and safe for children and I
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:08.440]   Mean it kind of goes without saying the kids under 13 in internet services of long kind of been considered off limits when it comes to these services
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:15.680]   We she said we aren't looking to play gotcha. It's just about kids being protected and promoting business compliance
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.240]   Kind of an interesting effort I suppose it makes perfect sense that Google would want to do this
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.760]   Google's always looking to kind of broaden, you know, their reach broaden their scope and everything
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.840]   Does it sound like this might be something that Google's gonna have to kind of fight for in order to pull off successfully?
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.160]   What do you guys think?
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.000]   It's so interesting that they said that they're doing this because lots of people at the company are having
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.680]   They really struck me right because like, you know, I mean Google is so grounded in geek culture
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.720]   And certainly there's this like, you know, build the thing that you need scratch your own itch
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.360]   And we know that Google has this 20% time where you can build up, you know
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:58.040]   That the products that matter to you. So of course if if Googlers are having more kids like they're gonna focus more on kids
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.720]   But but that that kind of thing makes me really nervous, you know
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.800]   Because what they're really saying is like we build the things that we need ourselves
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.080]   And and if you look at Google's diversity numbers
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.880]   Like we all know that like people who work at Google are very well paid and of a certain class and often of a certain gender and color
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.040]   So so that makes me it makes me a little bit nervous. Um, that said
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:25.800]   You know designing project products for kids online gets a little tricky because of Coppa the Child Online Privacy Act
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.920]   There's a lot of pretty strict rules about what information you can collect, which is like none
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.120]   And and that kind of thing so I wonder how Google's going to navigate that
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:41.600]   I mean, I mean, you know when I worked I worked on a social network very early social network back in the day called bolt
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.240]   Which is no longer around it was sort of like it was sort of like Facebook for high school students back back in the day
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.560]   And that was a big deal, you know, like the you know not signing up kids under 13 and like kids lying about their age
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.040]   Which is what every kid does especially now like on Xbox
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:00.080]   Was it was always kind of a big deal and Coppa this looming thing that we were gonna get, you know
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.840]   Gonna get caught for doing something wrong was always kind of a big deal. So I wonder how they're gonna handle that
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.240]   Yeah, I remember Coppa was changed about a year ago and and made basically more stringent
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.960]   In some ways that I think we're a bit silly. What one example was that if you try to do an educational game for students
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:27.040]   With geography tied to where they live that would be PII just even knowing anything like what town they're in
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:32.760]   And you couldn't use that and and so it's hard to imagine how Google can can
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.120]   Target services
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.960]   Personalized services to a young person without getting in Coppa trouble. I mean, I'm glad I think making young people more
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.040]   You know more literate about about research and how to find things and all that is wonderful
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:53.960]   But boy, I do see the anyway. Have you heard any rumblings about whether this is gonna cause trouble for Google to
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:00.700]   In terms of having Coppa stuff come in. Yeah privacy stuff. Oh my god. Google's trying to
[00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.440]   exploit children
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:08.900]   Well, I was I was skimming through the the article just now and and you could see the the epic was already coming in saying
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:11.920]   Well, we don't want to sell them products and stuff or whatever and we don't want to so yeah
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.360]   I'm sure that will come in as an issue for them, but you know
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:19.320]   I guess I would find one other person to quote than that made up organization
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:27.280]   Well, someone's gonna do it and then if not as you know, you know in about a week someone in Congress will send a letter
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.040]   asking seven questions for Google explain what their plans are, but
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.200]   you know, I think that I
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:41.600]   Think we're long overdue to recognize kids are are getting online and using products and services from all sorts of companies
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.240]   And the idea that you know, I think you want to have them protected
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:53.640]   but you know, my kids have had Facebook accounts and they you know, my youngest only just recently turned to the age where he could actually have one, right and
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.360]   You know, you want to get them going with Google Play stuff
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.480]   Or you even want to get them going on the Xbox or whatever, and you know, you're just making up stuff
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.760]   So we've got protections that actually sometimes don't actually base themselves in the reality
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:10.520]   And it doesn't allow the companies to to you know, offer better things that they could do so yeah
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.680]   I think it makes sense. It's kind of amusing though because when I was skimming through it
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.640]   One of the things of motivating them was like, you know, her daughter was searching for trains
[00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.960]   It didn't get Thomas the tank and come up, right?
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.440]   And I'm thinking okay, well, you know
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.240]   It's not like Google hasn't thought for years
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.880]   They should have a kid search engine and it's not like we didn't have things like Yahoo!
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.480]   Again, which died if anybody remembers was yahoo's, you know thing and so I
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:37.720]   Suspect that what they're going to discover is what might be a great idea
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:43.680]   It sounds like in in it just makes me laugh like and we're now we're having kids like
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.840]   15 years old the company's been having kids all along, okay?
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.920]   You know, it's not like they just discovered this sort of thing, but you know
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:58.840]   It'll be like just go tell me Facebook said last year that they were going to develop
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:02.920]   Services for under 13s, and I don't think we've heard anything about that since have we?
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.320]   No, but I suspect part of the problem is I suspect part of the problem is you it sounds like a great idea
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.040]   And then you go and develop it and it's like well
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.520]   How are you making money off of it, right?
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.880]   Because if you have ads that are targeting the kids they come under a special scrutiny even if you're not
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:25.240]   Personalizing the stuff to the kids all you need is a kid going to a kid search engine and doing a search and getting an inappropriate ad
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:31.320]   And it's even worse than if they used a regular search engine and they got the inappropriate ad
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.000]   They have to have ads if you argued that this is a way to indoctrinate
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.280]   A brainwash and and enslave little children as they
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.880]   You don't have to and that's in fact
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.800]   That's what Bing was doing with their Bing for schools program, which is still running
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:52.440]   And they I think had some gains with it where they were saying look we're gonna give you a search engine that's doing no targeting
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.800]   It's doing nothing whatsoever
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:59.400]   It's just to be out there and you can use it and in fact they they poked back at Google because Google if you recall
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.400]   I think it was about a year ago
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.200]   Google's program that they ran for kids in schools
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:09.080]   They'll do the same sort of thing give you like a Google friendly kid, you know filter search engine
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.040]   But they had these these terms that sort of suggested that they might still build up profiles
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.840]   You know at all like oh, you know
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.240]   So you're still building up profiles of the kids or whatever
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:25.240]   And that didn't go down well in some quarters if I remember it all correctly, so um you don't have to have it
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:31.000]   But if you want to have a child specific you don't have to have it, but then the question is
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:39.760]   What's your motivation in doing it so like for Facebook? What's their motivation in building out a child service for kids?
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:45.000]   To capture them early I suppose but then yeah, you know they may just feel like yeah
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.960]   It sounds like a good idea
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.880]   But the kids are already getting online already and so if we just sort of ignore all this you know
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:55.320]   It's solving a problem that maybe they don't necessarily have because the parents everybody else is just solving it anyway
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:01.880]   Until someone sees them. I mean Chromebooks have a lot of young users, right because they're so popular in education
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.000]   And I mean you know apple
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.520]   I mean the max part of the max come back had to do with the fact that it was so popular in you know in elementary schools
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:16.280]   Um, you know, I wonder if this is kind of a gateway or if this could be a gateway for google creating a no ad pay for product
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.640]   Like I think that there are parents who would pay five bucks a month or whatever to have a kid friendly google
[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:27.480]   That doesn't track their kids and doesn't advertise toward their kids but it gives them, you know kid friendly search results and
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:32.760]   Thomas when they search for trains, um, but I don't know maybe that's that's a whole different thing
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:39.160]   Isn't that a can of worms jina when you define kid friendly across this country? No, that's true
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.360]   Evolution no evolution
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.360]   Oh, I absolutely no no it is no it is a can of worms it is a can of words
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.120]   I mean, I'm wondering more about the pay for because I I know I think there was a yeah
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.880]   We covered an article a few episodes back where I think it was larry page was talking about
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.440]   You know different initiatives that they considered inside google and one of those things was you know
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.120]   The option to pay for a customer pay for a google account without being
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.040]   You know advertised to you know was that was that an option?
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:11.800]   And I wonder I wonder if google ever, you know really considers that as a different business model because they're just so heavily
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:18.600]   You know their their main revenue is about advertising and that's got to worry them that their primary source of income is advertising when
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.680]   A kid's product like that just isn't suited toward toward that business model
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:29.560]   Yeah, maybe then it is just less about making money directly off the kids by serving ads and more
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:34.840]   Just giving them the tool that they're already going to use anyways, but in the long term
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.160]   Uh, you know
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.720]   Like you were saying jeff kind of embold the kind of attaching them to google services
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.360]   Uh, almost like you know advertisements for coca cola you see the billboard for coca cola
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.680]   That's not necessarily going to push you out to go buy a coca cola because we all know coca cola at this point
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.960]   But it kind of confirms your belief in coca cola. It's like yeah
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:59.960]   That's up there and I see it and identify it with it. It's like confirmation that you're making the right decision
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:05.480]   Uh same same could apply here. It's not necessarily a direct money grab at kids
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.920]   Throwing ads at them or whatever, but kids are doing this anyways, right?
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.160]   Like we're talking about parents are creating accounts for their kids so that they can get on
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.760]   Uh, and you know send email like nowadays in school
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:24.040]   Now more than ever the internet is intrinsic is intrinsically a part of how children learn
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.920]   And I have to imagine a lot of that starts before the age of 13
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.440]   So how do you approach that with with kids that are younger than 13?
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.840]   Uh, how old are your kids daddy?
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.400]   Uh minor 13 and 15
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.080]   So, uh, it's just in that transition age right now, right?
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:15:05.980]   Right exactly. I went to her
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.700]   Which is just interesting. They don't use snapchat
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.340]   Which surprised me, um
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:17.100]   You know because apparently everybody uses snapchat, but you know, they don't they don't do that much snapchatting or whatever
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.780]   Um
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.660]   So
[00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.660]   They don't use google plus
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.700]   They do use they do use google
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:29.260]   And they do a lot on the xbox actually, you know and they connect with a lot of their friends on the xbox
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.260]   I think xbox sometimes gets
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.420]   Under credited for the amount of social activity it has on there
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.940]   But I think that's also down to microsoft doing a really poor job of of
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.980]   Bringing it off the xbox platform
[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:47.100]   But you know like my my son the other day we were playing he's and I sent him a messenger
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.540]   You know, I said why didn't you answer me? He's like why didn't you send me like an xbox chat thing?
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.660]   It's like
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.660]   Because I'm really old I don't think
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.820]   Because I don't have an xbox right in front of me here
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.300]   I thought just yelling really loudly from downstairs was gonna be effective, but you know
[00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.380]   So I I find those panels or those you know those
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:13.340]   For a friend of mine published an interview with his 14 year old niece about what I just I feel like it's really what you're never gonna find
[00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.740]   You know a panel of teenagers that represent all teens. It's just strange
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:22.620]   I feel like adults you could get a hundred opinions about what social networks they use and I feel like it's the same thing with teenagers
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.780]   I mean my 14 year old niece says she doesn't use facebook because like the old people took over
[00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.580]   You know and her and her mom's really big, you know, he uses facebook a lot
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.420]   You know and I have nephews who are huge like love facebook and also xbox is a big one
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:39.500]   I just I just think it like really depends on the kid and the region and the age and what their friends are doing and like what sort of caught fire
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.660]   And their particular class. I don't know. I just I feel like when we're like, oh, what are the kids doing?
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.260]   Like there's just no straight answer to that. You know, so what about what about you
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:52.460]   Mother of young one does a does a kitty version of google sound appealing?
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.740]   Yeah, I mean it does it does um
[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.380]   I mean, I I don't know. I have it
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.620]   I really wrestle with like what's this gonna be like when when at a starts experimenting and looking at things
[00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:09.100]   I mean she's already wanting to play play with all my devices. Um and it only gets worse jina
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.940]   Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure and fast
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:14.940]   Yes
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.100]   Yeah, Jason is closer is definitely closer than I am. I mean your kids are downloading games and
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:22.460]   Yeah, so I have a one in a four-year-old almost five-year-old
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:25.820]   And I mean, you know, she has you know, I have the nexus six with lollipop
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:33.740]   It has a profile on it for her that I specifically use so that my youtube and whatever doesn't get filled with um frozen, you know
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.740]   Barbie doll movies and everything
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.180]   But um, yeah, so I agree with you though jina
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:46.380]   It's a really tough question to answer when it comes to your kids because I feel like we're kind of in this weird
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:53.180]   Zone where we're learning along with everybody else. What's appropriate for really young children when it comes to the internet on one hand
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.420]   You want to protect them from the dangers of the internet and the bad things that they can find and everything
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.060]   But on the other hand the future lies and in the present very much the present
[00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:06.140]   But also the future lies in internet technologies and I don't want to hold my kid back
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.300]   And deny the fact that these things exist and that you know what?
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.620]   Chances are a lot of you know most of your future at least in the near term
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:21.020]   Is going to revolve around this technology so embrace it versus fear it? Um, it's it's a different
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:26.300]   It's a very fine line though like it, you know, I don't know. That's just kind of how I feel about it
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:28.220]   It's true. I mean my plan is really to have no plan
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.780]   I'm gonna just let her show me what she's interested in but I but I realize that if I show her you know
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.980]   I showed her one elmo video on youtube, you know a few months ago
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:39.820]   And now she all she wants is youtube and playlists on youtube and more elmo on youtube
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.540]   You know so so anything I kind of you know just give her a taste though
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:47.020]   She you know she wants more because it's in compelling and the tablet is just laying around the house and you know
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.180]   As soon as she sees the tablet also we you know we we video chat with family members so
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.260]   Um, but so you know in my mind
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:57.580]   I'm like I'm gonna let her guide me, but I also realize that what I what I show her, you know
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:01.180]   She she wants more of so it's really I'm just kind of taking it as it comes
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:07.740]   Fair enough. Yeah, and jeff the way we're talking about it the business insiders ignition conference um
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.300]   Few interesting things just to just to kind of summarize that just real quick here
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:18.300]   Uh group of new york teens that were kind of interviewed on on what we're talking about right now about productivity
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:24.220]   How they work at school, uh, you know do their work at school and beyond a couple of interesting things that they pointed out
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.620]   Of course, this could be regional kind of like what you were talking about jeena
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.980]   Uh different and you know different around different areas of the country
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.060]   But they say collaboration and mobility all revolve around the internet for their work
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.940]   That makes perfect sense say google drive dependency is huge google drive is
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:44.380]   It's this this is informative of the discovery. We just discussed exactly this is strategic
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:52.140]   Mm-hmm. Google drive. Yes, exactly it from it from an early state. They are relying most most of their work is is dependent on
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:56.620]   I'm exactly they don't I just have no no words no
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.260]   sadly, I still have plenty of
[00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:04.300]   Of demands that i've got to install word because you know our school still wants things written in the word so
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.020]   Yeah, I would call myself out as well
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.940]   I wish it would because I don't ever want to have to install software again so they can write a three page essay
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.660]   Oh my god
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:21.180]   But wait dumb dumb question can't can't can't they use google docs in the next board it as a word doc or
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.260]   No, my daughter screams at me and says the professor's
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:30.540]   Teachers don't want this and they want word and this reason and that reason and yeah, I've tried to convert it over and
[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.300]   Uh
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.340]   It sounds like writing a book. Oh, yeah
[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:43.980]   Um, and then finally because I think this totally relates as well. Um some new data from idc
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:47.340]   Uh are actually pointing to google's chromebooks
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:51.900]   overtaking the presence of apple ipads in uh, us schools
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:58.540]   They noted 715,000 chromebooks shipped in the third quarter compared to 702,000 ipads
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.620]   Uh ship to schools in the third quarter and uh, you know citing
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.540]   All the things that I know i've heard about on on this week in google anyways, and I completely agree
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:11.660]   I'm using a chromebook pixel right now, and I love it uh lower cost although the pixel is not lower cost but
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:19.500]   Most of the time they're lower cost. So bad bad comparison. Well, there were there were great black friday sales. There was a hundred forty nine dollar
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.340]   I think it was
[00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:28.060]   I forget which brand but one of the good ones and I actually bought the um tashiba
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:33.660]   Uh, it doesn't have the only thing that bothers me about it is it doesn't have uh lte
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.740]   But it's it's um hd screen
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:43.820]   Nine hours the reason I bought it was because if I go to europe and stuff I can get more airplane time on it without plugging in
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:49.900]   So nine hours batteries faster processor than the pixel i'll see how it works, but it's just amazing
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:55.340]   I got there for $267 with hd and it's amazing the prices now. I mean chromebooks
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.180]   Are regularly for nine hours without an internet connection
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:03.100]   I write stuff. Ah, okay
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:08.140]   Okay, exactly and there there are ways to work offline as well
[00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.740]   Um
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:15.100]   Let's see here better security measures is another one which I think is a pretty big deal when you're talking about schools
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:21.820]   Um, you know all the different users, which actually this this kind of uh, you know hark is back to to our discussion earlier
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.420]   You almost need well you need a google account to use a chromebook, right?
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.820]   Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.460]   So, but I mean you can have google accounts if you're under 13
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.700]   I'm pretty sure
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:40.620]   I can't remember if I fake the numbers or not but um, you know you can have them
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:46.700]   Google apps for education has to allow for that. Yeah, they're there have to be some yeah, it has to be some way
[00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.300]   I mean you can browse as guests you can use a chromebook as a guest. You can use this guest
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:55.900]   You definitely would want want a google account. So particularly if the drive integration is such a note
[00:22:56.620 --> 00:23:02.620]   Below are the minimum age requirements to own a google account us 13 spain 14 south korea 14 netherly
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:07.180]   Leatherland 16 all other countries. I'll put it in the chat
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.060]   Netherland 16
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:15.820]   I wouldn't I wouldn't call that I would have thought they would either I just put it in the uh the doc chat
[00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:21.020]   Interesting that chat, sorry
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:22.060]   Um
[00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:30.060]   Also another reason full keyboard. So, you know, what's the iPad kind of came along that the tablet era began or re-began
[00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:34.140]   Depending on how you look at it. Um, you know, a lot of people are kind of wondering
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:38.460]   Hey, you know our keyboard is going to be useless in 10 years when our kids who are growing up
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.340]   Using devices that have touch screens and everything
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:48.620]   Learn, you know on that at first and continue on you still you still need a key. Yeah, it's it's more and more
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.620]   It's it's proving to be I saw some country
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:55.580]   I forget where was this also our last week that some country was going to basically stop teaching penmanship and just teach typing
[00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:59.660]   Mmm, that's a prize. Oh, and then interesting
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.300]   Well, they might as well have not taught me because my is the worst here's my penmanship
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:08.220]   I see you like it really a word
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:12.300]   One of those funny like I think I actually think cursive is a completely wasted complete waste of time
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.420]   I print but I do it quickly so it's a little bit scripty
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:20.380]   I mean the lines, you know the words kind of move together, but I feel like yeah if you can print and it's legible
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:26.300]   Just skip skip the cursive and go straight to typing. Mm-hmm. I wish I were a British journalist because you're forced to learn
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:29.340]   shorthand
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.340]   Yeah, that's a superpower
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:36.460]   I guess I really is I guess you could take a shortcut and get a cursive font that you use
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.340]   Or you just you know tap the record button on your phone
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.340]   That's true. It's very very true
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:47.900]   Uh, hey, let's uh, let's take a break break and thank our first
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.840]   sponsor of today and this is actually a sponsor that I only got to play with
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.280]   Only got to play with this morning for the first time
[00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:01.480]   Uh, but I think it's awesome. It's brilliant. It's kind of you know, harkens back to what we're talking about with children
[00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:08.680]   It's called little bits. This is the deluxe kit. It's it's a modular approach to learning how
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.960]   How how to work with technology how to design technology if you haven't heard about them
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:22.440]   Obits is moving electric electronics design and creation from the hands of experts to everyone and they do so with this kit
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:30.520]   Let's everyone use electronics and modular building blocks as you can see here. It's perfect for makers artists designers engineers students
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:38.840]   Kids tinker's hobbyist musicians programmers. We've got all of these modular pieces that you can construct essentially
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:44.440]   Uh, a bunch of different kind of components of different use cases this manual
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:50.840]   Right here actually takes you through you know walks you through the uh, the process here on you know
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:57.560]   Some different projects that a tickle machine a prank handshake a truck crane
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:01.640]   I was building something earlier and i'm going to test it for the first time on air here
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.200]   This is supposed to be
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.800]   A noise maker. So let's see here. So we've got these different modular modular pieces
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:15.400]   So they connect by magnet, right? So I can take this which is the pulse module
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.840]   And I can take this which is the buzzer module snap it together and then I can take this
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.960]   Which oh here it is here it is the power module snap that on the side
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.760]   Plug it into a battery
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.640]   Hold on. Oh no. Oh no game over
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.160]   No, okay. I've recovered see that's how easy it is to recover when you totally mess up
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.640]   uh, and then
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:47.960]   Hey, what do you know? I just built built an alarm out of components just snapping them together the way that they snap together
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.920]   Uh, basically, you know prevents you from connecting it wrong because they're magnets they're polarized magnets
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.440]   So it doesn't allow you to snap it together incorrectly
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.080]   And I mean that's just one of the kits that you find
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:05.800]   In the manual is just filled with tons of these kits and honestly, this is the perfect time for something like little bits
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.800]   It's obviously the holiday season
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:13.000]   Uh, it's perfect holiday gift. You could actually fit this whole box into a stocking a large stocking
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.120]   But it would fit
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:18.760]   Uh, little bits has something for everyone during the holidays whether you're a musician program or gadget geek or just
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:25.480]   You know an enthusiast of this kind of thing. They have a holiday gift guide on their site so you can find a great gift
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:32.360]   Now for the tinkerer the deluxe kit includes 18 modules that snap together with billions of circuits
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.000]   There's no wiring no soldering required
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.960]   Uh, that would be more advanced stuff. This is like the beginning stages building you up to that
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.320]   So that you understand signal flow and and what these components do
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.320]   Uh, what could take days to make without little bits now takes
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:51.960]   Seconds and it's just a great learning tool for this kind of thing. I remember when I was a kid
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.160]   You know, they had the uh
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.840]   The sets that you could get at radio shack the big boards and you can play around with them
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:01.240]   This is like a you know kind of another another stage of that just building components
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:07.880]   And it makes it easy because of the magnets on board and uh, it's just it's a you know
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:10.360]   Just an easy way to build really cool stuff
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:16.120]   So new customers get $20 off purchases of $80 or more by going to little bits
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:20.520]   Dot com and while you're there enter the promo code twig
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:25.720]   And you'll get uh, also you'll get free shipping in the us really cool stuff
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.280]   I had a lot of fun playing around with this. I know you or whoever you happen to get this for
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:36.920]   Uh, we'll enjoy it as well. Take a minute and go to the site little bits dot com and uh, yeah
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:43.080]   enter the promo code twig save yourself some money and uh, uh, yeah, it's really cool stuff
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.720]   This is this is the kind of thing that I see and i'm like man
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:49.240]   I want to introduce this to my four-year-old and see what she can create
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:54.360]   Four might be a little young but with my help we can create something that beeps and maybe that sparks are interesting
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.240]   It's are interested, uh more in designing stuff like this
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:03.800]   So little bits dot com promo code twig check it out for yourself when we thank little bits for their support of this
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.480]   We can google
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:10.440]   All right. Yeah, it really is really really cool. Yeah, it's a lot of fun. Um
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.560]   Let's see here. So
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:19.000]   Is there anything that you guys are particularly charged up about uh, talking about like google plus
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.320]   Do we want to do we want to go down to google plus rabbit hole right now? What do you think?
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:29.560]   Let's do it. Let's do it. All right. I'm curious to see where this heads. I personally I love google plus
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:33.960]   Use it all the time before we start. Yeah, Mike in the studio is he listening right now?
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.200]   I need to know before
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.880]   Before we start you are and you you are in your underground bunker. So I think you'd be all right
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:44.840]   It's true. Mike can't reach you also. It's his birthday today
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.960]   So he's probably in a particularly good mood and I don't think he's here anymore. I think he's actually celebrating his birthday
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.440]   Which is what he should be doing really. Okay, so I can say whatever I want. Oh, yeah, he's not here
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:30:00.200]   You could talk about it. It's cool. Okay. He'll never hear any of this. No, no totally. It's not recorded in any way
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:04.840]   It's just us. It's just us girls. Let's do it
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:10.840]   Mike, you know mike's off happy having 450,000 people wish him a happy birthday on google plus
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.960]   No big deal. No big deal. No big deal. So let's see here. So what are we talking about?
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:20.920]   Chris Messina who is the former developer advocate and UX designer for google plus
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:29.720]   Took to medium and kind of came out swinging against his old project. He wrote about how google plus has
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:35.720]   Messed up. I'll say although he didn't use those words. He used uh, yeah words that I can't say
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:41.720]   And dropped the ball. He complains about how David uh, David best-brist who's google's head of social media
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.840]   Has pretty much said nothing publicly about his vision for google plus since he took his role a few months back
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:53.720]   Chris also points out that iOS updates to the google plus app have literally trickled over the past year while competing services have
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:59.960]   Iterated quickly and shown that they're much more in you know in his mind much more dedicated to the platform
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.960]   Uh, Chris also argues that not one social network like facebook
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:10.360]   Should have such a demanding lead in the space in a company like google is one of the very few that has the resources to successfully take it on
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:17.640]   Yet that doesn't seem to be happening. So, um, you know, he's basically he's asking why google plus exists for google
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.320]   The company isn't going to use it as universal repository
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:29.000]   For our identities within google signing that google took a conventional approach rather than a forward looking approach to his challenging
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Uh in the social network space. So that's kind of where this all starts
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.920]   Did you guys get a chance to to read chris's uh post on medium?
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:43.880]   You're gonna hear what my colleagues think yeah, yeah, yes. What do what do we think starting there?
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:47.960]   So i'm always a little
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:53.720]   I don't know. I'm always so surprised uh when an engineer or anyone really kind of publicly calls out
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:58.280]   Uh the former employee or or former team that they used to work with like that always makes me
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:03.640]   Stop and question. I did it once with life hacker. I regretted it later
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:08.120]   Because this is one of those things was like you know, you could talk to people internally, but you know, look
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:14.280]   It's funny chris wrote this because he had tweeted he had kind of snarked about how google plus had this bug
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:19.320]   Which actually didn't turn out that it was not a bug at all. It was a chrome extension that he had installed that was buggy
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:26.360]   Um, so I feel like this was him just explaining, you know, why he was kind of kind of a jerk on twitter about it even when he you know
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.440]   When it wasn't true
[00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:35.240]   I I thought I think that it's totally reasonable to question what's going on with google plus because google isn't telling us
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.680]   What's going on with google plus so I think it makes sense to question it
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.080]   Um, but I found chris's
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:47.480]   Like reasons why he thinks it's not going anywhere kind of vague and not really well backed up
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.240]   And and so I thought mike elgin not to jump into the next no do it
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.960]   But mike responded point by point
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.160]   Uh, you know, we all know that mike is you know has a huge
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.400]   Scholarship on google plus has been a very passionate art at user google plus from the very beginning
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.960]   Um, I I actually found
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:06.920]   Mike's response to be a little more religious
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.560]   Uh, then I mean he's just super zealous about it. Uh, and I get it
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.320]   He's had a really good experience with google plus
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.320]   Um, so i'm kind of somewhere in between the two. I've just stopped
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.080]   Do you read any erosin blats jina?
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.080]   Oh, I didn't let's see here
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:25.880]   Because because uh chris linked to ed I put it up right before the show
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:31.480]   And it's interesting because what it really goes into is the idea that what google plus could perhaps should have been was not
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.880]   Facebook light but was
[00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.600]   google me and was the opportunity for a personal data
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.160]   um
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:48.040]   marketplace, uh, a data a data repository data storage i'm not as sure what so it's interesting to think what google plus could have been
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.480]   And and then and I have to ask
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:57.000]   Well, so I think I see two things going on one is that is that chris is seeing google plus
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.520]   No matter what they say kind of orphaned in terms of what developments happening and what's going on
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:08.840]   Um, but on the other hand, it's not too late to make google plus into something and I and I my last point on this one
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.120]   before we move danny is that I
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.600]   um, uh
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.360]   I put up a post last week on on on the german's don't worry
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.280]   We won't do like to ensure it's right for this week
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.840]   But the discussion on google plus beat the discussion anywhere else. I still find that the case
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:32.200]   I still find better discussion there and and I don't want google plus to die which is what I feared that chris was kind of warning
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.200]   I
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.600]   Yeah, it just it seems like everybody is wants us talk about how much google plus has failed
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.880]   But these are all folks who don't use it and like google plus did nail
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:47.800]   I mean there's a couple of really good points parts of google plus and if you if you interact on it, it's a grape
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.200]   I mean, you know, we have a community for all about android. It's fantastic. We run our polls there now fantastic
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:57.480]   Um, I I just I find it really it feels like everyone's kind of like oh gotcha
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:03.640]   google put something out there and it failed they did it again. They failed with buzz and they failed with wave and now they're failing with google plus
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.280]   And it's it's just it's a weird. It's a weird thing
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:11.960]   Especially since if you look at google plus holistically which is as a platform and not a social network newsfeed
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:16.760]   It's which wildly successful and I use it every single day. I use google plus photos. I use hangouts
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:23.160]   Um, I you know like I signed into my google plus profile. It's comments on youtube. It's comments in the play store like
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:29.640]   It's it's it's tremendous thing and I actually think google me has gotten built. It hasn't wasn't called that
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:34.760]   Uh, but it's google now, right and like it's you know, it's google continues to
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.440]   Google
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.920]   Accomplish something huge with google plus which is they put all other products under one privacy
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.960]   one terms of service and one privacy policy and
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:50.440]   Gave themselves permission and it gave you the opportunity to opt out of giving them permission to to for all their products to talk to one another
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:56.200]   And let one another know about what date what your data is where and so google really is a repository of your
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.520]   Personal data and and I so I feel like all those things kind of came to fruition
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:05.080]   But there's this I don't know I feel like there's still this like weird raging debate about this social
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:10.760]   This social network aspect of google plus which I think is just like a small part of it you do to chris
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:14.040]   Well, you know, I just
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:19.400]   I don't interact on google plus a whole lot just because I don't know why I don't know it just it's I I reach for twitter
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.800]   Um more quickly
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:27.160]   Um right this moment. There are some city just just in this discussion. There are some google city experts
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:32.360]   Put up a picture of them watching twig live. So let's give them a shout out. But where do they put it?
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:39.480]   That's uh, i'm twitter. It's mittio mittio doni. He's a he's a repeat guest on all about android. So there he is
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.040]   How's it going mittio? Yeah
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.280]   Now the links in the links in the doc, right?
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:49.320]   It's below. Yeah, I just I like twitter because it's low it's low effort right like i'm just lazy
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:54.120]   It's easier for me to tweet to tweet things and it put one time like it's high troll
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.720]   It's high troll. That is true. It is high troll for sure
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.840]   Hey, hey, mittio
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:05.320]   Um, yeah, well
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.960]   So I love google plus use it all the time
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:12.600]   It I would say more than anything it gets used for the stuff I do here at twit
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:17.080]   And because you know a part of what chris is saying here is that google plus has ended up
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.720]   Being less of an identity thing and more of an interest
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:28.520]   Service and he's saying, you know, is that enough? It could have been so much more and now it's basically, you know glorified
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:36.200]   Forums of some sort or whatever but but it's true the conversation you get on google plus is unlike conversation that I get anywhere else
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.040]   Maybe maybe you could liken it to something as active as reddit
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   Perhaps you you post a reddit post you put it up there and you know it happens to be in this particular bucket
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:50.280]   You know the android sub reddit or the apple or whatever it happens to be
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.840]   So you're surrounded by all these other people that feel just the same way that you do because they're following it
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:01.160]   And then they all pile in and and you know create this great conversation around this particular thought and google plus definitely
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.320]   feels like that and
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.480]   I don't know, but could it have been more did did they mess up the opportunity?
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.840]   I guess there's still time there's still hope that google could do something more with it
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.840]   But anytime they try and do something more with it
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:18.360]   Tyra your social identity or your online google identity to google plus people
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:26.200]   Backlash because they say don't force me to use google plus don't force me into your social plan because that's not why I use your stuff
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.640]   Yeah, yeah, I mean I
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:35.480]   That's where to begin on it
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.960]   You know, I think that google plus is a failure in the sense of
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:49.240]   From my perspective is it top of mind for a lot of digital and social marketers and no it is not
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.360]   And it is not after what are we three years into it
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.120]   when um
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.840]   Uh, day bespers had had that long interview
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:04.280]   Um, I posted it and I said there's someone I christmucine that other people like here's a long interview that basically tells us nothing
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:10.440]   And in fact, not only tells us nothing about what's going on but doesn't even give us figures on their user growth
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.640]   Which is the first time they've done that for as long as I can imagine
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.520]   Which was not a positive thing
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:22.600]   Because you know, I mean you can argue about all the user numbers all you want, but when you don't even give them out anymore
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.960]   that's just not a positive thing and
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:33.240]   Because if you post something about google plus on google plus and it is even remotely negative about google plus
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.040]   Everyone comes out of the woodworks. It just starts yelling
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:38.360]   Interestingly, by the way, and that's part of the difference
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:43.960]   You know, one of the things that google plus is very successful for and I think counts as a big win as i've written before is
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:47.560]   It is a great place for the fan people
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:53.240]   Okay, and it is a great place for the android fanatics and it is anything they have to do with google
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.720]   That is a home for those people
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.920]   You know, the google is not happy for it is the apple store of google
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:03.080]   Right, so you know kudos to them. They've done that but I'm
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:08.520]   Quite often can share things across all three major social networks to me twitter facebook and google
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:14.840]   And it is only on google plus where the google plus stuff have to come into this big discussion about is google plus great
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.400]   It was google plus being attacked or is this a you know, whatever
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:24.120]   People on facebook don't have those kinds of debates because people on facebook are not trying to figure out whether or not facebook should exist or not
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.960]   It does exist. They see the value and they've moved on from that sort of thing
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.480]   so
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:33.080]   To come back when I you know, I did this post after three years and I was saying look
[00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:39.640]   It was fine in year one to say that when I would encounter different social marketers or whatever that they'd be like
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:43.000]   Well, I don't know if I should be doing this or whatever and you'd be like yeah
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.880]   You really should be doing it if only because you had a search optimization benefit that came with it
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.440]   You get in the like year two and they still not sort of doing it, but they are doing things like Pinterest, right?
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.960]   People won't even question that they should be doing Pinterest
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.560]   But they can't even take the time still major brands to
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:05.720]   Take five minutes and make their page or just simply share the same thing they put on facebook on google plus
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:09.800]   It is not that hard to do and they don't even see the value in doing that
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:17.160]   So when you get into year three and google has taken away some of the value of google plus in the form of say authorship or whatever
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:23.480]   And we're still having this discussion about well people don't get it or these people don't use google plus
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:27.080]   It's like you know what we're at the tipping point. It is not a question of well
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:35.880]   They don't use google plus and they don't get it. It is a question of why after three years do so many people clearly not feel compelled that they need to use google plus
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:40.440]   And so that's where I would say it's been a failure in terms of it being a standalone social network
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:44.360]   If the goal was to have it come up and be google's facebook
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:49.720]   Which they never said was their plan, but obviously was their plan and their hope and their dream
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.280]   And you know three of you
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.280]   Yeah, what are the odds?
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.840]   Give me a timetable. Let's say within two years
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.160]   Is google plus still alive?
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:05.000]   Yeah, google google plus the social network. Yeah, yeah, it's still there. Yeah, I would say so
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.160]   I actually I actually really danny
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.920]   You made a really good point was that they made a social network for super users
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:13.640]   And maybe it's just that I mean
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.840]   And that's a success. I mean that's
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:21.240]   And that's why I mean it's like it you can she can say it's a failure on one hand and you can say it's a
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:26.200]   Great thing and other things there is a photo community that is there and in fact
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:31.560]   There's perhaps an argument that google plus has become the new flicker in some ways for a certain group of people
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.840]   So they have they have different audiences
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:40.280]   And and maybe there are things that they can do with that and it's been interesting to also watch them do stuff like
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.840]   You know google photos
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:47.480]   What I think to your question Jeff is what happens google plus the social network is still there
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:52.760]   But parts of it start getting broken out and become more substantial on their own and google photos is a good example of that
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:43:01.400]   Google photos is an awesome awesome product that it is where if it were released from people still feeling like it's tied to google plus
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.040]   As they're doing I think even more people would do it
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:11.400]   Why you wouldn't be using google auto backup for all your devices because not everybody has an iphone yet you can use it on everything
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.400]   Why you can't use it on windows phone, but
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:19.880]   Interesting windows interesting windows phone backup you can use or one drive you can use on all three of the smartphone
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.680]   So, but you know microstalk still has some challenges there
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.720]   But the google photo option is wonderful
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.840]   And I think they were smart when they brought it out as a photo app
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:34.440]   And I think as they get people using that even if there's not the social aspect necessarily
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:38.040]   There's an opportunity for them to maybe do more with google photos
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.640]   Maybe google photos can be there kind of an instagram type of a thing
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:49.080]   And and and there's this whole argument that are we going into this era of social networks that are no longer the all-in-ones like facebook
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:54.920]   And the real future is a facebook scene to think we just keep building all these little specialty types of things
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.520]   so
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.040]   you know
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:02.840]   Anyway, I'm sure it'll be there. I just I think you're not going to see
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:07.000]   A lot of further development into that particular platform
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:12.280]   That if you do see new social efforts, they will probably be more standable in social efforts
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.160]   They may tie into google plus in some ways and other parts of google
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:19.560]   But I don't think you're going to see them as as big things within google plus itself
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:27.960]   Yeah, I mean it does feel like all of the all the features in the social app like you know plus ones and comments and I mean
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.280]   Those are those are things an authorship
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.640]   authorship got taken away, but those are things that you see elsewhere on the web
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.360]   You know what I mean? It feels like like google's building these features out
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:40.280]   And yes, they're all apart social network, but it doesn't feel like that's code that's you know
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:46.760]   Specific you know chris mccina did say like google google only invests in the projects that are that are doing really well
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:50.360]   And like hey, they killed wave because they had less than a million users, right?
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:53.320]   But it is so many ways wave lived on in google docs
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.320]   Oh, we see so many of the features and now google plus with polls
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:02.200]   Uh, so I don't know I I think I do think it's going to be around in some form
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:06.680]   But I hope it is broken out into a separate app and maybe not as central
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:10.040]   I think that they launched it with the idea that this is going to be the central hub
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:16.760]   And it didn't it didn't you know, it didn't get the reaction and get the users that they thought it would and so now they're breaking it out
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:23.720]   Yeah, and they certainly they certainly had the ambition in the beginning whether whether they say they did or they didn't now
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:29.240]   They had the ambition for this to be a big all-encompassing social network and now over the last three years
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:36.360]   This kind of settled into the comfortable, you know comfortable niche, you know, tailored to niche zone that it is right now
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:41.080]   It's not a bad thing. It's just different. Oh, no, you're right. You're right. I think Danny's point is great
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:46.120]   But there's another analysis the other analysis is that google needed more social signals
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.680]   Facebook had the monopoly on the social signals
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:53.480]   Uh google has social you know has has contextual signals out of android
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:58.280]   For a lot of users, but it didn't have social signals and connections and social graphs and all that
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:03.800]   To make for a better google as a service and a better google as an advertising company
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.640]   Absolutely
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:11.000]   I can say it is that if that ambition was there that's dead you're saying well, no, and I I think I think that's a real
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.880]   Problem that they have to if you if you go back before we got google plus they'd rolled out google plus one
[00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:22.680]   And they said google plus one was going to be really important for them to have new signal to use and search
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.160]   Then we got google plus, you know
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:32.440]   That we've been putting all this together, but then the plus ones were dropped out of search and google plus and your connections on google plus
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:35.640]   Still can trump every other factor on on search, right?
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:41.880]   If you are logged into google and you are connected with a brand or a person and you do a google search
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:46.520]   All that stuff about you got to get links or you got to have h1 tags you got to have them on the wars
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:49.960]   All that gets tossed out the windows. I just did a search for um
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:57.240]   Mike, you know elgin right I just searched for his name the second thing that came up after his name on google plus was his response to chris
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:02.120]   Messina, which is ranking high because i'm connected to him and so it's figuring out I want to do this
[00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.760]   But I do think they have this issue
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:10.040]   They wanted those social signals and they couldn't get them from twitter because their deal was falling through and they didn't want to get them from
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:15.000]   Facebook because they just didn't want to agree to facebook's terms and that all never you know happened
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:21.240]   But it may be that yes, they still have enough of the signals that are coming in to give them some reassurance
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:27.240]   But they still may need to do more but they are kind of stalled because I still tend to feel like they need something other than
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:31.000]   In the link reliance that they they still have really depend on yep
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   Do you know you're gonna say something?
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.880]   But google has gmail. I mean they have our email which I so when you say social signals
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:43.720]   I mean they have your contact list and gmail and you know they have your your messages of the people that you send
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:48.760]   I mean think I feel like that's even those are stronger signals than anything that you post publicly
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:55.800]   Um, but I mean of course you don't have things like link shared or you know thumbs up or plus ones or comments on on links
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.440]   But I don't know it seems like
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:03.080]   They can get some of that and like we can share links of it
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:08.280]   But if you think of it in terms of a ranking signal, you know google's predominant
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:15.480]   You know their predominant measure is we analyze links across the web and try to figure out those that have have the best
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.800]   reputable links in context, right?
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:22.280]   So that's why when you you know, Amazon has a lot of links, but when you search for cars
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:24.920]   They don't come up because no one links to them with the word cars
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.920]   Right, but people do link to Amazon and say books a lot and they're reputable sites
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.200]   And you can do that sort of thing with social where you can say well
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.480]   You know
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:39.560]   This brand has a lot of followers on twitter or a lot of followers on facebook a lot of followers on google
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.520]   Therefore, we think it is a very good authority
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:47.880]   And so you could then apply and if you can see the linkage between the brand social accounts and their own website
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.760]   Then you could apply some of that authority of the website and give them boost that way
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:53.160]   You can also then do the leveraging of well
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:58.360]   We've seen a lot of shares to put this particular article while everybody's into kim carda asians photos
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.800]   So, you know
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:04.520]   We're gonna we're gonna give that some extra credit or whatever and and that kind of goes into it as well
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.760]   It is true that
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.200]   You have an issue that not everything gets like that we like
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:12.760]   But that's even more an issue when it comes to links
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.480]   Think of all the things that you like in your life
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.480]   Um that you you know
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:23.320]   All the businesses that you are really pleased about that you have a good experience with or whatever and how often you actually go back
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.320]   And then write a blog post about them
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:31.000]   Make sure to link to them make sure that the link hadn't have a no follow that got put on to it or all these other things that go on there
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:38.040]   In contrast, I think arguably many more people who like things are actually using social to give those signals
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:41.320]   So I did that it was like two years ago and I talked about this thing
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:44.200]   Like social as when everybody gets to vote and what I was saying was
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:49.240]   When you use links as a method of trying to figure out who should get votes for search rankings
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:53.080]   It is like you were saying democracy in the united states when it started was
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:58.200]   Everybody gets to vote as long as they're 35 years old and older own land and are white
[00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:00.920]   You know
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:07.080]   Most people are kind of disenfranchised if your idea on how you count votes comes down to links
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.800]   So I think social is really important for them
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:15.880]   But you know, it's still kind of early days on how they're figuring all that out and and google plus if that was going to be the solution
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:19.160]   Has gotten them a bit closer to it, but it still has a ways to go
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.120]   Yeah, it definitely didn't succeed in that way
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:25.560]   Yeah, but I see your point that that's what those are the social signals they were looking for
[00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:30.840]   Yeah, google plus is one more reason for someone to log into their browser the minute they turn on their computer
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:38.040]   As well. So all that all that extra information that it gets by just you being logged into your you know a google account on your browser
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:40.280]   Started on logging in fella
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:46.200]   Get these started. This is your four minutes of Jarvis ramp. I'm still having fits about double accounts
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:50.680]   I got like the nexus nexus six. It was driving me bananas
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:54.040]   Google doesn't have the opportunity to know the full me
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:51:01.160]   Google thinks i'm skit so there's things there's two me's and they're probably separate and it makes me skits owners trying to deal with it
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:07.320]   That was in four minutes. Come on. I was I was expected to have a little bit longer than that
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.640]   But that's okay. Here's the new kid. All right. I appreciate
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:16.520]   Let's uh, let's take a break. Uh, let's let jeff calm down a little bit
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.080]   Just a little bit because we got to keep a mapped up a little bit for the rest of the show
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:27.560]   Uh, we're gonna take a break but we want to thank our another sponsor of today's episode that would be smart things

[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.640]   And you connect this to your home network and then
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:52:00.200]   By way of all of these different components. That's the uh, multi smart sensor that can do things like, you know

[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:16.760]   Uh even phillips hue and if you're a developer like I said, you can create new ways to use smart things
[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:20.600]   And then not only that so you've created this awesome cool thing that helps you out
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:26.200]   You can publish it for everyone else to use and smart things recently announced that in 2015

[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.760]   Let's do it
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.960]   The google change log

[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:04.440]   So look i gotta warn you it's the weekend with thanksgiving there's not a lot here, but but we have a couple of things
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:08.680]   Uh just today google released a new android app called devices
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:17.960]   It offers live tech support troubleshooting tips and more the catch is it's only for nexus google play edition and android one devices
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.000]   Sorry, I haven't installed I can show it while you talk
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.120]   Yeah, that would be great. That'd be great. So in
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:33.160]   In addition to offering quick access to google support the app to text issues with the device is set up make suggestions on things like gps
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:36.280]   connectivity and battering battery settings to improve overall
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.120]   performance
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:43.240]   Um, it gives you kind of it's like proactive troubleshooting to help you sort of get the most out of your device
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:46.760]   Like this is kind of it has a look into you jason
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:51.160]   Do you get like a live googler on the line? Is it like is it like actually the amazon?
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:57.160]   Well, so looking for help send device information to google for improved technical support see google's okay sure
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:02.920]   Okay, I don't know what i'm about to do here. Are you about to like launch a help? Okay, so you can request a call back
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.000]   You can request a call back
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.480]   Provide a backup number if you can phone issues will be easier to solve if we can call you on a different phone
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:13.640]   I should wait wait. Is it illegal to like call them right now and see what they do?
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:16.360]   Yeah, of course it is
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.840]   So you're telling me to do it then
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:22.040]   Call you back see how it takes. Oh, that's yeah. Oh, so
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:25.880]   Really have better information
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:28.200]   Google don't you know this about me already
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:34.360]   It's an ass for access to your number cover cover it. That's really
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.800]   Oh
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.800]   Yeah
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:44.760]   Describe your issue. It's only optional so I don't have to actually describe my issue
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:49.240]   So I'm live on a google related podcast. I'd like to be the comments on devices
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:55.000]   My issue right now someone's calling someone at google saying get a ready here come to say
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.800]   Yes, exactly. We want to call really really fast or I want everyone to know if this works right away
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:06.840]   So I guess I would just wait and see then and I'm sure at some point i'll get a phone call and it'll buzz on my wrist
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.840]   By the way, so I'll really know when it comes to
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:12.280]   Uh detected issues. I don't have any issues on this next to six
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:17.800]   So apparently I'm good, but it also has this tips column for and I think this is actually a really good good idea because
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:22.520]   So many times things inside android are just kind of buried you just kind of have to
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:27.880]   Discover them or know that they're there or long press something randomly and oh hey. I didn't know we did that
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:32.120]   So this is good. This is really good like I have in our little genie tapani there telling us what we could
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.000]   Yeah, it should be called the true panny tip. Yeah
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.240]   You know I went to I what one of these we do in in the academia
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.880]   Our colleagues and right
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.280]   By the way, oh, go go go

[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.480]   Um moving on with the google change log
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:03.160]   Uh google drive apps got a few little
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.560]   useful but little uh tweaks
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:11.800]   Um, let's see. We've got gmail on the desktop now. Let's you edit microsoft's office attachments with a single click
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.000]   So you're open up a gmail message you mouse over an attachment
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.680]   And you click on the edit with google docs for word documents edit with google slides for powerpoint presentations
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.560]   Or edit with google sheets for excel spreadsheets
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.800]   And then you can start editing and using them in google drive right away
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:33.160]   And they're now support 15 office formats including presentation and show files. That's pps
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.520]   Ppsx
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:39.880]   macro enabled filed and files and template files with better charts and images and table support
[01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:45.160]   So so really good office support there in gmail and google google docs and google drive
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:53.080]   Um google docs got a few other little minor features. Um, you can now merge cells of a table and google docs. Uh, that's exciting
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:58.680]   Uh, you can now edit images inside of a google docs if you got a new google doc with an image
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:06.680]   Um embedded in there you can right click on the image you choose format and you can change the color the transparency the brightness
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:10.040]   Uh, this is similar to what was available in slides. It's now in docs
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:17.240]   And google slides on the web got a minor update you can show slide numbers on a throughout your show
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.120]   So you can go to the insert menu and include slide numbers
[01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.840]   and finally
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.120]   in the changelog
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.600]   made with code.com is a
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:32.600]   A project that google launched I think a few months back. It's there to encourage girls to start learning how to code
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.480]   They're doing a holiday promotion. Um, where starting today on madewithcode.com
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.520]   You can girls can use the introductory programming language
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:44.600]   Blockly to animate the lights of the state and territory trees
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.000]   That will decorate president's park
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.720]   One of america's 401 national parks and home to the white house through the holiday season
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.200]   So this is pretty cool. You go to madewithcode.com
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:58.040]   You press the get coding button and there's kind of this web based whizziwig
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:05.800]   Blockly language that shows you a christmas tree or a holiday tree unless you pick out what lights should show how often they should blink
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.880]   Where they should be and you can adjust variables and kind of drag and drop
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.600]   Uh, these pieces and then I believe that the park they're going to choose
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:19.080]   Um, a few of the a few of the programs that that were submitted through the site
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.360]   And they're actually going to program the lights to to to blink in that way
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:26.280]   So really neat little little holiday thing if you got if you got kids in your life
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:33.480]   Uh neat way to start programming. Yeah, there you go. Nice brian. I love that. That's awesome. Good job. Awesome. Hey brian. You did it
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:36.920]   You did it brian? You said a variable. I'm coding
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:43.560]   Increment it. I don't know how brian does it. He codes and he switches the show. It's kind of unbelievable
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.440]   Show it's amazing. It is amazing. It's the future
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.720]   Hey, change the color of the lights. Yeah, it's it's cute. It's cute. So, you know when your kids really bored
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:56.120]   Just be like, hey, go go go to this website and make make the lights do pretty things. Oh, that is awesome
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.040]   Take over the war. Be a technologist
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.680]   Yeah
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:04.680]   step two
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.320]   That's all I got. Oh, you got for the google change log
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:13.960]   That's that's how leo does it right did either of you guys
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.760]   Did any of you guys download wire
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:20.120]   Wait a minute. What is wire?
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:26.280]   wire.com. It's a new chat app. It was funded by the founder of kite and it does it work on the next is six and i'm pissed
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:33.560]   And I want to know I saw it earlier and I man I meant to install it, but I okay fine. I want him to try next is six
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:39.480]   Well, that's a bummer. Are you are you finding a lot of incompatibility with apps on the next is six or
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:45.560]   Nobody you think that's the one where they would have got it worked. I suppose so I suppose
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:54.520]   Yeah, many beautiful people having exciting conversations on it. Yes, you know another messaging service
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:59.880]   Oh, so this is oh, this is an iOS app. Oh, no, there is there's android
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:04.040]   Okay
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:08.360]   Talk message ping groups photos sound
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.720]   I guess
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:16.280]   There's there's isn't a web app there isn't a web app. That's why you can't use it on the on the car book
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:19.960]   Mm-hmm. I was just wondering oh browser coming soon
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:22.200]   Womp womp
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.440]   Oh, so now
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.800]   It's it's facing the challenge of getting critical mass so that everybody's using it
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.600]   Uh, man, there's so many of these messaging apps out there
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:35.000]   All right, it's sick. There's a mess. Yes, exactly
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.920]   Um, so let's see here. Let's let's hit on a few of these here real quick
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:47.160]   Uh, since i'm realizing we're uh, we're nearing the end anyways of the show. Um, so how about this google is redoing the capture
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.280]   Did you guys see this they announced a new approach to captures?
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.400]   Captures are normally hated by humans by the way
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:58.680]   Uh, they call the new system. No capture. It's built on a new api
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:03.000]   Essentially the system pre screens users and identifies humans
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   In advance of the capture so ultimately the user will see a checkbox and nothing more if they're
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:11.480]   Identified as human by the time they get there
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:19.560]   Um a more advanced test can be run if the system can't tell for sure and that's something like text recognition image recognition
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:25.160]   That type of stuff. Uh, cool because I hate captures. I know i'm not alone
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:31.240]   Yeah, you know recaptures always captures in general, uh always felt like this
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:38.360]   Weird old-fashioned thing, you know like like, you know programmers just sort of foisted it upon users like hey
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:44.760]   This is too hard for us to figure out so now you have to squint at some blurry image and type this thing in right?
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:50.040]   Um, I think the thing the thing about no capture I kind of want to know how it works
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:54.840]   But it's got that problem right the seo problem where like if they tell you the algorithm and the bots will be able to beat it
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:58.360]   Um, so now it's just sort of this black box of like I guess
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:05.880]   I'm not sure how it works, but I guess you just embed some code and google calls back to google and google figures out based on your ip address
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:10.680]   And how you behave on the page whether or not you're a bot. I sort of it's the true terrain test
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.000]   Yeah
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.680]   Yeah, I sort of like
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:18.280]   Yeah, all right. You're right. I'm not a robot. That's the checkbox if it can figure out
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.400]   Uh, if it if it decides that you are not a bot
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.400]   It'll just show a tech checkbox where that you can check it if it can't decide though
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:30.120]   It will show it will default it'll it'll or like not default but it fall back on
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:35.160]   A cap show where it'll show you the image and you have to whatever right pick the kitten or whatever it is
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:37.800]   Um, so I think it's a good thing for users, but
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:42.040]   It also makes me a little bit worried like what if my ip address gets marked as a bot
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.680]   You know and I either gonna be forms that I can't submit
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.920]   You know, I always get a little bit worried about these black box things where I want to you know, and I don't know how it works
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:54.680]   And you're stuck in in capture purgatory because no one wants to be stuck in capture purgatory
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:59.080]   Yeah, maybe maybe some people in the chat room. I saw that that we're proclaiming their love for captures
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:03.640]   I don't believe them. I always love the story though about how it was at luivon on who who
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.800]   Did the captures where it was taking text from um
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:13.720]   It was taking text from scanned books. They couldn't quite recognize. It was a great story
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.800]   It was like five years ago, right story
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:21.720]   They would take the text books that couldn't get recognized and it turned out the biggest use of capture was on poren sites
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:26.840]   So he was causing all these people who wanted to get online poren to first help
[01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.280]   digitize all these classic works of literature
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.120]   By filling out capture forms and then the capture form would help them like okay. That's what that word is so
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.840]   It's so clever. It's really great
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.960]   Really good might as well put the frustration to use
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:51.960]   So and also so how about this
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:58.200]   You finally thought the gangnam style was a thing of the past you're wrong youtube
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:04.360]   Assess that the video has been seen upwards of 2.15 billion times
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:10.760]   Uh so many in fact that it grew beyond its 32 bit integer of 2,147,048
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:13.800]   483,647
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:16.440]   As a result is throwing off the view count so youtube
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:23.240]   Took to google plus to announce that they are now forced to upgrade the system to account for videos as popular as gangnam style
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:28.440]   Which how did we get here? How did we let this happen? It's like the white uk bug all over it. Yes
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.760]   the gangnam bug
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:34.840]   It's really unfortunate
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.840]   Um
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:39.400]   Yeah, there's not a whole lot to say about that to be honest
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.720]   Uh, what am I missing here? What what things I know?
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:51.240]   Jeff, I believe it was you put in this material redesign of the google search page
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:55.160]   What's it? What's it all that material design redesign google to it
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:59.400]   For those of you listening it looks very flat and blue
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:05.000]   Looks kind of like what you would expect a google search page that's been material redesign
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   Let's see what you guys think
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.840]   Let's see here
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.840]   My first reaction was
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:13.080]   No, don't change my google
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:20.120]   That's old. I'm not sure. That's a normal comforting google. We all know in love, right? Yes, very familiar very stark
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.360]   Um, okay
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.600]   A lot of shocking isn't it? Yeah, a lot of
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:30.200]   It is a lot of space. Not real, right? No, no, no, it's just it was a
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.240]   Concept proof of concept
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:38.200]   Daddy's thinking he missed a scoop. Don't worry. Danny. No. Yeah. Yeah
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.600]   Now does that hurt your brain a little bit? Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.200]   A little too much kind of like white space spacing between
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:54.200]   Uh, don't get nearly here's the question. Yeah is google do for a redesign. It's a good question. It is a good question
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:57.160]   Uh, it's a good question
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:03.320]   I don't like it. I mean it does google has had a redesign content redesign
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:07.640]   And if you want to see what? I know but you know what if you want to see what google
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:11.800]   Looks like you don't look at it on the desktop. You look at it on your ipad
[01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:16.360]   True, true. And in fact, I've it's on my calendar never get to it
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.520]   But I wanted to spend a week of dealing with
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:26.920]   Google just on the ipad or just on mobile because it is a radically different experience both from the results that you're getting to the presentation
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:30.680]   But if you look on your you think you'll see it's it's not material design so much as it is
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:39.240]   Almost card based design, but that all flows in through and you know, you you see it first on mobile and then you see it come into the desktop. So
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:46.360]   Yeah, it looks like a lot of wasted space. Although I really I really appreciate and like
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.680]   Material design on my device, but I don't know if it necessarily
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:12:00.360]   Uh, the browser version needs to be updated. It's just yeah kind of a little too pretty too too pretty for google on the web when google for years and years and years has been has kind of
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:03.080]   Symbolized
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:07.240]   Uh simplicity, uh, you know, just kind of getting right to the information that you're there to look for and that just
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.080]   Feels pretty for for no real good reason. I guess
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:16.760]   Yeah, it's it's the Craigslist thing right? Yes, exactly craigslist got redesigned it would it would feel in authentic
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:20.920]   I'd be like oh being I must have gone a bing right like it's a little too too good looking
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.840]   It doesn't feel like authentic google
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:29.080]   I feel like google's search results on the desktop just get this weird paths around design like they just like we're gonna keep doing the blue links
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:32.680]   Because this is what it is. I feel like it's just so cool. It's just it's the brand
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.360]   Um
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:39.240]   And people don't feel necessarily like it has to change because it's worked so well up until now
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.240]   I guess it would be changed for the sake of changing it
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:49.000]   Right and there's years and years and years of data collection and ab testing that that that you know went into every single pixel
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.600]   Other way it looks. I mean, I guess you could say that across every device, but I don't know
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:56.200]   Um, it's it's it's interesting. Um my my co-founder uses
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:03.160]   Anil dash he uses the uh gmail for in the ipad view like everywhere, you know on his desktop everywhere
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:06.760]   He just he just likes the way gmail works and the ipad view so that that's an interesting danny
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:09.320]   I think that would be kind of a fun a fun piece
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:13.880]   It's funny like gmail, you know
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:19.160]   My morning starts off dealing with my gmail on the ipad and it's so much more efficient than dealing with it on desktop
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:22.280]   When i'm trying to get through all my stuff and it's all my tabs or whatever and
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.440]   Yeah
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:26.440]   What about inbox if you use the box?
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.120]   I don't know
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:32.520]   In fact, I was just thinking today is inbox gonna turn into being the google wave of gmail, but
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:37.480]   That could just be me. I just it was so weird when I went to to the first place
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:42.600]   And then also because I can't use it on a regular google like you can't course you can't use it on a lap accounts
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:45.880]   Do anything
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:52.760]   So I like i've been sending all my mail to a google account, but then I don't check that that off
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.000]   And so it's hard to use on a regular basis and
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:01.480]   It was just weird and I didn't know that weird was better. I actually kind of think the gmail app is a pretty good app
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:08.600]   You know, yeah, yeah, well, you know what the other thing is the the offline gmail app, which I of course use on my chrome book
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:16.360]   Is really good and by the way, it very easily and smoothly goes back and forth between the two accounts with no hiccups
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.440]   No, headaches. No problems whatsoever
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:22.120]   The only problem is it's missing a little bit of functionality that your regular gmail app has
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.600]   Otherwise, I would switch to the offline app. It's pretty darn good and it's prettier. It's email offline
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:34.040]   Well, you know what I I mean i'm on the mac and I I really loved airmail because it interacts with gmail really well
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:38.760]   It doesn't have the tabs which I'll miss a little bit but and i've gotten you to those tabs
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:42.360]   But I I wish google would just make us apps
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.600]   Desktop
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:50.280]   But you know I found airmail and that takes care of me for my day-to-day stuff and but I have some use in all the inbox all right
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.400]   What's that? Is it do the priority inbox all right?
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:56.280]   um
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:57.480]   No
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:04.040]   I haven't tried to use it. My you know on a typical day my inbox all in the day with only about 10 or 12 items in it
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.040]   So I'm not I hate you
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:10.040]   Last a few months ago. I had a great
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:14.440]   I hate you and it's every day I hate you
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:20.760]   And in fact, I was tweeting pictures of like if you're at inbox zero in the gmail app you get a little little sun
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:25.080]   I go on a day and I like was seeing that every day and it made me feel so good
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.040]   And I tweeted out people like going what what what is that?
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:32.840]   Never see that's really not just every that's really
[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:39.000]   It's a little sunshine. It tells you go out and enjoy the day. You're done. Like it's a great. It's awesome messaging. You're done
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.080]   Go out and enjoy the day. It's like yes
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.960]   I'm gonna do an in an email app
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:47.640]   I would probably have an email app that at the end of every week
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:53.160]   Or two weeks would literally take whatever's in your inbox and just throw it into an archive folder
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:56.440]   And because you're never going to get back to that stuff
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:00.120]   But you sit there like almost a slave to it like well, I know I'm going to get to do whatever
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:06.280]   I would just throw it all away because in you know, I did this talk once on my my things on email and I'm like
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.760]   Anything that's really important
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.560]   That that you don't get to it's going to come back to you
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.120]   So leaving in your inbox doesn't help you in any way
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:19.240]   You know, so just archive all this stuff and all the way does lift it off your shoulders
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:23.480]   And you just focus on the other things and then I don't know there's other things I get but yeah, sorry
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.720]   So I don't need priority inbox so much
[01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:29.160]   Man, that sounds like a beautiful place
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:32.600]   Yeah, it sounds like a beautiful place to have uh inbox zero
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:37.320]   As much as I try as often as I try I can never get there and even if I get there, you know
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:41.800]   Gina you're you're saying just get outside. Enjoy your day. That's what the sun signifies
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.880]   That's only for like the next two minutes
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.880]   And then suddenly it starts piling up again
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:47.880]   It comes back in its just it does
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.280]   It's the first person who messes it up
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.280]   Yes
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.080]   The emails just keep falling in
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:01.080]   Tetris that's how I think about it. Yeah, I think it of a cissor fissant reverse the mountain keeps falling on you
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:07.000]   Exactly I actually like like a
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.240]   inbox but I agree it needs to be on on my apps account for me to use it here at work where it's
[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:18.680]   Desperately needed on my personal account. It's neat and I've you know, I've removed my uh
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:22.680]   When I open my chrome browser and automatically opens inbox instead of Gmail
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:27.080]   So that's nice. It forces me to kind of use it in mobile and on my phone and everything
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.480]   But I'm still not entirely 100 percent sold
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:34.600]   I never get why we have to be such a second-class citizen when we have apps accounts
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.600]   I just don't get it
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:42.200]   I like I want to throttle somebody over Google and the only reason I have a google apps account
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:44.360]   Is because I want my domain name
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:47.400]   I want my own email and my own domain name and back at the day
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:52.680]   That was the only way you could do it so that when you would email people you didn't get back
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:57.080]   Um, you know, it used to be that if you sent it out you could send it out from in the email address
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:18:02.600]   But if it wasn't actually through google apps and you get those a warning like this person is pretending to be something or whatever, right?
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:06.360]   And I think they fixed that but there's this like middle ground
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:13.080]   I feel like where they could take regular gmail accounts and let you use your own domain name and have a few more advantages where
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:18.680]   I could have the things I want without having to be this apps administrative person and all these
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.520]   Oh, oh, it just makes you want to go on here's my guess here's my guess
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.000]   They've they've fixed it for two years
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.920]   They're dog food in it long since all through google and they keep it from us
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.160]   Just so they can watch this show and laugh at us every week
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:36.040]   And occasionally two pictures of it. Yeah, come on. Come on
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:39.240]   In the secret evil building on campus
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.560]   It's just dedicated to you Jeff

[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:35.080]   All right, I believe this is the time where we uh dive into tips and stuff
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.000]   Um, one one quick story. I want to do real quick. Oh, yeah
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.520]   You don't mind me interrupting not at all because we we talked about on this on a on an earlier episode
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:50.280]   We've done a couple episodes talking about online harassment specifically on twitter and one of the points that jeff always made
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:54.040]   Which I thought was such a good one was that on twitter to report harassment
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:57.560]   You you could only only the person being harassed could make the report
[01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:03.240]   Not people who are observing it which doesn't make any sense because you know in the real world if you're at the playground and you see
[01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:09.160]   Someone bullying someone else you can step in and help out and twitter made a bunch of changes to their abuse reporting
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:11.960]   This week or they announced them and I believe that they're rolling out now
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:20.360]   Uh, but one of the changes that they made is that if you observe someone harassing someone else you can report that tweet as a as a bystander as an observer
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:22.360]   So I was
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:28.440]   I'm slightly optimistic feeling slightly optimistic about that, but my conclusion is clearly twitter is watching this week in google
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:31.720]   So hi twitter, uh good job and keep working on it
[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:33.720]   I
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:38.520]   Talk to um cbc about this today and quoted you quoted you often
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:44.840]   Uh trying to talk about you know the difficulties that they have but yeah, the it's almost as if I don't want to do a conspiracy theory
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:47.880]   Twitter made it incredibly easy to report spam
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:52.440]   One click boom done and I do it all the time because it helps me and it helps them
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:59.640]   But incredibly difficult to report harassment imposters trolls and other things you had to go through so much effort
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:07.320]   You just didn't bother it's like they didn't want to know and then it got to the point and I think the thing that you've emphasized so much on the show
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:12.040]   Um is that it's you're right. It's it's also about us all helping each other
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:17.080]   By being able to report these people and being able to get somewhere with that and um
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:20.040]   Yeah, I hope that they were listening to you
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:25.640]   And and they should get smarter about this and and I think after the beheading videos and the naked celebrity photos
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:30.200]   Twitter is no longer a 100 percent open network now
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:34.120]   It's got to decide where the line is but it's got to decide that with our help
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:38.520]   And they were not getting our help before they were not being helpful before it was far too difficult
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:42.200]   There was one horrible. I'm gonna get my trouble right now with this one horrible
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.280]   Twitter
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:50.280]   Uh, uh, yes who just do some research for seeing resurfacing and I try to do the all of twitter the favor
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.040]   of
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.040]   Reporting them
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:54.920]   Oh
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.920]   Oh, we just lost Jeff
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:01.800]   That favor the favor that will light up the video would have
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:04.280]   But unfortunate timing for the video to go away
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.600]   um
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:12.440]   Maybe when we get him back he can finish that thought but just to kind of give you a sense of the rest of the stuff that twitter is doing here
[01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:16.920]   Fewer steps to report abuse so they're kind of making it easier with fewer steps
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:20.760]   Like you said letting bystanders flag posts they see as abuse
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.480]   Um a blocked users page and blocking users from viewing a person's profile
[01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:30.520]   When they've been blocked by that user so I say I don't want that person to look at my profile anymore or my tweets
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:35.240]   Uh, you can do that and uh, you know, it's not just a matter of me not seeing them anymore
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:39.080]   Uh, they can't see my stuff. So powerful controls
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:46.600]   Better. Yeah. Yeah getting better for sure. Definitely better and that's gonna be available over the course of the next few weeks
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.200]   And I really want to hear what what Jeff had to say. Yeah
[01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:53.160]   I
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:58.600]   Think it was the troll who shall not be named. I maybe got him cut off. I mean, I mean the timing was just a peck
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.400]   It was amazing. I was like wow no good deed
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:04.280]   We'll see what happens there. All right
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:09.000]   So let's uh, but thank you for for bringing that up because I did want to definitely mention that and I I skimmed over it
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:16.120]   So apologies on that. Thanks for letting me interrupt. Okay. No problem. Okay. So, uh, jina. We might as well start off with you
[01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:18.360]   What uh, what's your tip?
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:22.520]   So tip this week come from life hacker pretty good site there
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:26.120]   So you can you could search for your email receipts right from google
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:28.920]   This can help you out with expense reports or holiday shopping
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:32.360]   You go to the google search box and you just type in my purchases
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:37.880]   You will see receipts in your results from your gmail
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:43.160]   Um, it's pretty it's pretty good and you can also like you you can um narrow the results
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:49.960]   So if you're like, hey, just show me all my iTunes purchases do my purchases iTunes or Amazon for example and it'll only show you
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:55.880]   Uh, uh, receipts from from that and now of course you can you can search for receipts inside gmail as usual
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.480]   But pretty neat to see
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:58.760]   Uh, I think it's pretty neat
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:00.280]   I don't know some people might think this is creepy
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:04.520]   But I think I think we're all sort of getting used to the idea now that that google has our gmail and it shows us some
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:07.000]   Content from our gmail in our regular search results
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.800]   Um, I think this is kind of neat kind of kind of helpful helpful
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:13.400]   So it's my purchases when you're signed into google and you'll see your receipts
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.880]   Uh in the search results
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.600]   Excellent and right about this time of year that's super handy
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:25.400]   Yeah, I feel like my my inbox is overcome by receipts and uh and purchases and everything right now
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:29.240]   Another good another good apple on those lines is slice actually which I'm
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:31.800]   Reviewing this for uh an arrayed aperina
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:34.680]   Um actually later on today for 30 pm pacific
[01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:36.680]   Um, but uh, yeah, it's really good
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:42.280]   Any anything that you can do to kind of manage this influx of receipts particularly this time of year is super helpful
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.640]   Um, danny
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:46.520]   I'm trying to remember if I even gave you the heads up on a tip
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:53.320]   But if I didn't I completely apologize is there anything you want to kind of talk about or a tool or tip or anything along those lines
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.640]   Sure, I can give some excellent
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:58.680]   It's the uh, I got my little android snowman here
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:00.600]   Aww, nice
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:01.720]   Thank you
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:05.800]   That's not a tip, but that's the introduction because um, it is that time of year again
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:11.880]   We have the santa tracker out from google that went live two days ago where you can go over and
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:18.680]   Basically just wait until christmas eve and then you'll actually be able to go online and track for for santa using google's tool
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:24.840]   And of course we have the traditional and the long-standing norad track santa site that has also gone up and that went up
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:32.360]   Yesterday in partnership with microsoft so you know for those of you that are just waiting to count down the days until the jolly old st
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:33.560]   Nick comes
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:38.360]   Uh, you can check out both of those sites. They both have uh games that you can play and things you can do with the kids
[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:44.200]   Apparently google's even got a little javascript course that uh kids can can play with as well
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.840]   Uh, and that that's sort of it for the moment
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:50.040]   Excellent. Yep santa tracker is great. Um
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:56.520]   And apparently uh santa has his location sharing turn two on because we can follow his every move so oh yeah
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:59.400]   Yeah, uh good on santa. Thank you for sharing santa
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:04.920]   Uh, we don't have jeff yet. We'll see if we can get him back for his number of the week
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:08.280]   But I can uh, I can give you a cool tool
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:12.040]   So I don't know if you knew this but with lollipop one of the features that uh, you know
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:15.960]   A lot of people heard about and maybe it has limited use case, but I think it's pretty neat
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:21.240]   Is that lollipop enables you to record your video from your device?
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:27.160]   natively without root before lollipop you had to do this with root access on your device and it was kind of a
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:32.680]   You know roundabout sort of thing either that or you know use terminal and go to adb and do a command and you know real geeky stuff
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.840]   Now it's accessible to anybody. There's an app
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:39.480]   There's a number of apps that are doing this uh coach has his mirror app that that does this
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:43.480]   There's also one that I was playing around with earlier called az screen recorder
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:48.760]   No root and you can you just install it. It's a free app
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:53.400]   It has kind of overlay controls to allow you to uh record
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:59.320]   Your screen and it also picks up audio from your uh from your on board microphone
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:03.800]   So it's not recording the audio from internally inside your device because I think maybe that's
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:09.560]   A way to kind of get around the the fact that people you know could record video and audio from a movie or whatever and
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:13.960]   And uh, you know rent it and do that so maybe it's a copyright protection in that regard
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:18.680]   Um, but it does record audio from your mic which could be actually pretty handy
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:23.160]   If you're doing some sort of demo or whatever a walkthrough on an app that you've created
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.840]   If you're a developer of an app
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.280]   And you want to do a walkthrough and go step by step through your app
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:33.400]   There's one easy way to do it. It was super super easy. There's actually a video link and brian
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:38.520]   I know you're you're hard at work. Um, but before but below this the this link in the doc
[01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:43.880]   There's a link to a video that I recorded of me playing of the new what is it? It's
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.720]   Run
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:50.760]   Run sack boy run for the playstation character and recorded this just in the device for
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:56.840]   About a minute you can activate it to show the touch controls so that it overlays on the top and uh
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:02.440]   Yeah, just a neat feature that you didn't have access to before lollipop. So at least not without root
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:08.360]   So that's very cool. Yeah, it's pretty awesome. Uh, this app that recorded this is called az screen recorder
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.560]   Though there are a ton of apps that do this sort of thing
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.880]   Uh, that mobile twitch you're coming
[01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:20.280]   There we go. What's that mobile twitch? I suppose so although this is this is less live streaming and more
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:26.840]   uh recording and then posting later, uh, who knows maybe that'll happen eventually. Um,
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:31.000]   I just made somebody a fortune to think of it. Yes, exactly
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.400]   Never understand it, but it's a big business. Yeah, no, I believe me. I hear you
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:40.280]   Uh, it's good to have you back sir. Sorry that uh, the video dropped it exactly the wrong time
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:43.160]   We okay. No other video was smart. It shut me up
[01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:48.040]   Going on too long
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:54.040]   While grilleham said shop service he abused us about these accounts and we've had it you got over your limit of kavech
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:57.880]   Of the the timing though fan
[01:29:57.880 --> 01:30:03.000]   Uh, okay. Well, you are welcome to finish the story or you can do your number. It's up to you jazz
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000]   Number i remember um so
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:10.760]   One of the big things in the advertising world right now is what's called viewability that is to say was your ad actually seen
[01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:15.560]   The thing you paid for and and google put out a spreadsheet that that's on the the rundown
[01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:23.080]   But the shocking stat in it, which is you know full disclosure is that 56 of ads served by google by double click are not seen
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:30.200]   And so that's that's a huge issue in the media world now because it's it's an instant deflator
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:33.480]   To all the money they used to make and the truth is the advertisers before
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.040]   Kind of discounted
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:39.560]   On that basis the same way when they did with print where not everybody sees every ad yet
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:45.480]   We know you tell us they do eat that they don't but but now of course you can count and you can you know places like chart beat
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:49.720]   Can tell you what's seen in analytics and tell you what's seen and 56
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:52.920]   Oh
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:57.000]   It's because i was shutting him down again. This just never happens with jeff's video
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:04.840]   Of course well 56 something smart. I'm assuming is what he was going to continue with because jeff is a smart guy
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:10.280]   Uh, okay and brian's working over time right now. Uh scrambling
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:13.480]   Really put decent brine work here today
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:20.680]   Wow, we don't really like brine's flailing. Oh, man. It happens and believe me brian. I've been there
[01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:23.560]   I know
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:29.640]   Um, all right. Well, let's uh, I suppose I suppose we have to kind of wrap things up because we have hit the end of the show
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:31.000]   Hopefully jeff gets on
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:34.360]   Uh before we say goodbyes, so we'll drag it out here a little bit
